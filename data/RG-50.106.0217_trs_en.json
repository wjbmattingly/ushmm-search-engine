        "A: This was the introduction and I don\u2019t even know whether Hitler\u2019s name came up, but\nGermany. What is this? I\u2019m 11 years old. I have no idea what is going on. Anyway my foster\nmom said when things started to calm down, it was time to go to school or whatever it was I\nwent back to school. Had to go to school. And things went on sort of normally. One week\npassed by. The principal came into the classroom and said all Jewish girls out into the hall. And\nat least I knew enough I was Jewish, you know. I went out into the hall and there were other\nJewish girls already out there. And the principal said pack up your books and whatever belongs\nto you and get out. Do not come back. No Jews allowed.\nSo the comprehension wasn\u2019t there yet, you know. What? What\u2019s going on? So I took my books\nand my coat and whatever we had and I took the streetcar and I went home to the foster parents.\nAnd she said what, are you all right? What\u2019s happening? I said I\u2019m ok but I got kicked out of\nschool. She said what did you do? I said I don\u2019t know. So I\u2019m proceeding to tell her, the\nprincipal said don\u2019t come back. They don\u2019t want Jews. And she, I remember this like it was\nyesterday. She sat in the chair and she said oh my god. I guess we have to call your parents.\nAnd she immediately went and called my parents. And it was either my mother or my father. I\ndon\u2019t recall said I guess we\u2019ll come and get her. So I was there another day and they came\nimmediately and brought me home. And you know what I thought. I thought you know what.\nThis isn\u2019t so bad. I hate this place anyway you know. Not realizing yet what was to come.",
        "Q: So you weren\u2019t frightened at that point?",

        "A: Something you know. My parents and the foster parents and that excitement and not good\nexcitement, not happy excitement but tension. So I went home. Now you can\u2019t just sit home.\nWhat are we going to do now? Ok. My mother called the school in Traisen where my cousin\nlived and they asked if they would take me in school. And they said yes. So that wasn\u2019t so bad\nbecause my cousin Lily, my age, we were like sisters. And she had two brothers, Oscar older and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 12\nOtto younger. And so we were kind of together and the school was right across from her house.\nSo we would go to lunch at my aunt\u2019s, Tante Olga was her name, Lily\u2019s mom and her dad\nIsadore. Isadore was my mother\u2019s brother. And so things were not too bad. This is now April\nalready. Took a while to get me in and you know the details of all this stuff.",
        "Q: Were there any banners or any symbols around \u2014",
        "A: The swastika.",

        "Q: Imean to an 11 year old girl.",
        "A: What is, just what\u2019s happening? What is happening? And then you\u2019ll find out. This is how I\nfound out how things are getting worse. Now we\u2019re finding out. A very nice teacher came in one\nmorning to the classroom and all the kids jumped up Heil Hitler with the arms. That was the law.\nAnd Lily and I jumped up too. We thought it has to be this way. And the teacher said Trudy and\nLily, you say good morning. You do not say Heil Hitler or he said you don\u2019t have to say. So we\nthought ok, Guten Morgen. We never saw the teacher again. It was the last time. He just\ndisappeared. Never knew what happened. I would think some of the kids went home, told\nmommy and daddy \u2014 unh. Away. Ok life goes on. About a month later, another teacher said to\nthe class. He was our math teacher. His name was Richter. I remember that. Well I guess you'll\nsee why I remember it. He said I have good news for you children. We are going on a field trip\nto Linz. Big city in Austria. So I\u2019m handing out the forms and you get your parents to sign it and\nLily and I were it\u2019s great. So we went home and showed it to Papa and he said I guess it\u2019s ok. He\nhad a little thinking but I thought well that\u2019s Papa. He worries about everything. And Lily went\nhome and she got permission. And we brought the forms back and the teacher takes the forms,\nlooks at them, tears them up and says Lily and Trudy you cannot go. We do not take Jews. Then\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 13\nthis is now we cried. Why? What did we do? Now it\u2019s beginning to sink in. Something is with\nthe Jews that they don\u2019t like. And he wasn\u2019t all nasty about it. He said I\u2019m so sorry. And that\nwas it. We couldn\u2019t go. So now this is beginning to sink in what is happening.",
        "Q: At that time did any of the Christian children say anything to you about that?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t recall them. I think if it had been anything nasty or mean I would remember it, but\nthere was nothing pro or con about it. Neither way, no. So it was beginning to be quite painful.\nWell then came the summertime and there was no school and Lily and I spent a lot of time\ntogether because our gentile friends were no longer our friends. They weren\u2019t allowed to play\nwith us. So we spent time together and did what we could. We visited each other. We couldn\u2019t\ngo to many places. You\u2019re not allowed to do anything. In the meantime \u2014",
        "Q: What weren\u2019t you allowed to do?",
        "A: Well I mean to really my parents and her parents did not allow us to run around and to \u2014\nbecause it was getting dangerous. My brother for example was in a gymnasium in St. Polten\nwhich I think I mentioned to you. And he had just finished gymnasium. He was 17. And he was\na valedictorian and the principal or the superintendent called him in to the office because they are\ngraduating now and said Eric we will give you your diploma but you cannot come to graduation.\nSo then I knew this. Eric was talking about it you know. And he said I can\u2019t go to graduation but\nat least I graduated. Eric always had a sense of humor about everything and he took things \u2014 [ll\nget to that a little bit later but now we are coming back from summer vacation and back to\nschool.",
        "Q: Was it frightening seeing German soldiers?",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t that frightened. I kind of liked seeing them. They\u2019re marching you know. We\nweren\u2019t, maybe we were dumb or something. I don\u2019t know. But kids love to see marching. We\nweren\u2019t aware that the soldiers were going to \u2014 there was going to be a war. That was not -- but\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 14\nthey marched right by my house. I remember that. And waving to them and you know. It didn\u2019t\nlast, believe me.\nBut now comes September. We are back in school.",
        "Q: This is September 38.",
        "A: Exactly, 38. And nothing much is happening and now we go right through until November\n10\". And we\u2019re in school and we went, as I said, home to lunch every day to Tante Olga, Lily\u2019s\nmom. And we\u2019re going to lunch and it is very cold. And we\u2019re getting there and the door is open\nand a window is open. Sometimes she used to open a window to air it out but always close it and\nall that. And we walked in and Lily calls mama. No answer. Again we\u2019re running through the\nhouse, mama, mama. Nobody there. And I\u2019m yelling Tante Olga where are you. We are home\nfor lunch. We only have half an hour. No answer. Lily and I look at each other. Something\u2019s not\nright. I said what do we do? She said I know the Tikler family here in town, another Jewish\nfamily. Why don\u2019t we go there? Something\u2019s happened. So ok we started going down the street,\nwhen all of a sudden across from us, we\u2019re walking straight and perpendicular comes what we\ncall the green Henry. It was a green police wagon. And in it is her father. And we see this and my\nuncle just waved goodby. And then we just were so scared. And we started running and we get to\nthe Tikler house and they\u2019re all women, no men gathered in that house. And we said to my aunt,\nand she said what happened. How come we didn\u2019t know where we were, where you were. She\nsaid I didn\u2019t have time. They came and chased me out. And they wouldn\u2019t even let me leave a\nnote or go get you so what is going on.\nWell nobody told us anything. The women were there and they were all very upset. An old\nwoman who was uh, and babies. I mean there must have been ten or 12 people. Where\u2019s my\nmother? We don\u2019t know. So I said I\u2019m going home. Oh you can\u2019t go alone. So Lily said P\u2019ll go\nwith you cause I will. You can\u2019t stop me now. Now I\u2019m getting independent. (laughs) So Lily\nand I start walking. And the distance was maybe a mile from where we were to my home. In\nWiesenfeld. We get about half way. I see a bicyclist coming towards us. There was minimal\ntraffic at that time. Nobody had a car, you know. It was, so here comes a bicycle rider. Even that\nwas a big deal. Come closer. Who is it? My mother. She said papa is in jail. Where\u2019s Eric?\nHe\u2019s in jail. Oh god. And uncle Isadore. We just saw him go by. They must have taken him to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 15\njail. What happened? A Jewish kid, my mother is saying. Come on, let\u2019s go. I\u2019m going to take\nyou back to the Tiklers. We\u2019re all going to be together. The story was and everybody has heard\nthe story. A Jewish kid killed a Nazi official and we\u2019re ok. Everybody paid I don\u2019t know how\nmany marks. Plus being in prison. So that\u2019s what that day was Kristal night. They took my\nfather into a jail in some other town, and my brother and they were sitting there and my mother.\nThey were taking my mother too. But my mother, if you want to know somebody feisty, she was,\nshe said you\u2019re not keeping me. You can shoot me first. You\u2019re not keeping me here. I got to go\nget my daughter. She didn\u2019t do anything. She\u2019s 11 years old. What. And they said ok, go, go,\ngo. So that\u2019s how she got out.\nSo we went back to the house and all the women. Uh, what are we going to and kvetching and\ncrying and my mother said. You know what. We don\u2019t have time for this. We better sit down\nhere and think about what to do. So perhaps we could find, she just made things up to keep them\nbusy, to get some clothes together. Or get whatever we need. Get some suitcases. Maybe do\nwhatever we have to do, even if the suitcases are empty. Just, you never know what we have to\ndo. And they said ok and they, I don\u2019t know what they did. But by that time things were coming\ntowards supper time. And my mother said now maybe we could find something to eat. Could\nmake a sandwich. Have some fruit. And so we all did that. They did that.\nAnd now it\u2019s getting later and later and now there 1s a banging on the door. Must have been\neight, nine o\u2019clock at night. Open. Open up. It\u2019s the Gestapo. So everybody is cowering. My\nmom close to the door and she said yes. And he said how many of you are there. And my mother\nsaid I don\u2019t know. And get out. So my mother said what do you mean get out. You get out in\nthe street all of you. Now. You can grab what you can and go and so people who had been\nfutzing around and looking for clothes. They had stuff and they had a coat and whatever we had.\nAnd we were on the street now. It\u2019s cold. Quite cold. My mother says what are you going to do\nwith us? We decided. There were three of them. You are going into that factory that\u2019s a few\nstreets, I don\u2019t recall where exactly. Was an empty factory. And they were going to put us in\nthere and we were to stay there. And this was a cement floor and nothing else.\nSo we get there and all of a sudden, my mother stops and she said to them, excuse me, sir. I\nwant to a, tell you something. And he said yes, what do you want? She said when we were\nyoung and I lived in that house where Lily lives now, and my aunt. I used to live here and you\nused to come to the back door and ask for me and when I came out, you tried to kiss me. And he\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 16\nsaid to her. Shut up. She said but you did. What if I spoke very loud and everybody would know\nthat you, a Nazi officer, kissed a Jewish girl. And he said if you don\u2019t shut up, I\u2019m going to send\nyou and the kid to Dachau. Meaning me. She said that\u2019s very good officer. You can send me\nand my kid but before you do, I\u2019m going to scream it all over this town that you tried to kiss a\nJewish girl. He said what the hell do you want? She said all I want 1s to take these people instead\nof putting us into the factory, to my home in Wiesenfeld. I have a big house and we can stay\nthere. And of course they argued. And they can\u2019t do that and who do you think you are. And she\nsaid ok, it\u2019s your choice but I can scream. And I thought he\u2019d shoot her right there.\nGo ahead, he says. Take them and go. I have to laugh at her. Cause she said but it\u2019s so cold. We\ncan\u2019t just walk. We\u2019ve got this old lady and a baby. And he just he was getting crazy, this man.\nAnd the other officials heard him say what does she want? She can\u2019t walk. She says I want a\ntruck and they said get her a damn truck. They got a truck. They loaded us on. They got us a\ndriver and they got us a bodyguard with a machine gun or whatever. And they drove us to my\nparents\u2019 house.\nSo she saved the day. Now it took some time to find out what happened to my aunts and uncles.\nAnd for my father to be released and in the meantime, while we were all mulling around in my\nbig house, my mother sent a telegram to a cousin we had here in the United States. My cousin. It\nwas my mother\u2019s niece who married an American physician. And this physician had gone to\nVienna years before in the 20s, to study at the University of Vienna. And",
        "Q: So you'll continue.",
        "A: Well he went to study, post graduate work at the University of Vienna and he met my cousin\nand they dated while he was there. And he was there about a year or so. And came back to the\nUnited States and sent her a telegram. Will you marry me? And she sent back yes. So he came\nback again and they were married. So lucky for us. Now she\u2019s in America, he\u2019s an American\ncitizen. And my mother sent them a telegram. Can you send us an affidavit. We got to have\nsomething because Hugo is in jail and Eric 1s 1n jail and they sent an affidavit to Eric. To get\nhim out first, my brother. Because they were really after the young men.\nSo they sent Eric an affidavit and to make a long story short, they let Eric out. And this was\nmaybe December now. Kristal night was November. So December. And he was able to get a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 17\nvisa and a passport to come to the United States and he came alone. And my cousins, they picked\nhim up and they took him in and they took care of him. Now \u2014",
        "Q: Was there any destruction on Kristallnacht in your town or in your father\u2019s store?",
        "A: Not in my father\u2019s store. No. I think he was a very well-known man and he helped a lot of\npeople. Not that it make any difference to some of them, but it did help. I\u2019m sure.",
        "Q: So you did not see any destruction?",
        "A: So, I would recall it but no destruction. No it was I think there were a couple of people who\ncame to our door at midnight to see if they could help. Good people. Solid people. One woman\nwas my mother\u2019s washerwoman. And she risked her life to come to do whatever she could do.\nShe even brought bread. She thought we were starving. But before that I forgot to put this very\nimportant element in.\nRight after the Anschluss not much time passed when a Nazi officer came to my house. And I\nhappened to be \u2014 it was a two story house. And downstairs was the kitchen and a dining room.\nMy father\u2019s office, his business. Upstairs were bedrooms and a music room. And I had a baby\ngrand piano. And an old fashioned bathroom. We did not have running water. We had a\nbeautiful home but there was no running water yet. My mother wanted to institute that and\nhadn\u2019t gotten around to it and blah, blah, blah. So.\nThis Nazi officer came to the door and said -- I was alone. Where\u2019s your mother. And I said\nshe\u2019s upstairs. Take me. so I take him and I called her and I said, Mupik, somebody to see you.\nShe comes out. He says to her, where\u2019s your piano. She said, show me. so she shows him. It\nwill be taken within the hour. And my mother said, what? What do you mean, it\u2019ll be taken\nwithin the hour. He said don\u2019t you know yet, lady, that Jews are not allowed to have anything\nof value. And she is thinking that this 1s a joke. And he said now I\u2019m going to give you a\nchance. Make a decision. It\u2019s either you or the piano. They were going to take either the piano\nor they\u2019 Il take her. Now what do you do? Even when you are feisty. You can\u2019t stop that. So that\nwas I forgot all about that. It was at the very beginning.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 18",
        "Q: Do you remember them taking the piano?",
        "A: Oh god yes.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts?",
        "A: Crying.",
        "Q: You stood there crying.",
        "A: I was crying. But we still had the house until two weeks after that. They came again and they\nsaw my father. And they said to him you know that you cannot possess your house any longer.\nNo business, no nothing. I want you to sign an IOU. And my father said I\u2019m not signing\nanything. You, you what do you mean, my house. We are here to possess, to take possession of\nyour business. And your house. And my father said and what are we supposed to do. He said\nwell we\u2019re not evil people. We will allow you to live upstairs. So it took a while to straighten all\nthis out. It was awful. We had to move upstairs. And if we wanted to cook and eat, the bathroom\nhappened to have a stove where, for heating. So we had to cook on that. There was a bathtub in\nthere. Toilet was somewhere else. And we had to go buy our own groceries.\nAnd the house was no longer \u2014 he had to sign it over to the German regime. It wasn\u2019t Austria\nanymore. It was all German. So that\u2019s how we lost everything.",
        "Q: What was your father\u2019s state of mind then?",
        "A: My father was a very, he didn\u2019t, he coped with everything. I mean he thought things through\nand he \u2014 this is what is happening. Let\u2019s figure out what do we do now. And it was very difficult\nfor him of course, my god. So ok, now that\u2019s gone. Then later that was March, I think or, Hitler\ntook in March so you know as the weeks went by all this happened.\nSo then as I said, Kristal night, I already explained that. Papa is still sitting in jail.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 19",
        "Q: Do you know if at that time you knew what had happened in Germany on Kristal night?",
        "A: Oh yeah because we knew it happened in every \u2014",
        "Q: How did you know that? Do you know how your parents knew it?",
        "A: Well we had a radio.",
        "Q: You had a radio.",
        "A: We were allowed to have the radio. So and the talk, calling on, I mean you can\u2019t just whisper\nthese things anymore. It\u2019s out now. And so we are now old enough to know what\u2019s going on.\nYou know and especially after Kristal night it was totally clear for Lily and me and her brothers\nthat nobody, they hate the Jews and god knows what\u2019s going to happen to us. So now comes the\naffidavit for Eric.\nNow he\u2019s allowed to go. What\u2019s going to happen to papa now? What\u2019s going to happen to us?\nSo Eric comes to the United States and he\u2019s being taken care of by the American physician and\nhis wife. And Eric 1s learning English and he gets himself a job. They lived in New York. So\nEric is in New York. Now Woodside, Long Island which is almost part of Manhattan. And\nsomebody from Europe told him that there is a guy in New Jersey and he works in a factory and\nhe used to know papa and Eric why don\u2019t you try to contact him and it worked. He contacted\nthis man and the man got Eric a job in that factory. In New Jersey. It wasn\u2019t all that bad to travel\nyou know, to commute but \u2014",
        "Q: Who had the money to pay for Eric to come over?",
        "A: My father.",
        "Q: Do you know what ship he was on?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 20",
        "A: No, not, not what. I don\u2019t know what he was on. I can only tell you later what we were on.\nAnd \u2014",
        "Q: So he gets this offer, this job in New Jersey.",
        "A: So he takes the job and a man said to him Eric, you look a little bit depressed all the time.\nWhat\u2019s the matter? And he said \u2019'm worried about my parents and my sister. They are still over\nthere. And this man said to him, well why don\u2019t you write to President Roosevelt and tell him.\nAnd Eric said yeah, right. I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t even speak the language. I can\u2019t write and I\u2019m going to\ntell the president, hey you know. And this man said well you never know. And Eric said no I\u2019m\nnot going to do it. This man kept pushing. He said Eric you got to try things. And Eric finally\nsaid he got disgusted. He said ok already. Will you help me? And the man said Ill help you\nwrite the letter.\nSo Eric writes this letter. Dear Mr. President whatever my parents, my little sister. I\u2019m very\nworried. It\u2019s a terrible time. Sent it, forgets about it. Two, three weeks pass by. A letter comes\nfrom the office of the President. From his press secretary. Dr. Mr. Wellisch, the president has\nbeen made aware of your situation and has directed me to tell you what to do and how you can\nget your parents out. And it had to be a farmer\u2019s visa because the United States had a quota,\ndidn\u2019t let everybody in.\nBut if you were, knew anything about agriculture, you had a chance. Luckily my father owned a\nfarm. I\u2019ve got pictures over there. I can show you later. He owned the farm right in Wiesenfeld.\nIt was a big farm. He owned it but he didn\u2019t run it. Somebody else who ran it, but papa was the\nkind of man who was well informed about everything. He owned the farm. He knew about\nfarming.\nHe knew about lumber and everything that he did, he was well informed about you know.\nSo my brother was able to communicate to papa to apply for a farmer\u2019s visa. To make a long\nstory short, he got it, but it took from January or February until the end of August for us to get\nout. We lived under the Hitler regime for a long, long time and things were getting harder and\nharder. But he did get the farmer\u2019s visa. And he was able to have enough money to have\ntransportation for us to come to the United States and the ship we were on was called the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 21\nVolendam. So in August of 28\" we arrived in New York and this was about a week before\nPoland was invaded when that was it. Nobody got out.",
        "Q: We will get to that of course. You said things got worse between January and August when\nyou left. What kind of things, how did your life change? What weren\u2019t you allowed to do?",
        "A: We weren\u2019t allowed to do anything. I mean we were just sitting tight. My father was allowed\nthough to go to different offices to try to get the visa. He had to do that. And you have to get a\npassport. And you have to get stuff together to, what are you allowed to take out. What are you\nnot allowed to take? That kind of stuff. That he was allowed to do, to go to Vienna and do that.\nBut other than that, nothing. I mean \u2014",
        "Q: When did he get out of prison?",
        "A: Well he must have been from Kristal night, November tenth. I don\u2019t know. About a month or\n\u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: What other restrictions did you have in that January to August time span? You, as you \u2014",
        "A: Well I couldn\u2019t play with anybody. As far as a child is concerned. I was able to go to Lily you\nknow and we could be together. She was with us anyway. They were in my house until all these\npeople that my mother rescued kept us busy because there were a lot of people to feed and the\nbedding and \u2014",
        "Q: And so they were up on the second floor with you?",
        "A: Yeah. In different bedrooms. My grandmother lived with us so she, and she had died. But\nwe were able to use her \u2014 she lived in. She had a kitchen and two or three bedrooms and so we\nwere able to put these people in there. And my parents\u2019 bedroom, my bedroom. Had lovely\nmusic room. Everything was used. And we left them there.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 22",
        "Q: Did you see any signs or in the street about Jews not being able to do certain things?",
        "A: Not there, in this town. There was nothing except where my brother was in that city, in St.\nPolten, there were signs on the benches around the schools. No Jews allowed. They couldn\u2019t sit\nthere. And my uncle, the one whom I told you we saw in that green wagon, he was taken to\nVienna to scrub the sidewalk with a toothbrush. You\u2019ve heard about those things. So he was one\nof them. But he made it. Now the sad part is that after we were here already, we were very\nconcerned about the rest of the family. Especially and Lily, I was worried more about Lily. We\nwere like sisters. And the edict more or less was that the Nazis were after the men and the young\nboys. And so my uncle and my, Lily\u2019s older brother were able to get out through some Jewish\norganization here. I don\u2019t remember which one. And they left Austria. They left Wiesenfeld\nwhere they were in my house. And came to the United States and my uncle thought he could get\nhis wife and Lily and Otto out. And never made it. So he\u2019s here with his son and with the guilt.\nWhy did I do this? And you know how you can, my cousin is still living in St. Louis. Lily\u2019s older\nbrother. He is ok but another, there are so many stories attached to what I am telling you. It\nwould take me all day.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about your leaving. What did you say to Lily when it was time to leave?",
        "A: When it was time to leave I said nothing. My father told me to be very quiet. We are leaving\nmidnight on a train that we didn\u2019t have a school in Wiesenfeld but we had a train station which\nto this day doesn\u2019t make any sense. We were going to take the train to Vienna and from Vienna\nwe were going to Holland. And I\u2019m not to say anything to anybody. It was too dangerous. So \u2014",
        "Q: What did you take with you?",
        "A: Ah, we had a few things we were allowed to take. At that time it was still not as bad as later\non. I mean ridiculous to even mention it cause nobody lived anymore. But we could take our\nclothing and my mother had some silver spoons and she had that in her suitcase and that was ok\nand this necklace. That\u2019s hers. That was my grandmother\u2019s. Now I don\u2019t remember how she got\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 23\nthat out, but that and nothing else. As far as jewelry is concerned because one day the Nazi came\nin and asked again where is your mother? And my mother is \u2014 where is your jewelry? It\u2019s in the\ndrawer wherever. Open it. She opens it and he goes through it and he finds her engagement ring\nwhich was a gorgeous ring. An emerald surrounded by diamonds. Ah, ok, in the pocket. And I\nhad a little ruby that I loved. Oh, is that the kid\u2019s? Oh that\u2019s mine. Yes. Oh, ok. That kind of\nthing so but papa said you know that\u2019s not the worst. We\u2019re getting out now so when we did get\nout, this was in the dead of night in August. And I couldn\u2019t say anything and I was pretty upset\nabout that. But we \u2014",
        "Q: Did you take anything besides clothes, like books or anything?",
        "A: Yeah, we took books. My mother\u2019s, she had a beautiful library and she packed them in some\nkind of box and I don\u2019t know. I guess of all things you know but when you\u2019re in the situation\nlike this you want to take something that \u2014",
        "Q: Did you take any dolls or anything?",
        "A: No couldn\u2019t take anything. Mm, mm not that. Mostly clothing and no linens. Nothing.\nMostly clothing and a few odds and ends.",
        "Q: So it was August and what port did you leave from? You went \u2014",
        "A: Well now this is another story.",
        "Q: You took the train to Vienna, you said.",
        "A: Took the train to Vienna and my father\u2019s aunt was there at the train station. And I don\u2019t\nremember much about anybody else but she was there because she was my very favorite aunt.\nAnd she hugged me and she said you should be very happy. You know why. I said why should I\nbe so happy? She said not only because you\u2019re getting away from here but because you won\u2019t\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 24\nhave to go to school on Saturday in America. (laughs) and we cried and she said my darling I\ndon\u2019t think I'll ever see you again. And I never did.\nSo we got on that train. When we get to the border the Gestapo comes on. Checking papers.\nCome to papa. Papers, passport, takes the papers, walks away and brings another officer and says\nthere\u2019s something wrong here. Get off the train. Take the kid, take your wife. Get off. We had\nto get off. The train goes away. That was hell. They took my father into an office and they told\nmy mother and me to sit and wait and we sit and we wait. And train after train is coming and\ngoing. Our train long gone. No Papa. Now what.\nI said to my mother I think we\u2019re going to die. And she pushed and she said we are not dying. I,\nif I have anything to do with these guys we (laughs). They could have killed her more than once.\nShe had a mouth and I mean it was about three or four hours later when Papa came out. We can\ngo. What happened? They did not believe that he knew anything about farming. Because he was\na businessman. And they brought in a knowledgeable agricultural expert who grilled him for\ntwo hours about cows and milk and what have you. And Papa thank God, he knew the answers.\nHe was well informed about everything. And they finally had to, well they didn\u2019t have to let him\ngo but they let him go.\nSo we got on the next train and went to Rotterdam. And they met the Jewish committees and\neven the Dutch people. They met every train coming from Germany. And they put us up in\nprivate homes, in hotels. Wherever there was room and we were put up. At first I think it was a\nhotel. We didn\u2019t stay long because the ship was leaving anyway but they treated us like royalty.\nThey were so kind, the Dutch people. And when we did finally get on that ship it was of course,\nthe Volendam, a Dutch ship, Dutch crew and they treated the immigrants beautifully. And I\nremember having to eat brick ice cream three times a day. They brought this ice cream. And to\nthis day if you show me brick ice cream I will ugh. (laughs) And we got here \u2014",
        "Q: Were you sad about leaving Europe, leaving \u2014",
        "A: Well you know when, I was distracted a lot. First of all you get into Holland. You meet all the\n-- another country. You\u2019re going to a hotel. So much distraction. But then it hit me. What\u2019s\nhappening? What, what, am I ever going to go home again? What\u2019s going to happen to Lily?\nLily, Lily, Lily. And all my other relatives. Lily was killed with Otto and my aunts in the 40s.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 25\nIn Sobibor or someplace like that. Shot in the mass grave. And other people. Horrible stories that\nmy family suffered like so many others.\nSo anyway, this is interesting. We come on the Volendam, right. Took us I think almost two\nweeks because we found out later from the captain that the ocean was mined. And he was trying\nto figure out what the best \u2014 where would the Germans not put a mine. So that\u2019s why, luckily\nyou know we avoided that. The Volendam went from New York to I believe Cuba with some\nrefugees. Dropped them off. Went back. And that\u2019s all I ever knew. And after I was here and\nmarried already, my brother in law took us to a very fancy restaurant in New York. It was some\nkind of celebration and he took my husband and me and he and his wife and, and each table\nalmost had their own waiter. It was a bit much. They come and put the napkin on your lap and\nthe, and I\u2019m not you know, and this one waiter said, spoke with an accent. And he was very nice\nand very courteous and I said so where are you from. And he said I\u2019m from Holland and I said\nyou know your people are wonderful. And he said oh madam, do you know anything about\nHolland? And I said well Pll just tell you briefly. We came from Austria through Germany. And\nyour people helped us and he said oh yes. He said may I ask you what ship. And I said the\nVolendam. And he said oh, almost like Oh. I said are you ok? And he said at that time I was a\ncrew member on the Volendam. And we had a trip to Cuba and on the way back we hit a mine\nand all my crew members died. I am one of the very few survivors.\nAnd I said I think that\u2019s the end of my dinner. I can\u2019t, can you \u2014 That was quite a \u2014 so that was\none of the stories that made me very sad but I said I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re alive so. He had tears in\nhis eyes and he walked away.",
        "Q: Do you remember the organization that helped you and the Jewish \u2014 was it the Joint\nDistribution Committee, in Holland?",
        "A: Or the Jewish, what else is there? What, we had so many organizations.",
        "Q: Now you\u2019re in the United States. What did the United States mean to you as a young girl?",
        "A: Well I tell you, the first impression, seeing the skyscrapers was \u2014 I said this cannot be. This 1s,\nI come from this little town in Wiesenfeld. Vienna is gorgeous. Have you ever been? It\u2019s a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 26\nbeautiful city. It doesn\u2019t have, it has some now though. But this is ridiculous. (laughs) So I was\nvery impressed you know but very, my English was minimal. I did have English in school. But\nyeah, it\u2019s difficult when you\u2019re in the country and you try to converse with people. You don\u2019t\nunderstand because it\u2019s, you think, why do they talk so fast. But I had to go to school. And I was\nadmitted to first, to sixth grade. Now here I am 13 now. So I am the oldest in the classroom. And\nthe children were very nice to me. And the teacher explained \u2014 her name was Mrs. Sacks, a\nJewish lady, that Trudy has just come from another country and she was trying to put a little\nhistory in there to tell the kids why this is happening. Why I\u2019m here. And they were listening\nand very polite and very sweet and can I help you and all that.\nSo the teacher said you don\u2019t have to do anything, to me. Just listen to the language. And I\u2019m\nlistening and I guess I\u2019m learning. And three months passed by and she said we\u2019re having a\nvocabulary test today. We\u2019re going to have a hundred words and I raised my hand and she said\nyes. I said could I try it. And she said yes. I got a hundred. And the next day this was after she\ncomes in and she said, I have an announcement to make, class. We had this vocabulary test\nyesterday and I want you to know that Trudy got one hundred percent and they all stood up and\nthat made me and that was America, my goodness. Whereas in Europe you have to sit quietly\nand most of the time you have your hands on the table and, and you don\u2019t say a word and you\ndon\u2019t, and here the children got up and celebrating this. I thought America is wonderful.",
        "Q: Where were you living then?",
        "A: Woodside. And then I skipped sixth grade and went to seventh grade. And I was in seventh\ngrade for a few months. I don\u2019t remember how long. And I skipped to eighth grade. And then I\nmoved to New Jersey with my parents. And both my parents worked in factories and had a little\nroom. I couldn\u2019t live with them. They had no room. I lived with my cousins. The ones who\nbrought me. I stayed with them for oh a year or two. Well while my parents were looking for\nwork. Oh boy it was hard. So they only had one room.",
        "Q: Were you in touch with Lily at that point?",
        "A: No more.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 27",
        "Q: Once you left \u2014",
        "A: Once I left \u2014",
        "Q: You had no communication.",
        "A: No, nope, nope, no. So at any rate, then my parents were able to get a little apartment. One\nbedroom and they got a couch so I could sleep in the living room.",
        "Q: Where was your brother then?",
        "A: Let\u2019s see now. My brother, this was already, oh. My brother, he got a job after the factory in\na tobacco, on a tobacco farm and he worked there in the summer. And again somebody said to\nhim, Eric you seem like a smart guy. You want to do this for the rest of your life? And Eric said\nno I don\u2019t want to do it but right now I don\u2019t have much of a choice. And this man said did you\nknow that about Johns Hopkins 1s giving out scholarships and Eric said so what? And this man\nsaid you are smart. You ought to try it. Again, the same thing. The way he spoke about\nRoosevelt. Oh he says, don\u2019t be ridiculous. To make a long story short, he applied and he got it.\nGot a scholarship to Hopkins. Came for an interview and the dean, whoever interviews, said we\nhave these two scholarships, specifically for immigrants.\nSo that\u2019s the good news. You are definitely in. You want to hear the bad news. And Eric\nthought oh God. You know I\u2019ve had enough bad news but what\u2019s the bad. He said you have to\ndo it in three years, not four. And Eric said so what. That\u2019s not bad news. I can do that. So he\nsaid to him, if you think you can do it in three years, you\u2019re in. What would you like to study?\nAnd Eric said law. Man leans back. He said Eric, I don\u2019t think so. You have such an accent\nyou ll never make it as a lawyer. Pick something else. So Eric said well ok, Pll be a chemist.\nThat\u2019s what he became. Went right through Hopkins in three years. The war came. He enlisted.\nThen he came back and went to Columbia, got a masters. And then Purdue and got a PhD so\nworks out ok.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 28\nGail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Trudy Schonberger. This is track number two and you just finished talking about\nyour brother so let\u2019s get back to your story. You\u2019re in high school now.\nTrudy Schonberger: I\u2019m in high school in New Jersey. It\u2019s a breeze. I loved it. And now I\u2019m\ngraduating. And I\u2019m graduating with honors and I was very happy about that. Now what do I\ndo?",
        "Q: Did you tell all your friends about your experience? They knew?",
        "A: Well they knew. You know I had an accent and how come and I did tell them some. I didn\u2019t\ntell them all that, you know but they knew and they learned some from teachers, but not enough.\nIt wasn\u2019t taught.",
        "Q: How were your parents\u2019 English?",
        "A: Not too great. We had more fun with that.",
        "Q: So you continued to speak German at home?",
        "A: Yes. My father\u2019s English was better than my mother\u2019s. Oral English. My mother was, her\nwriting English was better than my father\u2019s. So they\u2019d always have a repartee. You see, I can do\nbetter than you and so that was funny. And he said to her one day, you know Irene, they have a\ngood, your favorite pie downstairs in the bakery. I can\u2019t think of the name, but you know what\nyour favorite pie is. And she said oh why didn\u2019t you bring me one? I didn\u2019t have money with me.\nGo down. You can get it. She goes down, comes back. No pie. What happened? They said they\nnever heard of it. And my father said, what do you mean they never heard of it? What did you\nask them for? She said I asked them for a merchant marine pie and they never heard of it. What\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 29\nit was, was lemon meringue but it was war time and she got confused. (laughs) That\u2019s the\nEnglish.",
        "Q: So now you\u2019re graduating?",
        "A: I\u2019m graduating. Now what do I do. My parents working in the factory. We just about made it\nto pay the rent and live. Now what. And I always wanted to do something in medicine. And it\nmay be the influence of the physician who brought us over because he was a wonderful person\nand a wonderful doctor. So I suppose he had this influence of what I wanted to be.",
        "Q: Did we get his name?",
        "A: Leo Lefkowitz. And he was in the war too. Oh god, that\u2019s another story Ill tell you.\nAnyway that was, what could I possibly be? So papa said you know what. Maybe you can just\nfind a job for the summertime and we\u2019|l discuss it and see what you can do. You know you\nshould really be a typist. I said I don\u2019t want to be a typist. Yes, that\u2019s good for a girl. You know\nyou, I don\u2019t want to be a typist. I hate typing and I hate paperwork. Get a job in the summer,\nwhatever. What happened was friends of my parents were neighbors of a couple who had two\nchildren and they needed a babysitter living in for the summer. Do you want to do this? And I\nsaid I like kids. She said, why don\u2019t you \u2014 I will call them. Maybe they\u2019Il have you for an\ninterview. I went for the interview. I got the job. She had to go for surgery and she needed\nsomebody to be with the two little ones. And as she is recovering, he said to me, his name was\nDr. Dan Moore. What, he said you and I haven\u2019t talked about you at all. He said to me what do\nyou want to do now? The job is almost over here with us. What? I said I don\u2019t know. What are\nyou interested in? I said oh I don\u2019t know. Something in medicine. I just, I don\u2019t want to be a\nnurse. And he said to me, do you know what I do? And I said no, not really. He said \u2019'm a\nbiophysicist. And I have a laboratory in Columbia University right across the bridge. They lived\nin Leonia, New Jersey which 1s you\u2019ve heard of Fort Lee recently. Next door.\nHe said would you like to see my laboratory. And I said oh yes. So he said to his wife. \u2019m\ngoing to take Trudy and I\u2019m just going to show her around. And she was lovely. She said\nwhatever. So he took me.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 30",

        "A: This is 45. I graduated, yeah, 45.",
        "Q: So the war is over.",
        "A: The war is just about over I think. It was August. When did it end?",
        "Q: Well in Europe, it was in the spring. Japan was in the summer.",
        "A: Yeah, ok. Japan we\u2019re still going. Ok so he shows me his laboratory. It was at Columbia\nCollege of physicians and surgeons. And I was so impressed with this whole thing and going to a\nbig laboratory. What, he said, I do, I do some research in an area called electrophoresis. And he\nsaid of course you don\u2019t know what it is because it\u2019s so new to all of us and it is the separation of\nproteins in the blood, to study proteins, cause there wasn\u2019t too much known. And I thought well\nok, you know. Then he said to me, how would you like to work for me? He said I cannot pay\nyou but I\u2019d like you to learn. And I almost fell over. I said Dr. Moore, I do have to speak to my\nparents about this. I\u2019m 18 years old and I don\u2019t want to make \u2014 this is just too much to\ncomprehend. And I went back home and I called my parents. And I said I got to talk to you\npapa. What is it? Ihave to come home. I got to talk to you.\nSo they let me off for a few hours. I went home and I said this is what\u2019s happening. What do you\nthink? And he said I don\u2019t have to think. Take it. He said it\u2019s like going to school. Doesn\u2019t cost\nyou anything? Ok. You won\u2019t make any money but we\u2019ll figure it out. We\u2019ll give you money\nfor the subway and the bus and we\u2019ll feed you and see what happens. That\u2019s how I got the job.\nAnd about six months or so later, he said I can pay you a little bit. So he started paying me $50 a\nmonth. I thought oh it 1s fantastic. But there is a hang up here. Uh oh. I think you should go to\nschool. Oy. What, what, what I don\u2019t have any money. He said I\u2019m going to give you a day off\na week and you can go downtown and start taking courses at Columbia. He gave me a day a\nweek and I started taking physics of all things. I thought I must be crazy because he was a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 31\nbiophysicist. So I took physics and as time went on chemistry and more and more stuff. And he\nstarted to pay me more and more.\nAnd then in 1947 I got married. And they came to my wedding and I learned a lot. So I thought\nI was the luckiest girl in the world. At any rate, the job ended because I married and we moved to\nMontana.",
        "Q: We'll get to that in a minute. During the war years, when you were here with your parents,\ndid they have any communication with family back in Europe? Did they know what was\nhappening? What was their state of mind? You know talking about \u2014",
        "A: They were all dead by then.",
        "Q: So once you got here, your folks had no communication with \u2014",
        "A: Well when Eric enlisted, he was in the Battle of the Bulge. You want to hear a little aside, you\nmight like this story. He was a sergeant and he was in charge of a platoon. And you know about\nthe Battle of the Bulge, how horrible. And they were stuck in the ice and the snow and Eric was\n\u2014 and he\u2019s trying to get a jeep out. I don\u2019t know what. When a voice came above him and said,\nwhat the hell are you doing sergeant? And Eric didn\u2019t even look up. He said what the hell do\nyou think I\u2019m doing? And the voice said look at me sergeant. And Eric looks up and he said oh\nmy god. It\u2019s General Patton himself. (laughs)\nSo anyway they made it through and where were we?",
        "Q: I was asking if your parents had any knowledge of what was happening to the extended\nfamily.",
        "A: Well because of Eric who stayed after the war to try to find what was going on.",
        "Q: No, but I meant during \u2014",
        "A: During. No.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 32",

        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: During the war.",
        "A: Yes, oh yes, oh yes. Then we all, you know I was of course already of a more mature age that\nI could participate and \u2014",
        "Q: Did they try to contact anybody in Europe?",
        "A: The only ones that we were able to \u2014",
        "Q: During the war.",
        "A: During the war was a cousin who made it, a cousin of my father who made it to Bolivia.\nThat\u2019s another story, that\u2019s --. He, her husband, she was my father\u2019s cousin. And her husband\nwas my mother\u2019s cousin so that\u2019s a little \u2014 Kristal night. His name was Richard. And he was\ntaken away and sent to Dachau. And she was left alone with her baby. In Vienna. And the Nazis\nsaid to her, if you can get yourself out of here, I\u2019ll let him out and he can go with you. Let\u2019s get\nhim out. And so she starts going from one embassy to another embassy. Ends up at the Bolivian\nembassy, gets permission and they really let him out. It\u2019s now a few days before departure and\nthe kid gets scarlet fever and they can\u2019t go. So now you start this whole thing again. But she\nwas smart. She said I might as well go to the Bolivian embassy and tell them what has happened.\nMaybe they\u2019ll \u2014 and they did. But it took time. You know everything takes time. In the\nmeantime the Nazis come and take this and finally they\u2019re able to go by ship to Cochabamba\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 33\nwhich is the second largest city in Bolivia. They get there. I don\u2019t know how long it took. Heinz,\nthe little boy, who is now 76, still living in Vienna, whom I saw a few years ago, so they\u2019re on\nthat ship and they\u2019re getting to Cochabamba and it\u2019s on the weekend. And Richard says I do not\nfeel well. And all the immigrants are in that camp. That\u2019s where the refugees had to go to an\nimmigration center. And they said oh that happens all the time because the altitude is very\ndifficult on people. You'll be ok.\nRichard wasn\u2019t ok. He got worse, but there was no doctor available on the weekend. He had to\nwait until Monday and he\u2019s getting a fever and a lot of pain. Finally Monday comes. Richard\ncan\u2019t talk anymore, he\u2019s in so much pain. The doctor says you have a burst appendix. We\u2019ve\ngot to go quick. They get him to the hospital, put him on the table and he died. So she can\u2019t get\nout with the little boy. She didn\u2019t know what to do and that\u2019s where my father\u2019s communication\nbegan. At least to somebody. She had no idea what happened to any, any of the family. Until\nmuch later on we found out. Eric found out. My cousins, they were all in Theresienstadt, most\nof them. And Eric found her. This is my Aunt Elsa, the one who met me at the train station, said\nyou don\u2019t have to, her daughter was in Theresienstadt, survived and but she was deathly ill. And\nEric found her, found her in Vienna, after and saw how sick she was. She had TB. She had\nkidney disease. She had, you name it. And he arranged it for her to go to a sanatorium in\nSwitzerland. Until she got well. So he was able to save her and her husband whom she met in\nTheresienstadt. He was a roofer. His name was Alexander Bernot. He was in Theresienstadt and\nhe saw Anna scrounging around for some food and they got a little bit. He tried to help her. He\nwas a roofer in Vienna. He did most of the roofs of the big, like St. Stephen\u2019s and he was \u2014 and\nso the Nazis used him to fix the roof here and there. They didn\u2019t care if the water dripped down\non the inmates, but they wanted their roofs to be free from rainwater and all that. So he did that\nso he had a little access to more things. And then the rumor came that the war 1s coming to an\nend and Americans or British bombers are going to bomb.\nSo the inmates said so now we\u2019re going to, we survived this. Now we\u2019re going to get killed by \u2014\nhe climbed up on the roof of the barracks, with red paint. And he painted red crosses on the\nroofs. If he had been caught he would have been dead. But the thing was that some of these\nroofs leaked and the red paint dripped on some of the prisoners. They had no way to get rid of it\nand some of the Nazis saw them and they thought they had some kind of terrible disease. They\nran. (laughs)\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 34",

He hired a choral teacher and that choral teacher had never been married and she kind\nof flirted with him and he fell for her and they had an affair and it broke up my marriage. Kaput.\nSo he always said I\u2019m coming back and it\u2019s over and I fell for this whole shtick. Had two\nchildren. I didn\u2019t, I was terrified.

        "A: No, he\u2019s not Jewish. But I could, but he\u2019s very Jewish oriented. He\u2019s an atheist. And he says\nto me you know finally I\u2019m not, I don\u2019t believe in any of this religious stuff. It causes all the\nproblems but if I had to choose, I\u2019d be a Jew. Regardless. I said to him the other day about, I\nsaid Germany has grown and is rich in economics and I said deep down, I hate to say this, I\nresent it. And I can\u2019t help it and I know German people and I\u2019m friendly, but there is this\nresidual feeling and it isn\u2019t just the Germans, it\u2019s the Austrians too.\nAnd the Austrians in many ways were worse, well you can\u2019t be worse.

        "A: It was great. I had to become a citizen by myself because at the age when I turned 18 you had\nto -- first of all there was a five year span before you, but if you turned 18, you cannot become a\ncitizen with your parents. You had to apply on your own. So this was in New York and I had to\nhave two witnesses and my boss, this Dr. Moore from Columbia said I\u2019d be happy to be a\nwitness and an aunt of my husband\u2019s. We went and I was just so proud. And they did, I don\u2019t\nremember them asking many questions. Who\u2019s the president? Oh, Roosevelt. You know, and,\nand the judicial system. They didn\u2019t ask much. Ok. I was very happy.",

Such sadness and how can people do this to anybody? How\ncan you not be angry? Or what is that feeling? But it\u2019s not, I don\u2019t even say hatred but an anger.\nAn anger that people, I thought we were civilized in the world now but this went on.\nOne more thing that might interest you. When we, when we were divorced and I hadn\u2019t worked\nsince Columbia, a good friend, we lived right near New Haven, near Yale. And this woman, her\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 39\nhusband was a research position there said you know you\u2019re going through all this trauma. You\nreally should get a job. And I said to her, Gloria, I haven\u2019t worked in 15 years. What can I do?\nWash dishes or \u2014 she said no, no, no. You have experience. Go to Yale and apply. I said you are\ncrazy. I\u2019m not doing that. And she nudged like somebody nudged my brother. So I said all right,\nPll go. I get to the employment office. Gentleman says what would you like to do and I said well\nI thought I could get a job in a lab but I tried to talk myself out of it because I was too \u2014",

And the man\nsaid what did you just say? And I thought he didn\u2019t. I said electrophoresis. He said don\u2019t move.\nI said oh my god. This has nothing to do with electricity.

So I had to start school in a village called St. Veit. That\u2019s\nspelled capital S-T and then capital V-E-I-T. And that I started first grade to probably third grade\nmaybe, fourth grade. I don\u2019t quite recall. And we walked and it was about maybe from half a\nmile to a mile. And then I transferred to the other town that I mentioned, Traisen which had a\nschool that went to seventh grade or I don\u2019t recall. But I went there with my cousin Lily who\nlived in Traisen. And they had more Jews there, not many but a couple of families. So I went to\nTraisen until I was 11 years old. And then I was sent to Vienna, to the gymnasium which 1s like\nour high schools but a lot tougher. Very tough. I had to pass an entrance exam to get in. and I\nwas very tempted to cheat but not for the good, but for, so I didn\u2019t have to go. But I passed it\nand I lived with friends of my parents. In Vienna. I really didn\u2019t want to go. I was kind of a\nhome body. And these people I lived with were very nice. They were not Jewish. They had a\ndaughter, a little bit older than myself. And we both went to that gymnasium.",

Right then and there. Pouf. And shortly\nthereafter Chancellor Schuschnigg went on the air and saying goodbye to Austria. Austria is no\nmore.",

        "A: This was the introduction and I don\u2019t even know whether Hitler\u2019s name came up, but\nGermany. What is this? I\u2019m 11 years old. I have no idea what is going on. Anyway my foster\nmom said when things started to calm down, it was time to go to school or whatever it was I\nwent back to school. Had to go to school. And things went on sort of normally. One week\npassed by. The principal came into the classroom and said all Jewish girls out into the hall. And\nat least I knew enough I was Jewish, you know. I went out into the hall and there were other\nJewish girls already out there. And the principal said pack up your books and whatever belongs\nto you and get out. Do not come back. No Jews allowed.\nSo the comprehension wasn\u2019t there yet, you know. What? What\u2019s going on? So I took my books\nand my coat and whatever we had and I took the streetcar and I went home to the foster parents.\nAnd she said what, are you all right? What\u2019s happening? I said I\u2019m ok but I got kicked out of\nschool. She said what did you do? I said I don\u2019t know. So I\u2019m proceeding to tell her, the\nprincipal said don\u2019t come back. They don\u2019t want Jews. And she, I remember this like it was\nyesterday. She sat in the chair and she said oh my god. I guess we have to call your parents.\nAnd she immediately went and called my parents. And it was either my mother or my father. I\ndon\u2019t recall said I guess we\u2019ll come and get her. So I was there another day and they came\nimmediately and brought me home. And you know what I thought. I thought you know what.\nThis isn\u2019t so bad. I hate this place anyway you know. Not realizing yet what was to come.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have sense enough I think to be frightened. Really. I did sense \u2014",
        "A: Something you know. My parents and the foster parents and that excitement and not good\nexcitement, not happy excitement but tension. So I went home. Now you can\u2019t just sit home.\nWhat are we going to do now? Ok. My mother called the school in Traisen where my cousin\nlived and they asked if they would take me in school. And they said yes. So that wasn\u2019t so bad\nbecause my cousin Lily, my age, we were like sisters. And she had two brothers, Oscar older and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 12\nOtto younger. And so we were kind of together and the school was right across from her house.\nSo we would go to lunch at my aunt\u2019s, Tante Olga was her name, Lily\u2019s mom and her dad\nIsadore. Isadore was my mother\u2019s brother. And so things were not too bad. This is now April\nalready. Took a while to get me in and you know the details of all this stuff.",
        "A: The swastika.",
        "A: Everybody had the swastika. Everybody. I don\u2019t know where it came from. So quickly. The\nA",
        "A: What is, just what\u2019s happening? What is happening? And then you\u2019ll find out. This is how I\nfound out how things are getting worse. Now we\u2019re finding out. A very nice teacher came in one\nmorning to the classroom and all the kids jumped up Heil Hitler with the arms. That was the law.\nAnd Lily and I jumped up too. We thought it has to be this way. And the teacher said Trudy and\nLily, you say good morning. You do not say Heil Hitler or he said you don\u2019t have to say. So we\nthought ok, Guten Morgen. We never saw the teacher again. It was the last time. He just\ndisappeared. Never knew what happened. I would think some of the kids went home, told\nmommy and daddy \u2014 unh. Away. Ok life goes on. About a month later, another teacher said to\nthe class. He was our math teacher. His name was Richter. I remember that. Well I guess you'll\nsee why I remember it. He said I have good news for you children. We are going on a field trip\nto Linz. Big city in Austria. So I\u2019m handing out the forms and you get your parents to sign it and\nLily and I were it\u2019s great. So we went home and showed it to Papa and he said I guess it\u2019s ok. He\nhad a little thinking but I thought well that\u2019s Papa. He worries about everything. And Lily went\nhome and she got permission. And we brought the forms back and the teacher takes the forms,\nlooks at them, tears them up and says Lily and Trudy you cannot go. We do not take Jews. Then\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 13\nthis is now we cried. Why? What did we do? Now it\u2019s beginning to sink in. Something is with\nthe Jews that they don\u2019t like. And he wasn\u2019t all nasty about it. He said I\u2019m so sorry. And that\nwas it. We couldn\u2019t go. So now this is beginning to sink in what is happening.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t recall them. I think if it had been anything nasty or mean I would remember it, but\nthere was nothing pro or con about it. Neither way, no. So it was beginning to be quite painful.\nWell then came the summertime and there was no school and Lily and I spent a lot of time\ntogether because our gentile friends were no longer our friends. They weren\u2019t allowed to play\nwith us. So we spent time together and did what we could. We visited each other. We couldn\u2019t\ngo to many places. You\u2019re not allowed to do anything. In the meantime \u2014",
        "A: Well I mean to really my parents and her parents did not allow us to run around and to \u2014\nbecause it was getting dangerous. My brother for example was in a gymnasium in St. Polten\nwhich I think I mentioned to you. And he had just finished gymnasium. He was 17. And he was\na valedictorian and the principal or the superintendent called him in to the office because they are\ngraduating now and said Eric we will give you your diploma but you cannot come to graduation.\nSo then I knew this. Eric was talking about it you know. And he said I can\u2019t go to graduation but\nat least I graduated. Eric always had a sense of humor about everything and he took things \u2014 [ll\nget to that a little bit later but now we are coming back from summer vacation and back to\nschool.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t that frightened. I kind of liked seeing them. They\u2019re marching you know. We\nweren\u2019t, maybe we were dumb or something. I don\u2019t know. But kids love to see marching. We\nweren\u2019t aware that the soldiers were going to \u2014 there was going to be a war. That was not -- but\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 14\nthey marched right by my house. I remember that. And waving to them and you know. It didn\u2019t\nlast, believe me.\nBut now comes September. We are back in school.",
        "A: Exactly, 38. And nothing much is happening and now we go right through until November\n10\". And we\u2019re in school and we went, as I said, home to lunch every day to Tante Olga, Lily\u2019s\nmom. And we\u2019re going to lunch and it is very cold. And we\u2019re getting there and the door is open\nand a window is open. Sometimes she used to open a window to air it out but always close it and\nall that. And we walked in and Lily calls mama. No answer. Again we\u2019re running through the\nhouse, mama, mama. Nobody there. And I\u2019m yelling Tante Olga where are you. We are home\nfor lunch. We only have half an hour. No answer. Lily and I look at each other. Something\u2019s not\nright. I said what do we do? She said I know the Tikler family here in town, another Jewish\nfamily. Why don\u2019t we go there? Something\u2019s happened. So ok we started going down the street,\nwhen all of a sudden across from us, we\u2019re walking straight and perpendicular comes what we\ncall the green Henry. It was a green police wagon. And in it is her father. And we see this and my\nuncle just waved goodby. And then we just were so scared. And we started running and we get to\nthe Tikler house and they\u2019re all women, no men gathered in that house. And we said to my aunt,\nand she said what happened. How come we didn\u2019t know where we were, where you were. She\nsaid I didn\u2019t have time. They came and chased me out. And they wouldn\u2019t even let me leave a\nnote or go get you so what is going on.\nWell nobody told us anything. The women were there and they were all very upset. An old\nwoman who was uh, and babies. I mean there must have been ten or 12 people. Where\u2019s my\nmother? We don\u2019t know. So I said I\u2019m going home. Oh you can\u2019t go alone. So Lily said P\u2019ll go\nwith you cause I will. You can\u2019t stop me now. Now I\u2019m getting independent. (laughs) So Lily\nand I start walking. And the distance was maybe a mile from where we were to my home. In\nWiesenfeld. We get about half way. I see a bicyclist coming towards us. There was minimal\ntraffic at that time. Nobody had a car, you know. It was, so here comes a bicycle rider. Even that\nwas a big deal. Come closer. Who is it? My mother. She said papa is in jail. Where\u2019s Eric?\nHe\u2019s in jail. Oh god. And uncle Isadore. We just saw him go by. They must have taken him to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 15\njail. What happened? A Jewish kid, my mother is saying. Come on, let\u2019s go. I\u2019m going to take\nyou back to the Tiklers. We\u2019re all going to be together. The story was and everybody has heard\nthe story. A Jewish kid killed a Nazi official and we\u2019re ok. Everybody paid I don\u2019t know how\nmany marks. Plus being in prison. So that\u2019s what that day was Kristal night. They took my\nfather into a jail in some other town, and my brother and they were sitting there and my mother.\nThey were taking my mother too. But my mother, if you want to know somebody feisty, she was,\nshe said you\u2019re not keeping me. You can shoot me first. You\u2019re not keeping me here. I got to go\nget my daughter. She didn\u2019t do anything. She\u2019s 11 years old. What. And they said ok, go, go,\ngo. So that\u2019s how she got out.\nSo we went back to the house and all the women. Uh, what are we going to and kvetching and\ncrying and my mother said. You know what. We don\u2019t have time for this. We better sit down\nhere and think about what to do. So perhaps we could find, she just made things up to keep them\nbusy, to get some clothes together. Or get whatever we need. Get some suitcases. Maybe do\nwhatever we have to do, even if the suitcases are empty. Just, you never know what we have to\ndo. And they said ok and they, I don\u2019t know what they did. But by that time things were coming\ntowards supper time. And my mother said now maybe we could find something to eat. Could\nmake a sandwich. Have some fruit. And so we all did that. They did that.\nAnd now it\u2019s getting later and later and now there 1s a banging on the door. Must have been\neight, nine o\u2019clock at night. Open. Open up. It\u2019s the Gestapo. So everybody is cowering. My\nmom close to the door and she said yes. And he said how many of you are there. And my mother\nsaid I don\u2019t know. And get out. So my mother said what do you mean get out. You get out in\nthe street all of you. Now. You can grab what you can and go and so people who had been\nfutzing around and looking for clothes. They had stuff and they had a coat and whatever we had.\nAnd we were on the street now. It\u2019s cold. Quite cold. My mother says what are you going to do\nwith us? We decided. There were three of them. You are going into that factory that\u2019s a few\nstreets, I don\u2019t recall where exactly. Was an empty factory. And they were going to put us in\nthere and we were to stay there. And this was a cement floor and nothing else.\nSo we get there and all of a sudden, my mother stops and she said to them, excuse me, sir. I\nwant to a, tell you something. And he said yes, what do you want? She said when we were\nyoung and I lived in that house where Lily lives now, and my aunt. I used to live here and you\nused to come to the back door and ask for me and when I came out, you tried to kiss me. And he\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 16\nsaid to her. Shut up. She said but you did. What if I spoke very loud and everybody would know\nthat you, a Nazi officer, kissed a Jewish girl. And he said if you don\u2019t shut up, I\u2019m going to send\nyou and the kid to Dachau. Meaning me. She said that\u2019s very good officer. You can send me\nand my kid but before you do, I\u2019m going to scream it all over this town that you tried to kiss a\nJewish girl. He said what the hell do you want? She said all I want 1s to take these people instead\nof putting us into the factory, to my home in Wiesenfeld. I have a big house and we can stay\nthere. And of course they argued. And they can\u2019t do that and who do you think you are. And she\nsaid ok, it\u2019s your choice but I can scream. And I thought he\u2019d shoot her right there.\nGo ahead, he says. Take them and go. I have to laugh at her. Cause she said but it\u2019s so cold. We\ncan\u2019t just walk. We\u2019ve got this old lady and a baby. And he just he was getting crazy, this man.\nAnd the other officials heard him say what does she want? She can\u2019t walk. She says I want a\ntruck and they said get her a damn truck. They got a truck. They loaded us on. They got us a\ndriver and they got us a bodyguard with a machine gun or whatever. And they drove us to my\nparents\u2019 house.\nSo she saved the day. Now it took some time to find out what happened to my aunts and uncles.\nAnd for my father to be released and in the meantime, while we were all mulling around in my\nbig house, my mother sent a telegram to a cousin we had here in the United States. My cousin. It\nwas my mother\u2019s niece who married an American physician. And this physician had gone to\nVienna years before in the 20s, to study at the University of Vienna. And",
        "A: Well he went to study, post graduate work at the University of Vienna and he met my cousin\nand they dated while he was there. And he was there about a year or so. And came back to the\nUnited States and sent her a telegram. Will you marry me? And she sent back yes. So he came\nback again and they were married. So lucky for us. Now she\u2019s in America, he\u2019s an American\ncitizen. And my mother sent them a telegram. Can you send us an affidavit. We got to have\nsomething because Hugo is in jail and Eric 1s 1n jail and they sent an affidavit to Eric. To get\nhim out first, my brother. Because they were really after the young men.\nSo they sent Eric an affidavit and to make a long story short, they let Eric out. And this was\nmaybe December now. Kristal night was November. So December. And he was able to get a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 17\nvisa and a passport to come to the United States and he came alone. And my cousins, they picked\nhim up and they took him in and they took care of him. Now \u2014",
        "A: Not in my father\u2019s store. No. I think he was a very well-known man and he helped a lot of\npeople. Not that it make any difference to some of them, but it did help. I\u2019m sure.",
        "A: So, I would recall it but no destruction. No it was I think there were a couple of people who\ncame to our door at midnight to see if they could help. Good people. Solid people. One woman\nwas my mother\u2019s washerwoman. And she risked her life to come to do whatever she could do.\nShe even brought bread. She thought we were starving. But before that I forgot to put this very\nimportant element in.\nRight after the Anschluss not much time passed when a Nazi officer came to my house. And I\nhappened to be \u2014 it was a two story house. And downstairs was the kitchen and a dining room.\nMy father\u2019s office, his business. Upstairs were bedrooms and a music room. And I had a baby\ngrand piano. And an old fashioned bathroom. We did not have running water. We had a\nbeautiful home but there was no running water yet. My mother wanted to institute that and\nhadn\u2019t gotten around to it and blah, blah, blah. So.\nThis Nazi officer came to the door and said -- I was alone. Where\u2019s your mother. And I said\nshe\u2019s upstairs. Take me. so I take him and I called her and I said, Mupik, somebody to see you.\nShe comes out. He says to her, where\u2019s your piano. She said, show me. so she shows him. It\nwill be taken within the hour. And my mother said, what? What do you mean, it\u2019ll be taken\nwithin the hour. He said don\u2019t you know yet, lady, that Jews are not allowed to have anything\nof value. And she is thinking that this 1s a joke. And he said now I\u2019m going to give you a\nchance. Make a decision. It\u2019s either you or the piano. They were going to take either the piano\nor they\u2019 Il take her. Now what do you do? Even when you are feisty. You can\u2019t stop that. So that\nwas I forgot all about that. It was at the very beginning.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 18",
        "A: Oh god yes.",
        "A: Crying.",
        "A: I was crying. But we still had the house until two weeks after that. They came again and they\nsaw my father. And they said to him you know that you cannot possess your house any longer.\nNo business, no nothing. I want you to sign an IOU. And my father said I\u2019m not signing\nanything. You, you what do you mean, my house. We are here to possess, to take possession of\nyour business. And your house. And my father said and what are we supposed to do. He said\nwell we\u2019re not evil people. We will allow you to live upstairs. So it took a while to straighten all\nthis out. It was awful. We had to move upstairs. And if we wanted to cook and eat, the bathroom\nhappened to have a stove where, for heating. So we had to cook on that. There was a bathtub in\nthere. Toilet was somewhere else. And we had to go buy our own groceries.\nAnd the house was no longer \u2014 he had to sign it over to the German regime. It wasn\u2019t Austria\nanymore. It was all German. So that\u2019s how we lost everything.",
        "A: My father was a very, he didn\u2019t, he coped with everything. I mean he thought things through\nand he \u2014 this is what is happening. Let\u2019s figure out what do we do now. And it was very difficult\nfor him of course, my god. So ok, now that\u2019s gone. Then later that was March, I think or, Hitler\ntook in March so you know as the weeks went by all this happened.\nSo then as I said, Kristal night, I already explained that. Papa is still sitting in jail.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 19",
        "A: Oh yeah because we knew it happened in every \u2014",
        "A: Well we had a radio.",
        "A: We were allowed to have the radio. So and the talk, calling on, I mean you can\u2019t just whisper\nthese things anymore. It\u2019s out now. And so we are now old enough to know what\u2019s going on.\nYou know and especially after Kristal night it was totally clear for Lily and me and her brothers\nthat nobody, they hate the Jews and god knows what\u2019s going to happen to us. So now comes the\naffidavit for Eric.\nNow he\u2019s allowed to go. What\u2019s going to happen to papa now? What\u2019s going to happen to us?\nSo Eric comes to the United States and he\u2019s being taken care of by the American physician and\nhis wife. And Eric 1s learning English and he gets himself a job. They lived in New York. So\nEric is in New York. Now Woodside, Long Island which is almost part of Manhattan. And\nsomebody from Europe told him that there is a guy in New Jersey and he works in a factory and\nhe used to know papa and Eric why don\u2019t you try to contact him and it worked. He contacted\nthis man and the man got Eric a job in that factory. In New Jersey. It wasn\u2019t all that bad to travel\nyou know, to commute but \u2014",
        "A: My father.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 20",
        "A: No, not, not what. I don\u2019t know what he was on. I can only tell you later what we were on.\nAnd \u2014",
        "A: So he takes the job and a man said to him Eric, you look a little bit depressed all the time.\nWhat\u2019s the matter? And he said \u2019'm worried about my parents and my sister. They are still over\nthere. And this man said to him, well why don\u2019t you write to President Roosevelt and tell him.\nAnd Eric said yeah, right. I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t even speak the language. I can\u2019t write and I\u2019m going to\ntell the president, hey you know. And this man said well you never know. And Eric said no I\u2019m\nnot going to do it. This man kept pushing. He said Eric you got to try things. And Eric finally\nsaid he got disgusted. He said ok already. Will you help me? And the man said Ill help you\nwrite the letter.\nSo Eric writes this letter. Dear Mr. President whatever my parents, my little sister. I\u2019m very\nworried. It\u2019s a terrible time. Sent it, forgets about it. Two, three weeks pass by. A letter comes\nfrom the office of the President. From his press secretary. Dr. Mr. Wellisch, the president has\nbeen made aware of your situation and has directed me to tell you what to do and how you can\nget your parents out. And it had to be a farmer\u2019s visa because the United States had a quota,\ndidn\u2019t let everybody in.\nBut if you were, knew anything about agriculture, you had a chance. Luckily my father owned a\nfarm. I\u2019ve got pictures over there. I can show you later. He owned the farm right in Wiesenfeld.\nIt was a big farm. He owned it but he didn\u2019t run it. Somebody else who ran it, but papa was the\nkind of man who was well informed about everything. He owned the farm. He knew about\nfarming.\nHe knew about lumber and everything that he did, he was well informed about you know.\nSo my brother was able to communicate to papa to apply for a farmer\u2019s visa. To make a long\nstory short, he got it, but it took from January or February until the end of August for us to get\nout. We lived under the Hitler regime for a long, long time and things were getting harder and\nharder. But he did get the farmer\u2019s visa. And he was able to have enough money to have\ntransportation for us to come to the United States and the ship we were on was called the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 21\nVolendam. So in August of 28\" we arrived in New York and this was about a week before\nPoland was invaded when that was it. Nobody got out.",
        "A: We weren\u2019t allowed to do anything. I mean we were just sitting tight. My father was allowed\nthough to go to different offices to try to get the visa. He had to do that. And you have to get a\npassport. And you have to get stuff together to, what are you allowed to take out. What are you\nnot allowed to take? That kind of stuff. That he was allowed to do, to go to Vienna and do that.\nBut other than that, nothing. I mean \u2014",
        "A: Well he must have been from Kristal night, November tenth. I don\u2019t know. About a month or\n\u2014 yeah.",
        "A: Well I couldn\u2019t play with anybody. As far as a child is concerned. I was able to go to Lily you\nknow and we could be together. She was with us anyway. They were in my house until all these\npeople that my mother rescued kept us busy because there were a lot of people to feed and the\nbedding and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. In different bedrooms. My grandmother lived with us so she, and she had died. But\nwe were able to use her \u2014 she lived in. She had a kitchen and two or three bedrooms and so we\nwere able to put these people in there. And my parents\u2019 bedroom, my bedroom. Had lovely\nmusic room. Everything was used. And we left them there.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 22",
        "A: Not there, in this town. There was nothing except where my brother was in that city, in St.\nPolten, there were signs on the benches around the schools. No Jews allowed. They couldn\u2019t sit\nthere. And my uncle, the one whom I told you we saw in that green wagon, he was taken to\nVienna to scrub the sidewalk with a toothbrush. You\u2019ve heard about those things. So he was one\nof them. But he made it. Now the sad part is that after we were here already, we were very\nconcerned about the rest of the family. Especially and Lily, I was worried more about Lily. We\nwere like sisters. And the edict more or less was that the Nazis were after the men and the young\nboys. And so my uncle and my, Lily\u2019s older brother were able to get out through some Jewish\norganization here. I don\u2019t remember which one. And they left Austria. They left Wiesenfeld\nwhere they were in my house. And came to the United States and my uncle thought he could get\nhis wife and Lily and Otto out. And never made it. So he\u2019s here with his son and with the guilt.\nWhy did I do this? And you know how you can, my cousin is still living in St. Louis. Lily\u2019s older\nbrother. He is ok but another, there are so many stories attached to what I am telling you. It\nwould take me all day.",
        "A: When it was time to leave I said nothing. My father told me to be very quiet. We are leaving\nmidnight on a train that we didn\u2019t have a school in Wiesenfeld but we had a train station which\nto this day doesn\u2019t make any sense. We were going to take the train to Vienna and from Vienna\nwe were going to Holland. And I\u2019m not to say anything to anybody. It was too dangerous. So \u2014",
        "A: Ah, we had a few things we were allowed to take. At that time it was still not as bad as later\non. I mean ridiculous to even mention it cause nobody lived anymore. But we could take our\nclothing and my mother had some silver spoons and she had that in her suitcase and that was ok\nand this necklace. That\u2019s hers. That was my grandmother\u2019s. Now I don\u2019t remember how she got\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 23\nthat out, but that and nothing else. As far as jewelry is concerned because one day the Nazi came\nin and asked again where is your mother? And my mother is \u2014 where is your jewelry? It\u2019s in the\ndrawer wherever. Open it. She opens it and he goes through it and he finds her engagement ring\nwhich was a gorgeous ring. An emerald surrounded by diamonds. Ah, ok, in the pocket. And I\nhad a little ruby that I loved. Oh, is that the kid\u2019s? Oh that\u2019s mine. Yes. Oh, ok. That kind of\nthing so but papa said you know that\u2019s not the worst. We\u2019re getting out now so when we did get\nout, this was in the dead of night in August. And I couldn\u2019t say anything and I was pretty upset\nabout that. But we \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, we took books. My mother\u2019s, she had a beautiful library and she packed them in some\nkind of box and I don\u2019t know. I guess of all things you know but when you\u2019re in the situation\nlike this you want to take something that \u2014",
        "A: No couldn\u2019t take anything. Mm, mm not that. Mostly clothing and no linens. Nothing.\nMostly clothing and a few odds and ends.",
        "A: Well now this is another story.",
        "A: Took the train to Vienna and my father\u2019s aunt was there at the train station. And I don\u2019t\nremember much about anybody else but she was there because she was my very favorite aunt.\nAnd she hugged me and she said you should be very happy. You know why. I said why should I\nbe so happy? She said not only because you\u2019re getting away from here but because you won\u2019t\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 24\nhave to go to school on Saturday in America. (laughs) and we cried and she said my darling I\ndon\u2019t think I'll ever see you again. And I never did.\nSo we got on that train. When we get to the border the Gestapo comes on. Checking papers.\nCome to papa. Papers, passport, takes the papers, walks away and brings another officer and says\nthere\u2019s something wrong here. Get off the train. Take the kid, take your wife. Get off. We had\nto get off. The train goes away. That was hell. They took my father into an office and they told\nmy mother and me to sit and wait and we sit and we wait. And train after train is coming and\ngoing. Our train long gone. No Papa. Now what.\nI said to my mother I think we\u2019re going to die. And she pushed and she said we are not dying. I,\nif I have anything to do with these guys we (laughs). They could have killed her more than once.\nShe had a mouth and I mean it was about three or four hours later when Papa came out. We can\ngo. What happened? They did not believe that he knew anything about farming. Because he was\na businessman. And they brought in a knowledgeable agricultural expert who grilled him for\ntwo hours about cows and milk and what have you. And Papa thank God, he knew the answers.\nHe was well informed about everything. And they finally had to, well they didn\u2019t have to let him\ngo but they let him go.\nSo we got on the next train and went to Rotterdam. And they met the Jewish committees and\neven the Dutch people. They met every train coming from Germany. And they put us up in\nprivate homes, in hotels. Wherever there was room and we were put up. At first I think it was a\nhotel. We didn\u2019t stay long because the ship was leaving anyway but they treated us like royalty.\nThey were so kind, the Dutch people. And when we did finally get on that ship it was of course,\nthe Volendam, a Dutch ship, Dutch crew and they treated the immigrants beautifully. And I\nremember having to eat brick ice cream three times a day. They brought this ice cream. And to\nthis day if you show me brick ice cream I will ugh. (laughs) And we got here \u2014",
        "A: Well you know when, I was distracted a lot. First of all you get into Holland. You meet all the\n-- another country. You\u2019re going to a hotel. So much distraction. But then it hit me. What\u2019s\nhappening? What, what, am I ever going to go home again? What\u2019s going to happen to Lily?\nLily, Lily, Lily. And all my other relatives. Lily was killed with Otto and my aunts in the 40s.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 25\nIn Sobibor or someplace like that. Shot in the mass grave. And other people. Horrible stories that\nmy family suffered like so many others.\nSo anyway, this is interesting. We come on the Volendam, right. Took us I think almost two\nweeks because we found out later from the captain that the ocean was mined. And he was trying\nto figure out what the best \u2014 where would the Germans not put a mine. So that\u2019s why, luckily\nyou know we avoided that. The Volendam went from New York to I believe Cuba with some\nrefugees. Dropped them off. Went back. And that\u2019s all I ever knew. And after I was here and\nmarried already, my brother in law took us to a very fancy restaurant in New York. It was some\nkind of celebration and he took my husband and me and he and his wife and, and each table\nalmost had their own waiter. It was a bit much. They come and put the napkin on your lap and\nthe, and I\u2019m not you know, and this one waiter said, spoke with an accent. And he was very nice\nand very courteous and I said so where are you from. And he said I\u2019m from Holland and I said\nyou know your people are wonderful. And he said oh madam, do you know anything about\nHolland? And I said well Pll just tell you briefly. We came from Austria through Germany. And\nyour people helped us and he said oh yes. He said may I ask you what ship. And I said the\nVolendam. And he said oh, almost like Oh. I said are you ok? And he said at that time I was a\ncrew member on the Volendam. And we had a trip to Cuba and on the way back we hit a mine\nand all my crew members died. I am one of the very few survivors.\nAnd I said I think that\u2019s the end of my dinner. I can\u2019t, can you \u2014 That was quite a \u2014 so that was\none of the stories that made me very sad but I said I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re alive so. He had tears in\nhis eyes and he walked away.",
        "A: Or the Jewish, what else is there? What, we had so many organizations.",
        "A: Well I tell you, the first impression, seeing the skyscrapers was \u2014 I said this cannot be. This 1s,\nI come from this little town in Wiesenfeld. Vienna is gorgeous. Have you ever been? It\u2019s a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 26\nbeautiful city. It doesn\u2019t have, it has some now though. But this is ridiculous. (laughs) So I was\nvery impressed you know but very, my English was minimal. I did have English in school. But\nyeah, it\u2019s difficult when you\u2019re in the country and you try to converse with people. You don\u2019t\nunderstand because it\u2019s, you think, why do they talk so fast. But I had to go to school. And I was\nadmitted to first, to sixth grade. Now here I am 13 now. So I am the oldest in the classroom. And\nthe children were very nice to me. And the teacher explained \u2014 her name was Mrs. Sacks, a\nJewish lady, that Trudy has just come from another country and she was trying to put a little\nhistory in there to tell the kids why this is happening. Why I\u2019m here. And they were listening\nand very polite and very sweet and can I help you and all that.\nSo the teacher said you don\u2019t have to do anything, to me. Just listen to the language. And I\u2019m\nlistening and I guess I\u2019m learning. And three months passed by and she said we\u2019re having a\nvocabulary test today. We\u2019re going to have a hundred words and I raised my hand and she said\nyes. I said could I try it. And she said yes. I got a hundred. And the next day this was after she\ncomes in and she said, I have an announcement to make, class. We had this vocabulary test\nyesterday and I want you to know that Trudy got one hundred percent and they all stood up and\nthat made me and that was America, my goodness. Whereas in Europe you have to sit quietly\nand most of the time you have your hands on the table and, and you don\u2019t say a word and you\ndon\u2019t, and here the children got up and celebrating this. I thought America is wonderful.",
        "A: Woodside. And then I skipped sixth grade and went to seventh grade. And I was in seventh\ngrade for a few months. I don\u2019t remember how long. And I skipped to eighth grade. And then I\nmoved to New Jersey with my parents. And both my parents worked in factories and had a little\nroom. I couldn\u2019t live with them. They had no room. I lived with my cousins. The ones who\nbrought me. I stayed with them for oh a year or two. Well while my parents were looking for\nwork. Oh boy it was hard. So they only had one room.",
        "A: No more.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 27",
        "A: Once I left \u2014",
        "A: No, nope, nope, no. So at any rate, then my parents were able to get a little apartment. One\nbedroom and they got a couch so I could sleep in the living room.",
        "A: Let\u2019s see now. My brother, this was already, oh. My brother, he got a job after the factory in\na tobacco, on a tobacco farm and he worked there in the summer. And again somebody said to\nhim, Eric you seem like a smart guy. You want to do this for the rest of your life? And Eric said\nno I don\u2019t want to do it but right now I don\u2019t have much of a choice. And this man said did you\nknow that about Johns Hopkins 1s giving out scholarships and Eric said so what? And this man\nsaid you are smart. You ought to try it. Again, the same thing. The way he spoke about\nRoosevelt. Oh he says, don\u2019t be ridiculous. To make a long story short, he applied and he got it.\nGot a scholarship to Hopkins. Came for an interview and the dean, whoever interviews, said we\nhave these two scholarships, specifically for immigrants.\nSo that\u2019s the good news. You are definitely in. You want to hear the bad news. And Eric\nthought oh God. You know I\u2019ve had enough bad news but what\u2019s the bad. He said you have to\ndo it in three years, not four. And Eric said so what. That\u2019s not bad news. I can do that. So he\nsaid to him, if you think you can do it in three years, you\u2019re in. What would you like to study?\nAnd Eric said law. Man leans back. He said Eric, I don\u2019t think so. You have such an accent\nyou ll never make it as a lawyer. Pick something else. So Eric said well ok, Pll be a chemist.\nThat\u2019s what he became. Went right through Hopkins in three years. The war came. He enlisted.\nThen he came back and went to Columbia, got a masters. And then Purdue and got a PhD so\nworks out ok.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 28\nGail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Trudy Schonberger. This is track number two and you just finished talking about\nyour brother so let\u2019s get back to your story. You\u2019re in high school now.\nTrudy Schonberger: I\u2019m in high school in New Jersey. It\u2019s a breeze. I loved it. And now I\u2019m\ngraduating. And I\u2019m graduating with honors and I was very happy about that. Now what do I\ndo?",
        "A: Well they knew. You know I had an accent and how come and I did tell them some. I didn\u2019t\ntell them all that, you know but they knew and they learned some from teachers, but not enough.\nIt wasn\u2019t taught.",
        "A: Not too great. We had more fun with that.",
        "A: Yes. My father\u2019s English was better than my mother\u2019s. Oral English. My mother was, her\nwriting English was better than my father\u2019s. So they\u2019d always have a repartee. You see, I can do\nbetter than you and so that was funny. And he said to her one day, you know Irene, they have a\ngood, your favorite pie downstairs in the bakery. I can\u2019t think of the name, but you know what\nyour favorite pie is. And she said oh why didn\u2019t you bring me one? I didn\u2019t have money with me.\nGo down. You can get it. She goes down, comes back. No pie. What happened? They said they\nnever heard of it. And my father said, what do you mean they never heard of it? What did you\nask them for? She said I asked them for a merchant marine pie and they never heard of it. What\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 29\nit was, was lemon meringue but it was war time and she got confused. (laughs) That\u2019s the\nEnglish.",
        "A: I\u2019m graduating. Now what do I do. My parents working in the factory. We just about made it\nto pay the rent and live. Now what. And I always wanted to do something in medicine. And it\nmay be the influence of the physician who brought us over because he was a wonderful person\nand a wonderful doctor. So I suppose he had this influence of what I wanted to be.",
        "A: Leo Lefkowitz. And he was in the war too. Oh god, that\u2019s another story Ill tell you.\nAnyway that was, what could I possibly be? So papa said you know what. Maybe you can just\nfind a job for the summertime and we\u2019|l discuss it and see what you can do. You know you\nshould really be a typist. I said I don\u2019t want to be a typist. Yes, that\u2019s good for a girl. You know\nyou, I don\u2019t want to be a typist. I hate typing and I hate paperwork. Get a job in the summer,\nwhatever. What happened was friends of my parents were neighbors of a couple who had two\nchildren and they needed a babysitter living in for the summer. Do you want to do this? And I\nsaid I like kids. She said, why don\u2019t you \u2014 I will call them. Maybe they\u2019Il have you for an\ninterview. I went for the interview. I got the job. She had to go for surgery and she needed\nsomebody to be with the two little ones. And as she is recovering, he said to me, his name was\nDr. Dan Moore. What, he said you and I haven\u2019t talked about you at all. He said to me what do\nyou want to do now? The job is almost over here with us. What? I said I don\u2019t know. What are\nyou interested in? I said oh I don\u2019t know. Something in medicine. I just, I don\u2019t want to be a\nnurse. And he said to me, do you know what I do? And I said no, not really. He said \u2019'm a\nbiophysicist. And I have a laboratory in Columbia University right across the bridge. They lived\nin Leonia, New Jersey which 1s you\u2019ve heard of Fort Lee recently. Next door.\nHe said would you like to see my laboratory. And I said oh yes. So he said to his wife. \u2019m\ngoing to take Trudy and I\u2019m just going to show her around. And she was lovely.

And I was so impressed with this whole thing and going to a\nbig laboratory. What, he said, I do, I do some research in an area called electrophoresis. And he\nsaid of course you don\u2019t know what it is because it\u2019s so new to all of us and it is the separation of\nproteins in the blood, to study proteins, cause there wasn\u2019t too much known. And I thought well\nok, you know. Then he said to me, how would you like to work for me? He said I cannot pay\nyou but I\u2019d like you to learn. And I almost fell over. I said Dr. Moore, I do have to speak to my\nparents about this. I\u2019m 18 years old and I don\u2019t want to make \u2014 this is just too much to\ncomprehend.

You won\u2019t make any money but we\u2019ll figure it out. We\u2019ll give you money\nfor the subway and the bus and we\u2019ll feed you and see what happens. That\u2019s how I got the job.\nAnd about six months or so later, he said I can pay you a little bit. So he started paying me $50 a\nmonth. I thought oh it 1s fantastic. But there is a hang up here. Uh oh. I think you should go to\nschool. Oy. What, what, what I don\u2019t have any money. He said I\u2019m going to give you a day off\na week and you can go downtown and start taking courses at Columbia. He gave me a day a\nweek and I started taking physics of all things. I thought I must be crazy because he was a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 31\nbiophysicist. So I took physics and as time went on chemistry and more and more stuff. And he\nstarted to pay me more and more.\nAnd then in 1947 I got married. And they came to my wedding and I learned a lot. So I thought\nI was the luckiest girl in the world.

And her husband\nwas my mother\u2019s cousin so that\u2019s a little \u2014 Kristal night. His name was Richard. And he was\ntaken away and sent to Dachau. And she was left alone with her baby. In Vienna. And the Nazis\nsaid to her, if you can get yourself out of here, I\u2019ll let him out and he can go with you. Let\u2019s get\nhim out. And so she starts going from one embassy to another embassy. Ends up at the Bolivian\nembassy, gets permission and they really let him out. It\u2019s now a few days before departure and\nthe kid gets scarlet fever and they can\u2019t go. So now you start this whole thing again. But she\nwas smart. She said I might as well go to the Bolivian embassy and tell them what has happened.\nMaybe they\u2019ll \u2014 and they did. But it took time. You know everything takes time. In the\nmeantime the Nazis come and take this and finally they\u2019re able to go by ship to Cochabamba\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 33\nwhich is the second largest city in Bolivia. They get there. I don\u2019t know how long it took. Heinz,\nthe little boy, who is now 76, still living in Vienna, whom I saw a few years ago, so they\u2019re on\nthat ship and they\u2019re getting to Cochabamba and it\u2019s on the weekend. And Richard says I do not\nfeel well. And all the immigrants are in that camp. That\u2019s where the refugees had to go to an\nimmigration center. And they said oh that happens all the time because the altitude is very\ndifficult on people. You'll be ok.\nRichard wasn\u2019t ok. He got worse, but there was no doctor available on the weekend. He had to\nwait until Monday and he\u2019s getting a fever and a lot of pain. Finally Monday comes. Richard\ncan\u2019t talk anymore, he\u2019s in so much pain. The doctor says you have a burst appendix. We\u2019ve\ngot to go quick. They get him to the hospital, put him on the table and he died. So she can\u2019t get\nout with the little boy. She didn\u2019t know what to do and that\u2019s where my father\u2019s communication\nbegan. At least to somebody. She had no idea what happened to any, any of the family. Until\nmuch later on we found out. Eric found out. My cousins, they were all in Theresienstadt, most\nof them. And Eric found her. This is my Aunt Elsa, the one who met me at the train station, said\nyou don\u2019t have to, her daughter was in Theresienstadt, survived and but she was deathly ill. And\nEric found her, found her in Vienna, after and saw how sick she was. She had TB. She had\nkidney disease. She had, you name it. And he arranged it for her to go to a sanatorium in\nSwitzerland. Until she got well. So he was able to save her and her husband whom she met in\nTheresienstadt. He was a roofer. His name was Alexander Bernot. He was in Theresienstadt and\nhe saw Anna scrounging around for some food and they got a little bit. He tried to help her. He\nwas a roofer in Vienna. He did most of the roofs of the big, like St. Stephen\u2019s and he was \u2014 and\nso the Nazis used him to fix the roof here and there. They didn\u2019t care if the water dripped down\non the inmates, but they wanted their roofs to be free from rainwater and all that. So he did that\nso he had a little access to more things. And then the rumor came that the war 1s coming to an\nend and Americans or British bombers are going to bomb.\nSo the inmates said so now we\u2019re going to, we survived this. Now we\u2019re going to get killed by \u2014\nhe climbed up on the roof of the barracks, with red paint. And he painted red crosses on the\nroofs. If he had been caught he would have been dead. But the thing was that some of these\nroofs leaked and the red paint dripped on some of the prisoners. They had no way to get rid of it\nand some of the Nazis saw them and they thought they had some kind of terrible disease. They\nran. (laughs)\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 34",

        "A: Susie my daughter and my son in law.",
        "A: Like I mean I came here visiting all the time you know. And then when it was time, after my\nmother died, they -- 1t\u2019s too much. I had this house. Three bedrooms and dining room and\nbasement, the living room. Oh too much. All alone. Who needs it?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Well I love Vienna the city. But feeling, I could not live here. And I met, they had a reunion\nfor me. My, the children I went to school with when I was eight years old. We had a reunion. I\ndidn\u2019t recognize any \u2014 one I recognized and she had been corresponding. She is the one who set\nit up, but I didn\u2019t know the rest, except for this young man who\u2019s now 88, who lived across the\nstreet from us. And we were always together. We were in school and I always liked him you\nknow. And he said we should meet again in Vienna as long as you were here. And well, the very\nfirst time, before the \u2014 I was going to the reunion but he left a message with my cousin, the one\nmy brother rescued that I should call him. So I called and he\u2019s very, very not rigid but precise\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 44\nyou know. The timing. I would like to meet you for breakfast tomorrow at nine AM at such and\nsuch you know. So I said ok. He came with a dozen yellow roses, handsome as can be and that\nwas the first time I\u2019ve seen him. He was a, an American POW, served in the German army and\ntold me he had to join the Nazi party because they all did. Most of the men and women. But\nbecause he desperately wanted a university education. So he became what is equivalent here to\nthe Secretary of our Interior. That\u2019s what he was in Austria. So that\u2019s nice.",
        "A: I do.",
        "A: Nothing they can give us can make up for what was done to any of us. And I feel we deserve\nit. [have no qualms. They took away everything. They took away my education that I could have\nhad. They took away my home. They took away life. Not my personal life, but life. Yeah.\nAnd I don\u2019t know how other people feel but I have no qualms about it. And if they paid me\nmillions of dollars, they would not bring back Lily. Or Tante Elsa or Tante Olga or any of them.\nUncle Ludwig, who was a jolly, jolly man. Always had a good sense of humor. Loved kids,\nnever had any of his own. Was sent to Dachau. Came back a broken man. And one day he went\ndownstairs. He never left his seat, didn\u2019t want to go anywhere, do anything and his brother my\nuncle Isadore was coming to visit him and all of a sudden he says to his wife, let\u2019s go meet him\ndownstairs and she thought he\u2019s snapping out of it. Oh yeah. So he says to her. You wait at the\nfront door and Ill go to the back door. Fine. Never saw him again. She\u2019s standing at the door.\nHe\u2019s never coming. They found his coat on the edge, on the banks of the Danube. Now what,\ndoes it take a genius to figure out what, he just couldn\u2019t take it. What did they do to him? So\nshould you not be angry? But you can\u2019t live it all the time, you know. It would make you do\nsomething to myself. I wouldn\u2019t be a good mother. I wouldn\u2019t be a good grandmother. You can\u2019t\nlive that way. But I think about it almost every day about some aspect.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 45",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Good way to put it. It\u2019s difficult. I don\u2019t know how other people \u2014 well Erica,\nthe woman I was telling you about who lives here, who wrote a book. She was sent to Scotland,\nto a convent. Her parents, her parents converted to Catholicism. Gordish ga\u2019al fin [ph]. They\ndied. I don\u2019t know where. They tried to save her so I guess. She didn\u2019t know she was Jewish\nuntil she came to America, 20 years later. Her aunt. She had a cross on her bedpost and her aunt\ncame in and said Erica what is this. She said mother superior gave it to me or whatever. And she\nsaid but we don\u2019t have a cross and Erica said why not? She said because you\u2019re Jewish. And\nErica said, what? \u2019'm Catholic. She hasn\u2019t really been able to deal with it, yet.",
        "A: No, I\u2019m comfortable with everybody but I understand.",
        "A: Yes, you do feel a greater connection, of course cause you feel that you know what\u2019s your\nstory. What happened? And how did you deal with it? But I haven\u2019t felt that until now, until I\u2019m\nin Ryderwood. I met three other people and we have lunch together and you can\u2019t help it you\nknow. But I feel comfortable with, well I feel comfortable with just about anybody. I don\u2019t have\ntrouble making friends.",
        "A: Everything.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 46",
        "A: Not really active but I contribute to what I can. I support it whole heartedly, whole heartedly.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It could. Maybe not the way we knew it as, to the Jews, but it\u2019s happening everywhere. It\u2019s\nhappening. Look what they\u2019re doing in Iraq and in Syria and \u2014 it\u2019s happening.",
        "A: Perhaps, but how would I know. How, how can you \u2014",
        "A: It, I don\u2019t know if that, I was pretty much overprotected I think when I was growing up. I\ndon\u2019t think you know I think I was more independent, became more independent when I was\ndivorced. I had to \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, my husband didn\u2019t allow that which was a good thing and they\u2019re very independent.\nLook at Steven, schleps himself to Israel and jumps out of airplanes. (laughs) And Susan opened\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 16, 2014 47\nup her own practice in acupuncture and massage and all that right down the road on 29. Right\nabove, you know where Trader Joe is. Right upstairs. They\u2019re very independent.",
        "A: Well the only message 1s to tell them to live well and to be kind to all people. And I don\u2019t\nthink they need to hear that from me. And that I just love them very much. And they, and to read\nmy story in case you forget, which one of my grandsons typed out for me. I have no complaints\nabout the family, thank goodness you know. So I guess sometimes things turn out 1n the end,\ndon\u2019t they? Anything else I didn\u2019t answer?",
        "A: Take those pictures. See those pictures. It\u2019s just a little, it helps to put it in your head.",
