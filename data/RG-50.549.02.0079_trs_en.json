This is an interview with Dora Klayman conducted by Neenah Ellis on\nApril 26\", 2004, in Chevy Chase, Maryland. This interview is part of the United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum\u2019s post Holocaust interview project, and it\u2019s a\nKlayman in 2002. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully\nacknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape\nnumber one, side A. Dora, maybe you could start here. We ended your video\ninterview with your marriage, more or less, and we showed some photographs of all\nthe family members who came.",
        "Answer: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Can you talk some about that day and what -- what was your -- what were -- what\nwere your expectations? What did you think your future was going to be when you\ngot married?",
        "A: Wow. It was a very strange way that -- that I got married, to begin with, and I\ndon\u2019t remember how much time I had to talk about that. But I mentioned at that time\nthat I met my husband a year before, and we met on the train. All that was there, I\nthink. And so I haven\u2019t actually seen him prior to that, for a whole year. Prior to the\nwedding, I mean. For a whole year. He came two weeks before our wedding. And I\nhad never in my life seen a Jewish wedding, and I have never -- so I really didn't\nknow exactly what was going to happen. And very differently from weddings that\nI\u2019m witnessing now, including my sons. It never even occurred to me to think about\narranging for anything or thinking about anything except my dress. That was about\nthe only thing I thought about. And everything else I sort of just let be. It\u2019s like\nsomebody -- was somebody else\u2019s thing to do it, a sort of -- sort of like I was going\nto a party, and my col -- main -- my -- my main concern was to think about, you\nknow, Dan\u2019s coming and how 1s that going to be? Am I st -- am I truly, really in love\nor am I just making things up? Am I just bored in Switzerland, or unhappy in\nSwitzerland or lonely? Because, of course, I had come there only -- less than a year\nbefore and I'd left all my friends behind in -- in Croatia and Yugoslavia. Had a\nboyfriend whom I, you know, forgot the minute I got on the train. Obviously it\nwasn\u2019t a very serious thing. And I lived a totally, totally different life in Switzerland\nthan I had ever thought I would live. I mean, not only did I not know about Jewish\nweddings, I didn\u2019t know anything about Jewish period. And you know, I knew very\nlittle on -- my experience was one month in Switzerland before that, and I -- you\nknow, a few years before that. So everything was sort of going to [indecipherable]\nplus I was going to meet my aunt and uncle, who were coming in from Switzerland -\n- from -- I\u2019m sorry, from Israel, and I had never seen them as a adult.",
        "Q: Which aunt and uncle was this?",
        "A: That\u2019s my father\u2019s brother and my father\u2019s sister, both of whom decided to come\nin for my wedding. And so there were so many different things. I mean, I have -- I-I\nhave -- I had very little -- almost no contact with them. My aunt, of course, I didn't\neven see a -- at all after the war. I only had pictures, I knew she existed. My father\u2019s\nsister.",
        "Q: Can you say their names?",
        "A: Lina. That was Lina who married a wi -- a Weesler, and I knew that she had two\nchildren and I had the -- I had the daughter\u2019s photograph with me when I was living\nin -- in Yugoslavia. Her photograph was left because was -- had been sent to my\nmaternal grandparents, must be. I don\u2019t know how I got that photograph. And it was\nshe as a child, and it\u2019s a beautiful little girl with -- and she\u2019s holding a gorgeous doll.\nAnd I had that after the war. And it was sort of like all -- like looking at Shirley\nTemple, like a movie star or something, because we didn\u2019t have such dolls or such\nclothes or such anything. So that was -- that -- that was my only image of -- of this\naunt with this daughter, my dau -- my cousin Dina who now lives in Israel. And her -\n- her -- she had a brother, Rubin, whom -- whose picture I did not have and I -- he\nalso now lives in Israel and of course, we now we know -- know each other. So -- so\nmy aunt was coming. And then my uncle was coming, whom I last saw, I think as a\nseven or eight year old in Yugoslavia, because he came back from the prisoner of\nwar camps -- camp. He was in Germany during the war. He was in the Yugoslav\narmy when the war started and so he -- he was -- he survived as a prisoner of war, he\ncame back. He married a woman he met there in Yugoslavia, I think he may have\nknown her from before. She and her three sisters had all together survived\nAuschwitz. Oh, it\u2019s a unbelievable story which I can\u2019t get her to talk about on tape,\nwhich I wish I could. They now live in Israel. But at that time he came -- he came,\nhe found me in Ludbreg where I was living during the war, and he -- I remember that\nhe -- he tried to talk to me about going with him, and I refused to go. I remem -- sort\nof remember that conversation. I -- I -- I had that memory, and of course he left me a\npicture, which I have, which you know, beautiful handwriting says, this is a -- in\nmemor -- to remember him by. And he\u2019s wearing his army uniform. So, all of a\nsudden this aunt and uncle were going to come to the wedding. So that was going to\nbe that. And of course my m -- my future mother-in-law was coming with my\nhusband on the boat. And her brother, who is -- who survived the war -- actually th -\n- my husband\u2019s family left -- left Russia actually mol -- Moldavia -- Moldova in the\nearly 1900\u2019s, but this brother went to -- to France rather than to the States. And he\nremained in Paris studying medicine. As a physician went to Oran, to al -- Algeria,\nmarried there, had one child. And during the conflict in Algeria with the liberation of\nAlgeria from France, they came to live in Marseille. And they had a -- at the time of\nmy marriage, they had a 13 year old -- 12 year old son. So they were coming to the\nwedding as well, and my brother-in-law, whom I| had met bef -- before he came to\nvisit me one time in Switzerland. And everybody, of course, had waited for my\nbrother-in-law Leon to -- to inform everyone, you know, who is this person that my\nhusband was getting -- my future husband was getting ready to marry. And Leon is,\nyou know, he\u2019s darling, he\u2019s here all the time, we are very close now. But a -- he\nwasn\u2019t very -- there\u2019s a big joke that at the time he only wrote to them, keep smiling.\nThat\u2019s about what he sent to New York. And we had a good time, you know, we --\nwe -- when he came to visit, which was -- it would be before the wedding. And you\nknow, we -- we rowed the boat and sang row, row, row the boat on Lake Geneva,\nand had a good time. But he -- he didn't tell me -- I mean, he was telling me things\nabout Dan, but it was -- my future husband, but it was like, you know, sort of. So I\nhad to de -- still depend on my letters, so he didn't -- wasn\u2019t very explicit. So -- and\nthen of course -- so all these people were coming, and -- and Dan was coming two\nweeks ahead of time. And I think my -- so my wedding memories really go back to -\n- mostly to that day when he arrived.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And getting ready for his arrival.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And that was more important than the wedding itself. And that looms sort of large\nin terms of preparation and anxiety and -- and what was I going to wear and what\nwas -- what was I going to look like and what he looked like and do I remember him,\netcetera, etcetera, etcetera.",
        "Q: It had been a whole year since you\u2019d seen him, wow.",
        "A: Yes, almost, not quite. Yeah, we -- we met in the fall of the previous year. And\nthis was -- yeah, it was almost a year, it was July 15\" -- I\u2019m sorry, August 15\" that\nhe arrived. We were married September one. So my aunt, who now lives in Israel,\nthe one who just recently did this interview with us. She remembers every single\ndetail and tells it over and over and over again. She sort of lived through that with\nme. And this was -- this was one sort of aspect also of the wedding, is that she -- she\nwas very lonely in -- in Switzerland. She was married to my uncle, my brother\u2019s --\nmy brother\u2019s ha -- I\u2019m sorry, my hu -- my father\u2019s brother. That was Yoshi and she\u2019s\nMonda. Monda and Yoshi survived Bergen-Belsen and ended up in Switzerland and\nhad two children there. They lived from the beginning from hand to mouth, 1n fact\nthey were in those camps, the relocation camps. And Monda got incredibly -- I don\u2019t\nknow, I think I should say traumatized by the experience more-so than any of my\nother relatives. And her whole family except for her sister was killed in -- in --\nduring the war, and she found herself now in this new country without a language,\nwithout any means and -- and having these children, and she became -- basically she\n-- she -- she spent all her time cleaning and cooking and just taking care and cleaning\nto the extent of being really beyond no-normal cleaning. I mean, to sacrificing any\nkind of -- much social contact. And they lived in this very closed Orthodox Jewish\ncommunity, where she didn\u2019t have true, true, good friends. And she tells me the\nstory that even my arrival was a sort of like they -- you know, they were wondering,\nyou know, how is this going to be, they didn't have much money. And how was this\ngoing to be, you know, they have to support another person. And I was going to the\nuniversity and I needed a bit of money for -- for tuition and for travel, because I --\nthey were in Montre and I had to travel to University of Lausanne by train. And they\nwere able to get a little scholarship for me from the Jewish community. But it was a\nvery close community. And what she found, and I\u2019m telling you what she says to\nme, what she found that -- that I became her best friend. Because at that point I was\n19 and she was 30 some -- could figure out how old she was, but I can\u2019t remember it\nnow. Anyway -- and when she found out that I had met my husband -- I mean my\nfuture husband on the train and when the letters arrived, she went through that\ncourtship with me, and almost sort of vicariously lived through that. And so when\nthe day came of the -- of the wa -- I mean, she remembers in detail what I said to her\nabout, you know, when he proposed and -- and you know, where she was sitting. She\nwas sitting in the -- she was working in the bathroom, cleaning something and I\ncame and -- and told her and just exactly what I told her, you know, and so it was\nlike a big thing for her, bigger than it was for me. I was like, yeah, I\u2019m getting\nmarried. Sort of a crazy 19 year old, 20 year old --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- by that point. So that I think, you know, she remembers in detail about -- and\ntells me all over again about, you know, my going to -- to get Dan at the -- at the\ntrain station, you know, wearing a -- a two piece blue dress with, you know, that was\n-- that was perfectly ironed and my nails were perfectly done, etcetera, etcetera. And\nit\u2019s funny because -- and of course, I think I told on the other tape that one of the --\nanyhow, I don\u2019t know, that -- that one of the nice things that my uncle had done for\nme is that before Dan came and I met him again, my uncle said, you know, the\nwedding is all arranged for, which was fine with me, I hadn\u2019t do -- done very much\nabout that. And -- but you have not -- you know, you think you want to get married,\nbut if something doesn\u2019t go right, you have two weeks and if you want to cancel it,\nit\u2019s okay.",
        "Q: Oh --",
        "A: Which was --",
        "Q: That\u2019s great of him to say that.",
        "A: That was very great of him to say and I appreciated it then and I appreciate it\nmore as I am an adult and have children of my own. But he did say that, and so I\nhave that in the background, so I was feeling fairly safe and okay. And now, as an\nadult I look back and everybody says, my God, what a risk, you know, all of this\nthing was. But it didn\u2019t seen to me that way at all. I mean, you know, you marry --\nyou meet somebody, you like them, and you just get married.",
        "Q: Did you have a sense of -- this was more than 10 years after the end of the war.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: But did it have a sense for you because of all your aunts and uncles being there\nwho had survived, and even though you were a child then, did it have any sense of\ncontinuance, and we -- of surviving, people having survived the war. Was there that\nkind of a celebrat -- celebration as part of it? You hear people say this, people who\ngot married in the late 40\u2019s --",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: -- or immediately after the war. I\u2019m wondering if that attitude was at all present in\nyour wedding?",
        "A: Probably less so.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Maybe because -- because it was late -- so much later and because I was so young\nwhen I lost my parents. And I lived with my uncle -- my -- my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s\nhusband, whom I adored and he adored me. And you know, I star -- I started my life\nwith him when I was, you know, in elementary school. So -- so I was in -- it-it -- it\nwas, in a way, contrary to that 1-in -- in a sense that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to be\nat my wedding. So in a way, I -- I her -- I felt the absence of a parent, but not my real\nparents, because it was so far in the background. I mean, I know that that is how my\nuncle and my aunt felt, and -- and to my uncle it was extremely important. That\u2019s\nwhy, you know, my aunt tells me that to my uncle -- and he had told me -- he passed\naway in 90, but he told me how important it was to him that -- that there was this\ncontinuation and th -- it was extremely important to them that I marry someone who\nis Jewish and that was behind their inviting me, much -- very much so. And that was\nsaid to me. You know, they wanted me to -- to meet people because they knew at --\nmy aunt says that she knew that -- he knew that if I was left in Yugoslavia I wouldn\u2019t\nmarry somebody Jewish and that would be the end of that. There was just nobody to\nmeet there. And they thought I would meet someone in Montre, through them. And I\nmet people, but I had pre-empted it all by meeting Dan on the -- on the train. So -- so\nit was extremely important to them, it was -- it was for them, because they were that\ngeneration to -- who understood it. I ha -- I-I don\u2019t think I understood it fully.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I may have understood it after my children were born, but at that time I didn\u2019t\ndwell much on the Holocaust and on the losses. I grew up happy and in school and\njust being fairly norm -- normal teenager. And I intellectually knew, but emotionally\n[I ru -- I -- you know, as a child I used to say things like oh, I have to do this. Now, if\nI had a mother, I wouldn\u2019t have to do that. But that\u2019s sort of more, you know, a kid\nthing, you know.",
        "Q: Yup.",
        "A: I can -- I-I think, yeah, I had more of a kind of a response like maybe divorced --\ndivorced ch -- parents\u2019 children have, you know? If I didn\u2019t have this stepmother I\nwould be doing much better kind of thing. But some of it is totally unrealistic. So the\nfact that my uncle wasn\u2019t coming to the wedding was sad for me. And I had\noriginally when I -- when I decided that I would get married to Dan, I -- I -- I wou --\nI -- I was -- I wrote to him with great trepidation about that. My Swiss family was\nhappy bec -- because Dan was Jewish and everything. I translated all the letters and\nthey knew all the particulars, you know, and everything read well, so it was okay.\nBut my uncle, of course, knew nothing about that. My -- my uncle -- my -- Dietrich\nis what I called him, so Ill refer to him that way, probably easier. He knew nothing\nabout anything until I -- and in our house it was like an unspoken -- ma, what do I\nsay unspoken, it was a spoken word. You are not to get married until you graduate\nfrom the university. So here I am in my sophomore year and I\u2019m getting married to\nsomebody and taking off fre -- for -- for the United States, leaving, basically, you\nknow, him behind, which was mentioned in a very unkind way one of the books\nwritten about [indecipherable] and about him. But --",
        "Q: You\u2019ve mentioned that before.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It just really bugged me. So -- but because I didn\u2019t sort of say, oh I\u2019m -- you\nknow, I\u2019m going to leave you, which is circumstances, and I certainly did\ncommunicate with him from now on and -- and [indecipherable] that. But -- but he\ncouldn\u2019t come because he di -- he was just not healthy enough and -- and strong\nenough to make the journey. And he wrote that -- you know, he wrote back saying\nthat if I -- if my aunt and uncle in Switzerland felt that it was a good thing for me to\ndo, then it was okay. So I went ahead. Anyway, so there are [indecipherable] sort of\na [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So you got married in September 1\u201c, 1959, is that --",
        "A: 1958.",
        "Q: \u00b058. And did you go immediately to the States then?",
        "A: Oh, it was very strange, it was -- it -- we couldn\u2019t get my visa on time, so we sort\nof spent a month in Europe. I had to go -- well, we got a visa. Oh, there was\nAmerican visa, of course meaning that you have to have your health checked, and\nthen you have to go and -- that -- but also my passport was expiring, my Yugoslav\npassport. So we had to go to Geneva and extend my passport. And all of that took at\nleast a month. At -- at one point it looked almost as if Dan was going to have to\nleave without me. But we traveled -- w-we -- we traveled some, we went to some\nparts of Switzerland, we went to Lausanne and -- and we got -- we went to Gstaad,\nand went to Italy and then back, so that that\u2019s how we spent the month. It was truly a\nhoneymoon -- a moon, a moon, how a moon [indecipherable] fast. And then finally\nthe visa came and -- and the passport was extended and the visa came and -- and we\nwere able to -- to -- to go together. But I have to tell you -- I don\u2019t know whether I\nsaid anything. I should have listened to the end of the tape, but I don\u2019t know whether\nI told you anything about what the wedding was like.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: No?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think there was anything like that.",
        "A: Well, it was a very different affair from anything that happens here. It was in -- in\nthe mountains, in the Swiss mountains, in -- in -- 1n a place called the Chateau Deux\nwhere there was the f -- there is a family -- there was a family in Moltar, a Jewish\nfamily that ran a kosher ho -- a kosher restaurant and -- a pensionne actually, and\nthey also used to rent a -- I think it was in theirs, a hotel in Chateau Deux for\nPassover. And I was there once at Passover before, where you know, where\nOrthodox people would go to a hotel and spend the entire Passover there so that they\ndon\u2019t have to do anything at home. And that\u2019s where the wedding -- that\u2019s where the\nwedding was to take place. And we all had to go up there with a little bus. And I had\nthis dress on that I had designed by looking at -- because my ha -- my uncle worked -\n- this is wer -- the work he found a -- in Switzerland. He -- they sent -- they sent\npeople who were in these lo -- relocation camps to learn a trade, and they sent him to\nlearn how to be a couture ha -- cutter, a cloth --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- cloth cutter. So he worked for a Jewish family again in -- in -- in -- was a very\nclose community -- a Jewish family that had sort of a small couture house in -- in\nMontre and so I could design my own dress, and it was made. And I -- Dan had sent\nme from the States, \u201cBride\u201d magazine and I did -- I sort of followed some of that,\nand I had this pretty dress. And then you go up there -- we went up there with a bus\nand I had to not see them for three days. But -- well, at least, because it was really\nlonger that you don\u2019t see people in Orthodox Jewish wedding of -- weddings, the\nbride and groom are not to see each other. And we ran, of course, all over Montre\nthat whole time because this had to be done and that had to be done. And the town\nwas so small we ran into each other all the time. But officially we didn\u2019t see each\nother. And then he was to -- to get me the bouquet. And of course you know -- you\nknow what it\u2019s like here, I mean, how much you go through to for the bride to get\nthese flowers and you\u2019re thinking about it. I told him I wanted to have white\ncarnations. That\u2019s all I told him. I had no idea what to do and he had not the foggiest\nidea what to do. So, the afternoon before he goes to a florist and he said, I need a\nbouquet of white carnation. And they said, well, how many do you want? He said,\nwell, whatever is appropriate for a bride. And they practically fainted\n[indecipherable] at the florist shop. Started running all over Montre apparently,\nlooking for enough carnations to -- to make a bouquet, which they eventually came\nup with and put it together. So that\u2019s what he brought. And then there was a big fight\nabout -- I think every wedding has to have a fight, and this one had to do with\nwhatever hat he was going to wear. And he wanted to wear a yarmulke, which\npeople here wear in Jewish weddings and that\u2019s fine. But that community and that\nlevel of observance called for a proper hat. A real -- one of those black hats, not a ha\n-- top hat, but you know, a hat. Well, he want -- didn\u2019t want to wear one. So there\nwas a really tight situation, and finally his mother persuaded him to wear it. And --\nand he wore it just for under the chupah, that\u2019s it. After that he took it off the second\nhe could. But he wore it. And we were married by -- by the grand rabbi of\nLuxembourg, who had been a memb -- who had been a friend of the family. And he\ncame from Luxembourg to -- to marry us. And the chupah was outdoor, which 1s\nvery proper in Orthodox Jewish weddings. It was outdoors in a beautiful setting,\nwith you know, mountains in the background. And the entire Jewish community was\ninvited, but not for dinner. Dinner was just the family, but everybody was invited\nfor, you know, right now I think they would say this is a [indecipherable] wedding,\nyou know, because you had little sandwiches and drinks and that was -- you know,\nthat was that and everybody came out. And -- and then there was a family -- there\nwas a family dinner after that. So -- and then after that we took our [indecipherable]\non the train and that was that. That was the wedding.",
        "Q: And your smiling, it was -- 1t was a good memory.",
        "A: Oh, it was a great memory.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I loved it. To me, it was -- except a horri -- I had a horrible headache on the way\nup and I had to sit there -- that\u2019s another thing of Orthodox Jewish weddings, you\nhave a separation of the -- of the sexes and I -- I -- you sit there -- I\u2019ve not -- now\nseen it many times, you -- you sit and the -- all the females come and say hello and --\nand you -- you sit with your -- you know, with your veil up and -- or down, actually,\nI have pictures, and just, you know, talk with people. And you -- you were led to the\nchupah by two females and a man by two males, rather than, as we do mostly in the\nStates, and certainly the way my son got married, the -- the -- the parents take you.\nBoth parents, you know, and -- take you -- take the bride and the groom. And the --\nthe -- the father gives the bride away, none of that [indecipherable]. So my aunt and\nmy mother-in-law took me to the chupah. And my uncle and I think Dan\u2019s brother\ntook him to the chupah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Or maybe it was his uncle, I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t remember. His uncle and aunt\nfrom -- from France, who came.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Was there something symbolic about the carnation, or was it just a --",
        "A: No, I just liked it.",
        "Q: -- favorite flow -- okay, I\u2019m gonna st-stop the tape and flip it over.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Dora Klayman. This 1s tape number one, side B. So you, after you\nhad a month of traveling and getting to know each other --",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- you came to the States. To New York?",
        "A: Came to New York. Was quite an experience. After the -- the -- you know,\nbeautiful Switzerland and -- and the lake and this and that and we spend time in the\nmost love -- the loveliest parts of Europe, to come to New York, which I was\nlooking forward to, but I was afraid that 1t was going to be gray and ugly, sort of\nvery European, but huge. And we came on a ship, we came on the Queen Mary, and\n-- and a -- I-I think if -- if I have to talk about experiences in coming, I think I have\nto go slightly back to qu -- to queen -- to the queen -- the Queen Mary. It was -- I\nwas so afraid to go on a ship because on my trips during the summer in Croatia,\nwhen we used to go to the island of Solta, we once went on a boat that took three\nhours from Split to Solta, which you can see from one another. It was like boom-\nboom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom, you know, and everything was there, you\nknow, and sometimes goats and vegetables and everything, and it was just, you\nknow, a -- a small boat. And I would get -- I would get seasick, and so I was very\nafraid of being seasick on the way. And Dan assured me that I wasn\u2019t going to get\nseasick because these ships are very big and they don\u2019t rock and so on and so forth.\nAnd I remember in la -- getting, you know, close on the small boat that you go to the\nsmall boat to the ship and looking at this ship and saying, my God, it is enormous,\nit\u2019s like a huge skyscraper or something. And so I was reassured, but we did run one\nday into a hurricane. It was fall, the hurricanes are there, and near Ireland we ran into\na hurricane, and Dan, who claimed he was never sick on ships, got very sick on a\nship. Both of us were sick for the day. And then I have, you know, very sort of\nAmericanization memories o-on that ship because it was now -- it was now a\ndifferent world already, it wasn\u2019t just the arrival, it was already -- it was, you know,\nbeing -- being on foreign territory all by myself, and having to speak English all the\ntime, and --",
        "Q: How was your English?",
        "A: My English was good because -- I mean decent, because I had studied English all\nthrough high school.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: And I was an English major in college.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: So --",
        "Q: Great.",
        "A: Yeah. So one of the reasons I met Dan 1s because I was dying to speak English to\nsomebody. I -- I had met him because there were -- I think I talked on the tape about\nthe discussion he was having on the ship with somebody and everybody was\nlistening, it was [indecipherable] in Little Rock and all of that and I was dying to talk\nabout things. So I sort of took little walks until he started talking to me. And so I-I --\nyou know, because I had -- I had studied English for a long time, but I had no\nexperience actually speaking. There were no Americans or English speakers, and I\nwas one of the very few studying English at that time in Yugoslavia. So -- so my\nEnglish was decent, but there were many things I didn\u2019t know. I mean, lack of\nvocabulary, you know, and -- oh, and -- and the thing that really improved my\nEnglish by the way, is while I was -- while I was still in Switzerland and we wrote to\neach other, and I -- I have these things, I would -- I asked Dan, good student that I\nam, I said to him, please correct my letters. And so what he did 1s -- is -- in -- he\nwrote me corrections back, but not just, you know, every correction, but he would\nwrite me, for example, when you say something like, I don\u2019t know, I am at my\nsecond book, you don\u2019t say at, you say on. I am on my second book. And then he\nwould give me a whole lesson on -- on prepositions. So, even during our -- our --",
        "Q: He was a good teacher.",
        "A: -- courtship, I -- I -- I learned -- I learned a lot. And I spoke with a reas -- with a\nsomewhat British accent, from wherever, and I was still on aunt and cahn\u2019t, but I\ncorrected that when I got here. So, my English was okay, but I lacked vocabulary\nand I lacked cultural knowledge, and -- and -- and that was one of my -- my low\npoints on that ship that I remember. Sitting one evening in one of the lounges and\nthere were a number of Americans, and they were sitting around the piano and we\nwere included, sitting around the piano and someone 1s playing the piano and they\nare singing American songs. And I knew some, but I didn\u2019t know as many as they\ndid, of course. I knew, you know -- well, anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter, but you know,\njust -- just American songs, from s -- from sea to shining sea and whatever they\nwere. And I was never very good on my -- on memorizing voca -- words anyway, so\nthat was enjoyable. But then Dan s -- ordered a ginger ale. We were sitting at the\ntable, he ordered ginger ale and I said, what is ginger ale? And he said, well, you\u2019 ll\nsee when it comes. I said, well, what 1s it? And he\u2019s, well, you\u2019ll see when it comes.\nAnd I started crying. And I so remember that.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: All of a sudden --",
        "Q: You just felt frustrated, or --",
        "A: -- all of a sudden -- and he was terribly frustrate -- I mean, he was very upset that\nhe had upset me. But a -- it -- 1t -- it -- then somehow all of a sudden everything\ncame together. My God, I don\u2019t know anything about this country. I don\u2019t even\nknow what someone orders at the table. What am I going to do? S -- and you know,\nhe comforted me and then the ginger ale came and that was the end of that story. But\nI do -- [ -- it -- it was sort of like, you know, you -- I remember a few little things\nthat sort of were these kind of very small things. You think you, as an ESL teacher\nall my life later on, I was always aware how small things count. Just nothing counts -\n- nothing -- nothing [indecipherable] can trigger you, trigger that sense that you are a\nforeigner in a foreign country and that you don\u2019t really know everything, and -- and\nhow much, you know, you miss and it doesn\u2019t have to do -- it does -- has nothing to\ndo with Shakespeare, it has to do with ginger ale.",
        "Q: And at that age too, it\u2019s a kind of time when you want to belong --",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: In theater?",
        "A: -- was in its original -- on the original version in the theater on -- on Queen Mary.\nBut then we came into New York and I have pictures of myself on the ship with the\nStatue of Liberty behind me, early in the morning.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: That was fantastic. That was just fantastic, you know. It was just exactly what I\nexpected, you know, the -- obviously the statue is such a powerful symbol all over\nthe world and it was then as well. And, you know, seeing it was just amazing. And\nthen we come to New York. And, you know, people always say, oh, my goodness,\nit\u2019s -- New York is ugly, but I thought it was actually very beautiful, because I think\nI expected to be gray and it\u2019s actually very colorful. And instead of disliking all the\nwild colors and red bricks and -- and there weren\u2019t graffiti in those days, but you\nknow, posters and -- and advertising and you know, all of that. It was sort of -- it was\nexciting. It was exciting and I loved it. And Dan\u2019s parents waited for us and some\nother relatives.",
        "Q: And this was October?",
        "A: It was October.",
        "Q: Beautiful time of year.",
        "A: Yeah, it was a beautiful time of the year. And I remember very much it was\nOctober, because I remember witnessing my first Halloween very shortly after that.\nBut anyway, we went to -- to Dan\u2019s parents\u2019 apartment and that was a shock. They\nlived in a very small apartment in a northern -- northern part of Manhattan across\nfrom -- from Fort Tryon Park. That was the Inwood section of Washington Heights -",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: -- where a lot of Jewish community had settled. And my father-in-law had a small\ndrugstore around the corner from where they lived. But they never -- they -- they\nlived not in -- they lived in an apartment to which they moved when the kids were\nlittle and they never moved out of there. And was very small. It was a one bedroom\napartment and I\u2019ve never lived in a one bedroom apartment before in my life. So\nhere I come to the land of -- of -- of milk and honey and these people aren\u2019t living as\nwell as I was used to. I grew up in a big house, and -- when I lived in Zagreb and I\nwas roomed with friends, they -- was in a -- they -- the government had taken much\naway from them, but they had owned that villa that they lived in, and they also\nowned the land -- the little villa on the sha -- Solta. So, 1t was, you know, even\nthough it was small, it was beautiful furniture and it overlooked the garden and --\nand my aunt and uncle in Switzerland who were really not well-to-do, had two\nbedrooms. And the boys had one and they had one and I was -- I slept on the couch\nin the living room for the year I was there. But now, my in-laws lived in a one\nbedroom apartment with a tiny, tiny kitchen in an old house. In an old -- I mean old\nhouse, old building in New York that overlooked a courtyard, and you know, all the\nold buildings, the way they are. And my mother-in-law was sort of immovable in --\nin terms of moving anywhere. I mean, eventually we got them to move here, but she\nwouldn\u2019t change apartments and she liked where she was and she didn\u2019t -- changing\na chair was like a major issue. And so they just continued living there, like they did\nwhen da -- when they first started out. But 1t was across from the -- from fort -- Fort\nTryon Park and my husband adored the cloisters and spent time when he was at\nhome studying there. And --",
        "Q: And where did you and he live when you got there?",
        "A: I wa -- we moo -- we moved to an even worse place.",
        "Q: Did you move -- did you stay with them for a short time?",
        "A: No, no, no --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- we didn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t because what had happened was that my husband, when\nhe met me he was just returning from India where he had spent a year as a Fulbright\ndoing [indecipherable] work at the school of tropical medicine on Calcutta. And he\ntook a very long way home and met me on the -- on the way. He went up to Japan\nand then to -- went to some -- he took I -- I don\u2019t know what kind of boats and went\nto Egypt and then he was in Turkey [indecipherable] was in Turkey on that trip and -\n- and to Italy and eventually to Yugoslavia, back to Italy where he took a ship to go\nhome. And anyway, he a -- he had tried after that to find a job that he would -- that\nhe wanted and it took a very long time. It was the time of what he used to call the\nEisenhower depression, and -- not depression, 1t was, oh what they calling?\nRecession, sorry. And it was very difficult and he wanted to have a research job, and\nhe couldn't -- he didn\u2019t really want to work pharma -- pharmaceutical companies. He\nhad done that during his graduate days and he just didn\u2019t want to do that again, he\nwanted an academic position. It was very hard to come by. He had been waiting for a\nposition at NIH and it didn\u2019t come. While we were in Switzerland, he got a --a\ntelegram saying that the position had opened and he 1s in at NIH, but it was too late.\nBecause we were getting married, he took a position to teach at Hoffstra ha --\nCollege, which is now University of Long Island. And he knew that that wasn\u2019t\ngoing to be great, but he took it anyway because, I mean, we had to live on\nsomething, and I certainly didn\u2019t have any money. So, he talked to some friends who\nsaid they would find us someplace to live on Long Island. So when we came, there\nwas a place that they had sublet for us, and it was a sublet in someone\u2019s house. It\nwas a second -- on the second story of someone\u2019s house. I must have been in love,\nthat place was ga -- ghastly, you know. But I had ha -- I think I had a very typical\nAmerican experience, people all -- pe -- so many people tell me about their horrible\nfirst year.",
        "Q: First place [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well I had -- I had one, but I wasn\u2019t exactly expecting it. So\nthis was -- Mr. and Mr. -- Mr. and Mrs. O\u2019Connor and we had to go through their\nliving room and the television was always on, to the second story. And it was filthy,\nand I spend the time -- I have just come from my super clean u -- eat off the floor\naunt, and here it was like, you know, cockroach heaven.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And anyway, we cleaned it up. It was a -- it was just a one room, one kitchen,\nshare bathroom. And we didn\u2019t have a car, and -- to find something else, so it was a\nvery difficult few months. Eventually -- that was wintertime and -- and we used to\ngo do every -- all th -- our shopping taking buses and it was pretty cold and\nmiserable. And eventually, however, we were able to somehow find an apartment. It\nwas very difficult to find housing. We were in Hampstead, Long Island and it was\nalmost impossible to find anything. Every time we would come to an apartment it\nwas already taken. And eventually we found something in a small building that had\nsix small apartments and the -- Mr. [indecipherable] said we could have this\napartment, but he wasn\u2019t going to do anything. No painting, no nothing, take it or\nleave it, and so we did, we took it. And then finally by -- by -- by March, thank God\na refund from the government, for -- on his taxes, and we were able to buy this hou -\n- incredible car, which was like a \u201951 Buick, I think. And it had a -- that -- you know,\nat least went, if nothing else. And in -- in the meantime, you know, we would take\nbuses and stuff, and he took a long time to get to work every day and he hated it at\nHoffstra. Not that he -- he doesn\u2019t di -- he didn\u2019t like 1t because he was teaching\nfreshmen and he really couldn\u2019t understand at all kids, like I eventually got to\nunderstand because that\u2019s often what I had is kids who just weren't going to study, or\ndidn\u2019t feel like chemi -- and chemistry\u2019s hard for most kids. And none of -- none of\nthem were devoted to chemistry, it was just a subject they were taking. And, you\nknow, he was -- an-and he was extremely enthusiastic about chemistry. To him it\nmeant a lot and -- and they were just, you know, coming up with you know, my dog\n-- the dog ate my homework, and he couldn\u2019t understand that at all. So he didn't like\nit very much there and had im-immediately applied for other situation in the gover --\nsituations in the government. And of course the pay was extremely low, so that we\ncouldn\u2019t really afford anything. It was -- it was difficult to -- to -- to buy it -- to --\nyou know, to buy any furniture or anything. And we -- we bought something, but not\nvery much. And -- so it was -- it was kind of hard. And I -- I was home alone and I\nhad -- I could have started going to Hoffstra, but it was already in progress and I was\nreally scared. I had just gone through this whole year in -- in Switzerland of coping\nwith a new university where they required me to know much more French than I\nknew. I was doing [indecipherable] of the text of Proust and I could barely speak\nFrench because I was an English major and I had done very little French before, but\nthey couldn't care less. You\u2019re second year French, you take this. You know, there is\nnone of that. I mean, you -- American universities coddle kids in comparison.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Of course I didn\u2019t understand that they also didn\u2019t expect me to take any exams.\nJust -- you know, just you fla -- you know, you\u2019re just there. But -- but so it was\nactually lonely for me, and I waited for Dan to come home and I decided that I might\nas well have a baby. What else was there? You get married, you have a baby. So I\ngot pregnant right away. And Wanda was eventually born on our first wedding\nanniversary.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: So -- well, being pregnant meant you have to find a doctor and you have to pay\nthe doctor and I have an -- had an idiot, but that\u2019s not because we didn\u2019t pay him, we\ndid, but he was just bad. And we pay -- tried to -- we painted our apartment\nourselves and -- after we got tired of taking a shower and ending up with brown dots\non our heads because the paint was dropping down, you know. So we painted and\nwe had some furniture. But then things got really exciting because Dan got a -- a\nposition at Walter Reed and he said he couldn\u2019t come until June because he had to --\nhe promised to be at Hoffstra til the end of the school year, and they said they would\nwait. And so that was -- that was great. So by June I was already highly pregnant.\nWanda was born at the end of August. We took whatever possessions we had and we\nheaded for Washington. And that was great.",
        "Q: Yeah. So you were here in hot summer.",
        "A: We got here in a hot summer with very little to no money. We borrowed some\nmoney.",
        "Q: What -- what kind of job did he get?",
        "A: As a researcher.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: In -- ina lab at Walter Reed, which -- where he remained for the rest of his -- for\nthe rest of his life.",
        "Q: Oh really?",
        "A: Yeah. Not in -- in that lab. He came as a -- as a researcher, he eventually headed\nthe lab and the section. And they were working on -- it was a-again a no -- tropical\nmedicine.",
        "Q: Oh, really.",
        "A: Which is what he was interested in. Eventually he -- he worked in selentum\nchemistry. He had a -- his Ph.D. had to do with -- w-with e-e-extracting a new\nalkaloid from opium.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: And so that kind of tropical medicine was of interest to him. Eventually he ended\nup working on anti-malarials. But they -- at Walter Reed at that time they were also\ndoing anti-nuclear medicine. So I think I\u2019m saying it right, because it was a long\ntime that -- that they were working on that. They were thinking ab-bout how to -- of\ncourse it\u2019s the army, so they were always thinking in terms of, you know, what are\nwe going to be afflicted with that we have to counteract.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And so the medicine was going in -- in -- the research was going in the direction\nof if there is a nuclear attack -- and they were still thinking a lot about that, it was\nstill after the 50\u2019s and after McCarthyism.",
        "Q: So it was tre-treating people who had been --",
        "A: Who had been --",
        "Q: -- exposed to radiation.",
        "A: -- exposed to radiation, right.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: So it\u2019s anti-radiation, that\u2019s what it\u2019s really called.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That\u2019s anti-radiation. So anti-radiation and then eventually that kind of died down\nand they went more into doing anti-malarials and that\u2019s where really he did. And\nanyway, So th -- so w-we came to Washington and I will never forget the hotel we\nstayed in. It was on Dupont Circle in those old, old hotels before they were all\ndestroyed. And barely any air conditioning and the temperature was high and I was\nvery pregnant, and huge. And it was hot. But, we went to Walter Reed, and right\nnext to Walter Reed there were these apartment houses and there were plenty of\napartments to be had. It was unbelievable. And we got, right across from Walter\nReed -- I, of course, didn\u2019t arrive -- right across from Walter Reed, there was this --\nwhat it was called? A garden apartment that was beautiful and light and had two\nbedroom and a big living room and -- and a patio. And it was the same amount of\nmoney, it was like 115 dollars, I remember it. It was the same amount of money like\nthat hole in the wall in New York. So, I was thrilled. And of course, I had been\nlonely and Ill never forget that Dan went to work and he could walk across the\nstreet to work and somebody came and knocked on my door, and there was a\nneighbor from upstairs with -- pregnant, and with a baby on her arms, and she said,\noh I heard you moved in, welcome. I was like -- I thought I was going to faint. No\none talked to me in New York, ever.",
        "Q: Huh.",
        "A: On Long Island. It was a strange community. I -- I don\u2019t think this is true that\npeople in New York don\u2019t talk to you, but it happened to have been my experience\nin that particular town. So, well, 1t was just the people that were there and there were\nno children and so on. But it was a different life in Washington.",
        "Q: So things turned around pretty quickly.",
        "A: Very quickly.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was like totally on the dime.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The place was full of young physicians from Walter Reed and their wives and\ntheir children and I made some lifelong -- long friends. And, you know, that was just\ntotally, totally different life.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. We did not join -- join Jewish community. We went to services, Rosh\nHashanah, but to just whatever was free and open and there we -- there always were\nsome in town, but that\u2019s all we did. Not until we moved from there, when Wanda\nwas four and we bought a house and we moved to where we are now, into -- to this\ncommunity. And -- which is across from -- we are across from Ohr Kodesh\ncongregation.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

        "A: It\u2019s right on East-West highway. We join -- and we -- we -- our house was just\naround the corner from this house. This house was built in \u201979. But we moved into a\nthree bedroom, small Maryland type house that -- that at that time cost 18,500. And\nwas in -- it\u2019s insane. It just sold for like almost half a million dollars, ridiculous. But\nanyway, we moved into that house and we joined Ohr Kodesh, and that\u2019s where the\nkids went to -- and I\u2019m still a member now, I\u2019m much more active now than I was\nthen, and -- and the kids went to Hebrew school there, and were Bar and Bat\nMitzvah eventually.

        "A: 60\u2019s were raising kids.",
        "Q: Little kids.",
        "A: Little kids. I did things here and there. I started -- I did that little work for VOA. I\ndon\u2019t remember how I found them, or they found me.",

        "A: I did a lot of translation at the time for the Joint Publications Research Services. It\nwas Department of Commerce. And that was excellent because I could neither type,\nn-nor -- nor nothing. I -- I couldn\u2019t type. But it had to be perfectly typed and I\ncouldn\u2019t do that. So I lon -- wrote longhand translations the best I could and then\nedited them. And did a lot of work, but I really learned English that way. And th-\nthen I gave it to somebody to type. So, whatever they paid me I shared with the\ntypist. And so it was something -- something for me to do that -- that was sort of\nintellectually challenging and making a tiny bit of money. And that\u2019s that.",
        "Q: By that time -- did you feel like an American by that time?",
        "A: I -- I think so. You know, differently from very many people who come to this\ncountry, and I certainly have had much experience with that, because I ended up\nteaching ESL, I -- I did -- I did not have anybody who spoke my language, or who\ncame from my culture.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t have those constant reminders.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have those constant reminders. And I wrote home -- in quote home, less\nand less than my friends. And I got very involved with other mothers, and with, you\nknow, what was going on with my kids.",
        "Q: And your husband\u2019s family, too?",
        "A: And my husband -- well, my husband\u2019s family, there was nobody in Washington,\nactually. At fi -- one short period of time a cousin was here, a cousin of my\nhusbands. And they had a little boy -- and they still have him, but they ha -- they had\na baby at that time, and they lived in Arlington and we saw them sometimes. But a\nvery good friend of my husband\u2019s from high school -- junior high school and high\nschool settled here.

        "Q: And you said you stopped writing to a lot of your friends. But what about your\nuncle?",
        "A: Well, I wrote to my uncle not as frequently as I should have probably, looking\nback. But I did. I sent pictures. And waited for, basically, for my -- I made promises\n-- when I wrote to him, I -- originally to say I would get -- I wanted to get married, I\npromised that I would go back to school and finish. And it waited until Elliot was in\nkindergarten, but once he was in kindergarten, I enrolled in Montgomery College,\nwhich was very, very close. I -- I finally learned how to drive. I was 27, I learned\nhow to drive. And -- and I started taking -- I took -- I fre -- one course. And while he\nwas in kindergarten, I would drive to Takoma Park and take my class and drive\nback, and be back for him to come back from school. And I took a class in English\nwith a Dr. Laverne Miller, who shall not be forgotten by me forever. She just died\nrecently. She was a fantastic teacher, the best I ever had, or one of the best I ever\nhad, anyway. The best I had in the States, I think. And I took my first English\ncourse, and you know, freshman English 101, and wrote my first essay and drove\nDan crazy because I wanted him to read it and he wouldn\u2019t. And he said, just do it,\njust do it, just go. It\u2019s okay, you can do it. So I went with my first piece, and I have\nit, and the class ended and she se -- the class -- the new class began and we had to\nhave that [indecipherable] when a new class began, she said that there was one good\ncomposition. And she started reading it, it was mine. I was like, oh my God, you\nknow?",
        "Q: What did you write about?",
        "A: Oh, it was just something we had to summarize, it was nothing much. It was just\na summary of -- of -- of some article about some planets or something. It wasn\u2019t -- it\nwas just ri -- she sent us home to write a summary.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And obviously I knew how to write. I\u2019ve said that many times, you know, people\nask me, how do these ESL kids do it? And I say well, if they can write to begin with,\nthey do fine. But it\u2019s not a matter of teaching just the language, it\u2019s teaching\neverything.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And -- and I wou -- I had always been a very good writer, so I just transferred the\nskill, it was no big deal. I had to learn English, but I didn\u2019t have to learn how to\nwrite.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So -- so that was -- that was fine. So eventually I took a lot of classes from Dr.\nMiller, she taught [indecipherable] books at -- at Takoma Park. And she eventually\nhired me to, when I finished col -- when I finished University of Maryland she hired\nme, and then my -- that was my first job, was teaching at -- at Montgomery College.",
        "Q: Huh. Huh.",
        "A: So, anyway, I had [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So when you went back to school, did you know that you wanted to teach English\nas a second language?",
        "A: No, I had no idea, in fact, that that\u2019s what I would be doing. And -- and in fact, I -\n- | thought exactly what -- that I would not be doing that, because I felt like English\nas a second language was not a field that anybody even heard about here --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- at that time. [phone ringing] And now ignore it. [indecipherable] it\u2019s unknown,\nanyhow.",
        "Q: Just let me -- let me pause it. [tape break] -- 1t wasn\u2019t a field that was known here.",
        "A: No, it was not -- no one even talked about that. Certainly wasn\u2019t taught in the\ncounty. English as a second language was not a recognized class offering in\nMontgomery county. And I thought, even if the -- had ex -- if it had even started, I\nwould have thought that they wouldn\u2019t want someone who had an accent and was\nfrom a different country. And so I went to my second experience, namely to my\nSwiss experience, and -- because I had become ru -- quite fluent that year in -- in\nFrench. And so I thought I would be a French major. Languages was what I always\nwanted to study, so that was fine. So I was going to, you know, do French. Which I\ndid do, I enrolled in French, but I had such -- just crazy experiences, because in -- in\nEuropean schools you don\u2019t start from -- from ground zero at the university. You\ncan\u2019t sort of decide you\u2019re going to be a French major and start with French 101 in\ncollege. Which you could here. I mean, it will take you some doing -- take some --\nsome doing, but you can if you want to. There it\u2019s 1m -- it\u2019s -- it was great -- greatly\npro -- it was problematic in every way because when I came to Zagreb and I decided\n-- ]-I was an English major, but I decided already to study some French because I\nknew I was going to go to Switzerland, I had planned on that. So I too -- I had to\ntake French with the same student -- with the same kids who had studied French for\nfive years in -- in high school.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: I had studied English. And I had some pr -- private lessons, but I struggled greatly\nthat year, trying to do French with people who were ahead of me. And the same\nthing happened again when I came to Switzerland. I was still struggling with French\nand they again put me too far ahead. I could never -- you -- you can\u2019t make a\ndecision what you want to take. It\u2019s like what\u2019s available and where they think you\nshould be, with -- without regard and -- where you actually are as a student. So I\nthought, oh God, I\u2019m going to do this again? And when I realized that you can start\nfrom the beginning here, I enrolled in 101, French 101. Well, they threw me out of\nthere and I went to a higher level class, but I was at MC and I also started taking\nSpanish, which was the smartest thing I ever did. But anyway, I eventually graduated\nfrom University of Maryland with a degree in French and a minor in -- in Spanish.\nAnd then, at that point, ESL became already -- started to become a field a-and I had -\n- because I dragged through schools for such a long period of time, I didn\u2019t go like\nthree or four years, I don\u2019t know how long it took me, a long time. And I had -- I\nstarted teaching ESL at Takoma Park in the evening program, before I had any kind\nof a degree. Because I -- while I was a student there, they recognized that I could --\nthat I knew something about what -- what -- what needed to be taught and that I\nunderstood the process. And they started the evening programs for the new\nVietnamese community coming in.",
        "Q: At Montgomery College, yeah.",
        "A: At Montgomery College. Actually no, that\u2019s not even true. I-I started when the\nCubans were coming in.",
        "Q: In the early 80\u2019s?",
        "A: In the early -- oh, it was la -- much earlier than that.",
        "Q: Oh, oh, the first wave.",
        "A: That first wave --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- of Cubans --",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: -- that came in.",
        "Q: In the 60\u2019s.",
        "A: Yes, and we had -- nobody knew how to teach it, nobody knew what to do and\nnobody knew n-no -- we didn\u2019t have any books. The only books we had were\nsomething that the army had used. It was -- it was -- it was an -- you know, an -- an\nold system. I [indecipherable] remember what it was called, English 800 or\nsomething, and it was like based on 800 vocabulary items and -- and there were\nthese sent-sentences we were supposed to be teaching, it was like these Cuban ladies\nthat y -- that didn\u2019t know what hit them, and we are teaching them, if 1t had been\nraining in Miami, I would have taken my umbrella. What? You know? Because we\njust had no idea. Nobody knew how to teach it. And we were just sort of like\nstruggling and figuring things out. And -- and teaching in -- in the basement across\nthe street from MC there was an old church and in that basement there was a\nclassroom we could use. And then the Vietnamese population came in, and then\nsome books were published, and we tried -- you know, there were three of us trying\nto figure out what was going on. I was coordinating the program; I hadn\u2019t even\ngraduated from college, you know? It was crazy.",
        "Q: I bet it was fulfilling.",
        "A: It was very fulfilling and -- and it worked very well for me in every way because\nmy husband could stay home with the kids and we taught -- and I taught twice a\nweek in the evening, and they paid me. Wasn\u2019t much, but it was great. And so I was\n-- I was doing that and -- and going to school at the same time.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: But, to back up, you asked me about my uncle. When the kids -- so that was one\nthing I did, I -- I did -- I go back to school, not just because he wanted me to, but I\ndid, too.",
        "Q: You wanted to, sure.",
        "A: And that was one thing. But the other thing was that in -- by 19 -- let me see,\nWanda was five, so she was in kindergarten when I got my citizenship. That was\nanother story. And -- and since she was in kindergarten we could take her out of\nschool, we felt, for a little bit of time. Elliot was still in nursery school, and we went\nto -- we went to Switzerland for a bit and to cro -- to Yugoslavia to visit my uncle.\nAnd we stayed for a few months.",
        "Q: A few months?",
        "A: That was -- that was great, yeah.",
        "Q: I bet he was so thrilled.",
        "A: He was thrilled, yes, he was thrilled. There I am, you know, arriving back with\ntwo kids. And then eventually Dan came, and at that point, of course, we were doing",
        "Q: That was the first time he met Dan.",
        "A: Yes. They got along very well. They spoke in -- Dan [indecipherable] German,\nbut you know, he went up and he was -- Dan was very outgoing and lots of fun and\nthey had a good time together. It was very nice, it was very fulfilling and really\ngreat. Oh, we -- at that time we were doing better financially so we could, you know,\nwe -- first of all we -- we have saved enough money for all of us to go to Europe.\nAnd second, we could rent a car and you know, just go around a little bit and see a\nbit, and that was -- that was really a lovely trip. And so --",
        "Q: Great, yeah. Let me ask you about the 60\u2019s in this country. A lot of people have\ncommented that coming to this country as they did, and as you did, they felt\nextremely sensitive to the civil rights movement, especially people who moved\nanywhere close to the south and saw how blacks were being treated in this country.\nWas that -- was that of -- a -- a significant kind of thing on your radar at that time\nhere in Washington?",
        "A: Yeah, it was.",
        "Q: Washington had quite a --",
        "A: It was very much so.",
        "Q: -- quite its share of conflicts here.",
        "A: In fact, yeah, very much so. And in fact, I was just saying to the very friend\nwhose phone just rang, how I remember so well all the Civil Rights marches. I was\nat a march yesterday, the --",
        "Q: Women\u2019s march.",
        "A: -- the Women\u2019s march and how huge it was, but -- but 1t was not fraught with\ndanger, and those marches were fraught with danger. And I didn't go very much, I\nstayed with the kids, but -- but my husband went. I -- he was -- he was an avid\nphotographer, and -- and also wanted to record everything and he -- he -- he would\ngo down. But I went down too. I remember serving food in tent city in those days,\nwith the kids. And we -- you know, we lived through the -- through the riots and\nMartin Luther King\u2019s death and I remember -- and of course, through President\nKennedy\u2019s death. I -- I know that I was very American already, because I remember\nthat I cried when President Kennedy was nominated because I wanted Stevenson to\nbe nominated.",
        "Q: You had already had strong feelings about American politics.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: That was pretty quick.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, of course you know, I had -- I had a tutor living with me. And I\ndidn\u2019t have that other community. That, I think is really major in my transformation,\nthat -- that I got very involved -- oh yeah, I was - I was doing the dollars for\ndemocrats. I have pictures of myself co -- you know, trying to get money for\nJohnson to be elected. I mean, you know, it\u2019s -- so it\u2019s -- I-I got really involved in --\nin -- in the community and in -- and in life here. With, you know, with Civil Rights\nand everything else that came -- that came down the pike with the democratic party.\nI -- I served as a judge of elections in -- at -- one year. And so I just got a -- to meet a\nlot of people that were sort of kindred spirits. And of course in this com -- this\nparticular community where we lived, we -- it was an all white community at the\ntime. And from what I heard, even though this was built by -- by a -- a fellow Jew, it\nhad originally, when it was built in the late 1930\u2019s, early 40\u2019s -- well, not by 40\u2019s, it\nwas a-all gone. But -- but the early -- the houses built in the 30\u2019s actually had a-an\nanti-Jewish covenant. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: In this neighborhood?",
        "A: Yes, in this neighborhood.",
        "Q: What is this neighborhood called?",
        "A: This neighborhood 1s called Rock Creek Forest.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: And I think it went off fast, and I never saw any original documents. But my next\ndoor neighbor in my old house wa -- told me about it, and -- and they were sa --\nsavvy. He was a newspaper [indecipherable] Levins, and he was a -- they were pe --\nreally involved in labor issues and he was -- he published the newspaper for the\nrailway union. And so I -- I learned from them a lot, as well. So I -- so, at -- in this\nneighborhood at th -- at that time, I didn\u2019t even -- I wasn\u2019t aware that everybody was\nwhite in the neighborhood until a black family moved in and nobody said anything,\neverything was fine. But then they tried to buy a house -- th -- I think they were\nrenting and then they tried to buy a house and -- and she came to tell us, I remember,\nthat th -- th -- they had, I don\u2019t know, something had happened in their house. I can\u2019t\nremember now whether somebody threw stones or whatever, what happen, or\nsomeone wrote graffiti. And the neighborhood, there were a lot of -- they were rather\nreally progressive people living here and -- and people rallied around them. But then\nwe became aware that -- that it\u2019s been difficult for -- for black people to buy houses\nhere. And eventually things calmed down and -- and th-they bought some houses.\nIt\u2019s not that mixed here now, but it -- it is, I mean, you know, I have --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- neighbors across the street, or down the street --",
        "Q: At that time, did your friends know about your history and was it something that\nyou either -- either consciously made a point of telling people or consciously didn\u2019t\nmake a point of telling people? Or was it just relevant or irrelevant to your daily life\nor in your relations with friends?",
        "A: I would tell people if they asked.

        "A: Well, I 0 -- I was aware of the fact that a lot of people had escaped to this country\nand a lot of people left in 1945, and I just felt like I\u2019m just as well avoiding it. Now,\n1-1f there was somebody from Serbia, I would feel much more comfortable than if\nthere was somebody from Croatia.",
        "Q: Explain why.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s because during -- during the war, Croatia and Serbia were not in the\nsame country. Yugoslavia fell apart after the invasion, and Croatia became an\nindependent -- so-called ing -- it was called independent state of Croatia, Nezavisan\nStanje od Hrvatski. And it was a puppet government that carried out the edicts of --\nof the Third Reich. And so everything, including genocide perpetrated on Jews was\nalso perpetrated on Serbs.",
        "Q: Serbs.",
        "A: And so that I had -- I -- I -- I knew that if I met a Serb, that Serb could not have\nbeen my enemy during the war, because they were enemies of my b -- they were\nenemies of Germany or -- and of the Ustasi, who were the Croatian Nazis, as a --\nCroatian fascists, I should say --",

        "A: Well, what that means to me now is that I really -- I really -- they -- we talked\nabout Chetniks, for example. Chetniks were the Serbs who w -- fought against the\nGermans, apparently, but they also fought against the partisans. So in post-\nCommunist Yugoslavia, they were the enemy. They were just as much the enemy as\n-- as the Germans. But na -- I didn\u2019t understand exactly why England, for example\nand United States were supporting Chetniks at the beginning of the war. Now I\nunderstand. First of all they didn\u2019t know who was who. Second, th-there were some\ncircumstances where the Chetniks were doing some good things. On the other hand,\nof course, the sa -- they were nationalists at the same time so they also have their bad\npoints. But when I would meet Serbs after, when I came here, who would tell me\nthat -- that their families were Chetniks, I would think, my God, what horror. A-And\n-- and there probably was, but I still don\u2019t quite know. I still don\u2019t understand the\nChetnik movement properly because I\u2019ve never really delved into it.

And -- and I saw -- I saw many abuses that -- you know,\nas stupidities of the system. People who had no business running anything, you\nknow. One minute they were shepherds and the next minute they were running the\ncity, or being the police chiefs, or demanding that li -- that [indecipherable] we had a\nhouse and they demanded that we relinquish the house because we didn\u2019t have -- that\nwas not the house we lived in, but we had another building that was under\nconstruction, starting from before the war. And then we were ordered to finish it, and\nof course we didn\u2019t have the money to finish it. And so we said well, we can\u2019t. They\nsaid well, then the government will finish it and -- any way they wanted to. And\nthere\u2019s three people who probably didn\u2019t have a public -- didn\u2019t have an indoor\nplumbing of -- ever in their lives, now decided to make it into three apartments from\ntwo apartments and they made a total mess of it. You know, there was that kind of\nstuff going on. Those kinds of, you know, where everything was topsy-turvy. But,\nyou know, you -- and -- and I was aware that you had to be quiet and not say certain\nthings in certain places, and -- and you know, we listened to Voice of America and --\nand BBC every day. So we did know what was going on. But you still had that sense\nof being -- you had that sense of being in -- in sort of -- some sort of jail.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, it took me -- for example, when I decided to -- when I decided to go\nfirst time to Switzerland, my aunt and my uncle finally, you know, wrote to me and -\n- and I decided to go. It took me a long time to get a visa. And of course it took some\ndoing for me to have enough money to buy a ticket, even though my uncle was\ndirector of [indecipherable]. We only lived the way we lived because we have things\nfrom before the war we could sell. So, you know, there goes another gold chain that\nwas sold and I got a ticket. But the visa -- I got only the passport, and visa I got only\nbecause I was considered a victim of fascism. That was the actual title --",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- go out. So I was allowed -- I was given a passport because I wrote -- I wrote\nthis letter that I wanted to go and how we had, you know --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Anyway, so I had to write that I had this one uncle in Switzerland and that I\nwanted to go and visit, he invited me. And so they gave me a passport. But when I\ncame back, I was a celebrity, because nobody had been out of the country.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: And I went through my hi -- my -- my classroom -- my -- my high school\nclassrooms and I talked about things that I\u2019d seen. And, you know, strange things\nwere -- were -- I-I-I mean, the things that I talked about. I remember talking about\ndoors that o -- that opened automatically when you go to a supermarket, which we\ndidn\u2019t have either, and how -- you know, how many things are on the shelves and so\non. Cause after the -- that was \u00b054, I think ow -- whe -- but things were still really\ntough. You know, I don\u2019t know about that time, but just previous to that, I mean, we\nhad to have coupons for everything. And getting a pair of shoes was a major thing. I\nremember buying my first pair of shoes that I could actually go out and buy from a\nstore. And you know, that was so beautiful, I put them on my night table, I mean.\nAnd they were as ugly as can be, when I think back. I know exactly what they\nlooked like.",

        "A: And, you know, things were -- you know, there was very little to be had and even\nbooks, and -- you know, I n -- I remember how difficult it was to buy notebooks.\nAnd I got a first -- ma -- my -- my uncle sent me my fir -- my notebook -- notebooks\nand era -- an eraser, and ballpoint pen from Switzerland, that was like gold, you\nknow? I went around showing it off to everybody and everybody was borrowing\nmine -- my eraser, because it didn\u2019t smudge everything. So, things were -- things\nwere tough after the war, economically.",

        "A: And of course it was, you know, the communist [indecipherable] was it was\nbecause of the war and because, you know, Imperialists were against us and we --\nafter nine -- after \u00b048, after Yugoslavia broke off from Russia, 1t was, you know, we\nwere independent and we were maverick and 1n forefront -- in the forefront of --",

        "Q: There was a time in this country when a lot of people became aware and spoke\nout publicly about the Holocaust for the first time. It was somehow not on the\nnational radar much before then. And ene -- even people who were doing academic\nresearch into, you know, historical questions about the Holocaust were not always\npublicly received, acknowledged as doing important work.

        "A: I remember -- I remember the days, but I don\u2019t remember -- I -- I remember when\nthat series was -- was filmed and I remember that a lot of people started asking me\nquestions, that -- you know, how was it and what happened and what I remembered.\nThat hadn\u2019t popped up before. So I remember -- people also were -- you know, I was\n-- people asked me about, you know, did I live like Anne Frank. And so I usually --\nand even now I -- I tend to say to people when they ask me, where were -- you\nknow, what were you doing during the war, I would say, well, I was hidden, but not\nlike Anne Frank. Because I was really not -- I mean, I wa -- I may have been hidden\nfor a day, not for years, in the -- in that same sense. I don\u2019t know -- I was so\ninvolved in school at that time. I finally -- I -- I-I -- I was -- I just got out of college\nand I was student teaching and -- and I got my first job and I was -- I was teaching at\nBethesda Chevy Chase High School.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And that was -- well, after the year -- after the year at Montgomery College,\nwhere I was teaching full time in the regular students, rather than that evening\nprogram that I was doing, I was really busy. My kids were in junior high and -- or\nhigh school. No, they were in -- I think they were -- yeah, Elliot was still in middle\nschool, Wanda was in high school, and I was student teaching and coming home\ntired, wondering whether this is what I wanted to do, screaming at everybody at\nhome. I was like, I already had it with the kids. It was har -- I was student teaching\nhalf French and half ESL and I started to become aware of this whole new\nimmigrant community, and getting involved in all these other kids and their\nproblems, all these kids coming from Vietnam and -- and I think I was more\ninvolved in that than I was in the issues of the Holocaust, somehow. I started\nteaching at -- was it at -- an-and then my husband had his first heart attack. And that\nalso loomed fairly large. 1970 fo -- 1974, something like that, was his first heart\nattack. And Elliot was just Bar Mitzvah and so, you know, the -- I -- I-I was aware of\nit peripherally, but not involved in it in any way and it just seemed to me -- and I\ndon\u2019t think I was that aware that it was not being talked about. That\u2019s another thing,\nyou know, because what -- when I was in Switzerland with my aunt and uncle, it was\nso overwhelming. My aunt talks about it incessantly. But I don\u2019t th -- and I don\u2019t --\ndidn\u2019t know any survivors here, really. So I just thought well, you know, if I thought\nanything I would have thought well, why would Americans -- I think I -- I underst --\nI think -- I know what -- I remember that, you know, there were many mo -- there\nwere movies, like war-time movies, American war-time movies. Liberation movies.\nAnd I think it was more in my -- my mind, m-more work toward, you know, being\nliberated and what that felt like. The -- you know, being helped by the United States,\nI remembered UNRRA packages, things of that nature more, and I was just so\ninvolved in like present day issues, as I si -- mentioned, the politics of -- of the day\nthat I -- I don\u2019t think that was very much on my mind.",
        "Q: Interesting though, that you had -- that experience was, very clearly what moved\nyou in the direction that you went in, to help other people who were --",

And, you know, I mothered those kids til the day I\nretired, and I still do, to some extent, but it was just -- it was an overwhelming job\nsometimes. And some -- those kids who were -- who were at Lourdes had huge\namounts of problems and -- and you know, y-you had to constantly be looking after\nthem. And there were Cambodian kids too, and they were suicidal and they had, you\nknow, just --",

So, it was -- you\nknow, I was just really too involved with that. I mean, what -- think about it, I started\nteaching it -- teaching there in \u201976 - \u201977 school year. Elliot had just come there, he\nwas in 10\" grade and Wanda was in 12\" grade. I was in -- I was 38 - 39. I-It was all\nI could do.",

        "Q: Yeah. How did your kids respond to -- number one, they knew your story, but\nyour working with these other kids?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, they just sort of accepted it. They were just used to -- our house\nwas very open and -- and you know, I had kids come to the house. We had parties in\nour house, I have -- we had -- I had big di -- Thanksgiving dinners for them. I\ncooked a dinner -- they still do it at BCC, it\u2019s continued. Th-The -- the tradition had\ncontinued. I had Thanksgiving, a whole Thanksgiving turkey, which we served like\nthe week before Thanksgiving and we had a dinner at my house for everybody in\nESL. Eventually it got too big. We had a few since I moved into this house, when --\nfortunately was larger house, so we could do it. But then -- then we started doing it\nat school. So the kids were just sort of like part of it, and -- but sometimes not as\ninvolved as I would have wanted them to be actually, because they were just -- you\nknow they were just American kids, who wanted to be with other American kids and\nI\u2019m -- I\u2019ve always had trouble getting American kids to participate with -- with\nforeign kids. They -- I -- I -- you know, as open as I -- I always say when they say,\noh Americans don\u2019t like us, or this and that. And I say no, no, no, you know,\nAmericans are very open and they\u2019re very accepting, and I think generally they are.\nBut there always is sort of a divide, nevertheless and you know, I felt like I was\nalways sort of there to be between them and -- and that other world. And funny that I\nnever felt-- I know that there are people who feel -- and there are many foreign ESL\nteachers now, I mean foreign born ESL teachers now, and very often they will feel\nwith the kids against that outside. But I never did. I just always felt that I was the\nAmerican. And you know, people ca -- kids ask me, you know, where I\u2019m from and\nI said, well, I\u2019m from here, but I wasn\u2019t born here. I\u2019Il tell them right away. But --\nand -- and I often tell them when they ask me about it, I say well, that\u2019s why I can\nunderstand you better, because I had this -- I went through the same experience. Of\ncourse, I was very lucky in that I had someone to take care of me and guide me and -\n- and I knew the language and -- and I was educated and makes a big difference.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Makes a huge difference. But even the way I grew up, I grew up, you know, in a\nsmall town with sort of a -- it -- it\u2019s very funny because Yugoslavia 1s -- I mean,\nCroatia now, but Yugoslavia certainly, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- really a class society. It\u2019s a -- a\n-- United States is too, but we -- we claim we aren\u2019t. And to some extent, even\nthough we are, I -- I think there is an easier way of -- th-the -- the division, the\nvertical division isn\u2019t nearly as strong as it is there. And I g -- I grew up -- I know\nthat sounds funny because of what had happened to me, but I grew up privileged in\nmany ways, you know, because I was sort of [speaks foreign language here] which\nmeans sort of like a -- from a noble family, you know. But that\u2019s because of my\nuncle, not so much -- and -- and I was always taught that -- that you had to ha -- to\nhelp and -- and be -- I know that sounds awfully patrician, but was like, you know, to\nnot lord it over kids who have less, and to give. And -- and be helpful, and it just\nkind of stayed with me. So that -- so it comes to me naturally to -- to -- to do -- you\nknow, to work, to -- to work with these all -- kids. I had all -- both of those things,\nyou know. To having come from di -- from -- from that background and then -- then\ncome from -- then come to this country. So it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s sort of a double whammy. It\nwas sort of I s -- I often instinctively understood, or I think I understood.",

        "A: Because in \u201899 I retired from Montgomery county public schools. Not that I\ncouldn\u2019t have gone on, but a lot of my friends were retiring and I was getting a bit\ntired of being there morning, noon and night, from seven in the morning til who\nknows what hour and then doing work in the evening. And the school was closing\nfor two years and moving to another venue, and while --while BCC was being\nrebuilt. And I thought well, that\u2019s sort of -- I -- and I just -- I -- I had just turned 60\nand I thought, well, it\u2019s an opportune moment for me to close down, so I don\u2019t have\nto pack and repack and unpack and okay, so this 1s it. So I had just retired, and --\nwhen -- and I -- of course I knew Lucie Rosenberg for awhile. Actually, an ESL\nperson who is a mutual friend introduced us, and -- some years ago, and she had\nstarted telling me about that -- about this material arriving from Jasenovac, and from\nCroatia and that she had started working on it. And then I asked her about it again\nand again. And I had started working immediately back for the county, but on a part\ntime basis as a -- as a -- a consultant. So I was working basically two days a week\nand I had more time and I said well, you know, let me take a look at it and she said\nshe never -- she hadn\u2019t wanted to ask me to come, but she was thrilled that I would\nwant to go. But she hadn\u2019t wanted to ask me because she thought it would be too\nclose to home for me, emotionally. And -- but I said yeah, I\u2019m pretty tough, I\u2019Il look\nat it. So I went one time with her and Sanya. They were working on this material that\nhad arrived from Jasenovac and that was in Linthicum, ready to be -- well, they had\nalready been working on it, was in -- totally in process -- in progress. But they were\ndoing everything from classifying material, a written material to packing forks and\nknives and spoons that had been found in camp. Not knives, forks and spoons that\nhave been unearthed from the camp, into envelopes and marking them to -- you\nknow, writing translations of letters and there was one cookbook and things of that\nnature. And I said fine, P\u2019Il do 1t with you once a week, so we went there once a\nweek and started working on it, and that\u2019s how I started doing it.",

        "A: Just names. I did s -- find an -- names of my father and my uncle. Nobody else.\nBut of course, I had seen -- I ha -- I had -- came late, and they had looked at most of\nthe list before that. Lucy found some things for me. In the museum there are other\nthings that we found that had been borrowed from the archives before and they are\nalready on microfiche in the li -- in the museum. There are -- there are papers from\nmy mother\u2019s side of the family. Grandfather, aunt, uncle, all my mother\u2019s side of the\nfamily, cousins. There are p -- there are papers that they had to -- f-forms they had to\nfill out declaring their worldly goods and that\u2019s -- tha-that\u2019s very sad to just look at,\nyou know, because here it is, you know, a nine year old child declaring her\npossessions and it says things like, you know, one winter coat, one spring jacket,\nthree dresses, two pairs of shoes, one gold chain. You know, it\u2019s just awful, just\nawful. So, you know, I continue working on it, P\u2019ve -- P\u2019ve -- I-I can steel myself and\ndo these things because I feel like the language is so important, and there are so few\npeople that can translate and so -- and that can un -- that understand that world, so --\nso I do it.

I just sort of -- I think what I -- what I did\nis not that it didn\u2019t touch me, but I didn\u2019t allow me -- allow it to touch me.

        "A: Those years not even so -- yeah, I suppose so. I just -- you know, early childhood\nand you know, just thinking about what had happened. And I would just always say\nwell, I was very lucky and you know, I -- I know other people suffered and suffered\nterribly, but I was very lucky, so I\u2019Il just take my luck and run with it. But it\u2019s not --\nit\u2019s -- right now I don\u2019t feel differently about myself, but I -- I think it -- I think it\nwas -- I have a greater understanding. I-I think it\u2019s still sort of intellectual rather than\nemotional. I still don\u2019t like the emotional to -- to get me.

And -- but I can -- that out of --\nout of these ashes -- I don\u2019t want to be -- I don\u2019t want to be dramatic, but that\nsomething good comes, that I -- you know, the never again business 1s -- is\nimportant, and -- and it\u2019s -- and it\u2019s real. And I -- I think that it does -- the history\ndoes need to be understood, and -- and -- and I don\u2019t understand enough so -- so --\nbut I have -- so -- so I\u2019m -- I\u2019ve been learning, because I\u2019ve had to -- I\u2019ve had to\nlearn about things, you know. Like, for example I\u2019m -- never knew because certainly\nwasn\u2019t taught to me, anything about what was happening in Dalmatia during that\ntime, for example, to Jews. I mean I don\u2019t ha -- didn\u2019t have the foggiest idea about,\nyou know, the -- the camps that were run wa -- you know, in Italy and -- I mean, I --\nI saw Italians as the enemy, because that\u2019s what I was taught. The Italians were the\nsouthern enemy and it was very nice when we got rid of them, and we won against\nthem, but of course, you know -- and it was the partisans, of course, that chased them\nout of Dalmatia. That was how I saw things. Never a -- never realizing, you know,\nthat if not for Italians, many more Jews would have been killed, and that, you know,\nthat m -- some -- many of my friends survived there a -- and that, you know, th-there\nwere uprisings there. There was the first Jewish brigade. I mean, all of that, that --\nthat whole -- that whole chunk of history I knew nothing about. And I\u2019m very\ngrateful that I do know it, and --",
        "Q: When you came to this work, did you have -- I think I know the answer, but I\nwant to ask, did you have questions that you needed answered, or you just came\nupon these things not knowing that you\u2019d had gaps in your knowledge?",
        "A: No, I knew that I had gaps, and --",
        "Q: And -- and -- but now that you\u2019ve done this for a few years, do -- do you -- has it\ncompleted something in you that was incomplete? Has it answered questions for you\nthat you maybe didn\u2019t even know you had?",
        "A: Yeah, I think it -- it does, and -- and it -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s the questions, some that I\nperhaps didn\u2019t know I had, but some that I did know I had. Cause I had -- I think I\nwas very aware that I had, and I still have big chunks of -- of missing knowledge,\nhistorical knowledge. And of course, you know, I would like to know more about,\nyou know, how -- what my family did, or I -- you know, I -- especially my mother\u2019s\nside of the family, there 1s nobody living to know about their childhood and I know\nnothing, and I have lots and lots of pictures, and I always knew that I -- I always\nknow that I knew more about them, because my uncle lived there, too, and so I knew\nabout them. But I don\u2019t know anything about their, you know, feelings, thoughts,\nwhere they were going, what they were doing. And I remember my cousins very\nwell, and I's -- I do miss them. Because I grew up with those pictures, you know, and\nit\u2019s kind of sad. I grew up with those pictures and I grew up with -- with their clothes\nand their toys, and when I think about that sometimes, it\u2019s a sort of a -- an emotional\nsoft par -- spot. But -- but in terms of just general knowledge of what was going on\nthere, I -- I have -- I have chunks that I still don\u2019t -- don\u2019t know, and -- and I just -- I\njust sort of s -- thought, you know, oh, I don\u2019t want to -- I don\u2019t want to think about\nit, I don\u2019t want to know it because I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t want to feel sad and I don\u2019t want\nto feel upset, and -- and you know, people say to me now, you know, oh it\u2019s so brave\nof you to work there. And I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s brave of me to work there, but it\u2019s not --\nit\u2019s not the most amusing thing, let\u2019s put it that way. I mean, you know, yo-you have\nthat yourself, you know, how much of that do you want to hear? And I grew -- I\njoined a group a few years ago, since I\u2019ve started working -- well, maybe not.",

        "A: Mm-hm.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Dora Klayman. This is tape number three, side A. You -- you started to say that\nyou joined a group --",
        "A: I joined a group of child Holocaust survivors in the area, Washington area, do\nyou know about that group? It was just by accident. I sort of didn\u2019t even realize it\nwas -- that it existed. And then I found out about it from a fellow who also originally\ncame from Croatia. I met him at Flori Dragota\u2019s and he 1s, you know, very -- has\nvery different reactions from mine, and he\u2019s quite bitter and unhappy in many ways.\nAnd he said that this is the place that he\u2019s very happy with, because he could never\ntalk about what had happened, which I didn\u2019t have any trouble w -- you a -- asked\nme that before. I didn\u2019t go around talking about it, but 1f anybody ever asked, I\ntalked about it. Well, he said he -- he wa-was into denial in many ways, until he met\nthis group. And I can\u2019t remember exactly when the group put itself together and\nhow, but it\u2019s fairly decent size, and it -- it did one thing for me, and that is it said,\nokay, I am a Holocaust survivor, because children -- and that -- everybody 1n that\ngroup says that, that those of us, especially those of us who were hidden, that\u2019s really\nthe -- I mean, there is now a special group for that, but among this group of\nchildhood Holocaust survivors, some of them were in camps and some of them were\nnot. Many were not. And -- like my -- my daughter-in-law\u2019s mother, from -- who is\nfrom Poland lost practically all of her family. Everybody except her -- I think one\nuncle and her mother. And she is much more acting traum -- was much more\ntraumatized by it -- by it than I. And she mentions it -- something about the\nHolocaust practically every time I see her. Now, whether she does it because she\nknows I went through the experience, or whether it\u2019s general, I don\u2019t know. But\npeople either -- I know people who talk about it a lot, like my aunt, or people who\nnever talk about it. I was probably someplace in the middle. And s-so -- so this --\nthis -- this fellow said they will -- had this group and I said oh, I\u2019d like to come and\nsee. So I have joined the group since, and have -- it\u2019s supposed -- it\u2019s been\ninteresting to listen to other people\u2019s experiences, and to -- to see to what extent -- I -\n- |\u2019m -- I was also trying to categorize, you know, are people who lived in camps\ndifferent from those who didn\u2019t, or there a -- are -- there 1 -- there is a sort of great\naffinity among people who came from different countries, I noticed. You know, just\nto -- there are many people from Poland, for example, and many -- fewer from\nGermany or certainly fewer from Croatia. And people meet -- we meet once a month\nand people bring food to share and there is a program. And some of the program --\nfor a long time they did almost nothing but taken turns to talk about --",
        "Q: Themselves.",
        "A: -- themselves.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And many of them would say that this is the first time that they had talked about\nthemselves to anybody. And many of them have talked about their relationship to\ntheir kids, or how their kids don\u2019t really -- some of them feel that their kids don\u2019t\ncare to hear about it, and others have kids who are very involved, and -- an-and so on\nand so forth. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s been sort of an eye opener for me, too.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: To be -- to be with these people. Some of them are involved in doing volunteer\nwork, many of -- a number of them are volunteering at the Holocaust museum. And\nso that\u2019s sort of been an interesting experience for me, too.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And -- so | -- I find that I much m -- some of them have become personal friends,\nSo it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s sort of the -- somehow I\u2019m so more -- so much more involved in\nthinking or doing or m -- or meeting with people. I went to th -- there was a --\nrecently, just a few months ago there was a huge meeting at the Mayflower of the\nhidden children. So it\u2019s a -- you know, with seminars and -- and speeches and\npersonal explorations, and -- so this is just a -- sort of another world I\u2019ve sort of been\nin lately.",

        "A: Yeah, they know the story.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They nev -- they don\u2019t ask questions. I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve yet to -- ask to see -- to hear one\nof them -- well, maybe they asked questions as children, I can\u2019t remember. But right\nnow, as adults, maybe they feel that they know everything. They don\u2019t ask, I don\u2019t\ntell anything. I just -- we never get on that subject.",
        "Q: Do you think -- oftentimes people s-say their kids are afraid to ask because they\nthink it\u2019s painful for you.",
        "A: Possible. I have never asked. I think now we are getting to a stage where my\ngrandchildren will know about it. In fact, Daniella, who 1s now nine and a half\nstarted talking about Anne Frank recently. Apparently her mother has been reading it\nwith her. And I don\u2019t -- I didn't talk to Iona, to her mother, to see what that was all\nabout. Daniella is pretty with it, so you know, she -- for a nine and a half year old,\nshe -- she reads well, and she understands a lot. And the other day we were talking\nabout the black experience, and she was talking to me about the underground\nrailroad. So I\u2019m sure she could understand some of that. She goes to Hebrew school,\nso they must have been talking about -- about it there for Yom HaShoah.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: But I have not had the time to sit down with her and sort of obliquely say\nsomething to see if she will come up with something. Obviously I\u2019m not going to\nstart telling her anything unless I feel that she must know. I -- I -- you know, with\nyour grandchildren you don\u2019t know exactly when they\u2019re ready for what, because\nyou don\u2019t have them every day and I-I -- I don\u2019t want to dump anything on them.",
        "Q: Yeah. It\u2019s always an interesting -- there\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s an interesting issue that comes up\nin all these interviews is, when do you tell them --",
        "A: When do you tell.",
        "Q: -- how do you tell them, and --",
        "A: [have not the foggiest idea, I have no memory of when I told my kids. I think\nprobably they were asking question -- you know, they were in Croatia with me when\nthey were very little. And I probably told them early that my parents were killed in a\nwar. I don\u2019t know whether I told them how, or -- I think I told them why. And I may\nhave told them how, I may have told them they got killed in concentration camps,\nbut they probably found out later on what that meant. I don\u2019t know that -- I don\u2019t\nknow -- I d -- Id -- I do -- I can\u2019t think of th -- of any time when I had this moment\nwhere I would sit them down and talk to them about it, no.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I may have, but I rather doubt it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What -- wh-wh-what was it like for you when war broke out again in the\n90\u2019s?",
        "A: Oh, I was very upset. And again, that probably again has to do with my\nexperience in post-war Yugoslavia as a -- as a product of communist education. I\nreally felt like they -- they -- they need to stay together. I -- and I -- I just wanted\nUnited States to go and bomb Serbia and stop the war. I think I was right, but the\nCroats -- I still feel -- think I was right, but I don\u2019t know whether you were reading\nLouis in the \u201cNew York Times.\u201d He -- I -- I really agreed with his point of view. I\nthink people here -- I mean, the politicians here, the government felt -- you know,\nthey thought it was going to be another Vietnam. No, I mean, Iraq is going to be\nanother Vietnam, but herl -- but Yugoslavia could have been saved, but not by -- by\ndoing what [indecipherable] was doing, like siding with Milosevic. But -- but by\ngetting him out of power and -- and reestablishing law and order and -- and -- and\nsome semblance of democracy.",
        "Q: During those early days when Slovenia broke away and then it was sort of --",
        "A: Croatia.",
        "Q: -- Croatia -- tension was building in Croatia and then Bosnia. Were your friends\nasking you what -- what\u2019s going on wi -- because I remember I --",
        "A: Everybody.",
        "Q: Yeah. Who -- who could understand it? I mean, it\u2019s just -- it was so hard for\npeople to grasp.",
        "A: I was trying to explain to them -- everybody was asking me and I was trying to\nexplain that it\u2019s not a Vietnam and that it could be stopped easily. I think it could\nhave been stopped very easily from the beginning. I was starting to explain that there\nare -- th-the business of, you know, the ethnic animosity is age long -- you know,\nages long. Well, of course there were, but I mean -- so there are between the north\nand the south in the United States, but we don\u2019t go killing each other, you know.\nYeah, there are -- there are crazies running around in bars and stripes, so what, you\nknow? And the fact that I felt like, you know, you could have -- yo -- if you had that\nkind of leadership in United States, you could have this country in a -- in turmoil at\nno time at all. You get a lot of those Nazi party types, or you know, David whatever\nhis name was, or somebody elected t-t --",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about the guy from Louisiana?",
        "A: Yes, what was his name?",
        "Q: Can\u2019t think of his last name.",
        "A: I mean, people like that can stir up ethnic hatreds in two seconds. I mean, you\nknow, Latinos, blacks, you know, the -- cities could burn. I mean, you have to -- you\nhave to have the kind of leadership that says no, this will not do. We cannot have\nthat kind of behavior and -- and do -- instead of allowing that kind of -- that kind of,\nyou know, leadership to -- to go on, I -- I just -- I just felt like it was -- it\u2019s such a\npity. I mean, my Croatian friends, mind you, don\u2019t feel that way. I mean, they feel\nthat -- they feel that they are -- they are very happy to be rid of Serbs. They are very\nhappy to be rid of Yugoslavia and communism. Okay, communism I can see, but\nyou know, if they wanted to separate, it could have been done later, I mean the -- but\nif, you know, if Romania can make it, and -- and Poland can make it, Yugoslavia\ncould have made it. I don\u2019t know. I -- I -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a pity, I think. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Yeah. ... What -- I -- \u2019ve kind of come across all my questions, but there must be\nthings that I didn't hit upon. I mean, obviously we could go on for a long time, but\nthere must be something that I haven\u2019t asked you that you\u2019d like to talk about, or\nsome --",
        "A: [inaudible] have anything, I don\u2019t know. ... I don\u2019t know, what didn\u2019t we talk\nabout?",

        "A: You think?",
        "Q: -- that I\u2019ve done, because in -- I don\u2019t know, you seem to have, probably because\nof -- it\u2019s probably a personality thing, but you\u2019ve moved so -- 1n such a straight line\nand -- and eithe -- coped well, it seems like in -- in -- 1n every --",
        "A: It must be personality. I was really lucky.",
        "Q: In every phase, in ever -- well, you think of yourself as lucky, too, you know?",
        "A: Mm-hm. Yeah.",
        "Q: So you\u2019ve adapted to a lot of tre-tremendous upheaval.",

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- and you seem to have really had a pragmatic, sort of optimistic way of dealing\nwith all these things.",
        "A: True, and I think -- I think it\u2019s my Shoah tape, I -- which I haven\u2019t seen the whole\nthing either, but I remember doing it and I remember talking about everything and I\ncried at the very end because I think -- well, I think as the loss of my parents as\nbeing a horrendous thing. I think it was horrendous for them, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as\nhorrendous for me, which is a horrible thing to say, but because I have no memory of\nit. I can imagine what must have been like, now that I have children. After I had\nchildren, I was thinking of it. What must have been like for my parents to have given\nme away\u201d Basically, that\u2019s what they did. And even worse for my -- to -- to give\naway my brother. [phone ringing |[tape break]",
        "Q: -- it\u2019s harder -- you think harder when they gave up your brother?",
        "A: I think about my brother because I left -- I left almost like I\u2019m going to my\ngrandparents and I\u2019m going sort of like --",

        "A: -- who knows, you know, for a visit and maybe I\u2019Il be back. Maybe\n[indecipherable] maybe -- maybe it\u2019Il be -- all be okay. But my brother, they were\nalready in jail and he was a baby and my mother handed him away. So it must have\nbeen just horrendous. I think for me and my -- of course, my uncle died when he was\nin his 80\u2019s, so that was sad, but you expect older people to die. But to lose my\nhusband when I did was really a horrendous experience. That was the worst.",
        "Q: Yeah. You were quite young.",
        "A: Yeah, I was 54. And I think -- the reason I say I\u2019m luck -- I was lucky -- and I\nwas, because I had these people through my life, you know, first my uncle and then\nmy husband, who really were there for me to lean on and -- and -- and just continue,\nyou know, in my nice, as you say, straight way. If not for them, I don\u2019t know what\nmy life would have been like. It would have been -- I -- I may have -- I -- I was born\nwith -- with -- with a person -- with this personality, but who knows how my\npersonality would have been developed had I not had them. So, yes I\u2019m lucky that I\nwas -- that I was born -- I mean, it\u2019s good that I was born this way and I ha -- that I\nhave the personality I have, but -- but I was extremely lucky to -- to have -- to have\nhad that op -- you know, to have had these people in my life. And -- and later on,\nyou know, to have my children, who are, you know, who were here, and -- and a lot\nof friends. That, of course, you know, could have all been different. Let\u2019s say that I\ncontinued living in Long Island, let\u2019s say that I didn't meet my husband, that I went\nback to Yugoslavia. I\u2019m very glad to have -- to have been able to -- to turn back\ntoward being Jewish, which I knew nothing about. I knew I was Jewish, but 1t meant\nnothing.",
        "Q: When did it start to mean something to you?",
        "A: I think -- you know, I have early, early remembrances both pro and con. I don\u2019t\nthink I ever told anybody this story. I remember in ne -- a story of rejection. I had a\nlittle -- this 1s true confession story. I don\u2019t think I ever told anyone. I -- I remember\nthat I had, I don\u2019t know why it was mine, but I had a little Mogen Davide, that was\nfamily\u2019s. And why, at one time, must have been in one of those times when I felt like\nbeing Jewish was horrible because, you know, children told me that Jews killed\nChrist and it was terrible. And I gave that away. I gave it to one of my -- one of the\nlike farmer girls, peasant girls. And I said, well, I\u2019m not going to need this. So that\u2019s\nstory one. Then story two, I remember finding papers in the house, and I found a --\nthe music for [indecipherable] and I could play the piano and I played that and\nsomehow like from some other world, that sounded very emotionally stirring to me.\nAnd I don\u2019t know how old I was. I was fairly young. And then, of course, came my -\n- the watershed trip to -- to -- to Switzerland, when all of a sudden I found myself in\nan Orthodox family. And -- but -- but I had such a good feeling toward my uncle,\nthat -- my father\u2019s brother. I-I remember seeing him as he waited -- he came to wait\nfor me at the border and the train came into the border and I\u2019m looking out a window\nand I\u2019m thinking, am I going to recognize him? But I did, and he recognized me\nimmediately. We did exchange pictures, but still I thought I might not recognize\nhim, and I was fairly scared. That was 1954, I think, I was young and -- high school\nkid. And I had this really very warm experience and very emotional experience that\nthis was someone I was related to. I had never -- I -- I hadn\u2019t -- from the time that I\nwas like seven, when I saw my other co -- uncle for the last time, I never had any --\nmet any family members. It was so -- it was stirring. And then coming into this\nfamily, I was very willing to -- to learn and to find out and to think -- to accept the\nfact that I was Jewish and -- and everything that went with it. And you know, at that\npoint, I mean that -- that -- that -- that Mogen Davide experience was I must have\nbeen like eight years old or something. Was very long time ago. And -- but I -- I\nremembered it because I often thought about it later and I kind of regretted it. So it\nwas -- it was sort of a new -- an -- an -- an -- an experience that -- that I was willing\nto -- to accept and it just felt -- it felt right, just sort of right. And, you know, when --\nwhen I met Dan, of course, I -- I didn\u2019t know he was Jewish, because I couldn\u2019t tell\nJews. I can -- you know, now I can. It\u2019s like I couldn\u2019t tell on the phone somebody\nwho was from the south, and certainly someone who was black, I couldn\u2019t tell. I\nremember being totally surprised that Dan once got off the phone and said, this was\na black lady and she wanted to know this and that. I was like, how do you know?\nYou were on the phone. Are you clairvoyant or something? I didn\u2019t understand\nanything about language, and so I couldn\u2019t un -- I didn\u2019t know anything about\npeople\u2019s physiognomy or recognizing anything special, or expressions or anything.\nAnyway -- and of course -- and he -- he, who would normally have recognized it,\ndidn\u2019t recognize it in me because he never expected the Jew from Yugoslavia, in\nYugoslavia, I should say. Because you know, people think, oh well, they were all\nannihilated and who knows whether there were any. I mean, who knows --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- what about Yugoslavia? Dan was really savvy, but still he didn\u2019t know. So I\nremember when -- when the excitement, overall excitement, and I -- you see, I -- I ex\n-- | w -- this is -- this is actually going back to one of your questions that I -- I would\ntell people. In like my third letter I wrote to him about my history, because he asked\nme what I was doing in Switzerland. And I would have just said I\u2019m visiting 1n -- an\nuncle and an aunt.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But I went through the whole story and I told him that -- that they had survived\nBergen-Belsen and they are in Switzerland since the end of the war, and that my\nparents had been killed, and that -- that I\u2019m living with them for a year. And so he\nwrote immediately back in saying how excited he was to find out that I was Jewish\nbecause he was Jewish too, and there was great excitement in the -- in the family,\nbecause I told them. So it -- so that alone tells me that I was always very open about\nmy experience. And -- and I -- I just -- I just -- I don\u2019t know. I -- I just -- you know,\nfelt right about it. My aunt, of course, always says that it\u2019s in the blood because I -- I\nlearned all the kosher rules and everything very fast.",
        "Q: And about -- and how about your kids, are they religious?",
        "A: No, no. They\u2019re not religious. Wanda\u2019s particularly not religious, but -- but they\nfeel -- they -- they -- they feel very Jewish. Elliot is -- Elliot married a Jewish girl\nand they are -- they belong to Avas Israel and the kids go to Hebrew school. They\u2019re\nnot very religious, but they follow holidays and I don\u2019t know, you know. I think\nsome of it is Iona\u2019s doing. But that\u2019s often so, you know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Women --",
        "Q: Seem to be the carriers of the --",
        "A: -- seem to be the carriers, yeah, of -- of customs and so on. I don\u2019t know what\nElliot would have done on his own. Not that he doesn\u2019t feel very Jewish, but he may\nnot -- they don\u2019t -- neither of them 1s particularly observant.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So --",

        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Dora Klayman. This is tape number three, side B. Something that has\n-- often comes up 1s relationship with American relatives when you come here, a lot\nof people have had very tense relationships with their -- with people that they\u2019ve\nbecome related to. Someti -- you know, for all kinds of reasons. Sometimes because\nthere really isn\u2019t any understanding of what happened on either side. I\u2019m wondering\nwhat it -- if you\u2019d like to share something about that, if -- if -- if anything like that\nwas -- because sometimes, you know, somebody comes from another country, those\nwere times -- they were different times. And I know I -- you know, you heard all\nkinds of slurs about people who came to this country, no matter where they were\nfrom, east Europe -- from Europe or eastern Europe or whatever. So anyway, I\u2019m\njust wondering if you had --",
        "A: Well, another bit of luck. I think the fact that my in-laws and that whole\ngeneration of people, their siblings, were all immigrants. They all came early, but\nthey came in the 1920\u2019s, made a huge difference. So, my husband and -- and all the -\n- and his brother and all the cousins, they were all first generation. They had all\ngrown up with parents who talked about the old country, and so I was accepted\nabsolutely totally and completely into the family. And they have -- that family has\nbeen absolutely fantastic to me. And after Dan\u2019s death, cause he -- he was the oldest\nof the -- of the children, and he di -- of that generation -- he was the oldest of that\ngeneration and he died first. And the -- the ca -- the cousins -- well, his brother is,\nyou know, very close to me, but all -- but that\u2019s almost to be expected, but the\ncousins have all absolutely rallied around me and I am absolutely part of that family,\ntotally. The cousins that I mentioned before who were -- lived in Arlington, they\neventually returned, had lived all over and then they came from -- th-they\u2019re -- they\nwere in England and they\u2019re now in Arlington. And I see them all the time, we went\nto the march yesterday together. And the other cousin, this person\u2019s brother, Danny\nwho lives in Long Island, they were just here also, they went to a wedding here, and\nthey stayed with me. So it\u2019s just we\u2019re -- we are very -- everybody is very close, and\ntheir children are close to my children. My children, unfortunately, don\u2019t have any\ncousins. Their -- I only have these two children and my brother-in-law had no\nchildren and I have no siblings, so my children have no cousins. And they pretty\nmuch consider Dan\u2019s cousin\u2019s children their cousins and -- and they\u2019re quite close.\nSo I was s-super, super lucky on that score as well.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: In fact, A-A-Aunt Mara, my mother\u2019s sister, who lived a -- in Long Island and\nher -- her son Paul is exactly my age. And she was constantly telling him why o -- a-\nasking him why couldn\u2019t he cou -- why couldn\u2019t he go and marry somebody from\nEurope? That would be so nice. Oh, he married a no -- he married a lovely American\ngirl whom I adore, Joan, and that\u2019s that. But anyway, they -- the -- that -- I did not\nhave that -- that problem, because, m-mainly I think people face that with families\nwho have, you know, been here for a very long time and -- and have gotten totally,\nyou know, 1m -- Americanized. My in-laws were -- used to joke that you can take --\nwhich is probably why they lived the way I -- they lived, you know, I -- we used to\nsay that -- that they came out of the shtetl, but they couldn\u2019t -- you can take them out\nof the shtetl, but you can\u2019t take the shtetl out of them, you know. And you know,\nMom was always satisfied with very little. She never wanted very much of anything,\nyou know, and they -- they were super -- had super modest way of life. And just, you\nknow, they were very, very -- still very, very much part of the old country, even\nthough, you know the-they came here, they stru -- they really struggled hard in life.\nMy father-in-law came here with no English. He was 20 years old. He came with no\nmoney. How he ever -- and he was not a | -- a -- a -- a language learner. In fact, I\nmean, to hi -- to the end of his life, and he died in his 90\u2019s, he spoke English in si --\nwith -- with great deal of Yiddish and -- thrown in and whatever. And -- but he -- he\n-- and he -- but he made it through -- through -- through school and -- and got a d --\ndegree in pharmacy and became a pharmacist, a licensed pharmacist in the state -- in\nthe state of New York, and -- and had -- had -- had a small, you know, sort of\nprofessional kind of a drugstore, you know, not -- no -- no pri -- n-no counter, just --\njust drugs. So, you know, how they made it on, you know -- a-and so every fe --\nevery little bit that they had, it was like there and preserved and -- and so they lived a\nsort of -- in -- and they were very, very American in their eye -- you know, pro-\nAmerican, but their outlook was very much steeped in Europe, in old Europe, yeah.\nAnd it\u2019s -- Mom went to -- Mom came -- had a easier time coming, because she\nalready had an uncle here. But you know, she -- you know, th-th-they -- they were\nalso lucky in a sense that they -- they got educated reasonably well in Europe. They\nboth went through high school, which was not a very common thing in those days in\n-- in Russian. So -- and Mom spoke English quite well, and sh-she was much more\nof a language person than Pop, but -- and, you know, we had -- we had the usual,\nyou know, daughter, in-laws relationship sometimes, where you -- but -- but the --\nth-the -- the problems I had with them were mostly problems that my husband had\nwith them, too, rather than, you know, just you know, mostly -- I don\u2019t know what\nthe problems were like, you know, are you going to buy this sofa or that sofa, or you\ncan\u2019t buy the house, it\u2019s so expensive.",

        "Answer: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Wow. It was a very strange way that -- that I got married, to begin with, and I\ndon\u2019t remember how much time I had to talk about that. But I mentioned at that time\nthat I met my husband a year before, and we met on the train. All that was there, I\nthink. And so I haven\u2019t actually seen him prior to that, for a whole year. Prior to the\nwedding, I mean. For a whole year. He came two weeks before our wedding. And I\nhad never in my life seen a Jewish wedding, and I have never -- so I really didn't\nknow exactly what was going to happen. And very differently from weddings that\nI\u2019m witnessing now, including my sons. It never even occurred to me to think about\narranging for anything or thinking about anything except my dress. That was about\nthe only thing I thought about. And everything else I sort of just let be. It\u2019s like\nsomebody -- was somebody else\u2019s thing to do it, a sort of -- sort of like I was going\nto a party, and my col -- main -- my -- my main concern was to think about, you\nknow, Dan\u2019s coming and how 1s that going to be? Am I st -- am I truly, really in love\nor am I just making things up? Am I just bored in Switzerland, or unhappy in\nSwitzerland or lonely? Because, of course, I had come there only -- less than a year\nbefore and I'd left all my friends behind in -- in Croatia and Yugoslavia. Had a\nboyfriend whom I, you know, forgot the minute I got on the train. Obviously it\nwasn\u2019t a very serious thing. And I lived a totally, totally different life in Switzerland\nthan I had ever thought I would live. I mean, not only did I not know about Jewish\nweddings, I didn\u2019t know anything about Jewish period. And you know, I knew very\nlittle on -- my experience was one month in Switzerland before that, and I -- you\nknow, a few years before that. So everything was sort of going to [indecipherable]\nplus I was going to meet my aunt and uncle, who were coming in from Switzerland -\n- from -- I\u2019m sorry, from Israel, and I had never seen them as a adult.",
        "A: That\u2019s my father\u2019s brother and my father\u2019s sister, both of whom decided to come\nin for my wedding. And so there were so many different things. I mean, I have -- I-I\nhave -- I had very little -- almost no contact with them. My aunt, of course, I didn't\neven see a -- at all after the war. I only had pictures, I knew she existed. My father\u2019s\nsister.",
        "A: Lina. That was Lina who married a wi -- a Weesler, and I knew that she had two\nchildren and I had the -- I had the daughter\u2019s photograph with me when I was living\nin -- in Yugoslavia. Her photograph was left because was -- had been sent to my\nmaternal grandparents, must be. I don\u2019t know how I got that photograph. And it was\nshe as a child, and it\u2019s a beautiful little girl with -- and she\u2019s holding a gorgeous doll.\nAnd I had that after the war. And it was sort of like all -- like looking at Shirley\nTemple, like a movie star or something, because we didn\u2019t have such dolls or such\nclothes or such anything. So that was -- that -- that was my only image of -- of this\naunt with this daughter, my dau -- my cousin Dina who now lives in Israel. And her -\n- her -- she had a brother, Rubin, whom -- whose picture I did not have and I -- he\nalso now lives in Israel and of course, we now we know -- know each other. So -- so\nmy aunt was coming. And then my uncle was coming, whom I last saw, I think as a\nseven or eight year old in Yugoslavia, because he came back from the prisoner of\nwar camps -- camp. He was in Germany during the war. He was in the Yugoslav\narmy when the war started and so he -- he was -- he survived as a prisoner of war, he\ncame back. He married a woman he met there in Yugoslavia, I think he may have\nknown her from before. She and her three sisters had all together survived\nAuschwitz. Oh, it\u2019s a unbelievable story which I can\u2019t get her to talk about on tape,\nwhich I wish I could. They now live in Israel. But at that time he came -- he came,\nhe found me in Ludbreg where I was living during the war, and he -- I remember that\nhe -- he tried to talk to me about going with him, and I refused to go. I remem -- sort\nof remember that conversation. I -- I -- I had that memory, and of course he left me a\npicture, which I have, which you know, beautiful handwriting says, this is a -- in\nmemor -- to remember him by. And he\u2019s wearing his army uniform. So, all of a\nsudden this aunt and uncle were going to come to the wedding. So that was going to\nbe that. And of course my m -- my future mother-in-law was coming with my\nhusband on the boat. And her brother, who is -- who survived the war -- actually th -\n- my husband\u2019s family left -- left Russia actually mol -- Moldavia -- Moldova in the\nearly 1900\u2019s, but this brother went to -- to France rather than to the States. And he\nremained in Paris studying medicine. As a physician went to Oran, to al -- Algeria,\nmarried there, had one child. And during the conflict in Algeria with the liberation of\nAlgeria from France, they came to live in Marseille. And they had a -- at the time of\nmy marriage, they had a 13 year old -- 12 year old son. So they were coming to the\nwedding as well, and my brother-in-law, whom I| had met bef -- before he came to\nvisit me one time in Switzerland. And everybody, of course, had waited for my\nbrother-in-law Leon to -- to inform everyone, you know, who is this person that my\nhusband was getting -- my future husband was getting ready to marry. And Leon is,\nyou know, he\u2019s darling, he\u2019s here all the time, we are very close now. But a -- he\nwasn\u2019t very -- there\u2019s a big joke that at the time he only wrote to them, keep smiling.\nThat\u2019s about what he sent to New York. And we had a good time, you know, we --\nwe -- when he came to visit, which was -- it would be before the wedding. And you\nknow, we -- we rowed the boat and sang row, row, row the boat on Lake Geneva,\nand had a good time. But he -- he didn't tell me -- I mean, he was telling me things\nabout Dan, but it was -- my future husband, but it was like, you know, sort of. So I\nhad to de -- still depend on my letters, so he didn't -- wasn\u2019t very explicit. So -- and\nthen of course -- so all these people were coming, and -- and Dan was coming two\nweeks ahead of time. And I think my -- so my wedding memories really go back to -\n- mostly to that day when he arrived.",
        "A: And getting ready for his arrival.",
        "A: And that was more important than the wedding itself. And that looms sort of large\nin terms of preparation and anxiety and -- and what was I going to wear and what\nwas -- what was I going to look like and what he looked like and do I remember him,\netcetera, etcetera, etcetera.",
        "A: Yes, almost, not quite. Yeah, we -- we met in the fall of the previous year. And\nthis was -- yeah, it was almost a year, it was July 15\" -- I\u2019m sorry, August 15\" that\nhe arrived. We were married September one. So my aunt, who now lives in Israel,\nthe one who just recently did this interview with us. She remembers every single\ndetail and tells it over and over and over again. She sort of lived through that with\nme. And this was -- this was one sort of aspect also of the wedding, is that she -- she\nwas very lonely in -- in Switzerland. She was married to my uncle, my brother\u2019s --\nmy brother\u2019s ha -- I\u2019m sorry, my hu -- my father\u2019s brother. That was Yoshi and she\u2019s\nMonda. Monda and Yoshi survived Bergen-Belsen and ended up in Switzerland and\nhad two children there. They lived from the beginning from hand to mouth, 1n fact\nthey were in those camps, the relocation camps. And Monda got incredibly -- I don\u2019t\nknow, I think I should say traumatized by the experience more-so than any of my\nother relatives. And her whole family except for her sister was killed in -- in --\nduring the war, and she found herself now in this new country without a language,\nwithout any means and -- and having these children, and she became -- basically she\n-- she -- she spent all her time cleaning and cooking and just taking care and cleaning\nto the extent of being really beyond no-normal cleaning. I mean, to sacrificing any\nkind of -- much social contact. And they lived in this very closed Orthodox Jewish\ncommunity, where she didn\u2019t have true, true, good friends. And she tells me the\nstory that even my arrival was a sort of like they -- you know, they were wondering,\nyou know, how is this going to be, they didn't have much money. And how was this\ngoing to be, you know, they have to support another person. And I was going to the\nuniversity and I needed a bit of money for -- for tuition and for travel, because I --\nthey were in Montre and I had to travel to University of Lausanne by train. And they\nwere able to get a little scholarship for me from the Jewish community. But it was a\nvery close community. And what she found, and I\u2019m telling you what she says to\nme, what she found that -- that I became her best friend. Because at that point I was\n19 and she was 30 some -- could figure out how old she was, but I can\u2019t remember it\nnow. Anyway -- and when she found out that I had met my husband -- I mean my\nfuture husband on the train and when the letters arrived, she went through that\ncourtship with me, and almost sort of vicariously lived through that. And so when\nthe day came of the -- of the wa -- I mean, she remembers in detail what I said to her\nabout, you know, when he proposed and -- and you know, where she was sitting. She\nwas sitting in the -- she was working in the bathroom, cleaning something and I\ncame and -- and told her and just exactly what I told her, you know, and so it was\nlike a big thing for her, bigger than it was for me. I was like, yeah, I\u2019m getting\nmarried. Sort of a crazy 19 year old, 20 year old --",
        "A: -- by that point. So that I think, you know, she remembers in detail about -- and\ntells me all over again about, you know, my going to -- to get Dan at the -- at the\ntrain station, you know, wearing a -- a two piece blue dress with, you know, that was\n-- that was perfectly ironed and my nails were perfectly done, etcetera, etcetera. And\nit\u2019s funny because -- and of course, I think I told on the other tape that one of the --\nanyhow, I don\u2019t know, that -- that one of the nice things that my uncle had done for\nme is that before Dan came and I met him again, my uncle said, you know, the\nwedding is all arranged for, which was fine with me, I hadn\u2019t do -- done very much\nabout that. And -- but you have not -- you know, you think you want to get married,\nbut if something doesn\u2019t go right, you have two weeks and if you want to cancel it,\nit\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Which was --",
        "A: That was very great of him to say and I appreciated it then and I appreciate it\nmore as I am an adult and have children of my own. But he did say that, and so I\nhave that in the background, so I was feeling fairly safe and okay. And now, as an\nadult I look back and everybody says, my God, what a risk, you know, all of this\nthing was. But it didn\u2019t seen to me that way at all. I mean, you know, you marry --\nyou meet somebody, you like them, and you just get married.",
        "A: Uh-huh.\nkind of a celebrat -- celebration as part of it? You hear people say this, people who\ngot married in the late 40\u2019s --",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Probably less so.",
        "A: Maybe because -- because it was late -- so much later and because I was so young\nwhen I lost my parents. And I lived with my uncle -- my -- my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s\nhusband, whom I adored and he adored me. And you know, I star -- I started my life\nwith him when I was, you know, in elementary school. So -- so I was in -- it-it -- it\nwas, in a way, contrary to that 1-in -- in a sense that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to be\nat my wedding. So in a way, I -- I her -- I felt the absence of a parent, but not my real\nparents, because it was so far in the background. I mean, I know that that is how my\nuncle and my aunt felt, and -- and to my uncle it was extremely important. That\u2019s\nwhy, you know, my aunt tells me that to my uncle -- and he had told me -- he passed\naway in 90, but he told me how important it was to him that -- that there was this\ncontinuation and th -- it was extremely important to them that I marry someone who\nis Jewish and that was behind their inviting me, much -- very much so. And that was\nsaid to me. You know, they wanted me to -- to meet people because they knew at --\nmy aunt says that she knew that -- he knew that if I was left in Yugoslavia I wouldn\u2019t\nmarry somebody Jewish and that would be the end of that. There was just nobody to\nmeet there. And they thought I would meet someone in Montre, through them. And I\nmet people, but I had pre-empted it all by meeting Dan on the -- on the train. So -- so\nit was extremely important to them, it was -- it was for them, because they were that\ngeneration to -- who understood it. I ha -- I-I don\u2019t think I understood it fully.",
        "A: I may have understood it after my children were born, but at that time I didn\u2019t\ndwell much on the Holocaust and on the losses. I grew up happy and in school and\njust being fairly norm -- normal teenager. And I intellectually knew, but emotionally\n[I ru -- I -- you know, as a child I used to say things like oh, I have to do this. Now, if\nI had a mother, I wouldn\u2019t have to do that. But that\u2019s sort of more, you know, a kid\nthing, you know.",
        "A: I can -- I-I think, yeah, I had more of a kind of a response like maybe divorced --\ndivorced ch -- parents\u2019 children have, you know? If I didn\u2019t have this stepmother I\nwould be doing much better kind of thing. But some of it is totally unrealistic. So the\nfact that my uncle wasn\u2019t coming to the wedding was sad for me. And I had\noriginally when I -- when I decided that I would get married to Dan, I -- I -- I wou --\nI -- I was -- I wrote to him with great trepidation about that. My Swiss family was\nhappy bec -- because Dan was Jewish and everything. I translated all the letters and\nthey knew all the particulars, you know, and everything read well, so it was okay.\nBut my uncle, of course, knew nothing about that. My -- my uncle -- my -- Dietrich\nis what I called him, so Ill refer to him that way, probably easier. He knew nothing\nabout anything until I -- and in our house it was like an unspoken -- ma, what do I\nsay unspoken, it was a spoken word. You are not to get married until you graduate\nfrom the university. So here I am in my sophomore year and I\u2019m getting married to\nsomebody and taking off fre -- for -- for the United States, leaving, basically, you\nknow, him behind, which was mentioned in a very unkind way one of the books\nwritten about [indecipherable] and about him. But --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It just really bugged me. So -- but because I didn\u2019t sort of say, oh I\u2019m -- you\nknow, I\u2019m going to leave you, which is circumstances, and I certainly did\ncommunicate with him from now on and -- and [indecipherable] that. But -- but he\ncouldn\u2019t come because he di -- he was just not healthy enough and -- and strong\nenough to make the journey. And he wrote that -- you know, he wrote back saying\nthat if I -- if my aunt and uncle in Switzerland felt that it was a good thing for me to\ndo, then it was okay. So I went ahead. Anyway, so there are [indecipherable] sort of\na [indecipherable |",
        "A: 1958.",
        "A: Oh, it was very strange, it was -- it -- we couldn\u2019t get my visa on time, so we sort\nof spent a month in Europe. I had to go -- well, we got a visa. Oh, there was\nAmerican visa, of course meaning that you have to have your health checked, and\nthen you have to go and -- that -- but also my passport was expiring, my Yugoslav\npassport. So we had to go to Geneva and extend my passport. And all of that took at\nleast a month. At -- at one point it looked almost as if Dan was going to have to\nleave without me. But we traveled -- w-we -- we traveled some, we went to some\nparts of Switzerland, we went to Lausanne and -- and we got -- we went to Gstaad,\nand went to Italy and then back, so that that\u2019s how we spent the month. It was truly a\nhoneymoon -- a moon, a moon, how a moon [indecipherable] fast. And then finally\nthe visa came and -- and the passport was extended and the visa came and -- and we\nwere able to -- to -- to go together. But I have to tell you -- I don\u2019t know whether I\nsaid anything. I should have listened to the end of the tape, but I don\u2019t know whether\nI told you anything about what the wedding was like.",
        "A: No?",
        "A: Well, it was a very different affair from anything that happens here. It was in -- in\nthe mountains, in the Swiss mountains, in -- in -- 1n a place called the Chateau Deux\nwhere there was the f -- there is a family -- there was a family in Moltar, a Jewish\nfamily that ran a kosher ho -- a kosher restaurant and -- a pensionne actually, and\nthey also used to rent a -- I think it was in theirs, a hotel in Chateau Deux for\nPassover. And I was there once at Passover before, where you know, where\nOrthodox people would go to a hotel and spend the entire Passover there so that they\ndon\u2019t have to do anything at home. And that\u2019s where the wedding -- that\u2019s where the\nwedding was to take place. And we all had to go up there with a little bus. And I had\nthis dress on that I had designed by looking at -- because my ha -- my uncle worked -\n- this is wer -- the work he found a -- in Switzerland. He -- they sent -- they sent\npeople who were in these lo -- relocation camps to learn a trade, and they sent him to\nlearn how to be a couture ha -- cutter, a cloth --",
        "A: -- cloth cutter. So he worked for a Jewish family again in -- in -- in -- was a very\nclose community -- a Jewish family that had sort of a small couture house in -- in\nMontre and so I could design my own dress, and it was made. And I -- Dan had sent\nme from the States, \u201cBride\u201d magazine and I did -- I sort of followed some of that,\nand I had this pretty dress. And then you go up there -- we went up there with a bus\nand I had to not see them for three days. But -- well, at least, because it was really\nlonger that you don\u2019t see people in Orthodox Jewish wedding of -- weddings, the\nbride and groom are not to see each other. And we ran, of course, all over Montre\nthat whole time because this had to be done and that had to be done. And the town\nwas so small we ran into each other all the time. But officially we didn\u2019t see each\nother. And then he was to -- to get me the bouquet. And of course you know -- you\nknow what it\u2019s like here, I mean, how much you go through to for the bride to get\nthese flowers and you\u2019re thinking about it. I told him I wanted to have white\ncarnations. That\u2019s all I told him. I had no idea what to do and he had not the foggiest\nidea what to do. So, the afternoon before he goes to a florist and he said, I need a\nbouquet of white carnation. And they said, well, how many do you want? He said,\nwell, whatever is appropriate for a bride. And they practically fainted\n[indecipherable] at the florist shop. Started running all over Montre apparently,\nlooking for enough carnations to -- to make a bouquet, which they eventually came\nup with and put it together. So that\u2019s what he brought. And then there was a big fight\nabout -- I think every wedding has to have a fight, and this one had to do with\nwhatever hat he was going to wear. And he wanted to wear a yarmulke, which\npeople here wear in Jewish weddings and that\u2019s fine. But that community and that\nlevel of observance called for a proper hat. A real -- one of those black hats, not a ha\n-- top hat, but you know, a hat. Well, he want -- didn\u2019t want to wear one. So there\nwas a really tight situation, and finally his mother persuaded him to wear it. And --\nand he wore it just for under the chupah, that\u2019s it. After that he took it off the second\nhe could. But he wore it. And we were married by -- by the grand rabbi of\nLuxembourg, who had been a memb -- who had been a friend of the family. And he\ncame from Luxembourg to -- to marry us. And the chupah was outdoor, which 1s\nvery proper in Orthodox Jewish weddings. It was outdoors in a beautiful setting,\nwith you know, mountains in the background. And the entire Jewish community was\ninvited, but not for dinner. Dinner was just the family, but everybody was invited\nfor, you know, right now I think they would say this is a [indecipherable] wedding,\nyou know, because you had little sandwiches and drinks and that was -- you know,\nthat was that and everybody came out. And -- and then there was a family -- there\nwas a family dinner after that. So -- and then after that we took our [indecipherable]\non the train and that was that. That was the wedding.",
        "A: Oh, it was a great memory.",
        "A: I loved it. To me, it was -- except a horri -- I had a horrible headache on the way\nup and I had to sit there -- that\u2019s another thing of Orthodox Jewish weddings, you\nhave a separation of the -- of the sexes and I -- I -- you sit there -- I\u2019ve not -- now\nseen it many times, you -- you sit and the -- all the females come and say hello and --\nand you -- you sit with your -- you know, with your veil up and -- or down, actually,\nI have pictures, and just, you know, talk with people. And you -- you were led to the\nchupah by two females and a man by two males, rather than, as we do mostly in the\nStates, and certainly the way my son got married, the -- the -- the parents take you.\nBoth parents, you know, and -- take you -- take the bride and the groom. And the --\nthe -- the father gives the bride away, none of that [indecipherable]. So my aunt and\nmy mother-in-law took me to the chupah. And my uncle and I think Dan\u2019s brother\ntook him to the chupah.",
        "A: Or maybe it was his uncle, I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t remember. His uncle and aunt\nfrom -- from France, who came.",
        "A: No, I just liked it.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Came to New York. Was quite an experience. After the -- the -- you know,\nbeautiful Switzerland and -- and the lake and this and that and we spend time in the\nmost love -- the loveliest parts of Europe, to come to New York, which I was\nlooking forward to, but I was afraid that 1t was going to be gray and ugly, sort of\nvery European, but huge. And we came on a ship, we came on the Queen Mary, and\n-- and a -- I-I think if -- if I have to talk about experiences in coming, I think I have\nto go slightly back to qu -- to queen -- to the queen -- the Queen Mary. It was -- I\nwas so afraid to go on a ship because on my trips during the summer in Croatia,\nwhen we used to go to the island of Solta, we once went on a boat that took three\nhours from Split to Solta, which you can see from one another. It was like boom-\nboom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom, you know, and everything was there, you\nknow, and sometimes goats and vegetables and everything, and it was just, you\nknow, a -- a small boat. And I would get -- I would get seasick, and so I was very\nafraid of being seasick on the way. And Dan assured me that I wasn\u2019t going to get\nseasick because these ships are very big and they don\u2019t rock and so on and so forth.\nAnd I remember in la -- getting, you know, close on the small boat that you go to the\nsmall boat to the ship and looking at this ship and saying, my God, it is enormous,\nit\u2019s like a huge skyscraper or something. And so I was reassured, but we did run one\nday into a hurricane. It was fall, the hurricanes are there, and near Ireland we ran into\na hurricane, and Dan, who claimed he was never sick on ships, got very sick on a\nship. Both of us were sick for the day. And then I have, you know, very sort of\nAmericanization memories o-on that ship because it was now -- it was now a\ndifferent world already, it wasn\u2019t just the arrival, it was already -- it was, you know,\nbeing -- being on foreign territory all by myself, and having to speak English all the\ntime, and --",
        "A: My English was good because -- I mean decent, because I had studied English all\nthrough high school.",
        "A: And I was an English major in college.",
        "A: So --",
        "A: Yeah. So one of the reasons I met Dan 1s because I was dying to speak English to\nsomebody. I -- I had met him because there were -- I think I talked on the tape about\nthe discussion he was having on the ship with somebody and everybody was\nlistening, it was [indecipherable] in Little Rock and all of that and I was dying to talk\nabout things. So I sort of took little walks until he started talking to me. And so I-I --\nyou know, because I had -- I had studied English for a long time, but I had no\nexperience actually speaking. There were no Americans or English speakers, and I\nwas one of the very few studying English at that time in Yugoslavia. So -- so my\nEnglish was decent, but there were many things I didn\u2019t know. I mean, lack of\nvocabulary, you know, and -- oh, and -- and the thing that really improved my\nEnglish by the way, is while I was -- while I was still in Switzerland and we wrote to\neach other, and I -- I have these things, I would -- I asked Dan, good student that I\nam, I said to him, please correct my letters. And so what he did 1s -- is -- in -- he\nwrote me corrections back, but not just, you know, every correction, but he would\nwrite me, for example, when you say something like, I don\u2019t know, I am at my\nsecond book, you don\u2019t say at, you say on. I am on my second book. And then he\nwould give me a whole lesson on -- on prepositions. So, even during our -- our --",
        "A: -- courtship, I -- I -- I learned -- I learned a lot. And I spoke with a reas -- with a\nsomewhat British accent, from wherever, and I was still on aunt and cahn\u2019t, but I\ncorrected that when I got here. So, my English was okay, but I lacked vocabulary\nand I lacked cultural knowledge, and -- and -- and that was one of my -- my low\npoints on that ship that I remember. Sitting one evening in one of the lounges and\nthere were a number of Americans, and they were sitting around the piano and we\nwere included, sitting around the piano and someone 1s playing the piano and they\nare singing American songs. And I knew some, but I didn\u2019t know as many as they\ndid, of course. I knew, you know -- well, anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter, but you know,\njust -- just American songs, from s -- from sea to shining sea and whatever they\nwere. And I was never very good on my -- on memorizing voca -- words anyway, so\nthat was enjoyable. But then Dan s -- ordered a ginger ale. We were sitting at the\ntable, he ordered ginger ale and I said, what is ginger ale? And he said, well, you\u2019 ll\nsee when it comes. I said, well, what 1s it? And he\u2019s, well, you\u2019ll see when it comes.\nAnd I started crying. And I so remember that.",
        "A: All of a sudden --",
        "A: -- all of a sudden -- and he was terribly frustrate -- I mean, he was very upset that\nhe had upset me. But a -- it -- 1t -- it -- then somehow all of a sudden everything\ncame together. My God, I don\u2019t know anything about this country. I don\u2019t even\nknow what someone orders at the table. What am I going to do? S -- and you know,\nhe comforted me and then the ginger ale came and that was the end of that story. But\nI do -- [ -- it -- it was sort of like, you know, you -- I remember a few little things\nthat sort of were these kind of very small things. You think you, as an ESL teacher\nall my life later on, I was always aware how small things count. Just nothing counts -\n- nothing -- nothing [indecipherable] can trigger you, trigger that sense that you are a\nforeigner in a foreign country and that you don\u2019t really know everything, and -- and\nhow much, you know, you miss and it doesn\u2019t have to do -- it does -- has nothing to\ndo with Shakespeare, it has to do with ginger ale.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Exactly. And I -- I didn\u2019t -- you know, I remember watching \u201cFantasia\u201d on that\nship, that was when it --",
        "A: -- was in its original -- on the original version in the theater on -- on Queen Mary.\nBut then we came into New York and I have pictures of myself on the ship with the\nStatue of Liberty behind me, early in the morning.",
        "A: That was fantastic. That was just fantastic, you know. It was just exactly what I\nexpected, you know, the -- obviously the statue is such a powerful symbol all over\nthe world and it was then as well. And, you know, seeing it was just amazing. And\nthen we come to New York. And, you know, people always say, oh, my goodness,\nit\u2019s -- New York is ugly, but I thought it was actually very beautiful, because I think\nI expected to be gray and it\u2019s actually very colorful. And instead of disliking all the\nwild colors and red bricks and -- and there weren\u2019t graffiti in those days, but you\nknow, posters and -- and advertising and you know, all of that. It was sort of -- it was\nexciting. It was exciting and I loved it. And Dan\u2019s parents waited for us and some\nother relatives.",
        "A: It was October.",
        "A: Yeah, it was a beautiful time of the year. And I remember very much it was\nOctober, because I remember witnessing my first Halloween very shortly after that.\nBut anyway, we went to -- to Dan\u2019s parents\u2019 apartment and that was a shock. They\nlived in a very small apartment in a northern -- northern part of Manhattan across\nfrom -- from Fort Tryon Park. That was the Inwood section of Washington Heights -",
        "A: -- where a lot of Jewish community had settled. And my father-in-law had a small\ndrugstore around the corner from where they lived. But they never -- they -- they\nlived not in -- they lived in an apartment to which they moved when the kids were\nlittle and they never moved out of there. And was very small. It was a one bedroom\napartment and I\u2019ve never lived in a one bedroom apartment before in my life. So\nhere I come to the land of -- of -- of milk and honey and these people aren\u2019t living as\nwell as I was used to. I grew up in a big house, and -- when I lived in Zagreb and I\nwas roomed with friends, they -- was in a -- they -- the government had taken much\naway from them, but they had owned that villa that they lived in, and they also\nowned the land -- the little villa on the sha -- Solta. So, 1t was, you know, even\nthough it was small, it was beautiful furniture and it overlooked the garden and --\nand my aunt and uncle in Switzerland who were really not well-to-do, had two\nbedrooms. And the boys had one and they had one and I was -- I slept on the couch\nin the living room for the year I was there. But now, my in-laws lived in a one\nbedroom apartment with a tiny, tiny kitchen in an old house. In an old -- I mean old\nhouse, old building in New York that overlooked a courtyard, and you know, all the\nold buildings, the way they are. And my mother-in-law was sort of immovable in --\nin terms of moving anywhere. I mean, eventually we got them to move here, but she\nwouldn\u2019t change apartments and she liked where she was and she didn\u2019t -- changing\na chair was like a major issue. And so they just continued living there, like they did\nwhen da -- when they first started out. But 1t was across from the -- from fort -- Fort\nTryon Park and my husband adored the cloisters and spent time when he was at\nhome studying there. And --",
        "A: I wa -- we moo -- we moved to an even worse place.",
        "A: No, no, no --",
        "A: -- we didn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t because what had happened was that my husband, when\nhe met me he was just returning from India where he had spent a year as a Fulbright\ndoing [indecipherable] work at the school of tropical medicine on Calcutta. And he\ntook a very long way home and met me on the -- on the way. He went up to Japan\nand then to -- went to some -- he took I -- I don\u2019t know what kind of boats and went\nto Egypt and then he was in Turkey [indecipherable] was in Turkey on that trip and -\n- and to Italy and eventually to Yugoslavia, back to Italy where he took a ship to go\nhome. And anyway, he a -- he had tried after that to find a job that he would -- that\nhe wanted and it took a very long time. It was the time of what he used to call the\nEisenhower depression, and -- not depression, 1t was, oh what they calling?\nRecession, sorry. And it was very difficult and he wanted to have a research job, and\nhe couldn't -- he didn\u2019t really want to work pharma -- pharmaceutical companies. He\nhad done that during his graduate days and he just didn\u2019t want to do that again, he\nwanted an academic position. It was very hard to come by. He had been waiting for a\nposition at NIH and it didn\u2019t come. While we were in Switzerland, he got a --a\ntelegram saying that the position had opened and he 1s in at NIH, but it was too late.\nBecause we were getting married, he took a position to teach at Hoffstra ha --\nCollege, which is now University of Long Island. And he knew that that wasn\u2019t\ngoing to be great, but he took it anyway because, I mean, we had to live on\nsomething, and I certainly didn\u2019t have any money. So, he talked to some friends who\nsaid they would find us someplace to live on Long Island. So when we came, there\nwas a place that they had sublet for us, and it was a sublet in someone\u2019s house. It\nwas a second -- on the second story of someone\u2019s house. I must have been in love,\nthat place was ga -- ghastly, you know. But I had ha -- I think I had a very typical\nAmerican experience, people all -- pe -- so many people tell me about their horrible\nfirst year.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well I had -- I had one, but I wasn\u2019t exactly expecting it. So\nthis was -- Mr. and Mr. -- Mr. and Mrs. O\u2019Connor and we had to go through their\nliving room and the television was always on, to the second story. And it was filthy,\nand I spend the time -- I have just come from my super clean u -- eat off the floor\naunt, and here it was like, you know, cockroach heaven.",
        "A: And anyway, we cleaned it up. It was a -- it was just a one room, one kitchen,\nshare bathroom. And we didn\u2019t have a car, and -- to find something else, so it was a\nvery difficult few months. Eventually -- that was wintertime and -- and we used to\ngo do every -- all th -- our shopping taking buses and it was pretty cold and\nmiserable. And eventually, however, we were able to somehow find an apartment. It\nwas very difficult to find housing. We were in Hampstead, Long Island and it was\nalmost impossible to find anything. Every time we would come to an apartment it\nwas already taken. And eventually we found something in a small building that had\nsix small apartments and the -- Mr. [indecipherable] said we could have this\napartment, but he wasn\u2019t going to do anything. No painting, no nothing, take it or\nleave it, and so we did, we took it. And then finally by -- by -- by March, thank God\na refund from the government, for -- on his taxes, and we were able to buy this hou -\n- incredible car, which was like a \u201951 Buick, I think. And it had a -- that -- you know,\nat least went, if nothing else. And in -- in the meantime, you know, we would take\nbuses and stuff, and he took a long time to get to work every day and he hated it at\nHoffstra. Not that he -- he doesn\u2019t di -- he didn\u2019t like 1t because he was teaching\nfreshmen and he really couldn\u2019t understand at all kids, like I eventually got to\nunderstand because that\u2019s often what I had is kids who just weren't going to study, or\ndidn\u2019t feel like chemi -- and chemistry\u2019s hard for most kids. And none of -- none of\nthem were devoted to chemistry, it was just a subject they were taking. And, you\nknow, he was -- an-and he was extremely enthusiastic about chemistry. To him it\nmeant a lot and -- and they were just, you know, coming up with you know, my dog\n-- the dog ate my homework, and he couldn\u2019t understand that at all. So he didn't like\nit very much there and had im-immediately applied for other situation in the gover --\nsituations in the government. And of course the pay was extremely low, so that we\ncouldn\u2019t really afford anything. It was -- it was difficult to -- to -- to buy it -- to --\nyou know, to buy any furniture or anything. And we -- we bought something, but not\nvery much. And -- so it was -- it was kind of hard. And I -- I was home alone and I\nhad -- I could have started going to Hoffstra, but it was already in progress and I was\nreally scared. I had just gone through this whole year in -- in Switzerland of coping\nwith a new university where they required me to know much more French than I\nknew. I was doing [indecipherable] of the text of Proust and I could barely speak\nFrench because I was an English major and I had done very little French before, but\nthey couldn't care less. You\u2019re second year French, you take this. You know, there is\nnone of that. I mean, you -- American universities coddle kids in comparison.",
        "A: Of course I didn\u2019t understand that they also didn\u2019t expect me to take any exams.\nJust -- you know, just you fla -- you know, you\u2019re just there. But -- but so it was\nactually lonely for me, and I waited for Dan to come home and I decided that I might\nas well have a baby. What else was there? You get married, you have a baby. So I\ngot pregnant right away. And Wanda was eventually born on our first wedding\nanniversary.",
        "A: So -- well, being pregnant meant you have to find a doctor and you have to pay\nthe doctor and I have an -- had an idiot, but that\u2019s not because we didn\u2019t pay him, we\ndid, but he was just bad. And we pay -- tried to -- we painted our apartment\nourselves and -- after we got tired of taking a shower and ending up with brown dots\non our heads because the paint was dropping down, you know. So we painted and\nwe had some furniture. But then things got really exciting because Dan got a -- a\nposition at Walter Reed and he said he couldn\u2019t come until June because he had to --\nhe promised to be at Hoffstra til the end of the school year, and they said they would\nwait. And so that was -- that was great. So by June I was already highly pregnant.\nWanda was born at the end of August. We took whatever possessions we had and we\nheaded for Washington. And that was great.",
        "A: We got here in a hot summer with very little to no money. We borrowed some\nmoney.",
        "A: As a researcher.",
        "A: In -- ina lab at Walter Reed, which -- where he remained for the rest of his -- for\nthe rest of his life.",
        "A: Yeah. Not in -- in that lab. He came as a -- as a researcher, he eventually headed\nthe lab and the section. And they were working on -- it was a-again a no -- tropical\nmedicine.",
        "A: Which is what he was interested in. Eventually he -- he worked in selentum\nchemistry. He had a -- his Ph.D. had to do with -- w-with e-e-extracting a new\nalkaloid from opium.",
        "A: And so that kind of tropical medicine was of interest to him. Eventually he ended\nup working on anti-malarials. But they -- at Walter Reed at that time they were also\ndoing anti-nuclear medicine. So I think I\u2019m saying it right, because it was a long\ntime that -- that they were working on that. They were thinking ab-bout how to -- of\ncourse it\u2019s the army, so they were always thinking in terms of, you know, what are\nwe going to be afflicted with that we have to counteract.",
        "A: And so the medicine was going in -- in -- the research was going in the direction\nof if there is a nuclear attack -- and they were still thinking a lot about that, it was\nstill after the 50\u2019s and after McCarthyism.",
        "A: Who had been --",
        "A: -- exposed to radiation, right.",
        "A: So it\u2019s anti-radiation, that\u2019s what it\u2019s really called.",
        "A: That\u2019s anti-radiation. So anti-radiation and then eventually that kind of died down\nand they went more into doing anti-malarials and that\u2019s where really he did. And\nanyway, So th -- so w-we came to Washington and I will never forget the hotel we\nstayed in. It was on Dupont Circle in those old, old hotels before they were all\ndestroyed. And barely any air conditioning and the temperature was high and I was\nvery pregnant, and huge. And it was hot. But, we went to Walter Reed, and right\nnext to Walter Reed there were these apartment houses and there were plenty of\napartments to be had. It was unbelievable. And we got, right across from Walter\nReed -- I, of course, didn\u2019t arrive -- right across from Walter Reed, there was this --\nwhat it was called? A garden apartment that was beautiful and light and had two\nbedroom and a big living room and -- and a patio. And it was the same amount of\nmoney, it was like 115 dollars, I remember it. It was the same amount of money like\nthat hole in the wall in New York. So, I was thrilled. And of course, I had been\nlonely and Ill never forget that Dan went to work and he could walk across the\nstreet to work and somebody came and knocked on my door, and there was a\nneighbor from upstairs with -- pregnant, and with a baby on her arms, and she said,\noh I heard you moved in, welcome. I was like -- I thought I was going to faint. No\none talked to me in New York, ever.",
        "A: On Long Island. It was a strange community. I -- I don\u2019t think this is true that\npeople in New York don\u2019t talk to you, but it happened to have been my experience\nin that particular town. So, well, 1t was just the people that were there and there were\nno children and so on. But it was a different life in Washington.",
        "A: Very quickly.",
        "A: It was like totally on the dime.",
        "A: The place was full of young physicians from Walter Reed and their wives and\ntheir children and I made some lifelong -- long friends. And, you know, that was just\ntotally, totally different life.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. We did not join -- join Jewish community. We went to services, Rosh\nHashanah, but to just whatever was free and open and there we -- there always were\nsome in town, but that\u2019s all we did. Not until we moved from there, when Wanda\nwas four and we bought a house and we moved to where we are now, into -- to this\ncommunity. And -- which is across from -- we are across from Ohr Kodesh\ncongregation.",
        "A: And we joined, or --",
        "A: It\u2019s right on East-West highway. We join -- and we -- we -- our house was just\naround the corner from this house. This house was built in \u201979. But we moved into a\nthree bedroom, small Maryland type house that -- that at that time cost 18,500. And\nwas in -- it\u2019s insane. It just sold for like almost half a million dollars, ridiculous. But\nanyway, we moved into that house and we joined Ohr Kodesh, and that\u2019s where the\nkids went to -- and I\u2019m still a member now, I\u2019m much more active now than I was\nthen, and -- and the kids went to Hebrew school there, and were Bar and Bat\nMitzvah eventually. I had the -- that daughter, of course, that summer, and -- Wanda\nwas born and then Elliot was born a year and a half later.",

        "A: And that was the end of children.",
        "A: 60\u2019s were raising kids.",
        "A: Little kids. I did things here and there. I started -- I did that little work for VOA. I\ndon\u2019t remember how I found them, or they found me.",
        "A: That was in the 60\u2019s.",
        "A: I did a lot of translation at the time for the Joint Publications Research Services. It\nwas Department of Commerce. And that was excellent because I could neither type,\nn-nor -- nor nothing. I -- I couldn\u2019t type. But it had to be perfectly typed and I\ncouldn\u2019t do that. So I lon -- wrote longhand translations the best I could and then\nedited them. And did a lot of work, but I really learned English that way. And th-\nthen I gave it to somebody to type. So, whatever they paid me I shared with the\ntypist. And so it was something -- something for me to do that -- that was sort of\nintellectually challenging and making a tiny bit of money. And that\u2019s that.",
        "A: I -- I think so. You know, differently from very many people who come to this\ncountry, and I certainly have had much experience with that, because I ended up\nteaching ESL, I -- I did -- I did not have anybody who spoke my language, or who\ncame from my culture.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have those constant reminders. And I wrote home -- in quote home, less\nand less than my friends. And I got very involved with other mothers, and with, you\nknow, what was going on with my kids.",
        "A: And my husband -- well, my husband\u2019s family, there was nobody in Washington,\nactually. At fi -- one short period of time a cousin was here, a cousin of my\nhusbands. And they had a little boy -- and they still have him, but they ha -- they had\na baby at that time, and they lived in Arlington and we saw them sometimes. But a\nvery good friend of my husband\u2019s from high school -- junior high school and high\nschool settled here. In fact, they\u2019re the ones who always pushed my husband to come\n35and work for the government. He was one of the early arrivals to the Washington\narea to work on the computer -- in the com -- he worked for the Bureau of Standards\nand he worked on the computers.

And waited for, basically, for my -- I made promises\n-- when I wrote to him, I -- originally to say I would get -- I wanted to get married, I\npromised that I would go back to school and finish. And it waited until Elliot was in\nkindergarten, but once he was in kindergarten, I enrolled in Montgomery College,\nwhich was very, very close. I -- I finally learned how to drive. I was 27, I learned\nhow to drive. And -- and I started taking -- I took -- I fre -- one course. And while he\nwas in kindergarten, I would drive to Takoma Park and take my class and drive\nback, and be back for him to come back from school. And I took a class in English\nwith a Dr. Laverne Miller, who shall not be forgotten by me forever. She just died\nrecently. She was a fantastic teacher, the best I ever had, or one of the best I ever\nhad, anyway. The best I had in the States, I think. And I took my first English\ncourse, and you know, freshman English 101, and wrote my first essay and drove\nDan crazy because I wanted him to read it and he wouldn\u2019t. And he said, just do it,\njust do it, just go. It\u2019s okay, you can do it. So I went with my first piece, and I have\nit, and the class ended and she se -- the class -- the new class began and we had to\nhave that [indecipherable] when a new class began, she said that there was one good\ncomposition. And she started reading it, it was mine. I was like, oh my God, you\nknow?",
        "A: Oh, it was just something we had to summarize, it was nothing much. It was just\na summary of -- of -- of some article about some planets or something. It wasn\u2019t -- it\nwas just ri -- she sent us home to write a summary.",
        "A: And obviously I knew how to write. I\u2019ve said that many times, you know, people\nask me, how do these ESL kids do it? And I say well, if they can write to begin with,\nthey do fine. But it\u2019s not a matter of teaching just the language, it\u2019s teaching\neverything.",
        "A: And -- and I wou -- I had always been a very good writer, so I just transferred the\nskill, it was no big deal. I had to learn English, but I didn\u2019t have to learn how to\nwrite.",
        "A: So -- so that was -- that was fine. So eventually I took a lot of classes from Dr.\nMiller, she taught [indecipherable] books at -- at Takoma Park. And she eventually\nhired me to, when I finished col -- when I finished University of Maryland she hired\nme, and then my -- that was my first job, was teaching at -- at Montgomery College.",
        "A: So, anyway, I had [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, I had no idea, in fact, that that\u2019s what I would be doing. And -- and in fact, I -\n- | thought exactly what -- that I would not be doing that, because I felt like English\nas a second language was not a field that anybody even heard about here --",
        "A: -- at that time. [phone ringing] And now ignore it. [indecipherable] it\u2019s unknown,\nanyhow.",
        "A: No, it was not -- no one even talked about that. Certainly wasn\u2019t taught in the\ncounty. English as a second language was not a recognized class offering in\nMontgomery county. And I thought, even if the -- had ex -- if it had even started, I\nwould have thought that they wouldn\u2019t want someone who had an accent and was\nfrom a different country. And so I went to my second experience, namely to my\nSwiss experience, and -- because I had become ru -- quite fluent that year in -- in\nFrench. And so I thought I would be a French major. Languages was what I always\nwanted to study, so that was fine. So I was going to, you know, do French. Which I\ndid do, I enrolled in French, but I had such -- just crazy experiences, because in -- in\nEuropean schools you don\u2019t start from -- from ground zero at the university. You\ncan\u2019t sort of decide you\u2019re going to be a French major and start with French 101 in\ncollege. Which you could here. I mean, it will take you some doing -- take some --\nsome doing, but you can if you want to. There it\u2019s 1m -- it\u2019s -- it was great -- greatly\npro -- it was problematic in every way because when I came to Zagreb and I decided\n-- ]-I was an English major, but I decided already to study some French because I\nknew I was going to go to Switzerland, I had planned on that. So I too -- I had to\ntake French with the same student -- with the same kids who had studied French for\nfive years in -- in high school.",
        "A: I had studied English. And I had some pr -- private lessons, but I struggled greatly\nthat year, trying to do French with people who were ahead of me. And the same\nthing happened again when I came to Switzerland. I was still struggling with French\nand they again put me too far ahead. I could never -- you -- you can\u2019t make a\ndecision what you want to take. It\u2019s like what\u2019s available and where they think you\nshould be, with -- without regard and -- where you actually are as a student. So I\nthought, oh God, I\u2019m going to do this again? And when I realized that you can start\nfrom the beginning here, I enrolled in 101, French 101. Well, they threw me out of\nthere and I went to a higher level class, but I was at MC and I also started taking\nSpanish, which was the smartest thing I ever did. But anyway, I eventually graduated\nfrom University of Maryland with a degree in French and a minor in -- in Spanish.\nAnd then, at that point, ESL became already -- started to become a field a-and I had -\n- because I dragged through schools for such a long period of time, I didn\u2019t go like\nthree or four years, I don\u2019t know how long it took me, a long time. And I had -- I\nstarted teaching ESL at Takoma Park in the evening program, before I had any kind\nof a degree. Because I -- while I was a student there, they recognized that I could --\nthat I knew something about what -- what -- what needed to be taught and that I\nunderstood the process. And they started the evening programs for the new\nVietnamese community coming in.",
        "A: At Montgomery College. Actually no, that\u2019s not even true. I-I started when the\nCubans were coming in.",
        "A: In the early -- oh, it was la -- much earlier than that.",
        "A: That first wave --",
        "A: -- of Cubans --",
        "A: -- that came in.",
        "A: Yes, and we had -- nobody knew how to teach it, nobody knew what to do and\nnobody knew n-no -- we didn\u2019t have any books. The only books we had were\nsomething that the army had used. It was -- it was -- it was an -- you know, an -- an\nold system. I [indecipherable] remember what it was called, English 800 or\nsomething, and it was like based on 800 vocabulary items and -- and there were\nthese sent-sentences we were supposed to be teaching, it was like these Cuban ladies\nthat y -- that didn\u2019t know what hit them, and we are teaching them, if 1t had been\nraining in Miami, I would have taken my umbrella. What? You know? Because we\njust had no idea. Nobody knew how to teach it. And we were just sort of like\nstruggling and figuring things out. And -- and teaching in -- in the basement across\nthe street from MC there was an old church and in that basement there was a\nclassroom we could use. And then the Vietnamese population came in, and then\nsome books were published, and we tried -- you know, there were three of us trying\nto figure out what was going on. I was coordinating the program; I hadn\u2019t even\ngraduated from college, you know? It was crazy.",
        "A: It was very fulfilling and -- and it worked very well for me in every way because\nmy husband could stay home with the kids and we taught -- and I taught twice a\nweek in the evening, and they paid me. Wasn\u2019t much, but it was great. And so I was\n-- I was doing that and -- and going to school at the same time.",
        "A: But, to back up, you asked me about my uncle. When the kids -- so that was one\nthing I did, I -- I did -- I go back to school, not just because he wanted me to, but I\ndid, too.",
        "A: And that was one thing. But the other thing was that in -- by 19 -- let me see,\nWanda was five, so she was in kindergarten when I got my citizenship. That was\nanother story. And -- and since she was in kindergarten we could take her out of\nschool, we felt, for a little bit of time. Elliot was still in nursery school, and we went\nto -- we went to Switzerland for a bit and to cro -- to Yugoslavia to visit my uncle.\nAnd we stayed for a few months.",
        "A: That was -- that was great, yeah.",
        "A: He was thrilled, yes, he was thrilled. There I am, you know, arriving back with\ntwo kids. And then eventually Dan came, and at that point, of course, we were doing",
        "A: Yes. They got along very well. They spoke in -- Dan [indecipherable] German,\nbut you know, he went up and he was -- Dan was very outgoing and lots of fun and\nthey had a good time together. It was very nice, it was very fulfilling and really\ngreat. Oh, we -- at that time we were doing better financially so we could, you know,\nwe -- first of all we -- we have saved enough money for all of us to go to Europe.\nAnd second, we could rent a car and you know, just go around a little bit and see a\nbit, and that was -- that was really a lovely trip. And so --",
        "A: Yeah, it was.",
        "A: It was very much so.",
        "A: In fact, yeah, very much so. And in fact, I was just saying to the very friend\nwhose phone just rang, how I remember so well all the Civil Rights marches. I was\nat a march yesterday, the --",
        "A: -- the Women\u2019s march and how huge it was, but -- but 1t was not fraught with\ndanger, and those marches were fraught with danger. And I didn't go very much, I\nstayed with the kids, but -- but my husband went. I -- he was -- he was an avid\nphotographer, and -- and also wanted to record everything and he -- he -- he would\ngo down. But I went down too. I remember serving food in tent city in those days,\nwith the kids. And we -- you know, we lived through the -- through the riots and\nMartin Luther King\u2019s death and I remember -- and of course, through President\nKennedy\u2019s death. I -- I know that I was very American already, because I remember\nthat I cried when President Kennedy was nominated because I wanted Stevenson to\nbe nominated.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, of course you know, I had -- I had a tutor living with me. And I\ndidn\u2019t have that other community. That, I think is really major in my transformation,\nthat -- that I got very involved -- oh yeah, I was - I was doing the dollars for\ndemocrats. I have pictures of myself co -- you know, trying to get money for\nJohnson to be elected. I mean, you know, it\u2019s -- so it\u2019s -- I-I got really involved in --\nin -- in the community and in -- and in life here. With, you know, with Civil Rights\nand everything else that came -- that came down the pike with the democratic party.\nI -- I served as a judge of elections in -- at -- one year. And so I just got a -- to meet a\nlot of people that were sort of kindred spirits. And of course in this com -- this\nparticular community where we lived, we -- it was an all white community at the\ntime. And from what I heard, even though this was built by -- by a -- a fellow Jew, it\nhad originally, when it was built in the late 1930\u2019s, early 40\u2019s -- well, not by 40\u2019s, it\nwas a-all gone. But -- but the early -- the houses built in the 30\u2019s actually had a-an\nanti-Jewish covenant. [indecipherable]",

        "A: This neighborhood 1s called Rock Creek Forest.",
        "A: And I think it went off fast, and I never saw any original documents. But my next\ndoor neighbor in my old house wa -- told me about it, and -- and they were sa --\nsavvy. He was a newspaper [indecipherable] Levins, and he was a -- they were pe --\nreally involved in labor issues and he was -- he published the newspaper for the\nrailway union. And so I -- I learned from them a lot, as well. So I -- so, at -- in this\nneighborhood at th -- at that time, I didn\u2019t even -- I wasn\u2019t aware that everybody was\nwhite in the neighborhood until a black family moved in and nobody said anything,\neverything was fine. But then they tried to buy a house -- th -- I think they were\nrenting and then they tried to buy a house and -- and she came to tell us, I remember,\nthat th -- th -- they had, I don\u2019t know, something had happened in their house. I can\u2019t\nremember now whether somebody threw stones or whatever, what happen, or\nsomeone wrote graffiti. And the neighborhood, there were a lot of -- they were rather\nreally progressive people living here and -- and people rallied around them. But then\nwe became aware that -- that it\u2019s been difficult for -- for black people to buy houses\nhere. And eventually things calmed down and -- and th-they bought some houses.\nIt\u2019s not that mixed here now, but it -- it is, I mean, you know, I have --",
        "A: -- neighbors across the street, or down the street --",
        "A: I would tell people if they asked. I -- 1t wasn\u2019t something that I would -- I -- I\ncertainly, you know didn\u2019t think, oh, I\u2019ve got to go and tell people, or advocate for --\nfor knowledge of the Holocaust or I -- I -- I would be aware -- more aware of these\nissues when I would meet somebody from Croatia, that\u2019s one thing.

Now,\n1-1f there was somebody from Serbia, I would feel much more comfortable than if\nthere was somebody from Croatia.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s because during -- during the war, Croatia and Serbia were not in the\nsame country. Yugoslavia fell apart after the invasion, and Croatia became an\nindependent -- so-called ing -- it was called independent state of Croatia, Nezavisan\nStanje od Hrvatski. And it was a puppet government that carried out the edicts of --\nof the Third Reich. And so everything, including genocide perpetrated on Jews was\nalso perpetrated on Serbs.",

        "A: What that meant?",
        "A: Well, what that means to me now is that I really -- I really -- they -- we talked\nabout Chetniks, for example. Chetniks were the Serbs who w -- fought against the\nGermans, apparently, but they also fought against the partisans. So in post-\nCommunist Yugoslavia, they were the enemy. They were just as much the enemy as\n-- as the Germans. But na -- I didn\u2019t understand exactly why England, for example\nand United States were supporting Chetniks at the beginning of the war. Now I\nunderstand. First of all they didn\u2019t know who was who. Second, th-there were some\ncircumstances where the Chetniks were doing some good things. On the other hand,\nof course, the sa -- they were nationalists at the same time so they also have their bad\npoints. But when I would meet Serbs after, when I came here, who would tell me\nthat -- that their families were Chetniks, I would think, my God, what horror. A-And\n-- and there probably was, but I still don\u2019t quite know. I still don\u2019t understand the\nChetnik movement properly because I\u2019ve never really delved into it.

And -- and I saw -- I saw many abuses that -- you know,\nas stupidities of the system. People who had no business running anything, you\nknow. One minute they were shepherds and the next minute they were running the\ncity, or being the police chiefs, or demanding that li -- that [indecipherable] we had a\nhouse and they demanded that we relinquish the house because we didn\u2019t have -- that\nwas not the house we lived in, but we had another building that was under\nconstruction, starting from before the war.

Because I was really not -- I mean, I wa -- I may have been hidden\nfor a day, not for years, in the -- in that same sense. I don\u2019t know -- I was so\ninvolved in school at that time. I finally -- I -- I-I -- I was -- I just got out of college\nand I was student teaching and -- and I got my first job and I was -- I was teaching at\nBethesda Chevy Chase High School.",
        "A: And that was -- well, after the year -- after the year at Montgomery College,\nwhere I was teaching full time in the regular students, rather than that evening\nprogram that I was doing, I was really busy. My kids were in junior high and -- or\nhigh school. No, they were in -- I think they were -- yeah, Elliot was still in middle\nschool, Wanda was in high school, and I was student teaching and coming home\ntired, wondering whether this is what I wanted to do, screaming at everybody at\nhome. I was like, I already had it with the kids. It was har -- I was student teaching\nhalf French and half ESL and I started to become aware of this whole new\nimmigrant community, and getting involved in all these other kids and their\nproblems, all these kids coming from Vietnam and -- and I think I was more\ninvolved in that than I was in the issues of the Holocaust, somehow. I started\nteaching at -- was it at -- an-and then my husband had his first heart attack. And that\nalso loomed fairly large. 1970 fo -- 1974, something like that, was his first heart\nattack. And Elliot was just Bar Mitzvah and so, you know, the -- I -- I-I was aware of\nit peripherally, but not involved in it in any way and it just seemed to me -- and I\ndon\u2019t think I was that aware that it was not being talked about. That\u2019s another thing,\nyou know, because what -- when I was in Switzerland with my aunt and uncle, it was\nso overwhelming. My aunt talks about it incessantly. But I don\u2019t th -- and I don\u2019t --\ndidn\u2019t know any survivors here, really. So I just thought well, you know, if I thought\nanything I would have thought well, why would Americans -- I think I -- I underst --\nI think -- I know what -- I remember that, you know, there were many mo -- there\nwere movies, like war-time movies, American war-time movies. Liberation movies.\nAnd I think it was more in my -- my mind, m-more work toward, you know, being\nliberated and what that felt like. The -- you know, being helped by the United States,\nI remembered UNRRA packages, things of that nature more, and I was just so\ninvolved in like present day issues, as I si -- mentioned, the politics of -- of the day\nthat I -- I don\u2019t think that was very much on my mind.",

        "A: Because I could always -- I al -- you know, I would tell the kids what my\nexperience had been and I would understand the kids who came from war-time\nexperiences, and I would talk with them about it, and I would say, you know,\neventually you know, you have to think in a positive way and things are going to be\nbetter and -- cause we had -- at -- at BCC we had a whole group of kids, at one point\nearly, who actually -- Vietnamese orphans, or perhaps they were orphans, they didn\u2019t\neven know. Kids that were boat people, boat kids, who [phone ringing, tape\ninterruption]",

Eventually I was head of the ESL department, but when I\ncame to BCC in \u201977 -- \u201976 - \u00b077 school year, I was al -- I was alone. I -- I had all the\nESL kids, I was their mother. And, you know, I mothered those kids til the day I\nretired, and I still do, to some extent, but it was just -- it was an overwhelming job\nsometimes. And some -- those kids who were -- who were at Lourdes had huge\namounts of problems and -- and you know, y-you had to constantly be looking after\nthem. And there were Cambodian kids too, and they were suicidal and they had, you\nknow, just --",
        "A: -- their -- their -- they -- they\u2019d gone through some terrible times. Kao and Sao,\nthe two Cambodian kids, one of them did commit suicide later on. So, it was -- you\nknow, I was just really too involved with that. I mean, what -- think about it, I started\nteaching it -- teaching there in \u201976 - \u201977 school year. Elliot had just come there, he\nwas in 10\" grade and Wanda was in 12\" grade. I was in -- I was 38 - 39. I-It was all\nI could do.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know, they just sort of accepted it. They were just used to -- our house\nwas very open and -- and you know, I had kids come to the house. We had parties in\nour house, I have -- we had -- I had big di -- Thanksgiving dinners for them. I\ncooked a dinner -- they still do it at BCC, it\u2019s continued. Th-The -- the tradition had\ncontinued. I had Thanksgiving, a whole Thanksgiving turkey, which we served like\nthe week before Thanksgiving and we had a dinner at my house for everybody in\nESL. Eventually it got too big. We had a few since I moved into this house, when --\nfortunately was larger house, so we could do it. But then -- then we started doing it\nat school. So the kids were just sort of like part of it, and -- but sometimes not as\ninvolved as I would have wanted them to be actually, because they were just -- you\nknow they were just American kids, who wanted to be with other American kids and\nI\u2019m -- I\u2019ve always had trouble getting American kids to participate with -- with\nforeign kids. They -- I -- I -- you know, as open as I -- I always say when they say,\noh Americans don\u2019t like us, or this and that. And I say no, no, no, you know,\nAmericans are very open and they\u2019re very accepting, and I think generally they are.\nBut there always is sort of a divide, nevertheless and you know, I felt like I was\nalways sort of there to be between them and -- and that other world. And funny that I\nnever felt-- I know that there are people who feel -- and there are many foreign ESL\nteachers now, I mean foreign born ESL teachers now, and very often they will feel\nwith the kids against that outside. But I never did. I just always felt that I was the\nAmerican. And you know, people ca -- kids ask me, you know, where I\u2019m from and\nI said, well, I\u2019m from here, but I wasn\u2019t born here. I\u2019Il tell them right away. But --\nand -- and I often tell them when they ask me about it, I say well, that\u2019s why I can\nunderstand you better, because I had this -- I went through the same experience. Of\ncourse, I was very lucky in that I had someone to take care of me and guide me and -\n- and I knew the language and -- and I was educated and makes a big difference.",
        "A: Makes a huge difference. But even the way I grew up, I grew up, you know, in a\nsmall town with sort of a -- it -- it\u2019s very funny because Yugoslavia 1s -- I mean,\nCroatia now, but Yugoslavia certainly, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- really a class society. It\u2019s a -- a\n-- United States is too, but we -- we claim we aren\u2019t. And to some extent, even\nthough we are, I -- I think there is an easier way of -- th-the -- the division, the\nvertical division isn\u2019t nearly as strong as it is there. And I g -- I grew up -- I know\nthat sounds funny because of what had happened to me, but I grew up privileged in\nmany ways, you know, because I was sort of [speaks foreign language here] which\nmeans sort of like a -- from a noble family, you know. But that\u2019s because of my\nuncle, not so much -- and -- and I was always taught that -- that you had to ha -- to\nhelp and -- and be -- I know that sounds awfully patrician, but was like, you know, to\nnot lord it over kids who have less, and to give. And -- and be helpful, and it just\nkind of stayed with me. So that -- so it comes to me naturally to -- to -- to do -- you\nknow, to work, to -- to work with these all -- kids. I had all -- both of those things,\nyou know. To having come from di -- from -- from that background and then -- then\ncome from -- then come to this country. So it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s sort of a double whammy. It\nwas sort of I s -- I often instinctively understood, or I think I understood.",

        "A: Because in \u201899 I retired from Montgomery county public schools. Not that I\ncouldn\u2019t have gone on, but a lot of my friends were retiring and I was getting a bit\ntired of being there morning, noon and night, from seven in the morning til who\nknows what hour and then doing work in the evening. And the school was closing\nfor two years and moving to another venue, and while --while BCC was being\nrebuilt. And I thought well, that\u2019s sort of -- I -- and I just -- I -- I had just turned 60\nand I thought, well, it\u2019s an opportune moment for me to close down, so I don\u2019t have\nto pack and repack and unpack and okay, so this 1s it. So I had just retired, and --\nwhen -- and I -- of course I knew Lucie Rosenberg for awhile. Actually, an ESL\nperson who is a mutual friend introduced us, and -- some years ago, and she had\nstarted telling me about that -- about this material arriving from Jasenovac, and from\nCroatia and that she had started working on it. And then I asked her about it again\nand again. And I had started working immediately back for the county, but on a part\ntime basis as a -- as a -- a consultant. So I was working basically two days a week\nand I had more time and I said well, you know, let me take a look at it and she said\nshe never -- she hadn\u2019t wanted to ask me to come, but she was thrilled that I would\nwant to go. But she hadn\u2019t wanted to ask me because she thought it would be too\nclose to home for me, emotionally. And -- but I said yeah, I\u2019m pretty tough, I\u2019Il look\nat it. So I went one time with her and Sanya. They were working on this material that\nhad arrived from Jasenovac and that was in Linthicum, ready to be -- well, they had\nalready been working on it, was in -- totally in process -- in progress. But they were\ndoing everything from classifying material, a written material to packing forks and\nknives and spoons that had been found in camp. Not knives, forks and spoons that\nhave been unearthed from the camp, into envelopes and marking them to -- you\nknow, writing translations of letters and there was one cookbook and things of that\nnature. And I said fine, P\u2019Il do 1t with you once a week, so we went there once a\nweek and started working on it, and that\u2019s how I started doing it.",

You know, it\u2019s just awful, just\nawful. So, you know, I continue working on it, P\u2019ve -- P\u2019ve -- I-I can steel myself and\ndo these things because I feel like the language is so important, and there are so few\npeople that can translate and so -- and that can un -- that understand that world, so --\nso I do it.

The Italians were the\nsouthern enemy and it was very nice when we got rid of them, and we won against\nthem, but of course, you know -- and it was the partisans, of course, that chased them\nout of Dalmatia. That was how I saw things. Never a -- never realizing, you know,\nthat if not for Italians, many more Jews would have been killed, and that, you know,\nthat m -- some -- many of my friends survived there a -- and that, you know, th-there\nwere uprisings there.

Cause I had -- I think I\nwas very aware that I had, and I still have big chunks of -- of missing knowledge,\nhistorical knowledge.

But I don\u2019t know anything about their, you know, feelings, thoughts,\nwhere they were going, what they were doing. And I remember my cousins very\nwell, and I's -- I do miss them.

        "A: I joined a group of child Holocaust survivors in the area, Washington area, do\nyou know about that group? It was just by accident. I sort of didn\u2019t even realize it\nwas -- that it existed. And then I found out about it from a fellow who also originally\ncame from Croatia. I met him at Flori Dragota\u2019s and he 1s, you know, very -- has\nvery different reactions from mine, and he\u2019s quite bitter and unhappy in many ways.\nAnd he said that this is the place that he\u2019s very happy with, because he could never\ntalk about what had happened, which I didn\u2019t have any trouble w -- you a -- asked\nme that before. I didn\u2019t go around talking about it, but 1f anybody ever asked, I\ntalked about it. Well, he said he -- he wa-was into denial in many ways, until he met\nthis group. And I can\u2019t remember exactly when the group put itself together and\nhow, but it\u2019s fairly decent size, and it -- it did one thing for me, and that is it said,\nokay, I am a Holocaust survivor, because children -- and that -- everybody 1n that\ngroup says that, that those of us, especially those of us who were hidden, that\u2019s really\nthe -- I mean, there is now a special group for that, but among this group of\nchildhood Holocaust survivors, some of them were in camps and some of them were\nnot. Many were not. And -- like my -- my daughter-in-law\u2019s mother, from -- who is\nfrom Poland lost practically all of her family. Everybody except her -- I think one\nuncle and her mother. And she is much more acting traum -- was much more\ntraumatized by it -- by it than I. And she mentions it -- something about the\nHolocaust practically every time I see her. Now, whether she does it because she\nknows I went through the experience, or whether it\u2019s general, I don\u2019t know. But\npeople either -- I know people who talk about it a lot, like my aunt, or people who\nnever talk about it. I was probably someplace in the middle. And s-so -- so this --\nthis -- this fellow said they will -- had this group and I said oh, I\u2019d like to come and\nsee. So I have joined the group since, and have -- it\u2019s supposed -- it\u2019s been\ninteresting to listen to other people\u2019s experiences, and to -- to see to what extent -- I -\n- |\u2019m -- I was also trying to categorize, you know, are people who lived in camps\ndifferent from those who didn\u2019t, or there a -- are -- there 1 -- there is a sort of great\naffinity among people who came from different countries, I noticed. You know, just\nto -- there are many people from Poland, for example, and many -- fewer from\nGermany or certainly fewer from Croatia.

And I don\u2019t -- I didn't talk to Iona, to her mother, to see what that was all\nabout. Daniella is pretty with it, so you know, she -- for a nine and a half year old,\nshe -- she reads well, and she understands a lot. And the other day we were talking\nabout the black experience, and she was talking to me about the underground\nrailroad. So I\u2019m sure she could understand some of that.

I think I was right, but the\nCroats -- I still feel -- think I was right, but I don\u2019t know whether you were reading\nLouis in the \u201cNew York Times.\u201d He -- I -- I really agreed with his point of view. I\nthink people here -- I mean, the politicians here, the government felt -- you know,\nthey thought it was going to be another Vietnam. No, I mean, Iraq is going to be\nanother Vietnam, but herl -- but Yugoslavia could have been saved, but not by -- by\ndoing what [indecipherable] was doing, like siding with Milosevic. But -- but by\ngetting him out of power and -- and reestablishing law and order and -- and -- and\nsome semblance of democracy.",
        "A: Croatia.",
        "A: Everybody.",
        "A: I was trying to explain to them -- everybody was asking me and I was trying to\nexplain that it\u2019s not a Vietnam and that it could be stopped easily. I think it could\nhave been stopped very easily from the beginning. I was starting to explain that there\nare -- th-the business of, you know, the ethnic animosity is age long -- you know,\nages long. Well, of course there were, but I mean -- so there are between the north\nand the south in the United States, but we don\u2019t go killing each other, you know.\nYeah, there are -- there are crazies running around in bars and stripes, so what, you\nknow? And the fact that I felt like, you know, you could have -- yo -- if you had that\nkind of leadership in United States, you could have this country in a -- in turmoil at\nno time at all. You get a lot of those Nazi party types, or you know, David whatever\nhis name was, or somebody elected t-t --",
        "A: Yes, what was his name?",
        "A: I mean, people like that can stir up ethnic hatreds in two seconds. I mean, you\nknow, Latinos, blacks, you know, the -- cities could burn. I mean, you have to -- you\nhave to have the kind of leadership that says no, this will not do. We cannot have\nthat kind of behavior and -- and do -- instead of allowing that kind of -- that kind of,\nyou know, leadership to -- to go on, I -- I just -- I just felt like it was -- it\u2019s such a\npity. I mean, my Croatian friends, mind you, don\u2019t feel that way. I mean, they feel\nthat -- they feel that they are -- they are very happy to be rid of Serbs. They are very\nhappy to be rid of Yugoslavia and communism. Okay, communism I can see, but\nyou know, if they wanted to separate, it could have been done later, I mean the -- but\nif, you know, if Romania can make it, and -- and Poland can make it, Yugoslavia\ncould have made it. I don\u2019t know. I -- I -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a pity, I think. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: [inaudible] have anything, I don\u2019t know. ... I don\u2019t know, what didn\u2019t we talk\nabout?",
        "A: You think?",
        "A: It must be personality. I was really lucky.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Yeah.",
        "A: I was -- I -- I really would have [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: True, and I think -- I think it\u2019s my Shoah tape, I -- which I haven\u2019t seen the whole\nthing either, but I remember doing it and I remember talking about everything and I\ncried at the very end because I think -- well, I think as the loss of my parents as\nbeing a horrendous thing. I think it was horrendous for them, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as\nhorrendous for me, which is a horrible thing to say, but because I have no memory of\nit. I can imagine what must have been like, now that I have children. After I had\nchildren, I was thinking of it. What must have been like for my parents to have given\nme away\u201d Basically, that\u2019s what they did. And even worse for my -- to -- to give\naway my brother. [phone ringing |[tape break]",
        "A: I think about my brother because I left -- I left almost like I\u2019m going to my\ngrandparents and I\u2019m going sort of like --",
        "A: -- who knows, you know, for a visit and maybe I\u2019Il be back. Maybe\n[indecipherable] maybe -- maybe it\u2019Il be -- all be okay. But my brother, they were\nalready in jail and he was a baby and my mother handed him away. So it must have\nbeen just horrendous. I think for me and my -- of course, my uncle died when he was\nin his 80\u2019s, so that was sad, but you expect older people to die. But to lose my\nhusband when I did was really a horrendous experience. That was the worst.",
        "A: Yeah, I was 54. And I think -- the reason I say I\u2019m luck -- I was lucky -- and I\nwas, because I had these people through my life, you know, first my uncle and then\nmy husband, who really were there for me to lean on and -- and -- and just continue,\nyou know, in my nice, as you say, straight way. If not for them, I don\u2019t know what\nmy life would have been like. It would have been -- I -- I may have -- I -- I was born\nwith -- with -- with a person -- with this personality, but who knows how my\npersonality would have been developed had I not had them. So, yes I\u2019m lucky that I\nwas -- that I was born -- I mean, it\u2019s good that I was born this way and I ha -- that I\nhave the personality I have, but -- but I was extremely lucky to -- to have -- to have\nhad that op -- you know, to have had these people in my life. And -- and later on,\nyou know, to have my children, who are, you know, who were here, and -- and a lot\nof friends. That, of course, you know, could have all been different. Let\u2019s say that I\ncontinued living in Long Island, let\u2019s say that I didn't meet my husband, that I went\nback to Yugoslavia. I\u2019m very glad to have -- to have been able to -- to turn back\ntoward being Jewish, which I knew nothing about. I knew I was Jewish, but 1t meant\nnothing.",
        "A: I think -- you know, I have early, early remembrances both pro and con. I don\u2019t\nthink I ever told anybody this story. I remember in ne -- a story of rejection. I had a\nlittle -- this 1s true confession story. I don\u2019t think I ever told anyone. I -- I remember\nthat I had, I don\u2019t know why it was mine, but I had a little Mogen Davide, that was\nfamily\u2019s. And why, at one time, must have been in one of those times when I felt like\nbeing Jewish was horrible because, you know, children told me that Jews killed\nChrist and it was terrible. And I gave that away. I gave it to one of my -- one of the\nlike farmer girls, peasant girls. And I said, well, I\u2019m not going to need this. So that\u2019s\nstory one. Then story two, I remember finding papers in the house, and I found a --\nthe music for [indecipherable] and I could play the piano and I played that and\nsomehow like from some other world, that sounded very emotionally stirring to me.\nAnd I don\u2019t know how old I was. I was fairly young. And then, of course, came my -\n- the watershed trip to -- to -- to Switzerland, when all of a sudden I found myself in\nan Orthodox family. And -- but -- but I had such a good feeling toward my uncle,\nthat -- my father\u2019s brother. I-I remember seeing him as he waited -- he came to wait\nfor me at the border and the train came into the border and I\u2019m looking out a window\nand I\u2019m thinking, am I going to recognize him? But I did, and he recognized me\nimmediately. We did exchange pictures, but still I thought I might not recognize\nhim, and I was fairly scared. That was 1954, I think, I was young and -- high school\nkid. And I had this really very warm experience and very emotional experience that\nthis was someone I was related to. I had never -- I -- I hadn\u2019t -- from the time that I\nwas like seven, when I saw my other co -- uncle for the last time, I never had any --\nmet any family members. It was so -- it was stirring. And then coming into this\nfamily, I was very willing to -- to learn and to find out and to think -- to accept the\nfact that I was Jewish and -- and everything that went with it. And you know, at that\npoint, I mean that -- that -- that -- that Mogen Davide experience was I must have\nbeen like eight years old or something. Was very long time ago. And -- but I -- I\nremembered it because I often thought about it later and I kind of regretted it. So it\nwas -- it was sort of a new -- an -- an -- an -- an experience that -- that I was willing\nto -- to accept and it just felt -- it felt right, just sort of right. And, you know, when --\nwhen I met Dan, of course, I -- I didn\u2019t know he was Jewish, because I couldn\u2019t tell\nJews. I can -- you know, now I can. It\u2019s like I couldn\u2019t tell on the phone somebody\nwho was from the south, and certainly someone who was black, I couldn\u2019t tell. I\nremember being totally surprised that Dan once got off the phone and said, this was\na black lady and she wanted to know this and that. I was like, how do you know?\nYou were on the phone. Are you clairvoyant or something? I didn\u2019t understand\nanything about language, and so I couldn\u2019t un -- I didn\u2019t know anything about\npeople\u2019s physiognomy or recognizing anything special, or expressions or anything.\nAnyway -- and of course -- and he -- he, who would normally have recognized it,\ndidn\u2019t recognize it in me because he never expected the Jew from Yugoslavia, in\nYugoslavia, I should say. Because you know, people think, oh well, they were all\nannihilated and who knows whether there were any. I mean, who knows --",
        "A: -- what about Yugoslavia? Dan was really savvy, but still he didn\u2019t know. So I\nremember when -- when the excitement, overall excitement, and I -- you see, I -- I ex\n-- | w -- this is -- this is actually going back to one of your questions that I -- I would\ntell people. In like my third letter I wrote to him about my history, because he asked\nme what I was doing in Switzerland. And I would have just said I\u2019m visiting 1n -- an\nuncle and an aunt.",
        "A: But I went through the whole story and I told him that -- that they had survived\nBergen-Belsen and they are in Switzerland since the end of the war, and that my\nparents had been killed, and that -- that I\u2019m living with them for a year. And so he\nwrote immediately back in saying how excited he was to find out that I was Jewish\nbecause he was Jewish too, and there was great excitement in the -- in the family,\nbecause I told them. So it -- so that alone tells me that I was always very open about\nmy experience. And -- and I -- I just -- I just -- I don\u2019t know. I -- I just -- you know,\nfelt right about it. My aunt, of course, always says that it\u2019s in the blood because I -- I\nlearned all the kosher rules and everything very fast.",
        "A: No, no. They\u2019re not religious. Wanda\u2019s particularly not religious, but -- but they\nfeel -- they -- they -- they feel very Jewish. Elliot is -- Elliot married a Jewish girl\nand they are -- they belong to Avas Israel and the kids go to Hebrew school. They\u2019re\nnot very religious, but they follow holidays and I don\u2019t know, you know. I think\nsome of it is Iona\u2019s doing. But that\u2019s often so, you know.",
        "A: Women --",
        "A: -- seem to be the carriers, yeah, of -- of customs and so on. I don\u2019t know what\nElliot would have done on his own. Not that he doesn\u2019t feel very Jewish, but he may\nnot -- they don\u2019t -- neither of them 1s particularly observant.",
        "A: So --",
        "A: -- in -- in every way. It\u2019s just that he always felt like that\u2019s too much praying.",
        "A: Well, another bit of luck. I think the fact that my in-laws and that whole\ngeneration of people, their siblings, were all immigrants. They all came early, but\nthey came in the 1920\u2019s, made a huge difference. So, my husband and -- and all the -\n- and his brother and all the cousins, they were all first generation. They had all\ngrown up with parents who talked about the old country, and so I was accepted\nabsolutely totally and completely into the family. And they have -- that family has\nbeen absolutely fantastic to me. And after Dan\u2019s death, cause he -- he was the oldest\nof the -- of the children, and he di -- of that generation -- he was the oldest of that\ngeneration and he died first. And the -- the ca -- the cousins -- well, his brother is,\nyou know, very close to me, but all -- but that\u2019s almost to be expected, but the\ncousins have all absolutely rallied around me and I am absolutely part of that family,\ntotally. The cousins that I mentioned before who were -- lived in Arlington, they\neventually returned, had lived all over and then they came from -- th-they\u2019re -- they\nwere in England and they\u2019re now in Arlington. And I see them all the time, we went\nto the march yesterday together. And the other cousin, this person\u2019s brother, Danny\nwho lives in Long Island, they were just here also, they went to a wedding here, and\nthey stayed with me. So it\u2019s just we\u2019re -- we are very -- everybody is very close, and\ntheir children are close to my children. My children, unfortunately, don\u2019t have any\ncousins. Their -- I only have these two children and my brother-in-law had no\nchildren and I have no siblings, so my children have no cousins. And they pretty\nmuch consider Dan\u2019s cousin\u2019s children their cousins and -- and they\u2019re quite close.\nSo I was s-super, super lucky on that score as well.",
        "A: In fact, A-A-Aunt Mara, my mother\u2019s sister, who lived a -- in Long Island and\nher -- her son Paul is exactly my age. And she was constantly telling him why o -- a-\nasking him why couldn\u2019t he cou -- why couldn\u2019t he go and marry somebody from\nEurope? That would be so nice. Oh, he married a no -- he married a lovely American\ngirl whom I adore, Joan, and that\u2019s that. But anyway, they -- the -- that -- I did not\nhave that -- that problem, because, m-mainly I think people face that with families\nwho have, you know, been here for a very long time and -- and have gotten totally,\nyou know, 1m -- Americanized. My in-laws were -- used to joke that you can take --\nwhich is probably why they lived the way I -- they lived, you know, I -- we used to\nsay that -- that they came out of the shtetl, but they couldn\u2019t -- you can take them out\nof the shtetl, but you can\u2019t take the shtetl out of them, you know. And you know,\nMom was always satisfied with very little. She never wanted very much of anything,\nyou know, and they -- they were super -- had super modest way of life. And just, you\nknow, they were very, very -- still very, very much part of the old country, even\nthough, you know the-they came here, they stru -- they really struggled hard in life.\nMy father-in-law came here with no English. He was 20 years old. He came with no\nmoney. How he ever -- and he was not a | -- a -- a -- a language learner. In fact, I\nmean, to hi -- to the end of his life, and he died in his 90\u2019s, he spoke English in si --\nwith -- with great deal of Yiddish and -- thrown in and whatever. And -- but he -- he\n-- and he -- but he made it through -- through -- through school and -- and got a d --\ndegree in pharmacy and became a pharmacist, a licensed pharmacist in the state -- in\nthe state of New York, and -- and had -- had -- had a small, you know, sort of\nprofessional kind of a drugstore, you know, not -- no -- no pri -- n-no counter, just --\njust drugs. So, you know, how they made it on, you know -- a-and so every fe --\nevery little bit that they had, it was like there and preserved and -- and so they lived a\nsort of -- in -- and they were very, very American in their eye -- you know, pro-\nAmerican, but their outlook was very much steeped in Europe, in old Europe, yeah.\nAnd it\u2019s -- Mom went to -- Mom came -- had a easier time coming, because she\nalready had an uncle here. But you know, she -- you know, th-th-they -- they were\nalso lucky in a sense that they -- they got educated reasonably well in Europe. They\nboth went through high school, which was not a very common thing in those days in\n-- in Russian. So -- and Mom spoke English quite well, and sh-she was much more\nof a language person than Pop, but -- and, you know, we had -- we had the usual,\nyou know, daughter, in-laws relationship sometimes, where you -- but -- but the --\nth-the -- the problems I had with them were mostly problems that my husband had\nwith them, too, rather than, you know, just you know, mostly -- I don\u2019t know what\nthe problems were like, you know, are you going to buy this sofa or that sofa, or you\ncan\u2019t buy the house, it\u2019s so expensive.",
        "A: Or whatever now, since it\u2019s --",
        "A: Just the normal stuff, yeah.",
        "A: Nothing that -- that would be related to my being from another -- from another\nworld, also.",
        "A: They were much more from another world than I.",
        "A: Good.",
        "A: No, I -- I wish -- I so wish that we had done a tape like that with my husband, I\nhave so little from him.",
        "A: It\u2019s a very -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s really good. I think all -- every family should do\nthat.",
        "A: Never mind --",
        "A: Never mind hav -- this having to do with a particular issue that other people may\n-- may want to understand later on.",
        "A: But it\u2019s just -- just to understand what goes on in families and how they relate to\neach other and to the world. That would be an interesting thing to do.",
