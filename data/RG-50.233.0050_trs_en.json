        "\n.\n_\u2014 be ~\nINTERVIEW WITH EUGENIA GRUDZINSKA hE--E O. 2.23, COEV\nJuly 13, 1991\n(Szczecin, Poland)",
        "My name is Eugenia Grudzinska. I was born in Riga on December |",
        "23, 1912. My mother was Polish. My father was a Russian, an\nofficer in the Czar's army. He later left the service and,\nbecause he was a business school graduate, he worked as an\naccountant. My maiden name is Yevkieyev. It is difficult to\npronounce because it is Russian. I was first married in 1937, to\na Polish officer, Lieutenant Adam Wisniewski, who was killed in\nKatyn. We lived twelve kilometers from the Soviet border. When\non September 17 Soviet troops crossed the border at three o'clock\nin the morning, by five o'clock in the morning my husband had\nbeen arrested as an officer. I stayed at home. The next day\nthey brought my husband home to get his coat. I was not home at\nthat time. I went to the Russian headquarters, because I knew\nthey had brought him to the house, and asked to see him. They\ntold me he was not there. The third or fourth time that I was",
        "| there, an elderly man went out after me. I didn't know their\nranks and what rank he was, and he told me. I was twenty four at the\ntime, he said \"Child, you make a life for yourself and do not\nwait for him, because he will never again come back.\" That was\nall he said, but he told me not to come anymore unless I wanted\nto be arrested. That was a tiny town, half of it were Jews and\nthe other half were Tartars. The Tartars helped us escape from\nthere. There were only five officers' families, and six families\nof non-commissioned officers. The Tartars took care of us and\nhelped us escape. The town was called Kleck. It was twelve\nkilometers from the Soviet border, twenty kilometers past\nNieswies. Nieswies was a beautiful little town. Minckiewicz\nmentions it in his writings. After escaping from Kleck, I came\nto Zambrow, where I had been raised for the most part. Because\nmy mother and I had left Russia in 1921, my father was not\nallowed to leave because he was a Soviet, a Russian, citizen, and\nmy mother and I went to Poland for a year, thinking that after a\nyear communism would be over in Russia and we could go back\nthere, because we had a house and some property there. But we\nnever came back and we never saw father again. Mother lived in\nZambrow with us four children, whom she raised with the help of\nmy grandparents. I had two sisters and one brother. The Tartars\ntook me almost to my mother's door from Kleck. I came back at\nfour in the afternoon. At three o'clock that night, someone\nknocked at the window and said \"Pani Yevkieyev, your daughter\nmust run away.\u201d The Soviets were already there. They had\nalready found out from the NKVD that an officer's wife had\nreturned and they would come arrest me in the morning. So at\nthree in the morning I put my ski clothes back on, put my",
        "backpack on, and escaped on foot thirty kilometers through the\nforest to Ostrow Mazowiecka. I had to cross the Soviet-German",
        ". ",
        "border, but it was not watched that closely, there were guides",
        "there. It took me two days to get there because I needed a guide\nto take me across the border. So those thirty kilometers were\nsplit up into two days. I stopped ina village. I knew the\nlocal villages, and it was not hard for me to get to Ostrow\nMazowiecka. My elder sister lived there. Later I went to\nWarsaw, where my other sister lived. I lived with her. As an\nofficer's wife, I immediately was aware that an organization was\nat work... I met a friend of my husband's on the street. He ran\nup to me and told me his new surname that was on his Kennkarte.\nThat was Captain Woyniak, while the name on the card was",
        "| Malinowski. He let me know right away not use his real name. I\nbecame involved in the organization through this Captain\nWoyniak. In the organization, you knew two or three people, no\nmore. It was a system of threes. But I did know Pani\nKnolkownacka, General Knolkownacki's wife, from Poznan. She was\nthe soul of the organization that I belonged to, which was a\ndivision of the ZWZ. I do not even know who exactly was in\ncharge there. Some major swore me in. That was 1941. So I was\nworking for them for more than a year before I took the oath.\nThey had to be certain of people, after all. JI was a courier. I\ncarried various things given to me at my rendezvous. [I had two\nrendezvous: one was on Sniadeckich Street, at a tailor's.\nDownstairs at the tailor\u2019s there were German offices. So when I\ncame down with the things, I just had to walk past those offices,\nwhere there were guards and so on; my legs always shook then and I\nwas always afraid of that. The other rendezvous was at a\ndifferent tailor\u2019s, at Pani Dmochowskie. You remember Pani\nDmochowska. Pani Dmochowska lived here in Szczecin. And these\nwere the two people from the organization that I knew well. I\nalso knew a commander, a student named Marysia Lasocka. I was\nsworn in by the major and her. Later it turned out that her\nsister and she were Jewish, and they were arrested along with the\nrest of us. They arrested fifty-three of us women onn the .\nnineteenth of January, 1942. It was night, and it was twenty\ndegrees below (zero). They drove up to my house at two o'clock. Poles\ndid not have cars. Private cars were not even allowed, so any car\ndriving at night was known to be the Gestapo. That night, my\nbrother-in-law came from Ostrow Mazowiecka. He knew that I\nworked for the organization. He never asked me about it, but he\nknew. Also, one was not allowed to have a radio, but I would\ntell him news and information that had to come from the radio.\nSuddenly we heard a car coming. I said to him \"I wonder where it\nwill stop.\u201d It passed my house and stopped at the corner. About\nfive minutes later, we heard them banging on the door of the\nbuilding. I was on the third floor. The building had four\nfloors. We heard the superintendent go down and open the door.\nThey were coming up the stairs, German voices. They stopped in\nfront of our door. When they knocked, I was literally at the\ndoor in a second, and I opened it, because I was afraid that they\nwould shoot. Six of them came in. Four were in civilian clothes\nand two were in military uniforms, Gestapo. They began searching\nthe apartment, they told my brother-in-law to put his hands up.",
        "It was a small apartment, two rooms and a kitchen, because [I\nlived with my sister . My sister was not there. They saw that my\nbrother-in-law was not on the list and they left him. They were\ntaking people from a list. When they were checking their list, I\nrealized that it was all people from my organization, because I\nsaw the name of a Professor Zygler [ph - 104], a botanist.\nSometimes there would be secret study groups of high school\nstudents at my home. That professor was from the organization\n| and he held those underground classes in my apartment. Two or\nthree days earlier, he had brought me a hundred copies of the |\ncurriculum for schooling for 1941-1942 from London, with the seal\nof the London government on it. I had put them behind the door.\nI had a little shelf covered by a cloth, and I had put those\nhundred copies there. When the German opened the door and stood\nin the doorway, he covered up the shelf, and they did not find\nthe curricula . Those stayed behind. My friend, whom they came\nfor the same night, was patching up a map of all of the meeting\nplaces of our organizations. She was patching it with some cloth\n| because it had been torn. She put it between a blanket and a\nbedspread on her bed. When they lifted up the blanket, they\nlifted the bedspread with it, so they did not find that map\neither. Wonderful accidents. They took the whole family there,\ntwo sons, her, her husband. Only she and her sons came back.\nHer husband did not come back. There were fifty-three women\narrested in our organization and forty-nine came back. There\nwere two hundred and seventy men arrested that night and not a\nsingle one came back. Almost all of them were shot as hostages.\nSome were taken to Auschwitz, the stronger ones, and they worked\nthere for some time, but they had death sentences and they were\nexecuted there, in Auschwitz. Many people from our organization\ndied in Auschwitz. It turned out later that a person who had our\nlist betrayed us. His name was Adam Smuga. He was a lawyer,\nthirty years old, an only child. He was a very wealthy person,\nbut he allowed himself to be bought. He did not live long,\nhowever. The Germans would refer(?) him, so they did not protect\nhim at all after they got what the wanted. And we had contacts\nwith the outside world. The so-called \"grypsy,\" secret messages\nand letters in the prison, went out through our commanders in\nPawiak, and we let our people outside know. . . He was arrested\nalong with the other men and then released. They told the men in\nthe prison he had been executed, that they took him to Szucha\nBoulevard and shot him. I was interrogated three times on Szucha\nBoulevard. Adam Smuga was shot by the underground organization,\nwhich sentenced him for treason. They checked very carefully, and\nthey found out. I was in Pawiak for five months. On May 30, the\n| Germans organized a transport to Ravensbruck. It was called a ;\nSonderntransport. There were on 3 hundred and twenty (?) of us and\nmore were added in Lublin, so together there were a hundred and\nfifty. And on May 30, 1942, they brought us to Ravensbruck,\nwhere I was given the number 11,332 . Elf tausend drei hundert\n) zwei und dreisig. I did not know German, but I had to learn it,\nbecause I had to identify myself as \"haftling elf tausend drei",
        "hundert zwei und dreisig . \"I was in Ravensbruck until November\n1943 . My work detail there was called \"Ausen.\" They took us out.\nto work, to the fields . We gathered potatoes, carrots,\nrutabagas, pori [ ph - 160]. It was good work in one respect as we\nalways brought something back to the camp with us. We learned to\nhide it so that it would not be found when the auz jerka [ph -\n16 2]. The searches were somewhat haphazard, anyway. We were in\ncolumns of thirty or forty people, and there were always an\nauz jerka, an SS-man, and a dog. An SS-man with a pistol, a dog,\nand an auz jerka (?) . The auz jerka was the guard that watched\nover us. I was then taken to a factory for airplane parts and\nammunition, Neu-Brandenburg. There were 6,000 of us there, in\nNeu-Brandenburg . 3,000 worked during the day and 3, 000 at night.\nThe next week, those who had been working nights worked days and\nvice versa. I stayed there until the end. There was at least a\ndozen different nationalities in Ravensbruck and Neu-Brandenburg.\n| I am sure that every school-book has that information. There\nwere German women, because they were imprisoned too. For\nexample, I met a general's wife in Ravensbruck who was there for\nbuying bacon fat illegally. She got three months. Her husband\nwas at the front . So they treated their own that way also. I\nwas in Neu-Brandenburg until the end. On April 28, the camp was\nevacuated. The SS-men guarded us one or two more days. They\nmarched us all in a tight column. All of the concentration camps\nwere heading \u00a3 or Lubeck . We did not know what they wanted to do in\nLubeck, but the camps never got that far. The Soviet front was\nmoving so quickly that they abandoned us and ran away. They all\nhad civilian clothing under their uniforms and they left us. I\n| walked back to Poland. It took me three weeks and I covered 360\nkilometers. There were fifteen of us returning together and we\nwere all very weakened. Pani Helena Jurgelewicz, the wife of\nPresident Moscicki's aide-de-camp, and herself a veterinarian,\nwas there with her daughter, Krystyna. Also Marysia Kaleczko\n[ph - 194], a young girl, Lirka [ph ~ 194] Zielinska, a young\ngirl, Iza Marcowna, who had converted to Catholicism. So I was\nin Pawiak for five months, not to mention the fact that I was\n, interrogated three times on Szucha Boulevard, where one sat ina\nbox. One could not move because there was an SS-man behind\nwatching. Often one would sit for twelve or fourteen hours\nbefore the interrogation. I was interrogated three times. But just\nlife in the cell... the cell was built for ten prisoners. There\nwere twenty-five of us . We lay down to sleep next to each other\n| so that if one of us wanted to turn over, she had to nudge the\nwoman next to her and they would both turn over at the same time.\nThere were only three beds, which folded out of the wall. During\nthe day we had to fold them up, so we could only sit on the\nfloor . But the nights were the worst. The liquidation of the\nghetto had begun then . The SS-men who watched us - Birkel [ ph\n| 211], who was later killed on the street by the resistance,\nFriegert [ph - 213], who hanged himself, Wirupp [ph ~ 215], whose\nlast name I do not know. We called him Wirup (?) or Egg",
        "; ",
        "Watchman because he would cut open eggs in packages looking for\nnotes hidden inside them. We joked that he was scrupulously\ninvestigating whether Polish chickens lay secret messages or not.\nAfter all, it was ridiculous to think that someone could hide\nanything in an egg . At night the SS men drank an enormous\namount. Looking back, I am convinced that they were using\nnarcotics as well. They were completely unconscious people.\nThey make us do roll-calls in the middle of the night, count us\nall again, take us with their dogs outside as if they were going",
        ", to shoot us, then bring us back . We lived in constant fear there\nin Pawiak. They told us that we would be sent to a camp but did \u2018\nnot name the camp. I knew only that they sent people to\nAuschwitz. I only found out about Ravensbruck while at Pawiak.\nWe did not know we would go there. Let me return to what they\nwould do. They would bring Jews to the outside of our cell,\noutside of the women\u2019s prison, and shoot at them. We were on the\nfirst floor, so we could hear the crying groans of those people,\nthe gnashing of their teeth as they died. While it was\nhappening, there was a great silence among us . Many of us were\npraying, and there was just a great silence. We were afraid to\nlook out because they put spotlights on the prison just to see\nwhether we were looking out or not. And then they would shoot.\nWhen they left in the morning to sleep, we would look out. There\nwas so much blood that a white foam formed on it. A foam just\nlike... it is not easy for me to say, but blood flowed in\ngutters. The dead lay there and the Jewish police would come and\npick them up. There was a Jewish orphanage across from us. We\nwould see how the Germans came and took the children and the\npeople taking care of them away. They would shoot them either\nagainst our wall or on the opposite side. They literally did it\nso that we could see. They were cruel, sadists. And the",
        ". commandant was Birkel, who was shot by the underground in Warsaw.\nThat was soon after we left, I think less than a year later.\nGetting onto the transport, we thanked God that we were leaving\nthat hell. We did not know what awaited us: they were\nliguidating the ghetto. With my own eyes I saw how they stood an\nold Jew under our windows and put a can on his head and shot at\nthe can. The croaking of those Germans, that laughter... they\nfinally shot him. Or, for example, they told him to run away.\nThey took a woman who was in clogs. When she started to run, we\ncould hear her steps and then her scream. She did not get far,\nthey shot her. But sometimes they would let them get away.\nOnce we saw them take two young boys and put them against the\nopposite wall. They put empty cans on their heads and fired at\nthem. The boys were crying very hard. They were twelve or\nthirteen. They let those boys run away. They did not shoot\nthem. It depended on their mood. The Germans were cruel to the\nJews in the ghetto, cruel . As far as the ghetto goes, a\nstreetcar went through it. The ghetto was in the middle of\nWarsaw. The ghetto was in a Jewish neighborhood, but many Aryan\nstreets were included in it. If one wanted to get to the other",
        "Side of town, one had to ride the street-car through. Two\nGermans stood in every street-car. But the Poles would always\nfind a way... they would even distract the guard. When he looked\nthe other way, one threw food out. I always took bread along\nwith some kind of fat. A piece of bacon, a piece of sausage...\nwhatever there was. It was very hard during the occupation. For\nexample, I could not eat margarine. I had some kind of allergy.\nI always threw that margarine to the ghetto with bread. Often I\nwould return with the bread and margarine, if I did not get the\nchance to throw it out. Some of the Germans watched people, but\nsome would become bored and then one could throw it. Especially\nto the children. Children stood all along the entire street-car\ntrack, begging for help. I belonged to an organization, but I\ndid not know if there were any contacts with German\norganizations. But I know that there were. I know that arms\nwere brought. I worked in a small cafe, Kruszynka, on\nMarszakowska Street. In order to be allowed to serve Germans, a\nrestaurant had to have a permit. The owner was General\nDugoszewski's sister. She may have been divorced, in any case I\ndid not know her husband. But she did not try to get that\npermit. There was a sign there that said that Germans were not\n| admitted. So Germans did not come to our cafe. But many people\ndid come. Mainly there were lawyers who had escaped from the\nPoznan province to the General Government. They had a little\nclub there. They would come and meet. Doctors would meet there.\nI more than once heard them planning how they would send\nshipments to the ghetto, mostly food. Later on, the ghetto was\ntightly sealed, but for a long time one could enter and exit the\nghetto freely, as long as one had a pass. The owner of the cafe\napplied for such a pass, posing as a Jew. She had a Binde, an\narmband like the Jews had to wear, with a yellow star. But she\nwas Polish, not Jewish. She had brown hair, so she could pass\nas Jewish. She carried food to the ghetto. This was never\n, discussed openly, because one could end up in front of a firing\nsquad for helping Jews in a second. But a great deal of aid went\nto the Jews. I feel that we passed... that as a Pole I passed\nthe examination; as a person, as a citizen. Especially because I\ngrew up in a small town, Zambrow, where there were many, many\nJews. The town had 7,000 inhabitants and 3,000 were Jewish. I\nhad a friend, Maszka Yankec, whose family had a bakery. A\nbeautiful girl. The whole family was eradicated, sent to\nTreblinka. The whole Yankec family died in Treblinka. Two\ndaughters, two sons, father, mother. Everyone perished. About\nhelp for the Jews: every Pole knew the risks. If he wanted to\nhelp, he had to do it very carefully, because he was endangering\nboth himself and the person that he was helping. Everyone knew\nthat if someone was throwing sandwiches, he was throwing them to\na Jewish child, because it was mostly children. Older people\nand adults also reached out, but it was mostly children. Of\ncourse, I did not look to whom I was throwing the food. I\njust threw, knowing that someone would be nourished. And there\nwere posters everywhere, proclaiming the death penalty for\nhelping Jews. And there were cases of whole families being shot\nif they were caught sheltering Jews. Sometimes Poles would take",
        "Jews simply to make money. Jews had dollars, nad money. Poorer\npeople would take Jews in for this reason. There were cases\nwhere the Pole was very honest and did not betray the Jew, and\nthere were also cases where Poles took the money and informed on\nthe Jew. People acted differently. But I knew many people who\nhelped. And truly, no one ever said \"A Jew. Why should we help?\"\nOn the contrary. On the contrary. The Germans said from the\nbeginning they would destroy the Jews and then go after the\nPoles. The Poles knew that the Jews' fate would be theirs also.\nAnd they were just as much at risk as the Jews were. There was\nno [ph - stynty]. It was just that the Jews had to wear armbands\nwith Zionist stars on them. All the Jews were labeled. If a Jew\nleft the ghetto, he usually hid the armband. It was easier to\nbuy things, to move around. Also, he did not know whom he might\nrun into, so he was afraid to wear the star. Poles did not have\nto wear anything of that sort. No other nationality had to. Only\nthe Jews.",
