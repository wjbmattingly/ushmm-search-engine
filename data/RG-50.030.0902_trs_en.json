        "A: Well, I\u2014 I have \u2014 yes, I do have some memories. They\u2019re very \u2014 because I was\nso young during the war years, some of them are vague, some of them may be\nmixed in with things that I was told later, or once I came here, things that I had read\n\u2014 read about, or heard about. But some of my earliest memories are sleeping in a \u2014\nin a\u2014 in acrib, and seeing a picture over my bed. Sleeping on a diagonal wall, and\nthere was either a picture, or a cross hanging over my bed. And wondering, why\nwould that image be there? Now \u2014",

        "A: Yes. I\u2019m the youngest of seven.",
        "Q: So, I'd like now to talk a little bit about your family. Tell me, who were your\nbrothers and sisters, and could you name them for me?",

        "A: He\u2019s the only boy in \u2014 in the family, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Actually, I think \u2014 I think I was supposed to be a boy, beca \u2014 well, because the\nname Bela is really a man\u2019s name. But I guess, you know, they got what they got.\nThen my sister, Zenta(ph).",
        "Q: Okay.September 28, 2016",

And then\nGertrude, born in 1932, in Berlin, and then Ren\u00e9 \u2014 let me make sure | got this\nright, there\u2019s so many of us. Alphonse(ph), Zenta(ph), Ruth, Gertrude was born\n1932, and then Ren\u00e9 was born in 1935. She\u2019s a girl, Ren\u00e9, the only other redhead.\nAnd then my sister Judy was born 1937.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And she was from Hungary.",
        "Q: Do you know what part?",
        "A: Rokopolishta(ph). I don\u2019t know wh \u2014 I think it\u2019s probably the western side of\nHungary. My father, who was born in \u2014 came from Powderbourne in Westphalia,\nhad gone \u2014 his family, I think, were umbrella makers, and he had traveled to \u2014 to\nHungary to sell umbrellas, and he met \u2014 was a little bit like meeting Rachel at the\nwell. I think he simply saw her, and struck up a friendship, and \u2014 and they got \u2014 he\nthen \u2014 he was born a Catholic, converted to Judaism, because my mother was the\ndaughter of a r \u2014 of a cantor.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: So they were Orthodox Jews. He converted to Judaism in order to be able to\nmarry her.",
        "Q: And do you know anything about her side of the family?",
        "A: Her side of the family?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, yeah.\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: Other than the fact that she was the daughter of a ra \u2014 of a cantor, I don\u2019t think I\ndo.",
        "Q: Do you know if she had brothers and sisters?",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t recall.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: There may \u2014 there may have been.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I certainly never met them.",
        "Q: And do your \u2014 on your father\u2019s side of the family, do you know if he had\nbrothers and sisters?",
        "A: Yes. I\u2014I\u2014I don\u2019t recall now how many, but I know that he was the oldest \u2014 the\neldest of at least one, maybe two or three brothers and sisters.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And when he and my mother traveled back to Germany, they went to his\nfamily, and at which point the family sort of disowned him, because he had married\noutside of Catholicism. And so there was a total break in the family.",
        "Q: Was the same true on your mother\u2019s side?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: Was the same thing true for your mother\u2019s side?September 28, 2016",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe so.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because he had converted to Judaism.",
        "Q: I see. I see.",
        "A: And s \u2014 and \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 and h-he practiced Judaism up un \u2014 really up until the time that we left\nGermany, after the war.",
        "Q: In those \u2014",
        "A: Ev \u2014 excuse me.",
        "Q: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: Even though \u2014 even though in 1940, he was sort of forced to renounce his\nconversion, and once again become Catholic. But I don\u2019t think \u2014 from things that\nI\u2019ve read, that my brother has written \u2014 because I would have no personal\nknowledge \u2014 I \u2014 I think he continued to, if not outwardly practice Judaism, still\nbelieve in the Jewish faith.",
        "Q: Okay. Do you have memories of your mother and father, as a little girl? Personal\nmemories?\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: The \u2014 there s \u2014 they\u2019re so \u2014 I have several images that come to mind. One\nactually is an image of when my mother was taken. And, you know, how perfectly\naccurate this 1s, I don\u2019t know, but \u2014 and I\u2019ve written about this. I was \u2014 this would\nbe 1943. So I was three years old. And the image that I have is my mother and I\nwere home, by ourselves, and there was a knock at the door, and it was two men,\ndressed in black, who came to the door and began to question her. And I was sort of\nhiding behind another door. And then they made her go with them. And so I ran up\nand sat on the windowsill and looked down, and I saw her being put into a \u2014 a black\ncar. It was a very frightening image and experience, because it was the Gestapo\ncoming to take her away.",
        "Q: Were you alone in the house with her?",
        "A: I\u2014I thought I was, I think I was. Whether I truly was or not, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But, I mean, whether I \u2014 whether that\u2019s factual, I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s my\nmemory.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The \u2014 the other image that I have, in our apartment, is always not understanding\nwhy I would see people coming into our building and out of our building, going into\na room, or an apartment next door to our apartment, and then never seeing themSeptember 28, 2016\nagain. Or, they would leave, and then another man, woman, child, family, would\ncome the next day. And in trying to understand why, as a three year old, I would\nconstantly see strangers coming and going, well, it was because she was helping\npeople get out of Berlin. So she was part of the underground.",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: In getting people \u2014 probably both Roma and Jewish people, helping them escape.\nThe image that I have of my father was that he was red \u2014 red hair, or red and \u2014 with\na red beard, possibly, or maybe just red hair. And having a radio playing, and he\nwould be tinkering with electrical things, with the radio, maybe building, taking it\napart. And I later learned that he was an electrician. So playing with radios and\nthings, and that there would be music playing on the radio. So, in my very earliest\nmemories, those were kind of the memories that I have. After a couple of years,\nafter my mother was taken \u2014",
        "Q: Wa \u2014 did she come back?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: Did she come back\u2019?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Ever\u2019?\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: Ne \u2014 well, what I know was that we were all arrested, and we were incarcerated\nin the \u2014 the Jewish hospital.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: But it was for about a month. We were all taken in March or April of 1943.",
        "Q: And you would have been three and a half.",
        "A: Right. And I think we lived there for a couple of weeks, or a month.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of this?",
        "A: I don\u2019t have memories of that, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This is what I\u2019ve learned, but I don\u2019t have memories of that. The memories that I\nhave is that from Berlin, at some point, we moved to a farm, or a fruit orchard,\nabout 60 kilometers east of Berlin.",
        "Q: East of Berlin.",
        "A: East of Berlin, so toward \u2014 towards the Russian zone. And always sort of\nplaying by myself in a field, digging up potatoes. Why \u2014 why potatoes? Maybe\nthat\u2019s all there was in the field. But being by myself.",
        "Q: Nobody around you. No brothers or sisters?",
        "A: They were there, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m just trying to recall memories. And digging up\npotatoes because I was always hungry.September 28, 2016",
        "Q: So you remember being hungry?",
        "A: Yeah. Cold and hungry, and always being alone. And \u2014 and then asking \u2014 always\nsaying to my sister, Gertrude, I\u2019m so alone. Or, why am I always alone? So, I\nknow that there was another family living in hiding with us, or at least on the same\nproperty, and maybe there were children, but I have no recollection of being with\nother children. And maybe we did play together. I mean, here I was three or four\nyears old, or four \u2014 four to five years old, and only thinking of myself as being\nalone.",
        "Q: So, I want to step back a little bit. The conclusion we can come to is that you had\na mother for three and a half years, maybe, of your life. And then she disappears.",
        "A: Gone. Just out \u2014 out \u2014 out of my life. But \u2014 but I still had all my sisters and my\nbrother. And my sister Gertrude, I think sort of filled the place of my mother. So I\nfelt very close to her. And \u2014 and to this day, I mean, she is a very motherly,\nnurturing kind of person. And so, my bond with my siblings is primarily to her, and\nto my brother Alphonse(ph).",
        "Q: I see. The two. The two of them.",
        "A: The \u2014 the two of them. The oth \u2014 the others are a little more peripheral \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.September 28, 2016",
        "A: \u2014 1n\u20141n how they affected me. Because they \u2014 they were ta \u2014 you know, my \u2014\nmy brother was sort of the stand-in for my father, perhaps. Older, and in charge, and\nI would look up to him. My sister was \u2014 my sister Gertrude was more of that \u2014",
        "Q: Maternal person.",
        "A: \u2014 supportive \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 mothering role.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Another image that I have from that time was, we lived on this food orchard, or\n\u2014 or farm, for about a year and a half. That would be 1944, coming back to Berlin \u2014\ncoming back to Berlin at the \u2014 perhaps the beginning or maybe the end of ninet \u2014\n1945.",
        "Q: Beginning of 40 \u2014",
        "A: The begi \u2014 no, no, the beginning of 1945, ahead of the Russians army, who were\ncoming \u2014 marching into Berlin. So we had to leave where we were, to get away\nfrom them coming back into Berlin. And then I have very strong recollections of\nbeing on the street with my father, watching soldiers coming down the street, and\nbeing very frightened.",
        "Q: Okay.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: Because they were menacing looking. Dressed in black, just sort of like the two\nmen that I had seen when my mother was taken. And wearing boots, and being, you\nknow, loud and aggressive. And so there was a lot of fear.",
        "Q: And it was wintertime. If you went back \u2014 it was wintertime \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 in the beginning of \u201945. Did you go back to the same apartment that you had\nleft from, or a different one?",
        "A: We went back to the same building.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know if we went back to the same apartment, because I think, at\nsome point, our apartment was \u2014 the building was bombed out, so we may have\nmoved into the building \u2014 into an apartment next door. But, there were a lot of air\nraids. So either we would go to the bunker at the Alexanderplatz, the un-\nunderground train station, which was probably only a \u2014 a block or two from our\napartment. Or, we would go down into the bunker in the basement of our building,\nthe shelter, and wait out the air raids. So the \u2014 the sounds of bombs falling, and\nnoises, and planes overhead, again were, for a young \u2014 for me, sounds were very\nconfusing and disturbing.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: And maybe one of the reasons that I would ask my sister, why am I so alone, or\nI\u2019m always alone, was because my mother was no longer there. My father was still\nin our life, but not my mother.",
        "Q: That was a question of mine. When you went to orchard \u2014",
        "A: When we what?",
        "Q: When you went to the orchard, did you see your father? Was he around, in the\nsame place?",
        "A: He -\u2014 he and my brother stayed in Berlin during the week, and they would come\nout on the weekends.",
        "Q: Ah, I see.",
        "A: Because he\u2019d have found work, and so they were able to \u2014 to work. He was an\nelectrician. My brother, I think, helped him with electrical work in the city, but then\nthey would drive out with the man who owned the food orchard, on the weekends.\nSo we did have time together. But I don\u2019t \u2014 th-those kind of memories are too vague\nfor me \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 to really be able to recollect.",
        "Q: Okay. And do you know why you ended up in that food orchard, why you were\nthere?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: We\u2019re in hiding, because we were Jews, and we knew \u2014 I-I knew. I felt that \u2014\nthat the world was against us, that there were people that didn\u2019t want us around.\nAnd in order to be safe, we had to go \u2014 you know, get out of Berlin, and we had to\nlive in hiding, to not \u2014 to try not to be Jewish, not to be identified as Jews.\nOtherwise, we would not have survived. So the \u2014 the impression left on me was, at\na very young age, to be deceptive. To not admit what I was and who I was. That\nextended from that time, until we had to declare ourselves as orphans, to be able to\nget from Germany to America. Because had we a \u2014 had we said that we had a\nfather living at \u2014 we would not have been able to get on the first ship out, to come to\nthe United States. So having to lie, so the I \u2014 and then once I was here, not wanting\nto admit at \u2014 or what \u2014 wanting to assimilate, because now the wa \u2014 then the war\nwas over, and every \u2014 all the c \u2014 all my classmates, and people that I knew here,\nwould make fun of my German accent, the fact that I couldn\u2019t speak English. The\nfact that I was German, and everybody in the United States was against Germany,\nbecause of what Germany had done in the war. So, denying what my actual\nheritage was.",
        "Q: So 1n one sense \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: So the idea of deception and lying was almost \u2014 almost second nature.",
        "Q: It was also reinforced, over and over.",
        "A: I beg your pardon\u2019?",
        "Q: It was reinforced over and over. First, because you\u2019re Jewish, and second\nbecause you\u2019re German.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you have as \u2014",
        "A: And to be a German Jew was the worst, because you\u2019re ji \u2014 yeah, number one,\nyou\u2019re German, so \u2014 and \u2014 and part of the German culture is to be very proud that\nyou\u2019re German. But to be Jewish, you know, you\u2019re \u2014 no \u2014 no matter what \u2014 what I\nwas, we were \u2014",
        "Q: You were wrong.",
        "A: \u2014 not accepted.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Do you have any sense of your mother\u2019s influence in your life,\nbefore she disappeared? Should I say that louder?",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Well, I shouldn\u2019t \u2014 the \u2014 the influence that I recall \u2014 I mean, she was a \u2014 a kind\nperson, but I think I was probably more influenced by Gertrude, and maybe by mySeptember 28, 2016\nsister Ruth, who would take me on excursions with her. So \u2014 and they were closer\nto my age, so I don\u2019t know that I felt influenced by my mother.",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s int \u2014 you know, it\u2019s interesting and it\u2019s also very heartbreaking,\nbecause both of your older sisters were children themselves, you know.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Even Ruth, the oldest \u2014",
        "A: She was \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 was no more than \u2014",
        "A: She was 15 or 16.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. I mean it\u2019s \u2014 at the end of the war, but in the beginning, she\u2019s a \u2014 in\nher early teens. She\u2019s like 12, 13, or something like that.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What about your father? Did you feel his presence? Did he have an influence on\nyour life? Early life.",
        "A: An influence in the sense that yes, as a \u2014 I mentioned earlier, being on the street\nwith him, and I have this image of standing sort of between his legs, with my arms\nwrapped around his legs, and \u2014 and looking kind of furtively down the street,\nwatching these people. And whether there were trucks and tanks, or just soldiers\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016\nmarching, I don\u2019t know. But being in his embrace, so being protected by him, very\nmuch so.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But at that point, you know, my mother was gone for a year and a half, so \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, this is the end of the war, when Germany capitulates.",

        "Q: Do you remember leaving Berlin?",
        "A: I rem \u2014 I remember being very confused, sort of like we were always going\nsomewhere. We were going from Berlin out to the food orchard. We were going\nfrom our apartment to the bunker in the Alexanderplatz. We were from our\napartment, down below, into the shelter in our building, where I think we actually\nlived for a few days, or a week or so, because we had no apartment to go back to.\nAnd then, going from Berlin, on the train, from one place to another. And when I\nsay from one place to another, we were going from DP camp to DP camp. So this \u2014\nthis sense of not belonging, of not s \u2014 sort of being homeless, because we were\nconstantly in flux, and traveling, was both very, very confusing, and yet, I was still\nwith my sisters and brother. So that was reassuring. But sort of not understanding\nwhy. If things were explained to me, I don\u2019t remember the \u2014 any explanations. But ISeptember 28, 2016\nthink I always had the sense of why, or what\u2019s going on. Not knowing, and being\nconfused. And some of those feeling of insec \u2014 and they were feelings of insecurity,\nmay have played into \u2014 into why when I came to the States, and came to the Jewish\nChildren\u2019s Bureau in Chicago, who was our s-sponsor, and then having to go from\none foster home to another foster home, and then finally, eventually, landing with a\nfamily who were a stable family, who wanted to adopt me. I embraced that.",
        "Q: You needed the stability.",
        "A: I needed the stability and I \u2014 I needed to know that there were people who were\ngoing to take care of me from then on. And \u2014 and you know, provide warmth and\nlove, and discipline, which I didn\u2019t want.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But before talking about that, there\u2019s another image that comes to mind, in\nBerlin. And that is \u2014 I was too young to go to school, although I may have been in\nnursery school for a short time. But this image of being on the street, standing in\nline, and either getting a cup, or \u2014 either tin cups, or tin ladles of soup. And maybe it\nwasn\u2019t really outside, maybe we were in \u2014 in the school building, and that\u2019s how we\ngot some lunch, or something. I \u2014 I don\u2019t remember exactly.

        "A: Yeah. And \u2014 and you asked about being on the ship. I \u2014 I do \u2014 I have memories,\nactually of \u2014 of going to the galley, to the kitchen.

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That both parents had died, and this was the way we were going to be able to get\nout of Germany. Because in Germany, you know, there were shortages of\neverything.

But then as \u2014 going up to him,\nlicking my finger, and running my finger down his cheek, thinking it was chocolate.\nAnd he picked me up, and \u2014 and he laughed, and then we became friendly, and I\nwasn\u2019t afraid of him any more.

Anyway, after getting the shoes, at some point we\nwere put on a train, and we wound up in Chicago. And getting off the train, and\ngoing to a building downtown, which was the Jewish Children\u2019s Bureau, of the\nJewish Federation. I was plopped up on a table, or a desk, or something. And again,\nwe were lined up, given ice cream, and a doll. So \u2014 and posing for more pictures.\nAnd then, getting into a taxicab, and one by one, we were each dropped off at a\nfoster home.",
        "Q: A different foster home.",
        "A: Different foster home, and it was the first time, after all these years of being\ntogether \u2014 my brother would walk each of us up to a foster home, I think either \u2014\neither my brother, or my brother and the social worker who was with us. And I \u2014\nagain, I didn\u2019t understand why, but told that we were going to be with these people,\nwho would take care of you. Well, the first foster home I was in, I liked the man,\nbut I didn\u2019t like the woman. And my sister Ruth came to see me, and I told her that\nshe beat me, that the woman took away my doll, and whatever toys there were, andSeptember 28, 2016\nshe would beat me in the bathtub. And so my sister immediately contacted the\ncaseworker, got me out of there. At which point I went to live with my sister Ren\u00e9,\nwho was in a foster home wi \u2014 and her foster parents were Ruth and Ben\nCarleton(ph). And they were very nice people. And then, at some \u2014 I don\u2019t think I\nlived with her that long, but we did go to the same school. We went to Shakespeare\nElementary School for a very short time, maybe just a couple of weeks that I was\nthere. And then there were two people \u2014 some \u2014 somehow, and this gets confusing, I\nwas back at the Jewish Children\u2019s Bureau, or somewhere, where these two people\ncame and talked to me. And I was in \u2014 perhaps the caseworker asked if I would like\nto go and be with them, and spend the night, or see how things worked out. And I\nliked those people, and they became my adoptive parents.",
        "Q: What were their names?",
        "A: Rosalind and Joshua Spiegel. They were not interested in being foster parents.\nThey wanted to be adoptive parents. My father, Joshua Spiegel, was a\nneurosurgeon. He had operated on Mary Lawrence, who was the director of the\nJewish Children\u2019s Bureau. And at some point he had said to her, we are interested\nin adopting a child. And so, when we came through the JCB, she thought perhaps I\nwould be a good candidate. I was still young. I was only, you know, six and a half\nat the time. I\u2019d \u2014 so I lived with them for a while, and when they asked me if I\nSeptember 28, 2016\nwanted to be adopted, I didn\u2019t know \u2014 I didn\u2019t know any better, I said, oh yeah,\nthese are nice people, okay. I would like that.",

        "Q: Did they know you had a living father?",
        "A: I told them no, but of course they knew. Every \u2014 all of this \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 fora\nlong time, I lived thinking that nobody knew that our father was living. But the JCB\nknew, everybody knew.",
        "Q: How do you know they knew\u201d?",
        "A: In papers that I\u2019ve seen since then. So they were complicit in a good way. They\n\u2014 they wanted us to have good lives.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But \u2014 and at that time \u2014 this was, you know, 1946, the rules for adoption, and the\nbest thinking of social workers and psychologists, was that no contact was to be\nmaintained with families of origin, because it would be too difficult \u2014",
        "Q: Can we cut? [break] So you were talking about the kind of thinking that was\ngoing on at the time. Tha \u2014 about \u2014",
        "A: Thinking about adoption and foster care, and the thinking at that time was,\nnumber one, documents were not public. Everything that was done was hidden\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016\naway. So, it \u2014 which kind of played into my earlier mentioning of deception, and\nsort of \u2014 and rather than overt deception, it\u2019s hiding, keeping things private.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Not talking about things, and sort of keeping things hidden away from view. So\nonce I moved in with the Spiegels, I actually saw my sisters and brother \u2014 probably\nmore my sisters, several of them, quite a bit. But my mother, of course \u2014 not of\ncourse, my mother, Rosalind Spiegel was in consultation both with the social\nworkers at the Jewish Children\u2019s Bureau, and with a psychiatrist who recommended\nthat contact with my siblings be discontinued, because I was too confused. When\nmy sister would come over, there was always talk about don\u2019t forget Mama, don\u2019t\nforget Papa. We\u2019re all together, don\u2019t forget them. So, of course, I would want to be\nwith them. Then, when I was with these foster people, soon to become my adoptive\nparents, it was difficult to relate to them. And I think I would lash out at them, or\nact out, especially towards my mother, my foster mother Rosalind. And she was\nthen advised to stop contact. Now, when I say contact, maybe they came what, two\nor three times, and then it was decided that \u2014 I mean, I was too young to really make\na choice, but it was decided that it would be in my best interest to identify with this\nnew family, so that they could become my family, so that I would be given the\nopportunity, you know, to have a stable home life, and not be torn between mySeptember 28, 2016\nloyalty to my German siblings, and my loyalty to my new American family. I did\nnot have access to my papers, my German papers until I was an adult. So this would\nbe 1958, 1960. And even then, when I called the Jewish Children\u2019s Bureau to say, I\nwant to see my case file, they gave me a very hard time. This is not public. I said,\nI\u2019m not public, this is my case file. And I had to sort of argue with them, before\nthey finally released the files.",
        "Q: And what did you learn in those files?",
        "A: What did I learn? I learned that my father had remarried, my German father had\nremarried. I learned that the Jewish Children\u2019s Bureau knew that my father was\nliving. I\u2014I don\u2019t think I learned too much more than that, but I knew \u2014 I learned\nthat the JCB knew that I didn\u2019t have to be hiding the fact that I had a father living\nin Germany all these years. I didn\u2019t have to continue the deception.",
        "Q: Oh, that must have been a burden.",
        "A: It was a\u2014",
        "Q: That must have burden \u2014",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was a terrible burden. It was a burden because \u2014 and \u2014 and the burden\ncontinued for many years, because I felt this tremendous loyalty towards my\nAmerican parents. But I also had this desire to know about my German family. I\nknew that they all lived in Chicago. What I didn\u2019t know, was not only did they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016\nknow where I lived, they knew what I was doing, where I went to school. They\nwould some \u2014 they would sort of keep tabs on me. They \u2014 1-1-in a \u2014 in a good way,\nthey wanted to make sure everything was okay. I remember I went to the University\nof Chicago Laboratory Schools. I remember \u2014 and tha \u2014 I was now in high school. I\nremember going down the street with my classmates, we were going from one\nbuilding a couple of blocks away, to another building, turning around and seeing\nsome young women kind of following \u2014 following us. And I had no idea why. Well,\nit was two of my sisters. We all lived on the south side of Chicago, not too far away\nfrom each other. They were \u2014 they saw me on the street, and were following me. I\nmean, there was nothing bad about that \u2014",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: \u2014 except that I was with this new family. I hadn\u2019t seen them now in seven or\neight years, and I didn\u2019t \u2014 and I wasn\u2019t sure, I wasn\u2019t positive of who they were.",
        "Q: Were you ever told by your adoptive parents that you could not have contact\nwith your siblings?",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was implied. You have a new family. You have \u2014 you have to learn a\n\u2014 you have to learn a new language. You are now an American, you\u2019re not a \u2014\nyou\u2019re not German. You know, it was very exciting time for me to be \u2014 to get \u2014 I\nwas a naturalized citizen. In 1951, I became a US. citizen, that\u2019s a big time. But the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016\nimplication was pretty clear. Oh, at \u2014 that 1t would be better for me to make my \u2014 to\nsort of make my allegiance to this family.",
        "Q: So in other words, they \u2014 they put it gi \u2014 you know, and the way you are\nexplaining it is, with the best of intentions, but the way they put it, it\u2019s either us or\nthem, and it should be us.",
        "A: It\u2014 yes. Now, it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t given the option, you can go back\nto them, and then it won\u2019t be us. It wasn\u2019t that. It was, you\u2019re here, you\u2019re our\ndaughter, we love you, we\u2019ll take care of you. This is the way it should be. And,\nbecause of the acting out that I had been doing \u2014 I\u2019m not exactly sure what acting\nout I was doing, except I was probably \u2014",
        "Q: You were \u2014 you were being a kid.",
        "A: \u2014 disobeying, or disrespectful, particularly to my mother. I adored my father. I\nadored him, because he, of course, was a pushover. Gave me everything. Would\ntake me to the park, we\u2019d go kite flying. He would take me to Michael Weiss\nHospital on Sunday mornings, where he made rounds of his patients, while I was in\nthe telephone operators\u2019 room with all the operators, and so you know, I was like\nthis little darling. And \u2014 and they would \u2014 they would play with me at \u2014 etcetera.\nBut because of all this confusion, my mother took me to a psychiatrist. So I was in\nSeptember 28, 2016\ntherapy, and I hated that therapy. And the psychiatrist, her name was Emmy\nSylvester(ph), who I believe had emigrated from Germany as well.",
        "Q: She might have had a few issues, you know\u2019?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: She might have had a few issues.",
        "A: She might have had a few issues. She would, of course, try to get me to talk\nabout my feelings, etcetera, etcetera, and I just wanted to play with whatever it was\nI was \u2014 either \u2014 I wasn\u2019t much of \u2014 into playing with dolls, but building things and\nother \u2014 other kinds of toys. And so I really never wanted to talk to her, but was\nforced to do so. The other thing that my adoptive parents gave me, that was sort of a\nlifesaver with me, was dance lessons. And \u2014 which I would never have had the\nopportunity to do. I came from a very poor family, into now a very well-to-do\nfamily. And I was given every advantage. I went to \u2014 I started out at a public\ngrammar school, but then, after a few years, went to a private high school. And one\nof the very best universities, not only in this \u2014 in \u2014 in the country. Recognized\naround the \u2014 around the world. There was never a question of whether there would\nbe enough food. I was, however, very malnourished. I think we all were, with rotten\nteeth, and you know, no \u2014 no healthcare to speak of. And my parents, the Spiegels,\nwould ply me with food. Well, I would sit at the table, and I was a tiny little girl.September 28, 2016\nNot so tiny any more, but then I was tiny. Filled my mouth with food, and excused\nmyself to go to the bathroom. And finally \u2014 and then I\u2019d come back and I\u2019d eat\nmore food, excuse myself again. I was flushing it down the toilet.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: Cu \u2014 and they \u2014 it was discovered because either my mother or father went into\nthe bathroom after I came back at \u2014 at some point, and saw that I was flushing food\ndown the toilet. A natural question would be, why didn\u2019t you just stop eating? Well,\nit was pretty early ingrained upon me that I should be grateful for whatever I was\ngiven. I think I learned that in the first foster home, that I was \u2014 that I was in. Be\nthankful and be grateful. Be quiet, and don\u2019t cause trouble. So I was sort of this\nlittle Goody Two-shoes, who acted out secretly, and in a secretive way. I never\nremember once \u2014 when a child is angry, what does a child do?",

        "Q: You\u2019re mad at them.",
        "A: Not I. I could never be mad at my parents. So I did it in a \u2014 in an underhanded\nway, more subterfuge. Because I couldn\u2019t say, I don\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing, orSeptember 28, 2016\nI\u2019m angry at you. I could never be that open, because I had to be grateful, because\nthey took me in, and they adopted me, and they gave me this wonderful life. So\nthere was always this confusion of, can I be who I am? Can I be myself?",
        "Q: Did you come to an answer?",

        "Q: Did you ever come to an answer as to whether you were allowed to be yourself?",
        "A: Not for many years. Not for many years. It was \u2014 it was very hard. So \u2014 and a \u2014\nand when I say many years, I mean after I had children of my own. After I was\nmarried and had children. I remember in my new family, we adopted \u2014 my parents\nadopted two more children. So I had a brother, Jonathan, who was nine and a half\nyears younger than I. And then \u2014 and he was from the U.S., but he had been\nabandoned. And then my sister Petra, who was 12 years younger than I, who had\nbeen \u2014 she was Italian, and lived in an Italian orphanage, because her parents could\nnot take care of her. And I\u2019ve lost my train of thought.",
        "Q: You had \u2014 you were saying that \u2014",
        "A: Oh, I\u2014 I just remembered. My brother Jonathan once said \u2014 he was probably\nfive or six, or maybe a little bit older. I wa \u2014 I was in the room, and \u2014 and he said to\nSeptember 28, 2016\nmy mother, I hate you. Now, at that \u2014 if he was five or six, I was about 15. And I\nsaid to my mother, how could you let him say that? How could you possibly let him\nsay that to you? And she looked at me, and she said, he\u2019s angry. Of course he hates\nme at the moment, because I didn\u2019t give him candy, or whatever it was. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s\nperfectly natural. And I didn\u2019t think that was right. He was adopted, he should be\ngrateful. Because that\u2019s what I had been told.",
        "Q: What a burden. What a burden, you know?",
        "A: It was. It is what \u2014 and it is what kept me, because of these dual loyalties, it is\nwhat kept me from reconnecting with my s-sisters and brother. There was one time,\nwhen I was still in high school, probably a junior or a senior. My parents \u2014 we, as a\nfamily went out for dinners, usually on Thursday night or something. I went to this\nfavorite Chinese restaurant. And we left the restaurant to walk home, and I saw four\npeople, you know, just walking down the street. And I remember looking at this\nman, just staring at him as we walked past each other, and he was staring at me. It\nwas my father from Germany, and his new family. I didn\u2019t know it, quite, at the\ntime, except that I kept staring at him, wondering who he was, and why I felt this\nconnection to him. But he had given up his rights to me, that in order for me to be\nadopted, the Jewish Children\u2019s Bureau, I think it was the bureau, had placed \u2014\nplaced an ad in the paper at the time, in 1946 or \u201947, saying that unless you claim\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016\nrights to this child, she will be placed for adoption. So he gave up his rights to me,\nwhich meant no contact. You cannot have contact with her. That was the law in\n1946. You know, that was just the \u2014",
        "Q: Did you ever see him again?",
        "A: I never saw him again, no. In \u2014 in 19 \u2014 he came here in 1956 \u2014 1956. So about\nthat time \u2014 about that time, and I did not know that he was here, but about that time,\nI was studying dance downtown, and after class I came downstairs. This was\ndowntown, came downstairs to go and take the train to go home, and there was this\nyoung woman on the street who came up to me, and I sort of looked at her, and I\nsaid, I\u2019m not allowed to talk to you. It was my sister Ruth. I couldn\u2019t remember her\nname.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: She had gone up to my dance studio, talked with the dance director, told her who\nshe was. The dance director immediately, you know, had her go into another room,\ncalled my father and said, there\u2019s a young woman here who says she\u2019s Ginger\u2019s\nsister. Who is she? My parents had never told the dance director my background.\nHe then apparently contacted the Jewish Children\u2019s Bureau, who contacted my\nsister and said, if you ever go near Ginger \u2014 Bela again, you'll be sent back. ThereSeptember 28, 2016\nwas this fear, sort of hanging over all of us, that if you don\u2019t behave, you\u2019re going\nto be sent back.",
        "Q: Oh, how sad.",
        "A: So there were these conflicting feelings. I believe when I was about 18 or 19, my\nmother said to me, if you ever want to know about your family, just ask me, or let\nme know, or if you want to contact them, I will arrange it. And at that time I said, I\nhave my new family. It\u2019s okay. I can\u2019t have loyalties to both. When I was engaged\nto be married, I was 20, I was contacted \u2014 I got a letter, I\u2014 I guess, about German\nreparations. And so I met with someone and signed the papers, and turned over\nwhat money I got. And this was for the death of my mother. So the German\ngovernment made reparations. I got a check for 39 dollars. And I immediately\nsigned it over to the Jewish Children\u2019s Bureau. You know, I \u2014 I\u2014 I wanted no part\nof it. But basically, that was the only contact that I had with my family, my \u2014 my\nGerman family. A month or two before I got married \u2014 at that time, 1960, you had\nto get [indecipherable] health certificate. So I went to my pediatrician, to si\u2014 e-\neveryone did. Before you could get a marriage license, you had to be \u2014 make sure\nthat you were \u2014 did not have venereal disease, or other health issues. And so I went\nto my pediatrician, got whatever document I \u2014 I needed, and two women came up to\nme and said, are you Ginger? I said yes. Well, can we talk to you for a minute? We\nSeptember 28, 2016\nwent into \u2014 down the hall, and it was my sister Ren\u00e9, and my sist \u2014 I \u2014 I think \u2014 and\nI don\u2019t know why, but I\u2019m saying Gertrude, but it might not have been. Anyway,\nwe went down the hall, and they said, we saw in the newspaper that you\u2019re getting\nmarried, and we just wanted to wish you all the best.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And I immediate recognized Ren\u00e9, because she had red hair. And I said \u2014 but, I\nwas kind of embarrassed, because I had not contacted them, or made any effort to\ncontact them, to tell them I was getting married. And you know, I was 19 or 20\nyears old at the time. I was not a child any longer. But they did say, we just wanted\n\u2014 we \u2014 we hope \u2014 we hope you\u2019re okay, and that you\u2019re happy, etcetera, etcetera.\nAnd they were married, they had children of their own. And a few years later, I got\na phone call from one of my sisters, Judy, who said, I\u2019m moving to Lawrence,\nKansas, and I\u2019d \u2014 before \u2014 and I don\u2019t know that I'll ever be back. I\u2019d like to see\nyou. So I said, sure. So she came. I, at this point, had a child. She came to my\napartment, and I opened \u2014 I never forget this, I opened the door, and for the first\ntime in my memory, I looked at someone who looked just like me. Which was very\ninteresting, in that \u2014 you know, I looked at my child, or my children, they didn\u2019t\nlook like me. I didn\u2019t look like my adoptive mother. I didn\u2019t look like my sister or\nbrother. So here was somebody from my past, who looked like me. So \u2014\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "Q: What a price.",
        "A: \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and still \u2014 and still I maintained \u2014 and I \u2014 I\u2014 I remember talking\nwith my husband, should I reconnect with my family? And he advised against it. He\nsaid, you\u2019re gonna sort of open up a can of worms. You\u2019ve got this family. And I\nhave relatives in Canada, I mean, the f \u2014 you know, and new cousins here. So it\nwas \u2014 it was hard. I didn\u2019t realize how difficult it was on my sisters, and brother.",
        "Q: They were kind of hovering, like \u2014 they were hovering like \u2014 like guardian\nangels.",
        "A: They were \u2014 they were hovering angels, and yet they couldn\u2019t acknowledge\nthemselves. Two of them once came into the a-apartment building where I lived\nwith my parents, and they almost rang the doorbell, and then they ran away instead.\nSo it was \u2014 yeah, they \u2014 they sort of kept \u2014 kept an eye on me, in \u2014 in \u2014",
        "Q: Which is a lovely, wonderful thing.",
        "A: Fabulous. Fabulous. Many years later \u2014 oh, oh, and every once in\n[indecipherable] about every five years, once I was an adult, I had contact with\nthem, through the \u2014 I-I\u2019d get a letter, or a card, or something. It turns out that my\nsister Ren\u00e9 went to the same high school that my husband went to. They both went\nto Hyde Park, on the south side. I don\u2019t know that they knew \u2014 I don\u2019t think they\nknew each other, but they \u2014 you know, there was always something. I received\nSeptember 28, 2016\nsome letters, some were nice, some were not so nice. But I \u2014 because I did question,\nshould I contact them, what should I \u2014 and \u2014 and it was sort of, you\u2019ve just got too\nmuch going on in your life. You\u2019ve got your own family, you\u2019ve got your children,\nyou\u2019ve got your adopted brother and sister, you\u2019ve got your parents. How many\nthings, you know, can you handle? I became disabled in 1984, and shortly\nthereafter, I don\u2019t know what possessed me, but shortly thereafter, I called and\nmade a lunch date with Mary Lawrence, the director of the Jewish Children\u2019s\nBureau. We had lunch downtown. And she too had sort of kept tabs on me, because\nshe orchestrated the adoptions of my brother and sister, as well as me. And she said,\nwell, tell me what\u2019s going on in your life, and how\u2019s your German family? And I\nsaid, well, I don\u2019t have contact with them. Well, why not? Or, when are you going\nto call them? And I said, well \u2014 anyway, a-and so I\u2014 we got on to other subjects.\nSo, after thinking about that for maybe six months, I picked up the phone. I\u2019ve had\n\u2014I\u2019d had a New Year\u2019s card from my sister Gertrude, that I\u2019d had for 10 years or\nso. I saw a phone number on the back of the envelope, and I said, okay, and I made\na phone call. I had \u2014 so I had a phone number, which meant that I had made a phone\ncall 10 years before, probably, and there was no answer. So this time would be\nabout a year or two after my accident. I saw that card, picked up the phone and\nmade a phone call. And it \u2014 at about lunchtime \u2014 I remember this very clearly, and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016\nsomebody answered the phone and said hello, and I said, Manya? And she said \u2014\nshe just [sharp inhale] and the first words out of her mouth were, why now? And I\nsaid \u2014 this is my sister Gertrude \u2014 and I said to her, well, I tried to call you 10 years\nago, but there was no answer. And she said, do you mean if I hadn\u2019t picked up the\nphone now, it would be another 10 years? And I said, yeah. So, I \u2014 I mean, she \u2014\nyou know, sh-she was in such shock. Immediately called my brother, who called\nme, and he drove to Chicago I think two days later. I had not seen him now, since\n1946.",
        "Q: So this is like 40 years.",
        "A: Forty years.",
        "Q: Oh my gosh.",
        "A: He and I created a bond that was really quite deep, and \u2014 and profound. And\nunfortunately, he just passed away, two weeks ago. So, sort of what the whole\nfamily saga turns into was that, they would say that after wandering in the desert for\n40 years, I came back. And I \u2014 we had a family reunion, after \u2014 a 40\" reunion, and\nthen 10 years later at my home, we had a 50\" anniversary party of coming to\nAmerica, so that would be 1996.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And so, you know, we\u2019ve maintained a \u2014 a very good \u2014\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "Q: Are they part of your life now?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Are they part of your life now?",
        "A: Yes. Again, the two most important people, Gertrude and Alphonse(ph), have\nbeen more a part of my life than the \u2014 than the others. Just because it \u2014 there\u2019s just a\ncloser bond. You know, you \u2014 you\u2019re not going to be equal with every \u2014 every\nmember of your family. But al \u2014 al \u2014 I would travel to D.C. to see him, he would\ncome here. He would have meetings, and \u2014",
        "Q: Did you ev \u2014 were your adoptive parents still alive when you reconnected?",
        "A: Yes, yes, they were. And one time, he was in town, and there was a party at my\naunt and uncle\u2019s house \u2014 my American aunt and uncle\u2019s. And we \u2014 and I-I-I said,\ncan I\u2014 can Alphonse(ph) come with me? Of course. So he met my parents, and he\nasked my father, Joshua Spiegel if he could talk with him privately. They went\ndown to the basement and afterwards, I asked my father, I said, what did\nAlphonse(ph) say to you? And he said, he thanked me ... he thanked \u2014 he thanked\nme for giving you a life, for providing you with a home and opportunities, and\nestablishing a family. And, I mean, here was my brother, who had his own family,\nwho was such a mensch as to go up to my father and thank him for being my father.",
        "Q: Wow.September 28, 2016",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: That perhaps give you a tiny insight into the kind of man that my brother was. A\nman who was a fisit \u2014 brilliant physicist, had a deep sense of history, who was very\nGerman, had a \u2014 loved music and literature. Had almost gone to the University of\nChicago, because he was offered a scholarship, but because of his interest in\nscience and math, decided to go to the Illinois Institute of Technology, and become\na physicist. He and I would have long talks, and he was so sorry 1n his later years\nthat he didn\u2019t take up the offer of going to University of Chicago, you know, and\nlearning many \u2014 much more of the humanities. But he is a man who married outside\nhis Jewish faith, fell in love, raised a family, did not really practice his Judaism for\nmany years. The children were raised Catholic. But I believe he felt a disconnect\nwith his wife and chi \u2014 and children because of \u2014 not only the religious differences,\nbut the cultural differences of all of us. I mean, I\u2019m very Americanized. Gertrude\nis pretty much Americanized. Alphonse(ph) never was. He was 18 when he came\nhere, so rema \u2014 remained very German.",
        "Q: European. Very mu \u2014 very European.",
        "A: Very European.",
        "Q: Yeah.September 28, 2016",
        "A: Very European. And \u2014 and yet, you know, tremendous loyalty and love for his \u2014\nhis family. He lived in Gaithersburg, Maryland. He got his, you know, degree\nhere in Chicago, moved to Toronto for his post-doctoral work, then his fam \u2014\nmoved with his family to New York for a number of years, and then to D.C. to\nwork for the government. The National Institute of \u2014 of \u2014 National Bureau of\nStandards, now called NIST. For many years did a lot of research into physics and\nRaman spectroscopy in particular. But, in a different way, had many of the same\nconflicts that I had.",
        "Q: Really? Really?",
        "A: If I\u2019m thinking about it now, my conflicts were not over religion, but over two\ndifferent worlds; a German world, and an American world; German family, and an\nAmerican family. His conflicts were more over a German heritage.",
        "Q: Jewish German heritage, or German heritage?",
        "A: You know, there is \u2014 I mean, German Jews considered themselves German. So 1-\nit\u2019s not \u2014 there \u2014 there\u2019s a combination of a German heritage, and a German Jewish\nheritage. It\u2019s a little hard to explain, unless you\u2019re there. So, I mean, he \u2014 you know,\nhis eldest son, he named Karl, k-a-r-l, who, in his adulthood became, and is, a\nLutheran minister. The family ma \u2014 moved away from Catholicism, and became\nEpiscopalian, but then Karl became a Lutheran minister. So the \u2014 there \u2014 these \u2014September 28, 2016\nthese conflicts of \u2014 of dual loyalty \u2014 I mean, Alphonse(ph) was fluent in German,\nknew a lot of German songs. Steeped himself in the \u2014 the \u2014 the poetry of \u2014 of\nGoethe and Rilke and \u2014 and \u2014 and Schubert, and you know, just \u2014 and \u2014 and felt\nthat there was nothing better than a German education, because it was the Germans\nwho really implemented higher education. Very proud of that. And yet \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 was denied a good part of his own education because he was Jewish. So these\n\u2014 these conflict \u2014 and the conflict in his own marriage, and sadly, we would talk \u2014 I\nmean, he did not practice any religion of any kind for many years. And about 10\nyears ago \u2014 and I would talk to him about that. I mean, I \u2014 I don\u2019t consider myself a\nreligious Jew, but more of a cultural Jew, but I would \u2014 I \u2014 certainly I went to \u2014 to \u2014\nto religious school, and became confirmed, and \u2014 cause girls were not Bat Mitzvah\nwhen I was growing up. My children have been raised in a \u2014 in a Jewish home. But\nit wasn\u2019t until 10 years ago that Alphonse(ph) returned to his Jewish roots and\nbegan to go to synagogue. And not only began to go to synagogue, but really\nimmersed himself and steeped himself in Jewish tradition. And we\u2019ve recently had\nsome bad family feelings because he \u2014",
        "Q: Can we cut for a second? [break] When I hear you speak about Alphonse(ph),\nand about Gertrude, and reconnecting to your family of origin \u2014\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: \u2014 did you ever feel anger at your adoptive parents, for the fact that they cut them\noff?",
        "A: You know, that\u2019s a \u2014 that\u2019s an interesting question. I \u2014 actually, there was a time\nwhen I felt anger towards my birth father, because he gave up his rights to me. And\nI said to myself, how could he do this? He disowned me. And then I would have to\ntalk to myself, and say, he did this for my benefit. Number one, he did not think he\nwas ever going to get to the United States.",
        "Q: Is that the case?",
        "A: That is the case. I\u2014 I \u2014 I believe that is the case. Now, he signed those rights\naway in 1946, so that I could be adopted, or maybe it was \u201947. At which point, I\u2019m\nnot sure exactly when, but he remarried. He had a stepdaughter, and together he and\nhis wife had a son. That\u2019s my half-brother Harry.",
        "Q: Have you met him\u2019?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes. Harry. And my stepsister is Gitta(ph). Brigitta(ph), so Gitta(ph). A-And\nshe and I are about six months apart in age, yes. And \u2014 and they\u2019re \u2014 you know,\nthey\u2019re lovely people. So I have met them a \u2014 a number of times. When I had, at my\nSeptember 28, 2016\nhome, the 50\" anniversary party, of course they were included. Harry and his wife,\nand Gitta(ph) and her husband. And I\u2019ve met th \u2014 Gitta(ph) and \u2014 and her\nhusband\u2019s children.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So I\u2014I \u2014 initially I felt anger towards my father, Alexander, but then I would\nsay, I know he did this because he wanted you to ha \u2014 you, Ginger, to have a life.",
        "Q: Now, do you \u2014 did your siblings \u2014 did you ever talk about this with your\nsiblings, and did they ever fill in any information?",
        "A: They had a lot of anger towards my adoptive parents, absolutely. I will try to\nexplain \u2014 in fact, Is \u2014I think I still have letters that we exchanged, where I was\nexplaining to them why my parents did what they did. They didn\u2019t do it because ab\n\u2014 out of dislike of them, they did it because they felt this would be in my best\ninterests, and they were advised to do it by professionals. So they thought that this\nwould be in my best interests. But there was a lot of anger, yes, and \u2014 and perhaps\nsome resentment. It \u2014 but I\u2014 I think we\u2019re beyond that.",
        "Q: Yeah, that was going to be my next question.",
        "A: And past that.",
        "Q: Has it been put to rest?September 28, 2016",
        "A: Yes, oh yes, definitely been put to rest, and \u2014 and when \u2014 you know, so e-\neverything is fine. I \u2014 I think maybe sometimes I felt some ambivalence toward my\nadoptive parents. Not anger.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I\u2014 I\u2019m not a person who f \u2014 at \u2014 who feels a lot of anger, or admits to a lot\nof anger. It\u2019s a little \u2014 1t \u2014 it goes a little more underground with me. But \u2014 and I\nnever \u2014 I never felt unhappy or \u2014 or questioned why they did what they did, as I\u2014I\ndidn\u2019t think that there were ulterior motives. I knew that what they did was out of\nconcern for me. I did discuss, after my sister Judy had come to see me, before she\nmoved to Lawrence, and told me the stories of sitting around the table with the\nfamily, that, number one, my father and his new family had come to the States,\nwhich I had not known, and that they \u2014 when they would occasionally get together,\nthey would say how nice it was, how wonderful it was that all the family were\ntogether, except for Mama and Bela. Well, that did a guilt trip on me that was pretty\nprofound. I do remember talking to my father, and kind of feeling him out, and\nasking him if he thought I should contact my German father. And he said \u2014 because\nI wanted to find \u2014 I\u2014 when I say I was feeling him out, I wanted to know, or get a\nfeeling of whether he would feel that I didn\u2019t care for him, or if it would hurt him if\nI contacted my German father. And he said to me \u2014 he\u2019s a very wise man \u2014 he said,\nSeptember 28, 2016\nprobably \u2014 no, he said, if you contact him, you should do it with the knowledge that\nyou will continue a relationship with him. Don\u2019t do it out of curiosity and then\nnever see him again. That would be cruel.",
        "Q: That\u2019s very kind.",
        "A: It would not be right \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 for you to do that. If you make a \u2014 a connection with him, you need to follow\nthrough on that connection with your father, and with your siblings, he said, My\nadvice to you would be to not do it, because you\u2019ll be opening up a can of worms.\nYou have your own family, you have your husband, you have one or two chi -\u2014 I\ndon\u2019t remember how many children IJ had at that point. You know, you have this\nwhole western, Americanized family. It\u2019s a lot for you to take on. I read into that,\nthat he would be hurt, so I never did, until after I became disabled and decided I\nneeded to look at my life.",

        "Q: That\u2019s right.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: A lot of internal feelings that \u2014 that aren\u2019t expressed. Once he met my bro \u2014 not\nonce, but when he met my brother, I think he was overwhelmed by my brother\u2019s\ngenerosity, and by their connecting with each other. Now, my \u2014 my German fatherSeptember 28, 2016\ndied in 1970 \u2014 1969 or 1970. I did have a lot of guilt feelings about n-never seeing\nhim again.

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014I\u2014I had some guilt feelings. But I think I dealt with them, or overcame some\nof them by reconnecting, in particular with Alphonse(ph), and having, you know,\nthe \u2014 this warm, loving relationship with him in \u2014 highly intelligent, highly sensitive\nman who \u2014 who had a lot of warmth and a lot of love to share.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was \u2014 because they weren\u2019t adopted. It was only the process of adoption, I\nthink, that kept us \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 from each other. And you know, a \u2014 and a lot of that might have been my\ndoing as well, because I wanted this new family, which turned out to get bigger and\nbigger, and cousins here and cou \u2014 you know, cousins in Cleveland and cousins in\nCanada and my fa\u2014 my American father was Canadian originally.

We have good relationships now, and\ncertainly \u2014 it\u2019s an interesting \u2014 there\u2019s an interesting thing. I think, as a very tiny\ngirl, I probably was a little bit afraid of my German father. I mean, he was big and\ntall \u2014 I don\u2019t think \u2014 I don\u2019t know how big and tall he was, but you know, you\u2019re \u2014",

        "Q: Protected.",
        "A: \u2014 protected me. I was never afraid of Alphonse(ph). He was not \u2014 to me, he was\nnever an intimidating figure. I think, to some of my other siblings, he was a little\nbit. Very bright, very \u2014 in some ways, he could be authoritarian. And \u2014 so when I\ncame back into the picture, it was sort of this big lovefest, rather than maybe seeing\nall of the realities that are out there. But \u2014 but we \u2014 I mean, we all had strong\nfeelings for him.",
        "Q: Yeah, but you ne \u2014",
        "A: They were different.",
        "Q: \u2014 the siblings never held it against you that you \u2014 your other siblings never held\nit against you, or did they \u2014 was there any resentment why you had not gotten in\ncontact?",
        "A: You \u2014 ye \u2014 your \u2014 they never held it against me, well, I think there was some\nresentment.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I was given opportunities they were not given. I stepped away from the family,\nwhether by choice or not, the result was, I did step away, I \u2014 I mean, I was awaySeptember 28, 2016\nfrom the family. Certainly once I was an adult, once I was 20 or 25, I could have\nreconnected with them, and I didn\u2019t. I did not reconnect with them until I was in my\n40s. Why not? So yes, I think there have been some \u2014 some feelings of why didn\u2019t\nyou. But again, at this point, that\u2019s in the past.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We\u2019 ve dealt with it. \u2019ve explained my positions, they\u2019ve explained their\npositions, and you know, we don\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: How do your children look at this?",
        "A: Well, the first thing they said when I told them that I had reconnected, and I told\n\u2014 and they \u2014 they sort of said, well ho-how many \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 over the years, they\nkn \u2014 they knew something. But my youngest daughter, who is herself now, I think\n45 or so. So when this happened, 30 some odd years ago, and I told \u2014 and she said,\nwell, how many are there? And I \u2014 I \u2014I told her how many cousins there were, and\nshe said, you mean, I have 23 instant first cousins? And I said, yeah, 23.",

        "A: Mm-hm.\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "Q: \u2014 of our interview. What would you say to others? What would you say to others\nabout this destiny that your family has had? I \u2014 I'll speak \u2014",
        "A: What would I say?",
        "Q: To other people. To people like me, who are strangers. To \u2014 you know, you \u2014\nyour destiny clearly is born from the circumstances of World War II. This impartial,\nhorrible thing, and in particular, the Holocaust. What would you say to people about\nthis destiny? What would you want them to understand?",
        "A: I think I would want \u2014 I can speak both from a specific, and a more global\nperspective. In the larger sense, I would want people to \u2014 to know, and to\nunderstand that we\u2019re all a common humanity. That unfortunately, there is some\nevil that exists in the world, but that most people want what\u2019s best, not only for\nthemselves, but for others. I would want people to offer, to \u2014 to \u2014 to bel \u2014 to feel and\nto offer compassion for those that are not like them. I have never been able to\nunderstand why the Holocaust had to happen, but I would never blame the next\ngenerations, that came after the perpetrators of that unspeakable evil and horror, to\n\u2014I\u2014Ido not blame them. I think the experiences that we all go through in our own\nway, while the Holocaust is a very unique story, there are other genocides that\nhappen in this world, and there are millions of other survivors of those genocides.\nAnd we try our best to get through life, and that\u2019s all \u2014 it\u2019s really all we can do,September 28, 2016\nthough be \u2014 you know, besides trying to get through life and offer compassion to\nothers. Offer not only compassion, but acceptance and love and understanding, and\nto not turn away from others. I\u2014I-\u2014Iam sorry that I did not find my German\nfamily sooner than I did, but I am thankful and grateful that not only did I find\nthem, or reach out to them \u2014 I always knew where they were, and they always knew\nwhere I was, but that they embraced me, a-and accepted me. And you know, in\ngeneral, I \u2014 besides that horrible, horrible time, that yes, I experienced directly, but I\nwas so young that it didn\u2019t affect me the way it affected my older siblings. That I \u2014 I\n\u2014 I\u2019ve had \u2014 I\u2019ve been given opportunities and have had a life that\u2019s to be envied. It\n\u2014 it \u2014it has been and continues to be a \u2014 a wonderful life. I don\u2019t think I can really\nsay more than that.",

        "Q: \u2014 end of our interview.",
        "A: Yeah. I also think it\u2019s important that we keep the memories alive. That we never\nforget. And I am profoundly grateful to Elie Wiesel, as being an instrumental figure\nin establishing the Holocaust Museum. Because there are still Holocaust deniers out\nthere, throughout the world. And the \u2014 one of the problems with denying the\nHolocaust, is that that will also mean denying other atrocities that occur. And we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016\ncan\u2019t let that happen. So for the museum to be a repository of artifacts and\ndocuments, and being a place where we can learn about history, and about the\nunspeakable horrors, and the unbelievable kindnesses of not only those who \u2014 you\nknow, the people that adopted me, but the people in Germany, who, knowing that\nwe were Germans trying to hide, did not turn us in. They protected us. They found\nfood for us, they gave us a place to hide.

        "A: The \u2014 there s \u2014 they\u2019re so \u2014 I have several images that come to mind. One\nactually is an image of when my mother was taken. And, you know, how perfectly\naccurate this 1s, I don\u2019t know, but \u2014 and I\u2019ve written about this. I was \u2014 this would\nbe 1943. So I was three years old. And the image that I have is my mother and I\nwere home, by ourselves, and there was a knock at the door, and it was two men,\ndressed in black, who came to the door and began to question her. And I was sort of\nhiding behind another door. And then they made her go with them. And so I ran up\nand sat on the windowsill and looked down, and I saw her being put into a \u2014 a black\ncar. It was a very frightening image and experience, because it was the Gestapo\ncoming to take her away.",

        "A: But, I mean, whether I \u2014 whether that\u2019s factual, I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s my\nmemory.",
        "A: The \u2014 the other image that I have, in our apartment, is always not understanding\nwhy I would see people coming into our building and out of our building, going into\na room, or an apartment next door to our apartment, and then never seeing themSeptember 28, 2016\nagain. Or, they would leave, and then another man, woman, child, family, would\ncome the next day. And in trying to understand why, as a three year old, I would\nconstantly see strangers coming and going, well, it was because she was helping\npeople get out of Berlin. So she was part of the underground.",
        "A: In getting people \u2014 probably both Roma and Jewish people, helping them escape.\nThe image that I have of my father was that he was red \u2014 red hair, or red and \u2014 with\na red beard, possibly, or maybe just red hair. And having a radio playing, and he\nwould be tinkering with electrical things, with the radio, maybe building, taking it\napart. And I later learned that he was an electrician. So playing with radios and\nthings, and that there would be music playing on the radio. So, in my very earliest\nmemories, those were kind of the memories that I have. After a couple of years,\nafter my mother was taken \u2014",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: No.\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: Ne \u2014 well, what I know was that we were all arrested, and we were incarcerated\nin the \u2014 the Jewish hospital.",
        "A: But it was for about a month. We were all taken in March or April of 1943.",
        "A: Right. And I think we lived there for a couple of weeks, or a month.",
        "A: I don\u2019t have memories of that, no.",
        "A: This is what I\u2019ve learned, but I don\u2019t have memories of that. The memories that I\nhave is that from Berlin, at some point, we moved to a farm, or a fruit orchard,\nabout 60 kilometers east of Berlin.",
        "A: East of Berlin, so toward \u2014 towards the Russian zone. And always sort of\nplaying by myself in a field, digging up potatoes. Why \u2014 why potatoes? Maybe\nthat\u2019s all there was in the field. But being by myself.",
        "A: They were there, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m just trying to recall memories. And digging up\npotatoes because I was always hungry.September 28, 2016",
        "A: Yeah. Cold and hungry, and always being alone. And \u2014 and then asking \u2014 always\nsaying to my sister, Gertrude, I\u2019m so alone. Or, why am I always alone? So, I\nknow that there was another family living in hiding with us, or at least on the same\nproperty, and maybe there were children, but I have no recollection of being with\nother children. And maybe we did play together. I mean, here I was three or four\nyears old, or four \u2014 four to five years old, and only thinking of myself as being\nalone.",
        "A: Gone. Just out \u2014 out \u2014 out of my life. But \u2014 but I still had all my sisters and my\nbrother. And my sister Gertrude, I think sort of filled the place of my mother. So I\nfelt very close to her. And \u2014 and to this day, I mean, she is a very motherly,\nnurturing kind of person. And so, my bond with my siblings is primarily to her, and\nto my brother Alphonse(ph).",
        "A: The \u2014 the two of them. The oth \u2014 the others are a little more peripheral \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 1n\u20141n how they affected me. Because they \u2014 they were ta \u2014 you know, my \u2014\nmy brother was sort of the stand-in for my father, perhaps. Older, and in charge, and\nI would look up to him. My sister was \u2014 my sister Gertrude was more of that \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 supportive \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 mothering role.",
        "A: Another image that I have from that time was, we lived on this food orchard, or\n\u2014 or farm, for about a year and a half. That would be 1944, coming back to Berlin \u2014\ncoming back to Berlin at the \u2014 perhaps the beginning or maybe the end of ninet \u2014\n1945.",
        "A: The begi \u2014 no, no, the beginning of 1945, ahead of the Russians army, who were\ncoming \u2014 marching into Berlin. So we had to leave where we were, to get away\nfrom them coming back into Berlin. And then I have very strong recollections of\nbeing on the street with my father, watching soldiers coming down the street, and\nbeing very frightened.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: Because they were menacing looking. Dressed in black, just sort of like the two\nmen that I had seen when my mother was taken. And wearing boots, and being, you\nknow, loud and aggressive. And so there was a lot of fear.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We went back to the same building.",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know if we went back to the same apartment, because I think, at\nsome point, our apartment was \u2014 the building was bombed out, so we may have\nmoved into the building \u2014 into an apartment next door. But, there were a lot of air\nraids. So either we would go to the bunker at the Alexanderplatz, the un-\nunderground train station, which was probably only a \u2014 a block or two from our\napartment. Or, we would go down into the bunker in the basement of our building,\nthe shelter, and wait out the air raids. So the \u2014 the sounds of bombs falling, and\nnoises, and planes overhead, again were, for a young \u2014 for me, sounds were very\nconfusing and disturbing.\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: And maybe one of the reasons that I would ask my sister, why am I so alone, or\nI\u2019m always alone, was because my mother was no longer there. My father was still\nin our life, but not my mother.",
        "A: When we what?",
        "A: He -\u2014 he and my brother stayed in Berlin during the week, and they would come\nout on the weekends.",
        "A: Because he\u2019d have found work, and so they were able to \u2014 to work. He was an\nelectrician. My brother, I think, helped him with electrical work in the city, but then\nthey would drive out with the man who owned the food orchard, on the weekends.\nSo we did have time together. But I don\u2019t \u2014 th-those kind of memories are too vague\nfor me \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to really be able to recollect.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: We\u2019re in hiding, because we were Jews, and we knew \u2014 I-I knew. I felt that \u2014\nthat the world was against us, that there were people that didn\u2019t want us around.\nAnd in order to be safe, we had to go \u2014 you know, get out of Berlin, and we had to\nlive in hiding, to not \u2014 to try not to be Jewish, not to be identified as Jews.\nOtherwise, we would not have survived. So the \u2014 the impression left on me was, at\na very young age, to be deceptive. To not admit what I was and who I was. That\nextended from that time, until we had to declare ourselves as orphans, to be able to\nget from Germany to America. Because had we a \u2014 had we said that we had a\nfather living at \u2014 we would not have been able to get on the first ship out, to come to\nthe United States. So having to lie, so the I \u2014 and then once I was here, not wanting\nto admit at \u2014 or what \u2014 wanting to assimilate, because now the wa \u2014 then the war\nwas over, and every \u2014 all the c \u2014 all my classmates, and people that I knew here,\nwould make fun of my German accent, the fact that I couldn\u2019t speak English. The\nfact that I was German, and everybody in the United States was against Germany,\nbecause of what Germany had done in the war. So, denying what my actual\nheritage was.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: So the idea of deception and lying was almost \u2014 almost second nature.",
        "A: I beg your pardon\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And to be a German Jew was the worst, because you\u2019re ji \u2014 yeah, number one,\nyou\u2019re German, so \u2014 and \u2014 and part of the German culture is to be very proud that\nyou\u2019re German. But to be Jewish, you know, you\u2019re \u2014 no \u2014 no matter what \u2014 what I\nwas, we were \u2014",

        "A: Well, I shouldn\u2019t \u2014 the \u2014 the influence that I recall \u2014 I mean, she was a \u2014 a kind\nperson, but I think I was probably more influenced by Gertrude, and maybe by mySeptember 28, 2016\nsister Ruth, who would take me on excursions with her. So \u2014 and they were closer\nto my age, so I don\u2019t know that I felt influenced by my mother.",

        "A: She was 15 or 16.",

And whether there were trucks and tanks, or just soldiers\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016\nmarching, I don\u2019t know. But being in his embrace, so being protected by him, very\nmuch so.",
        "A: But at that point, you know, my mother was gone for a year and a half, so \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, it was very \u2014 it was very frightening to see them, but then to at\nleast know that my father would protect me.",
        "A: I rem \u2014 I remember being very confused, sort of like we were always going\nsomewhere. We were going from Berlin out to the food orchard. We were going\nfrom our apartment to the bunker in the Alexanderplatz. We were from our\napartment, down below, into the shelter in our building, where I think we actually\nlived for a few days, or a week or so, because we had no apartment to go back to.\nAnd then, going from Berlin, on the train, from one place to another. And when I\nsay from one place to another, we were going from DP camp to DP camp. So this \u2014\nthis sense of not belonging, of not s \u2014 sort of being homeless, because we were\nconstantly in flux, and traveling, was both very, very confusing, and yet, I was still\nwith my sisters and brother. So that was reassuring. But sort of not understanding\nwhy. If things were explained to me, I don\u2019t remember the \u2014 any explanations. But ISeptember 28, 2016\nthink I always had the sense of why, or what\u2019s going on. Not knowing, and being\nconfused. And some of those feeling of insec \u2014 and they were feelings of insecurity,\nmay have played into \u2014 into why when I came to the States, and came to the Jewish\nChildren\u2019s Bureau in Chicago, who was our s-sponsor, and then having to go from\none foster home to another foster home, and then finally, eventually, landing with a\nfamily who were a stable family, who wanted to adopt me. I embraced that.",
        "A: I needed the stability and I \u2014 I needed to know that there were people who were\ngoing to take care of me from then on. And \u2014 and you know, provide warmth and\nlove, and discipline, which I didn\u2019t want.",
        "A: Yeah. Who does?",
        "A: And food.",
        "A: And a lot of food.",
        "A: So, all the good things that chil \u2014 you know, and toys. And a\u2014 and a yar \u2014 and a\n\u2014nota yard, but a park to play in. So, all the things that children want.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: I\u2014-a\u2014a-~\u2014a few things.",
        "A: But before talking about that, there\u2019s another image that comes to mind, in\nBerlin. And that is \u2014 I was too young to go to school, although I may have been in\nnursery school for a short time. But this image of being on the street, standing in\nline, and either getting a cup, or \u2014 either tin cups, or tin ladles of soup. And maybe it\nwasn\u2019t really outside, maybe we were in \u2014 in the school building, and that\u2019s how we\ngot some lunch, or something. I \u2014 I don\u2019t remember exactly. But that\u2019s just that one\nsort of one fleeting image.",
        "A: Mm-hm, of \u2014 again, of food, which of course, is another way of being nurtured.",
        "A: Yeah. And \u2014 and you asked about being on the ship. I \u2014 I do \u2014 I have memories,\nactually of \u2014 of going to the galley, to the kitchen. And I mean, I was \u2014 I was young,\nI was relat \u2014 I was the youngest, so probably the \u2014 the crew were \u2014 wer-were nice,\nand so asking or being given oranges, and fruit, or drinks, and then rushing back to\nour cabin, and handing them over.\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: It would have been six.",
        "A: And I think I was probably the type of child who would ingratiate herself. I\nknew how \u2014 I knew how to get people to like me, or give me things, like food.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s just there.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And of course it continued, once I got with my adoptive parents. I really knew\nhow to charm my dad.",
        "A: And my mom turned out to be the disciplinarian.",
        "A: Well, the f\u2014 the first thing I \u2014 I remember is being wakened very early in the\nmorning, and saying, get dressed, we have to go up on deck. And not knowing why,\nbut when we went up there, the first thing that we saw \u2014 that I saw, was the Statue\nof Liberty, which was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 pretty o \u2014",
        "A: \u2019'm not sure what I knew, except there was this very tall lady standing in the\nmiddle of the water. But the \u2014 but that it was wonderful, and everyone was cheering\nand applauding and screaming. And I thought the whole ship was going to capsize,\nbecause we were all on one side of the ship. So it began to list. So \u2014 but it \u2014 that was\na very happy time. And then, getting off the ship, into this enormous warehouse, or\nholding area, on the \u2014 on the dock, and sort of being sectioned off into almost \u2014 I \u2014 I\nwould almost describe it as a cattle pen, where you have fences separating groups.\nBut it was \u2014 but it was people. I mean, we weren\u2019t treated as cattle, we were treated\nnicely. And having pictures taken. And I just m \u2014 sort of recoiled, I didn\u2019t want \u2014\npeople were constantly taking pictures of us, of the seven of us. And then, moving\nfrom there at some point, to a building in the Bronx, in New York, and living there\nfor \u2014 for a month, and going out one day \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 I think we lived there forSeptember 28, 2016\na month in quarantine. And going out one day, sort of \u2014 all of us lining up and going\nto a shoe store to get \u2014 to be given shoes. Who was in charge of us? I do \u2014 certainly\n\u2014 you know, adults that were with the HIAS, or the Jewish Federation.",
        "A: I\u2014I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t know why. I\u2019ve learned, of course, that \u2014 oh, I know why.\nBecause the only way we could get here, as I had mentioned earlier, was to declare\nourselves as orphaned \u2014 orphans.",
        "A: That both parents had died, and this was the way we were going to be able to get\nout of Germany. Because in Germany, you know, there were shortages of\neverything. Buildings were bombed out, there was rubble all over, there was no\nfood available. So getting to America was going to be the thing you strived for, and\nwe would not have been able to get out, if we had waited for our father to join us.",

        "A: Another image comes to mind, before \u2014 even before leaving Berlin. And that is\ngoing with my sister Ruth to some building. Now, we were in the Russian sector,\ngoing into a building and unbeknownst to me, she was meeting \u2014 we were there to\nmeet with, I guess, representatives of the army, the U.S. Army to see if we could get\npapers, so that we could begin the process of becoming DPs, refugees, and\neventually emigrating t-to the U.S.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: So we went from the Russian zone, into the American or the British zone. But I\nbelieve we met with American personnel, and it was the first time that I saw a very\ntall man, who wasn\u2019t my color, and being afraid. But then as \u2014 going up to him,\nlicking my finger, and running my finger down his cheek, thinking it was chocolate.\nAnd he picked me up, and \u2014 and he laughed, and then we became friendly, and I\nwasn\u2019t afraid of him any more. So that was the \u2014 my first recollection of seeing a\nblack person, and that he was friendly. It was not someone to be afraid of.\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: At some point, we got on a train \u2014 oh, on the ship, I was always throwing up.\nEven with these wonderful oranges that the crew were giving me, always seasick.\nOh, to this day, I get seasick. Anyway, after getting the shoes, at some point we\nwere put on a train, and we wound up in Chicago. And getting off the train, and\ngoing to a building downtown, which was the Jewish Children\u2019s Bureau, of the\nJewish Federation. I was plopped up on a table, or a desk, or something. And again,\nwe were lined up, given ice cream, and a doll. So \u2014 and posing for more pictures.\nAnd then, getting into a taxicab, and one by one, we were each dropped off at a\nfoster home.",
        "A: Different foster home, and it was the first time, after all these years of being\ntogether \u2014 my brother would walk each of us up to a foster home, I think either \u2014\neither my brother, or my brother and the social worker who was with us. And I \u2014\nagain, I didn\u2019t understand why, but told that we were going to be with these people,\nwho would take care of you. Well, the first foster home I was in, I liked the man,\nbut I didn\u2019t like the woman. And my sister Ruth came to see me, and I told her that\nshe beat me, that the woman took away my doll, and whatever toys there were, andSeptember 28, 2016\nshe would beat me in the bathtub. And so my sister immediately contacted the\ncaseworker, got me out of there. At which point I went to live with my sister Ren\u00e9,\nwho was in a foster home wi \u2014 and her foster parents were Ruth and Ben\nCarleton(ph). And they were very nice people. And then, at some \u2014 I don\u2019t think I\nlived with her that long, but we did go to the same school. We went to Shakespeare\nElementary School for a very short time, maybe just a couple of weeks that I was\nthere. And then there were two people \u2014 some \u2014 somehow, and this gets confusing, I\nwas back at the Jewish Children\u2019s Bureau, or somewhere, where these two people\ncame and talked to me. And I was in \u2014 perhaps the caseworker asked if I would like\nto go and be with them, and spend the night, or see how things worked out. And I\nliked those people, and they became my adoptive parents.",
        "A: Rosalind and Joshua Spiegel. They were not interested in being foster parents.\nThey wanted to be adoptive parents. My father, Joshua Spiegel, was a\nneurosurgeon. He had operated on Mary Lawrence, who was the director of the\nJewish Children\u2019s Bureau. And at some point he had said to her, we are interested\nin adopting a child. And so, when we came through the JCB, she thought perhaps I\nwould be a good candidate. I was still young. I was only, you know, six and a half\nat the time. I\u2019d \u2014 so I lived with them for a while, and when they asked me if I\nSeptember 28, 2016\nwanted to be adopted, I didn\u2019t know \u2014 I didn\u2019t know any better, I said, oh yeah,\nthese are nice people, okay. I would like that.",
        "A: I beg your pardon\u2019?",
        "A: I told them no, but of course they knew. Every \u2014 all of this \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 fora\nlong time, I lived thinking that nobody knew that our father was living. But the JCB\nknew, everybody knew.",
        "A: In papers that I\u2019ve seen since then. So they were complicit in a good way. They\n\u2014 they wanted us to have good lives.",
        "A: But \u2014 and at that time \u2014 this was, you know, 1946, the rules for adoption, and the\nbest thinking of social workers and psychologists, was that no contact was to be\nmaintained with families of origin, because it would be too difficult \u2014",
        "A: Thinking about adoption and foster care, and the thinking at that time was,\nnumber one, documents were not public. Everything that was done was hidden\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016\naway. So, it \u2014 which kind of played into my earlier mentioning of deception, and\nsort of \u2014 and rather than overt deception, it\u2019s hiding, keeping things private.",
        "A: Not talking about things, and sort of keeping things hidden away from view. So\nonce I moved in with the Spiegels, I actually saw my sisters and brother \u2014 probably\nmore my sisters, several of them, quite a bit. But my mother, of course \u2014 not of\ncourse, my mother, Rosalind Spiegel was in consultation both with the social\nworkers at the Jewish Children\u2019s Bureau, and with a psychiatrist who recommended\nthat contact with my siblings be discontinued, because I was too confused. When\nmy sister would come over, there was always talk about don\u2019t forget Mama, don\u2019t\nforget Papa. We\u2019re all together, don\u2019t forget them. So, of course, I would want to be\nwith them. Then, when I was with these foster people, soon to become my adoptive\nparents, it was difficult to relate to them. And I think I would lash out at them, or\nact out, especially towards my mother, my foster mother Rosalind. And she was\nthen advised to stop contact. Now, when I say contact, maybe they came what, two\nor three times, and then it was decided that \u2014 I mean, I was too young to really make\na choice, but it was decided that it would be in my best interest to identify with this\nnew family, so that they could become my family, so that I would be given the\nopportunity, you know, to have a stable home life, and not be torn between mySeptember 28, 2016\nloyalty to my German siblings, and my loyalty to my new American family. I did\nnot have access to my papers, my German papers until I was an adult. So this would\nbe 1958, 1960. And even then, when I called the Jewish Children\u2019s Bureau to say, I\nwant to see my case file, they gave me a very hard time. This is not public. I said,\nI\u2019m not public, this is my case file. And I had to sort of argue with them, before\nthey finally released the files.",
        "A: What did I learn? I learned that my father had remarried, my German father had\nremarried. I learned that the Jewish Children\u2019s Bureau knew that my father was\nliving. I\u2014I don\u2019t think I learned too much more than that, but I knew \u2014 I learned\nthat the JCB knew that I didn\u2019t have to be hiding the fact that I had a father living\nin Germany all these years. I didn\u2019t have to continue the deception.",
        "A: It was a\u2014",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was a terrible burden. It was a burden because \u2014 and \u2014 and the burden\ncontinued for many years, because I felt this tremendous loyalty towards my\nAmerican parents. But I also had this desire to know about my German family. I\nknew that they all lived in Chicago. What I didn\u2019t know, was not only did they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016\nknow where I lived, they knew what I was doing, where I went to school. They\nwould some \u2014 they would sort of keep tabs on me. They \u2014 1-1-in a \u2014 in a good way,\nthey wanted to make sure everything was okay. I remember I went to the University\nof Chicago Laboratory Schools. I remember \u2014 and tha \u2014 I was now in high school. I\nremember going down the street with my classmates, we were going from one\nbuilding a couple of blocks away, to another building, turning around and seeing\nsome young women kind of following \u2014 following us. And I had no idea why. Well,\nit was two of my sisters. We all lived on the south side of Chicago, not too far away\nfrom each other. They were \u2014 they saw me on the street, and were following me. I\nmean, there was nothing bad about that \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 except that I was with this new family. I hadn\u2019t seen them now in seven or\neight years, and I didn\u2019t \u2014 and I wasn\u2019t sure, I wasn\u2019t positive of who they were.",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was implied. You have a new family. You have \u2014 you have to learn a\n\u2014 you have to learn a new language. You are now an American, you\u2019re not a \u2014\nyou\u2019re not German. You know, it was very exciting time for me to be \u2014 to get \u2014 I\nwas a naturalized citizen. In 1951, I became a US. citizen, that\u2019s a big time. But the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016\nimplication was pretty clear. Oh, at \u2014 that 1t would be better for me to make my \u2014 to\nsort of make my allegiance to this family.",
        "A: It\u2014 yes. Now, it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t given the option, you can go back\nto them, and then it won\u2019t be us. It wasn\u2019t that. It was, you\u2019re here, you\u2019re our\ndaughter, we love you, we\u2019ll take care of you. This is the way it should be. And,\nbecause of the acting out that I had been doing \u2014 I\u2019m not exactly sure what acting\nout I was doing, except I was probably \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 disobeying, or disrespectful, particularly to my mother. I adored my father. I\nadored him, because he, of course, was a pushover. Gave me everything. Would\ntake me to the park, we\u2019d go kite flying. He would take me to Michael Weiss\nHospital on Sunday mornings, where he made rounds of his patients, while I was in\nthe telephone operators\u2019 room with all the operators, and so you know, I was like\nthis little darling. And \u2014 and they would \u2014 they would play with me at \u2014 etcetera.\nBut because of all this confusion, my mother took me to a psychiatrist. So I was in\nSeptember 28, 2016\ntherapy, and I hated that therapy. And the psychiatrist, her name was Emmy\nSylvester(ph), who I believe had emigrated from Germany as well.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: She might have had a few issues. She would, of course, try to get me to talk\nabout my feelings, etcetera, etcetera, and I just wanted to play with whatever it was\nI was \u2014 either \u2014 I wasn\u2019t much of \u2014 into playing with dolls, but building things and\nother \u2014 other kinds of toys. And so I really never wanted to talk to her, but was\nforced to do so. The other thing that my adoptive parents gave me, that was sort of a\nlifesaver with me, was dance lessons. And \u2014 which I would never have had the\nopportunity to do. I came from a very poor family, into now a very well-to-do\nfamily. And I was given every advantage. I went to \u2014 I started out at a public\ngrammar school, but then, after a few years, went to a private high school. And one\nof the very best universities, not only in this \u2014 in \u2014 in the country. Recognized\naround the \u2014 around the world. There was never a question of whether there would\nbe enough food. I was, however, very malnourished. I think we all were, with rotten\nteeth, and you know, no \u2014 no healthcare to speak of. And my parents, the Spiegels,\nwould ply me with food. Well, I would sit at the table, and I was a tiny little girl.September 28, 2016\nNot so tiny any more, but then I was tiny. Filled my mouth with food, and excused\nmyself to go to the bathroom. And finally \u2014 and then I\u2019d come back and I\u2019d eat\nmore food, excuse myself again. I was flushing it down the toilet.",
        "A: Cu \u2014 and they \u2014 it was discovered because either my mother or father went into\nthe bathroom after I came back at \u2014 at some point, and saw that I was flushing food\ndown the toilet. A natural question would be, why didn\u2019t you just stop eating? Well,\nit was pretty early ingrained upon me that I should be grateful for whatever I was\ngiven. I think I learned that in the first foster home, that I was \u2014 that I was in. Be\nthankful and be grateful. Be quiet, and don\u2019t cause trouble. So I was sort of this\nlittle Goody Two-shoes, who acted out secretly, and in a secretive way. I never\nremember once \u2014 when a child is angry, what does a child do?",
        "A: \u2014 to her or his parents?",
        "A: You what? You\u2019re mad at them.",
        "A: Not I. I could never be mad at my parents. So I did it in a \u2014 in an underhanded\nway, more subterfuge. Because I couldn\u2019t say, I don\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing, orSeptember 28, 2016\nI\u2019m angry at you. I could never be that open, because I had to be grateful, because\nthey took me in, and they adopted me, and they gave me this wonderful life. So\nthere was always this confusion of, can I be who I am? Can I be myself?",
        "A: Because I have to be grateful.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t hear you.",
        "A: Not for many years. Not for many years. It was \u2014 it was very hard. So \u2014 and a \u2014\nand when I say many years, I mean after I had children of my own. After I was\nmarried and had children. I remember in my new family, we adopted \u2014 my parents\nadopted two more children. So I had a brother, Jonathan, who was nine and a half\nyears younger than I. And then \u2014 and he was from the U.S., but he had been\nabandoned. And then my sister Petra, who was 12 years younger than I, who had\nbeen \u2014 she was Italian, and lived in an Italian orphanage, because her parents could\nnot take care of her. And I\u2019ve lost my train of thought.",
        "A: Oh, I\u2014 I just remembered. My brother Jonathan once said \u2014 he was probably\nfive or six, or maybe a little bit older. I wa \u2014 I was in the room, and \u2014 and he said to\nSeptember 28, 2016\nmy mother, I hate you. Now, at that \u2014 if he was five or six, I was about 15. And I\nsaid to my mother, how could you let him say that? How could you possibly let him\nsay that to you? And she looked at me, and she said, he\u2019s angry. Of course he hates\nme at the moment, because I didn\u2019t give him candy, or whatever it was. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s\nperfectly natural. And I didn\u2019t think that was right. He was adopted, he should be\ngrateful. Because that\u2019s what I had been told.",
        "A: It was. It is what \u2014 and it is what kept me, because of these dual loyalties, it is\nwhat kept me from reconnecting with my s-sisters and brother. There was one time,\nwhen I was still in high school, probably a junior or a senior. My parents \u2014 we, as a\nfamily went out for dinners, usually on Thursday night or something. I went to this\nfavorite Chinese restaurant. And we left the restaurant to walk home, and I saw four\npeople, you know, just walking down the street. And I remember looking at this\nman, just staring at him as we walked past each other, and he was staring at me. It\nwas my father from Germany, and his new family. I didn\u2019t know it, quite, at the\ntime, except that I kept staring at him, wondering who he was, and why I felt this\nconnection to him. But he had given up his rights to me, that in order for me to be\nadopted, the Jewish Children\u2019s Bureau, I think it was the bureau, had placed \u2014\nplaced an ad in the paper at the time, in 1946 or \u201947, saying that unless you claim\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016\nrights to this child, she will be placed for adoption. So he gave up his rights to me,\nwhich meant no contact. You cannot have contact with her. That was the law in\n1946. You know, that was just the \u2014",
        "A: I never saw him again, no. In \u2014 in 19 \u2014 he came here in 1956 \u2014 1956. So about\nthat time \u2014 about that time, and I did not know that he was here, but about that time,\nI was studying dance downtown, and after class I came downstairs. This was\ndowntown, came downstairs to go and take the train to go home, and there was this\nyoung woman on the street who came up to me, and I sort of looked at her, and I\nsaid, I\u2019m not allowed to talk to you. It was my sister Ruth. I couldn\u2019t remember her\nname.",
        "A: She had gone up to my dance studio, talked with the dance director, told her who\nshe was. The dance director immediately, you know, had her go into another room,\ncalled my father and said, there\u2019s a young woman here who says she\u2019s Ginger\u2019s\nsister. Who is she? My parents had never told the dance director my background.\nHe then apparently contacted the Jewish Children\u2019s Bureau, who contacted my\nsister and said, if you ever go near Ginger \u2014 Bela again, you'll be sent back. ThereSeptember 28, 2016\nwas this fear, sort of hanging over all of us, that if you don\u2019t behave, you\u2019re going\nto be sent back.",
        "A: So there were these conflicting feelings. I believe when I was about 18 or 19, my\nmother said to me, if you ever want to know about your family, just ask me, or let\nme know, or if you want to contact them, I will arrange it. And at that time I said, I\nhave my new family. It\u2019s okay. I can\u2019t have loyalties to both. When I was engaged\nto be married, I was 20, I was contacted \u2014 I got a letter, I\u2014 I guess, about German\nreparations. And so I met with someone and signed the papers, and turned over\nwhat money I got. And this was for the death of my mother. So the German\ngovernment made reparations. I got a check for 39 dollars. And I immediately\nsigned it over to the Jewish Children\u2019s Bureau. You know, I \u2014 I\u2014 I wanted no part\nof it. But basically, that was the only contact that I had with my family, my \u2014 my\nGerman family. A month or two before I got married \u2014 at that time, 1960, you had\nto get [indecipherable] health certificate. So I went to my pediatrician, to si\u2014 e-\neveryone did. Before you could get a marriage license, you had to be \u2014 make sure\nthat you were \u2014 did not have venereal disease, or other health issues. And so I went\nto my pediatrician, got whatever document I \u2014 I needed, and two women came up to\nme and said, are you Ginger? I said yes. Well, can we talk to you for a minute? We\nSeptember 28, 2016\nwent into \u2014 down the hall, and it was my sister Ren\u00e9, and my sist \u2014 I \u2014 I think \u2014 and\nI don\u2019t know why, but I\u2019m saying Gertrude, but it might not have been. Anyway,\nwe went down the hall, and they said, we saw in the newspaper that you\u2019re getting\nmarried, and we just wanted to wish you all the best.",
        "A: And I immediate recognized Ren\u00e9, because she had red hair. And I said \u2014 but, I\nwas kind of embarrassed, because I had not contacted them, or made any effort to\ncontact them, to tell them I was getting married. And you know, I was 19 or 20\nyears old at the time. I was not a child any longer. But they did say, we just wanted\n\u2014 we \u2014 we hope \u2014 we hope you\u2019re okay, and that you\u2019re happy, etcetera, etcetera.\nAnd they were married, they had children of their own. And a few years later, I got\na phone call from one of my sisters, Judy, who said, I\u2019m moving to Lawrence,\nKansas, and I\u2019d \u2014 before \u2014 and I don\u2019t know that I'll ever be back. I\u2019d like to see\nyou. So I said, sure. So she came. I, at this point, had a child. She came to my\napartment, and I opened \u2014 I never forget this, I opened the door, and for the first\ntime in my memory, I looked at someone who looked just like me. Which was very\ninteresting, in that \u2014 you know, I looked at my child, or my children, they didn\u2019t\nlook like me. I didn\u2019t look like my adoptive mother. I didn\u2019t look like my sister or\nbrother. So here was somebody from my past, who looked like me. So \u2014\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and still \u2014 and still I maintained \u2014 and I \u2014 I\u2014 I remember talking\nwith my husband, should I reconnect with my family? And he advised against it. He\nsaid, you\u2019re gonna sort of open up a can of worms. You\u2019ve got this family. And I\nhave relatives in Canada, I mean, the f \u2014 you know, and new cousins here. So it\nwas \u2014 it was hard. I didn\u2019t realize how difficult it was on my sisters, and brother.",
        "A: They were \u2014 they were hovering angels, and yet they couldn\u2019t acknowledge\nthemselves. Two of them once came into the a-apartment building where I lived\nwith my parents, and they almost rang the doorbell, and then they ran away instead.\nSo it was \u2014 yeah, they \u2014 they sort of kept \u2014 kept an eye on me, in \u2014 in \u2014",
        "A: Fabulous. Fabulous. Many years later \u2014 oh, oh, and every once in\n[indecipherable] about every five years, once I was an adult, I had contact with\nthem, through the \u2014 I-I\u2019d get a letter, or a card, or something. It turns out that my\nsister Ren\u00e9 went to the same high school that my husband went to. They both went\nto Hyde Park, on the south side. I don\u2019t know that they knew \u2014 I don\u2019t think they\nknew each other, but they \u2014 you know, there was always something. I received\nSeptember 28, 2016\nsome letters, some were nice, some were not so nice. But I \u2014 because I did question,\nshould I contact them, what should I \u2014 and \u2014 and it was sort of, you\u2019ve just got too\nmuch going on in your life. You\u2019ve got your own family, you\u2019ve got your children,\nyou\u2019ve got your adopted brother and sister, you\u2019ve got your parents. How many\nthings, you know, can you handle? I became disabled in 1984, and shortly\nthereafter, I don\u2019t know what possessed me, but shortly thereafter, I called and\nmade a lunch date with Mary Lawrence, the director of the Jewish Children\u2019s\nBureau. We had lunch downtown. And she too had sort of kept tabs on me, because\nshe orchestrated the adoptions of my brother and sister, as well as me. And she said,\nwell, tell me what\u2019s going on in your life, and how\u2019s your German family? And I\nsaid, well, I don\u2019t have contact with them. Well, why not? Or, when are you going\nto call them? And I said, well \u2014 anyway, a-and so I\u2014 we got on to other subjects.\nSo, after thinking about that for maybe six months, I picked up the phone. I\u2019ve had\n\u2014I\u2019d had a New Year\u2019s card from my sister Gertrude, that I\u2019d had for 10 years or\nso. I saw a phone number on the back of the envelope, and I said, okay, and I made\na phone call. I had \u2014 so I had a phone number, which meant that I had made a phone\ncall 10 years before, probably, and there was no answer. So this time would be\nabout a year or two after my accident. I saw that card, picked up the phone and\nmade a phone call. And it \u2014 at about lunchtime \u2014 I remember this very clearly, and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016\nsomebody answered the phone and said hello, and I said, Manya? And she said \u2014\nshe just [sharp inhale] and the first words out of her mouth were, why now? And I\nsaid \u2014 this is my sister Gertrude \u2014 and I said to her, well, I tried to call you 10 years\nago, but there was no answer. And she said, do you mean if I hadn\u2019t picked up the\nphone now, it would be another 10 years? And I said, yeah. So, I \u2014 I mean, she \u2014\nyou know, sh-she was in such shock. Immediately called my brother, who called\nme, and he drove to Chicago I think two days later. I had not seen him now, since\n1946.",
        "A: Forty years.",
        "A: He and I created a bond that was really quite deep, and \u2014 and profound. And\nunfortunately, he just passed away, two weeks ago. So, sort of what the whole\nfamily saga turns into was that, they would say that after wandering in the desert for\n40 years, I came back. And I \u2014 we had a family reunion, after \u2014 a 40\" reunion, and\nthen 10 years later at my home, we had a 50\" anniversary party of coming to\nAmerica, so that would be 1996.",
        "A: And so, you know, we\u2019ve maintained a \u2014 a very good \u2014\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Again, the two most important people, Gertrude and Alphonse(ph), have\nbeen more a part of my life than the \u2014 than the others. Just because it \u2014 there\u2019s just a\ncloser bond. You know, you \u2014 you\u2019re not going to be equal with every \u2014 every\nmember of your family. But al \u2014 al \u2014 I would travel to D.C. to see him, he would\ncome here. He would have meetings, and \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, they were. And one time, he was in town, and there was a party at my\naunt and uncle\u2019s house \u2014 my American aunt and uncle\u2019s. And we \u2014 and I-I-I said,\ncan I\u2014 can Alphonse(ph) come with me? Of course. So he met my parents, and he\nasked my father, Joshua Spiegel if he could talk with him privately. They went\ndown to the basement and afterwards, I asked my father, I said, what did\nAlphonse(ph) say to you? And he said, he thanked me ... he thanked \u2014 he thanked\nme for giving you a life, for providing you with a home and opportunities, and\nestablishing a family. And, I mean, here was my brother, who had his own family,\nwho was such a mensch as to go up to my father and thank him for being my father.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That perhaps give you a tiny insight into the kind of man that my brother was. A\nman who was a fisit \u2014 brilliant physicist, had a deep sense of history, who was very\nGerman, had a \u2014 loved music and literature. Had almost gone to the University of\nChicago, because he was offered a scholarship, but because of his interest in\nscience and math, decided to go to the Illinois Institute of Technology, and become\na physicist. He and I would have long talks, and he was so sorry 1n his later years\nthat he didn\u2019t take up the offer of going to University of Chicago, you know, and\nlearning many \u2014 much more of the humanities. But he is a man who married outside\nhis Jewish faith, fell in love, raised a family, did not really practice his Judaism for\nmany years. The children were raised Catholic. But I believe he felt a disconnect\nwith his wife and chi \u2014 and children because of \u2014 not only the religious differences,\nbut the cultural differences of all of us. I mean, I\u2019m very Americanized. Gertrude\nis pretty much Americanized. Alphonse(ph) never was. He was 18 when he came\nhere, so rema \u2014 remained very German.",
        "A: Very European.",
        "A: Very European. And \u2014 and yet, you know, tremendous loyalty and love for his \u2014\nhis family. He lived in Gaithersburg, Maryland. He got his, you know, degree\nhere in Chicago, moved to Toronto for his post-doctoral work, then his fam \u2014\nmoved with his family to New York for a number of years, and then to D.C. to\nwork for the government. The National Institute of \u2014 of \u2014 National Bureau of\nStandards, now called NIST. For many years did a lot of research into physics and\nRaman spectroscopy in particular. But, in a different way, had many of the same\nconflicts that I had.",
        "A: If I\u2019m thinking about it now, my conflicts were not over religion, but over two\ndifferent worlds; a German world, and an American world; German family, and an\nAmerican family. His conflicts were more over a German heritage.",
        "A: You know, there is \u2014 I mean, German Jews considered themselves German. So 1-\nit\u2019s not \u2014 there \u2014 there\u2019s a combination of a German heritage, and a German Jewish\nheritage. It\u2019s a little hard to explain, unless you\u2019re there. So, I mean, he \u2014 you know,\nhis eldest son, he named Karl, k-a-r-l, who, in his adulthood became, and is, a\nLutheran minister. The family ma \u2014 moved away from Catholicism, and became\nEpiscopalian, but then Karl became a Lutheran minister. So the \u2014 there \u2014 these \u2014September 28, 2016\nthese conflicts of \u2014 of dual loyalty \u2014 I mean, Alphonse(ph) was fluent in German,\nknew a lot of German songs. Steeped himself in the \u2014 the \u2014 the poetry of \u2014 of\nGoethe and Rilke and \u2014 and \u2014 and Schubert, and you know, just \u2014 and \u2014 and felt\nthat there was nothing better than a German education, because it was the Germans\nwho really implemented higher education. Very proud of that. And yet \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 was denied a good part of his own education because he was Jewish. So these\n\u2014 these conflict \u2014 and the conflict in his own marriage, and sadly, we would talk \u2014 I\nmean, he did not practice any religion of any kind for many years. And about 10\nyears ago \u2014 and I would talk to him about that. I mean, I \u2014 I don\u2019t consider myself a\nreligious Jew, but more of a cultural Jew, but I would \u2014 I \u2014 certainly I went to \u2014 to \u2014\nto religious school, and became confirmed, and \u2014 cause girls were not Bat Mitzvah\nwhen I was growing up. My children have been raised in a \u2014 in a Jewish home. But\nit wasn\u2019t until 10 years ago that Alphonse(ph) returned to his Jewish roots and\nbegan to go to synagogue. And not only began to go to synagogue, but really\nimmersed himself and steeped himself in Jewish tradition. And we\u2019ve recently had\nsome bad family feelings because he \u2014\nSeptember 28, 2016",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know, that\u2019s a \u2014 that\u2019s an interesting question. I \u2014 actually, there was a time\nwhen I felt anger towards my birth father, because he gave up his rights to me. And\nI said to myself, how could he do this? He disowned me. And then I would have to\ntalk to myself, and say, he did this for my benefit. Number one, he did not think he\nwas ever going to get to the United States.",
        "A: That is the case. I\u2014 I \u2014 I believe that is the case. Now, he signed those rights\naway in 1946, so that I could be adopted, or maybe it was \u201947. At which point, I\u2019m\nnot sure exactly when, but he remarried. He had a stepdaughter, and together he and\nhis wife had a son. That\u2019s my half-brother Harry.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Yes. Harry. And my stepsister is Gitta(ph). Brigitta(ph), so Gitta(ph). A-And\nshe and I are about six months apart in age, yes. And \u2014 and they\u2019re \u2014 you know,\nthey\u2019re lovely people. So I have met them a \u2014 a number of times. When I had, at my\nSeptember 28, 2016\nhome, the 50\" anniversary party, of course they were included. Harry and his wife,\nand Gitta(ph) and her husband. And I\u2019ve met th \u2014 Gitta(ph) and \u2014 and her\nhusband\u2019s children.",
        "A: So I\u2014I \u2014 initially I felt anger towards my father, Alexander, but then I would\nsay, I know he did this because he wanted you to ha \u2014 you, Ginger, to have a life.",
        "A: They had a lot of anger towards my adoptive parents, absolutely. I will try to\nexplain \u2014 in fact, Is \u2014I think I still have letters that we exchanged, where I was\nexplaining to them why my parents did what they did. They didn\u2019t do it because ab\n\u2014 out of dislike of them, they did it because they felt this would be in my best\ninterests, and they were advised to do it by professionals. So they thought that this\nwould be in my best interests. But there was a lot of anger, yes, and \u2014 and perhaps\nsome resentment. It \u2014 but I\u2014 I think we\u2019re beyond that.",
        "A: And past that.",
        "A: Yes, oh yes, definitely been put to rest, and \u2014 and when \u2014 you know, so e-\neverything is fine. I \u2014 I think maybe sometimes I felt some ambivalence toward my\nadoptive parents. Not anger.",
        "A: But I\u2014 I\u2019m not a person who f \u2014 at \u2014 who feels a lot of anger, or admits to a lot\nof anger. It\u2019s a little \u2014 1t \u2014 it goes a little more underground with me. But \u2014 and I\nnever \u2014 I never felt unhappy or \u2014 or questioned why they did what they did, as I\u2014I\ndidn\u2019t think that there were ulterior motives. I knew that what they did was out of\nconcern for me. I did discuss, after my sister Judy had come to see me, before she\nmoved to Lawrence, and told me the stories of sitting around the table with the\nfamily, that, number one, my father and his new family had come to the States,\nwhich I had not known, and that they \u2014 when they would occasionally get together,\nthey would say how nice it was, how wonderful it was that all the family were\ntogether, except for Mama and Bela. Well, that did a guilt trip on me that was pretty\nprofound. I do remember talking to my father, and kind of feeling him out, and\nasking him if he thought I should contact my German father. And he said \u2014 because\nI wanted to find \u2014 I\u2014 when I say I was feeling him out, I wanted to know, or get a\nfeeling of whether he would feel that I didn\u2019t care for him, or if it would hurt him if\nI contacted my German father. And he said to me \u2014 he\u2019s a very wise man \u2014 he said,\nSeptember 28, 2016\nprobably \u2014 no, he said, if you contact him, you should do it with the knowledge that\nyou will continue a relationship with him. Don\u2019t do it out of curiosity and then\nnever see him again. That would be cruel.",
        "A: It would not be right \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 for you to do that. If you make a \u2014 a connection with him, you need to follow\nthrough on that connection with your father, and with your siblings, he said, My\nadvice to you would be to not do it, because you\u2019ll be opening up a can of worms.\nYou have your own family, you have your husband, you have one or two chi -\u2014 I\ndon\u2019t remember how many children IJ had at that point. You know, you have this\nwhole western, Americanized family. It\u2019s a lot for you to take on. I read into that,\nthat he would be hurt, so I never did, until after I became disabled and decided I\nneeded to look at my life.",

        "A: And yes, an-and that made me examine myself a little bit more and say, stand up\nand do what\u2019s right.",
        "A: You need to connect with them. But in terms of my American father, the \u2014 my\nmother had already given me permission, but I needed \u2014 I needed to hear from them\n\u2014 from my father \u2014 cause my moth \u2014 my German mother was gone.",
        "A: So she would not be threatened. I was concerned that my father would be\nthreatened. So, you know, we each bring so much to any conversation.",
        "A: A lot of internal feelings that \u2014 that aren\u2019t expressed. Once he met my bro \u2014 not\nonce, but when he met my brother, I think he was overwhelmed by my brother\u2019s\ngenerosity, and by their connecting with each other. Now, my \u2014 my German fatherSeptember 28, 2016\ndied in 1970 \u2014 1969 or 1970. I did have a lot of guilt feelings about n-never seeing\nhim again.

And you know, a \u2014 and a lot of that might have been my\ndoing as well, because I wanted this new family, which turned out to get bigger and\nbigger, and cousins here and cou \u2014 you know, cousins in Cleveland and cousins in\nCanada and my fa\u2014 my American father was Canadian originally.

We have good relationships now, and\ncertainly \u2014 it\u2019s an interesting \u2014 there\u2019s an interesting thing.

Very bright, very \u2014 in some ways, he could be authoritarian. And \u2014 so when I\ncame back into the picture, it was sort of this big lovefest, rather than maybe seeing\nall of the realities that are out there. But \u2014 but we \u2014 I mean, we all had strong\nfeelings for him.",

I stepped away from the family,\nwhether by choice or not, the result was, I did step away, I \u2014 I mean, I was awaySeptember 28, 2016\nfrom the family. Certainly once I was an adult, once I was 20 or 25, I could have\nreconnected with them, and I didn\u2019t. I did not reconnect with them until I was in my\n40s. Why not?

But my youngest daughter, who is herself now, I think\n45 or so. So when this happened, 30 some odd years ago, and I told \u2014 and she said,\nwell, how many are there?

        "A: I think I would want \u2014 I can speak both from a specific, and a more global\nperspective.

That unfortunately, there is some\nevil that exists in the world, but that most people want what\u2019s best, not only for\nthemselves, but for others. I would want people to offer, to \u2014 to \u2014 to bel \u2014 to feel and\nto offer compassion for those that are not like them. I have never been able to\nunderstand why the Holocaust had to happen, but I would never blame the next\ngenerations, that came after the perpetrators of that unspeakable evil and horror, to\n\u2014I\u2014Ido not blame them. I think the experiences that we all go through in our own\nway, while the Holocaust is a very unique story, there are other genocides that\nhappen in this world, and there are millions of other survivors of those genocides.\nAnd we try our best to get through life, and that\u2019s all \u2014 it\u2019s really all we can do,September 28, 2016\nthough be \u2014 you know, besides trying to get through life and offer compassion to\nothers. Offer not only compassion, but acceptance and love and understanding, and\nto not turn away from others. I\u2014I-\u2014Iam sorry that I did not find my German\nfamily sooner than I did, but I am thankful and grateful that not only did I find\nthem, or reach out to them \u2014 I always knew where they were, and they always knew\nwhere I was, but that they embraced me, a-and accepted me. And you know, in\ngeneral, I \u2014 besides that horrible, horrible time, that yes, I experienced directly, but I\nwas so young that it didn\u2019t affect me the way it affected my older siblings. That I \u2014 I\n\u2014 I\u2019ve had \u2014 I\u2019ve been given opportunities and have had a life that\u2019s to be envied. It\n\u2014 it \u2014it has been and continues to be a \u2014 a wonderful life. I don\u2019t think I can really\nsay more than that.",
        "A: But I -",
        "A: Yeah. I also think it\u2019s important that we keep the memories alive. That we never\nforget. And I am profoundly grateful to Elie Wiesel, as being an instrumental figure\nin establishing the Holocaust Museum. Because there are still Holocaust deniers out\nthere, throughout the world. And the \u2014 one of the problems with denying the\nHolocaust, is that that will also mean denying other atrocities that occur. And we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 28, 2016\ncan\u2019t let that happen. So for the museum to be a repository of artifacts and\ndocuments, and being a place where we can learn about history, and about the\nunspeakable horrors, and the unbelievable kindnesses of not only those who \u2014 you\nknow, the people that adopted me, but the people in Germany, who, knowing that\nwe were Germans trying to hide, did not turn us in. They protected us. They found\nfood for us, they gave us a place to hide. So \u2014 so there are good people in the world,\nno matter their culture, no matter their teaching, no matter their upbringing.",
