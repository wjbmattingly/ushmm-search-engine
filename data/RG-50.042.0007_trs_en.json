        "SHONY BRAUN\nMarch 9, 1992\nBeep.\nFalse start, take 2 1s up. Actually, we'll keep one, we'll repeat one.\nI want you to describe the transport and then the arrival in Auschwitz, and why don't you as you\ndescribe it, give me your age and ----------.\nWell, the transport was approximately 4 days as we were, and there, there were so many so many\nthings happened even before the transport that probably I will skip it in and go right into what you,\nto answer your question. There were, we had no water, we had very little food, just the food which\nwe took from home before we had to board the cattle cars, and there were a lot of , lot of people\ndied, mainly children and older people. For instance we were so compact, we were like Sardinians.\nIf you sat, you couldn't get up, and vice-versa. At, on the fourth night we, we arrived to\nAuschwitz, and we had to wait, and the train was waiting. Then, all of the sudden the doors\nopened, slid open, and we were ordered out. As we stepped out, head prisoners called Kapos\nrushed at us using their whips and so did the SS. They were beating, they're kicking, they're hitting\neveryone they could reach. And we were ordered to form a line, stand in line, men in one, women\nand small children in the other. Why the whip and the kicking and the beating was going on, after\nwe lined up, I noticed that a SS, high ranking SS officer approached. He, that was the infamous Dr.\nJosef Mengele. The angel of death. The man who would decide our fate. Instant death in a gas\nchamber or lingering life of ----------, slavery. We had to file by him. As we did, I noticed that he\nhad slender stick, actually 1t was a conductor's baton, being a musician, even at 13, so I recognized\nit, and he was waving it to the right or the left. He was pointing which way each individual who\nfiled by him to go. My mother and younger sister, my Goldie, who was only nine years old. She\nwas motioned to the left, along with my mother. My older sister Violet was motioned to the\nopposite side, to the right. My brother Zoltan, who was 15 and my father they, they next were in\nline, they were also motioned to the same side where Violet, my older sister. By the way, Violet\nwas 18, I don't know if I mentioned it or not. But my turn came. To my great surprise, Mengele\nstopped me, motioned to stop, and he says, \"Tell me little boy, how old are you?\" \"I am 13,\" I\nreplied. Previously coached to say more than I was because this way I had a better chance to\nsurvive, and being sent to work rather than being sent immediately to the gas chamber. When he\nwas, Mengele was sort of looking at me with a suspicion, suspiciously, because I really didn't look,\nno, not even 13. My frail body, and pale, you know I didn't go out to play foot, football, soccer",
        "with the boys, but I was always practicing the violin. So, but miraculously he was motioning me to\nthe group where my father and brother were. After the selection was were over, my mother, my\nyounger sister, and the group that they were in were led away. I didn't, now that I've seen them, did\n-------. They were taken direct to the gas chamber, and they were told that that you have to take a\nshower, in order to camouflage really what they wanted to do, the SS will issue a towel and a bar of\nsoap.\nWe better stop for the siren.\nSync take 2 is up.\nBeep.\nAfter the selections were over, my mother, my younger sister, and the group they were in were led\naway. I didn't know that I have seen them for the last time. They were taken directly to the gas\nchamber. There was actually a house where was written the words, \"Bade.\" Means bath. And each\none of them were issued a bar of soap and a towel, and then they said, \"You have to go in there and\ntake a shower,\" but in reality, that was the gas chamber. As soon as they went in, the doors were\nlocked behind them, and then the gas was flowing, and everybody had died. The terrible thing,\nmaybe, to add to that, I should say, was that then the SS would send some of us prisoners to go and\npick up the dead bodies and cart them away. When, when we were just getting to ourselves what\nhappened, we were taken to uh another barrack, we were stripped completely, and had to take a\nlittle shower, and the very same gas chamber where these won-wonderful people and the poor, poor\nchildren were taken and were gassed, we really took a shower. When the, the gas where there were\nflowing through the pipes, now they let water through. I know because I was in it also to shower in\nreality. Then we were assigned to a barrack. We managed somehow to stay together. My father,\nmy brother Zoltan and me. And one night, as we were standing in line to be count-counted, that\nwas the final count, and Kapo, which means head prisoner, and we're going to be fair from now on,\nthey were as a Kapo, came to our line, and he was picking prisoners for what they call a Zonder\ncommando. And he, among other prisoners, he picked me too. A Zonder Commando had to go\naround to the camp, and pick up the dead, only the dead bodies, and cart them up to the\ncrematorium. Now being in the Zonder commando, that meant separation from my father and\nbrother. I was assigned to a different barrack. And, one occasion as I was picking up a body, I\nnoticed that this, this man was not dead at all. And I turned to the Kapo, and I said, \"Herr Kapo,\"\nyou know, uh, \"If we would give a little food or a little water, this man would, would survive.\"\nAnd then he turned around and hit me with his fist in my face so hard that I fell over, and he said,",
        "\"You are not here to tell me who would survive. We're not here to make people survive. Now if\nyou're not going to uh keep your mouth shut, I'm going to put you in the crematorium also. Now\npick up that body, and put him up,\" and we did it, I, I didn't say no more, anything. But, all my life,\neven today, even as I am telling you this, I have the most awful feeling that I really had to burn my\nfellow prisoners, had to go and cart them out to the crematorium so that they would be burned, and\nthey were alive. So we were doing this for about oh maybe 6 days. Now in that group where I was\nworking the Zonder Commando, there was another Commando, a father...\nNow we do have to reload.\nBeep.\nBeep.\nTo my great surprise, Mengele stopped me and talked to me, and he was asking, \"Tell me little boy,\nhow old are you?\" I said, \"I'm 16 and I can prove it.\" And I was gesturing to go into my pocket\nbecause I had the, this birth certificate that we falsified birth certificate, because previously my\nfather, when we still, when we're still home, I have to qualify that we're, we're told, we were told\nby--unless you, you do, your minor children, like I was 13 before, I mean uh, before we were taken\nyou know, and uh my uh sister was 9 years old so unless is getting uh different birth certificates,\nwe're not going to survive. Now, we children didn't know about it, but our father did. So, paid a\nlot of money for that, but we did get certificates. So I pulled out, uh, but, he was looking at me, and\nmiraculously he mo-waved me to the group where my father and my brother were . Now in the\nZonder Commando, there was a man who was about same age as my father, and he had a son who\nwas in the same barrack where my father and brother were, and the son was about the same age,\nmaybe a year or two older than I, and he heard, word came to him that the very same barrack where\nhis son was going to be evacuated, and they're going to go to France the very next day. So, he\ncontrived an ingenious plan, and he says, listen, I tell you what, because you like to be with your\nfather and brother, and I certainly love to be with my son. Now, when you see that all the\nprisoners running from every direction to regroup the final count, in the evening, go in, go into the\nline where my son is, and my son is going to take, get into this line, where this barrack line is and\nno one, nobody the wiser because we were only numbers, so the plan worked. He was reunited\nwith his son, and I got back in the barrack where my father and brother were. Next morning, next\nday, we were off to France. I found out later that the very same day when we were transported to\nFrance, that all the Zonder Commandos were killed because the SS feared if one of the commandos\nor not, uh specifically the commandos, would escape, would tell the world of the atrocities, and of",
        "the, the terrible thing which the SS did to humanity. Because we were more witnesses to their uh\nmachine, you know, death machine, than any other prisoners, because we were the one who were\npicking up dead bodies and, and took them and burned them on their order. And, I tell you, the\nimage of this father and son will haunt me for the rest of my life. Now in, when we arrived in\nFrance, I was put to uh work in an ammunition factory, and in that factory they were making, it was\nand build a, I don't know exactly if the V-2 rocket, but rocket which was designed specifically to\nshoot airplanes, and of course, mainly the Americans and the Russians, and that was su-a such a\ntremendous force, they would, they would all the, all the uh the airplane if, if it got in contact with a\nrocket it would be torn to pieces. I was cutting parts to that rocket. Then, later, I was put to a\nmachine which automatically filled explosive caps with the gun powder. One day a French\nprisoner approached me and he says, \"What would you do to stop Hitler's madness? Would you\ngive up your life?\" Without hesitation, I said, \"Yes.\" Now, I was operating a machine at that point,\nas I, I think I mentioned that, which beside filling uh, uh gun powder, we have to go back to that,\nI'm sorry. Yeah. Can I do that now?",
        "Yeah.",
        "This French captain, uh forgive me, this French man, is, I forgot to tell, uh, what his rank was. He\nwas actually a uh, captain in the underground movement, resistance movement, who was smuggled\namong us as a prisoner, and he organized a sabotage movement. So, this is how he approached me\nand if I would be, because to him, I was the most important person by, by working on that machine\nwhich filled gun powder, the caps with the gun powder, and he said to me, \"I tell you what. You\nsee those civilians? Those are all French men. Electricians. They were working around the\nammunition factory.\" And he says, \"I tell you what you do. Now these men will supply you sand,\nand I want you to put in this capsule which you've been filling with gun powder, sand and very\nlittle gun powder. So the machine that I was working would be filling the gun powder\nautomatically as I just, all I had to do is just put it on. But now I had to put sand and mix, mix it\nwith the gunpowder. And it worked. I mean it was fantastic how easy it really was to do that. One\nday, some new transport came with new prisoners, and another prisoner was put in that very near\nme, the machine, working, cutting parts, and it turned out that that was an a SS spy, wanted to\nknow, they already detected, they were, they found out that this weapon, the second stage in impact\ndid not work. And that was the idea. I didn't know that, I found out later that the sand was needed\nto uh, uh how can I say that stop the second stage from exploding, and uh, our leader was\nidentified, this French captain. He was hanged, and all of us who were around that area had to\nwatch him die, and we were not allowed to avert our eyes from him nor move away. After that,\nabout 60 of us put, were put in, in a horizontal line and asked to stand still. Other words still stand,",
        "or stand at attention maybe in, in uh English, and an SS officer was going down the line picking\nprisoners at random. He passed me, and then was coming back and passed me again, they picked\nmy right the one next time. And the third time he still went down the line just looking at prisoners\nwhich he sort of wanted to kill and passed me again. Three times I was to be taken to be shot to\ndeath, and all three times I was passed by. Now the ones that were chosen, they had to step out of\nline, they were taken out of the camp and shot to death. We were sent back to the barrack, and then\nwere sent some Kapos and we had a beating in a ---------. I can't tell you we, our...face and, and\nbody and, and, and were puffed up and, and uh as many of them, their ribs were broken in because\nwe were around that area. Now I was a saboteur, and I got a, a uh sort of a form like a uh half\ncircle written on my back and I, I 'saboteur.'\n(Sandy talking in background).\nYou can just start with \"I was a saboteur.\"\nI was a saboteur, and then go on. So I was a saboteur, and I was marked as such, on the, on the\njacket of my back, and every time, I, any, a Kapo would pass by me or an SS officer or an SS\nguard, either would spat at me, spit on me or kick me, so, I believe in God because God saved my\nlife so many times that that I was not patriot, in spite of all the three times that the SS went by\npicking people at random, um passed me by. I don't believe that was a coincidence. And uh, it was\nGod's way of protecting me. And anyway, about two weeks later that I had that Saboteur jacket, all\nthe jackets were taken from everybody, and for the, I couldn't belie-believe it, we had back new\njackets which was clean, and the word saboteur disappeared off, off of my jacket, so I was again\nnot molested anymore as a saboteur, but freely could walk back and forth over where I was\nworking. So, I also give credit to God for that. Now, I must tell you something is an extremely\ninteresting, and maybe one of the million or ten million or hundred million that can happen. I have\nto go to Cleveland, Ohio for a second, uh because it's, we are still with that sabotage things. Uh,\nwhen I was in Cleveland in 19, in 1958, --------------fifty, I was studying in the university, and um,\none of my ---------uh gave me a check. Now he was an American, Hungarian and Jewish like\nmyself, except I was not American unfortunately, and uh, he gave me a check to pay up a debt,\nwhich I uh, had been paying, paying, and never got smaller, so he says, \"Go in any bank, and cash\nit.\" But you see, he didn't have an account in that bank or any bank in that area, and I didn't have\nan account anywhere at any bank. So, in fact, I didn't even speak English, very little, and I said to\nhim, \"How do I do this? I mean,\" \"Oh no,\" he says, \"It's very simple, here's the check, all you do\nis go up to the teller, and just say, cash, cash, give me cash.\" I said, \"That's all?\" He says, \"Yeah.\"\nNow I went into, looked around where is a bank and I'm coming from uh around lunchtime you",
        "know and I had --------you had to go back to school in the afternoon classes. So I saw a bank, so I\ngo in there. Cleveland Trust, I remember now. And, I went up to, waited in line and went up to\nwhat was the teller, put down and I said, \"Cash cash.\" And and he looked at me, so other words,\nwe couldn't communicate. So he was a compassionate man, he said, \"Okay, just a second.\" He\ncame from his window and escorted me to the President's office. Now he spoke several languages.\nNow we're going to find out what this foreigner wants, he thought, probably. So, I started with uh,\nI spoke to the uh it was the President of the bank, and I said, uh \"Parlez francaise?\" \"Sprechens-y\nDuetshce?\" \"----------Hungarian.\" He says, \"Spreche Duetsche.\" I'm I speak German. Thank God.\nSo we start, and we waited a little because the teller had to find out if there is money on this\naccount, and he says to me, \"-------------------,\" speak French, are you French? I said, \"No, I'm a\nTransylvanian.\" But I was in France, and looking at my violin case being next to me, he says, \"Did\nyou study music there?\" I said, \"No.\" But then I relented what I doing in France, that I was doing\nsabotage, putting sand instead of uh filling up with sand you know with gun powder, and when,\nwhen actually uh one of these uh planes are what the plane would be obliterated. And he stood,\nfrom, he sprung up from his chair, ran, ran to me, grab my hand, \"God bless you, God bless you.\" I\nsaid, \"Thank you. Thank you.\" I mean blessing comes always well, so I thank you for it.\" He\nsays, \"No please,\" he saw my puzzled face, he says, \"Please let me explain. My son and nine crew,\nhe was a captain over nine crew, and they were bombing around that area where the ammunition\nfactory was, and they were shot with one of these rockets, which penetrated the airplane but did not\nexplode. I think they were caught on the wing, and or the tail, whatever, and when they got back to\nthe bases, very carefully, they took that weapon, that rocket apart to see why did not explode, they\nfound sand in the capsule.\" So we both hugged and started to cry, and I knew, I knew then that if I\nwould have been killed and died, it would not be in vain, because I knew that at least ten people,\nnine, nine plus the captain, ten lives were saved because of my sabotage.\nI want to jump to the incident 1n the salt mines.\nYes.\nOkay, with my father.\n--------------electric wires, that resistance because, before we run out.\nIn September, we were transferred from France into Copendorf, which was a, a large salt mine, and\nwas a terrible grueling work, and, and day of Yom Kippur, all of the sudden the whole area of the\nsalt mine became dark, completely dark, and we put our uh hammers down and uh sat down",
        "immediately. A little rest, at least a little rest. We thought 1t was God's will that on Yom Kippur at\nleast, you know, sending us something, darkness that we can rest, and one of, one of the prisoners\nstarted to chanting the -----------------, and honestly, I can hear it, I can hear it now, like, then the\nother one got into, and then another one. We were also about 60 to 80 persons around there, and\nwe're sitting, and then even those who did not know the words, and they did not probably even\nknow the melody, but they were humming along, along, and in, in a miracle too, the entire section\nwas full of, of, of, of the ----------------, the song of, of the Yom Kippur. We didn't know that the\nSS, we were not aware of it that the SS were listening in. Within ten minutes, the whole problem\nwas found, restored and the light came on. Then we found out what was the source of the darkness.\nOne of us in fact, it, he was which I did not put in my book that was a Hungarian uh Jew who used\nto show, in, he had secretly hidden his wife's and his little son's picture, and that gave him a little\nbit of will of, of, of living because constantly we had to talk him out of committing suicide,\nconstantly, and my father was the one who always said, \"No, you'll see, we're going to survive,\"\nand you know. But, he couldn't stand it any longer, and he went and cut the wire with the uh\nspoon made into sharpen the, like it was like a knife. He was beaten severely until he fell\nunconscious. Then we had to form another line, exactly like 1t was in France, and one was picked,\nthe other one was let go, then he passed, the SS passed 2 then picked the third one the fourth, then\nagain. So, here half of them were picked, taken out and shot to death. I also again was bypassed.\nSo, I have, you have to, you have to puzzle, you have to think how come I didn't, I was saved one\nday before I would be killed as Zonder Commando, then in France I was bypassed three times.\nNow again, coincidences maybe. Who knows? I believe differently. So, we were severely beaten,\nthe one that they were not picked. In, still in Copendorf, in February, my father turned 42. So my\nWait we are going to run out. We should just start another roll. We're going to run out in about ten\nseconds.\nBeep.\nIn February 1945, my father turned 42, and we didn't have nothing to give him. We at home always\nused to exchange gifts. We children would put our little pennies together to buy for our parents'\nanniversary or, or birthday, but here we had nothing. The Nazis stripped us of everything. So I came\nup with the idea to give a ration of bread for a day to him as a birthday present, and I told Zolton, and he\nliked the idea. So, in the evening, we held out our hands, said, \"Father, for you.\" He wouldn't think of\nit. He knew that bread, it means nourishment, it means life. We were starving. In fact we were on\nstarving ration and that was the idea, let them work as long as they can and then drop dead, and then\nthey're just going to take them away. We were not there really ever, ever to leave the concentration",
        "camp, any of us, none of us, but here's the bread, \"No way,\" he says, \"I'm not going to take it. You need\nthat little nourishment.\" But we ins--kept on insisting so finally, not wanting to hurt our feelings, he\naccepted the gift, and he said, \"Thank God that allowed me to live long enough to witness that gracious\nlove from my sons.\" It was like, like he would have sensed being his last day on earth. Next morning at\n5 o clock, we were already in line to go to the salt mines, but one prisoner was missing. After several\nrecounts, the prisoner was still missing. The Kapo sent him to the barrack to look for him. They found\na missing person sleeping in a corner, my father, so they dragged him in front of the SS, they picked\nhim up from the cover, and it was bitter winter, and he just had his, his underalls on, his uh practically\nnothing, and he was ordered to stand still or at attention, and then the Kapo went to the SS and was\nwhispering something, so when the SS turned to the and they asked the uh assembly and they said, \"I\nunderstand that that dirty Jewish dog has here two sons. I want them to step out of line and come next\nto him and see what his punishment going to be because he kept Germany from victory ten minutes,\nbecause that's how long it took to find him. Then he gave a hard swift kick to my father , and this\nsignaled the kapos to start it, the punishment. For every, every for every side, every corner, they started\nhitting him, kicking and beating him until he fell on the ground and Zolton and I begged, went on our\nknees, and went, begged the SS to s-to stop it and went and tried to grab the arm of the Kapos, then the,\nthe hitting and the beating and the whipping were on our backs. And they were beating my father until\nhe collapsed, and was so badly beaten he was unrecognizable. I started to chant the 22nd song. ---------\n-------------------, Oh God, my God, why hast thou forsaken us? So the beating finally stopped when my\nfather was motionless, except for his lips, and I saw that he was trying, trying to say something, and I\ncame close, and then I heard he was reciting the Shamah, the Declaration of the Faith of the Jew to God,\nand it says, \"----------------------------------------,\" Hear Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Then he\nbecame very silent. He didn't speak no more. He didn't move no more. We went, Zolton and I we went\noff to the salt mine. The first time in my life that I lost faith in God. I was born in an Orthodox family.\nMy father was a wonderful, wonderful human being, a very pious Jew. That he wouldn't harm a soul.\nIn fact, in the concentration camp, he kept people alive, really alive, the lots of them went and touched\nthe barbed wire to end, they couldn't stand it any longer, and he used to say, \"No, no, you'll see, like\nGod sent Moses to get the children of Israel out of Egypt, of our bondage, you'll see that he will send\nsomebody to free us, and in fact, to take us back to Aris Israel.\" That means go to our homeland, Israel,\nand it was like, like, like he foresaw that. Like uh it was a prediction or, or not a prediction it was a, a\nprophecy sort of, you know. Now that wonderful man, no more. And I said, if God allowed that to\nhappen, there is no God. If, if God allowed for, for him to be killed, then I don't believe anymore, and it\nthank God that it didn't last long because on the very same night, in my dream, my father appeared, and\nhe said, called me on my Hebrew name \"Yitzhok,\" he says, \"Don't ever lose your faith in God. God 1s\nreal. And you'll see that you will survive.\" What was, what was so strange to me that he said, \"You,\"\nsingular. He didn't say the plural, \"You,\" meant that you and Zolton will survive. He said, \"You will",
        "survive.\" Meanwhile, Zolton was so angry and so out of beside him uh what we witnessed that said uh,\nhe's going to go and spring a -------, grab this SS guards, or SS officers neck and he's going to choke\nhim to death. I said, \"You couldn't get two feet next to him, close to him. Not even two feet, you will\nbe shot.\" He says, \"No, I will do it. You'll see I will do it,\" and Zolton was even though he was not\nquite 16 years old, he was very, very strong, since what like some people practice God knows what all\nday long, he was muscle build up, bodybuilder, I mean it incredibly so, and he says, \"No, and I just go\nand I crush him to death because he killed our father.\" And I said, \"Zolton, I tell you something. A\nmiracle happened Zolton, my father appeared to me in my dream, and he said we should believe there is\na God, and we should never lose our faith 1n God because we going to survive.\" He said that. You\nknow our father, even in dream, said, he never said anything that wasn't so. So Zolton gave up the idea\nkilling because that would be killing himself right away. Now, not long after that in the beginning of\nApril, we were transferred at, from, from Copendorf to Dachau. The trip from Copendorf to Dachau\nwas the worst that I have ever accounted. On one occa-one instance, in one occasion the SS stopped the\ntrain, there were American fliers very, very low, they wanted to see what is the train because there\nalways cattle cars, you know. We were transported in cattle cars, we were so packed that I'm, I'm, I'm\ntelling you worse than when we went to, to Dachau, I mean to uh Auschwitz. The Dachau trip was the\nworst I have ever, ever experienced. We were, for instance, you couldn't even sit down. Once you sat,\nlike the same thing uh in Auschwitz, except in Ausch----------going to in Auschwitz, it was a little more,\nuh even if you didn't have uh no food and no water, but at least there was some more room that we\ncould move a little bit better, but here there was no way, and the worst was that if you tried to move,\nthen a bickering among uh prisoners themselves because they were trying and were shoving and\npushing and, and, and, and were hitting uh with, with the elbows among prisoners. So, what happened\nis the American fliers came low enough because they want to see the SS stop the train and took cover\nunder it and start shooting at the at the uh, uh airplane, at the pilot, fighter pilots. They shot back. The\nAmericans shot back, and the bullets would go through the top of the cattle car, unfortunately hitting\nquite a few of the prisoners, and one man who, who was standing, now you could not sit down\nanymore, and there was a three days trip. He was all of the sudden says, \"I am hit!\" And then slowly he\nwas going down and he landed on my foot. He was moaning, he was hurting terribly say, \"Shut up, shut\nup, don't, don't move, don't scream.\" So the next, about a few hours later, he died right on my foot, and\nin ----------I was trying to push him off, because it was terrible, my food got numb, and I couldn't feel\nanymore but it was so uncomfortable, and I tried to push him off, and the others wouldn't let. There\nwere j-just no room. There were absolutely none. So, when we finally arrived at Dachau, I was\noverwhelmed with happiness seeing from the other car, Zolton my brother also survived.",
        "We have to reload.",
        "Beep.",
        "Beep.",
        "Second sticks??",
        "After we arrived at Dachau, I knew if something wouldn't happen soon, I would not survive. I\ncould hardly walk, let alone do the chores or the work that I was required to do. For a second I'd\nlike to go back to my childhood. When I was 4 years old, I got lost in a forest. My governess took\nus, took, we went for a walk, and we landed in the forest, and she sat down, after a while we got\ntired, and she said, later that she fell asleep, and when she woke up, I was nowhere to be found. I\nwas wandering around and hopelessly lost, I started crying, and a little gypsy woman, a young\ngypsy woman I should say, was picking mushrooms, flowers, heard my cry and took me into their\nGypsy camp, and that, this the first time in my life that I heard violin music, and it was beautiful.\nThey could make it sound like a bird, chirp like a bird. They could play fast, they could play sweet,\nslow, I , I was just ----------. So, later on when finally I was home, I said to my parents, \"I want\nthis,\" and I mean---------the violin, \"I want that, I want this.\" After about, I was four years old, as I\nmentioned, but a year later, when I was five, then finally they gave in since uh every single day I\nwas pestering them for, for that violin, and I start formally taking lessons. When I was ten I gave a\nconcert, it was my first debut, uh in --------------. And, when I was 13, I finished conservatory,\nwhich the diploma is right there, so it seems like my uh career was really well-established to go on\ntour, and uh, something high??? However, a man named Hitler, thought it differently. Now, here\nI am in Dachau, and I was just praying God, \"If you're not going to help me, I'm not going to\nsurvive.\" And at night, one night thereafter, an SS came to the barrack holding a violin up, and\nsaying, announcing, \"Who can play the violin to come to the front room, and if I like you the\nplaying, I'm going to give food and water.\" When you mentioned food, we would do anything, and\nwater, I mean anything. We couldn't think, talk, we dreamt about food. Nothing I could uh we had\nbut food, food, food. So hungry. So, I eagerly volunteered, and so did two others. So we went to\nthe front room where three Kapos, the SS and the barrack doctor were waiting. The violin was\nhanded to the older one, it's about a 40 years old man, who tuned it, and the first few notes were\nshaky because he hadn't played the violin uh about a year or so like myself, but thereafter, he\nstarted to play the Zircon, Da Zarcon? One of the Sonatas. So beautiful, I had never heard\nanything like that in my life, and I thought what am I doing here? I mean this is, the man is going\nto get the food. The SS grimaced. He didn't like it, and signaled the Kapo. One Kapo went, took\nthe violin away from this wonderful violinist. The other one picked up an iron pipe and went\nbehind this wonderful man, and he hit him so hard, that he cracked his skull open. Blood and brain",
        "was splattered all over the floor. I got terribly scared. I\u2019ve seen death around me but never nothing\nlike that, and immediately I realized like in the past, they don't want really playing, they did not\nwant that violin music, they just the way, that's a joke. Now we kill another one, and we having\nfun by that. So now the violin was handed to the next man who was about 25, and he was so scared\nthat he couldn't play a straight note. He was standing there shivering, and, and, and, and (plays\nquivering violin simultaneously) just going like that. I never found out if he could or could not\nplay. Well the SS was terribly angry. He says, \"You said, you come out, how do you dare come\nout, and say that you can play? And you expect me to give you food for this?\" They started\nkicking him and, and they were beating him to death. Now was my turn. When I came out of the\nbarrack, I was intending if I have a chance to play, I'm going to play a Sonata by ----------- or one of\nthose encore pieces, beautiful pieces by ---------------, after all, I was classically trained. But I was\nscared stiff. My mind went blank. When I got to him, I said, \"My God, my God, how does the\nSonatina start? How does Fitz ---------piece start? How does anything start?\" And I noticed that\nthe murder Kapo went for his pipe again. Was picking up and picked up his pipe and was walking\ntoward me. Every nerve in my body was concentrating on the blow that I'm going to get killed\nnow. And I was standing there about maybe few seconds, maybe five maybe ten, motionless, and\nthen, incredibly, my right hand and my left hand started to move in perfect harmony, and this what\ncame out of the violin. Plays. Beautiful -----------. Everybody looked at the SS, and the, the Kapo\nwith the iron pipe waiting and waiting for the sign, \"When shall I hit him?\" And the Kapo was\nsinging and humming the melody, and he was tapping his fingers uh at the at the table which like it\nwas ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, so hitting the rhythm, and said, \"Let him live.\" So really honestly I got\nfood, but I was so terribly overtaken by what I've noticed, what I've witnessed that I couldn't eat it.\nSo, but they let me live. The Kapo picked up his, up his guitar and accompanied me, and that gave\nthe SS an idea. So, that wasn't the only time that I played for them. We had to go and entertain the\nSS. And after that specific debut which I did in the front room, I could play anything, it was okay.\nI could play anything, but when the SS got tired of, of our playing, our Kapo came along and\naccompanied me on the guitar. Then they played differently. He says, this is ---------, this is\nenough. So there we have to stand next to a brick wall, all of us, the Kapo also, and they were\nshooting at us, there was, I have to, I have to say the truth that it was accident shots. They were\nmissing, they were aiming at uh my head for instance, right between my eyes, aiming, and at the\nlast second, a little move, and the bullet went above my head, or side of me, and sometimes it came\nso close that I could f--I could feel the wind of the of the bullet. If somebody didn't, didn't have\nthat they don't know what I'm talking about. You know? And every single time almost, was\npraying, I said, \"God please, let him kill me because it's too much, it's just ten, fifteen, shooting at\nyou, and I, at the end, I looked like a, a bloody mess because from the brick uh wall, little brick,\nchunk of bricks it would sometimes hit me and they would cut me, but he never, never touched a",
        "bullet---------------until later. I have to tell you that, it was very, there was, again, I use the word\n\"debut,\" in quotation, and that night there was the back doctor, a French man, who heard me and he\nwas drawn to me immediately because he had a son about the same age as I, and was very talented,\nand studied the violin, but Mengele thought he was too young to live. Mengele did not pass him in\nAuschwitz. So, he was also in Auschwitz, and wound up in Dachau like myself, and but not at the\nsame time as I was. He was already there, that uh doctor. And uh, he said, \"When we're going to\nget liberated, I take you and you're going, I take you home, and I'm going to make your dream\ncome true, you're going to be a great violinist, I'm going to take care of you, and in fact, you're\ngoing to be my son.\"\nWe have to reload.\nBeep.\nOne day the SS came to our barrack and said, \"Jews, Poles, Germans, any prisoners, out of the\nbarrack. And Russians too. We're going to be evacuated.\" The Americans are close and they did\nnot want us to fall in the Americans' hand. So, the barrack doctor would come and he said, \" The\nbarrack doctor is there and he is going to determine who is going to walk, who 1s able to walk, who\nwill walk.\" It's the very famous death march, by the way, \"And uh the others going to be put on\ncattle cars or on the train.\" And we're going to be evacuated, we're going to Tyrol. However, the\ntruth was that we were taken, we were taken into a forest nearby, and the barrack doctor was also\nbrought just to camouflage the whole things so that we're not going to find out really why we've\nbeen tak--taken in the forest. We were taken out of the barrack in fact. Now, he knew, and he was\nhelping people to get organized would in a horizontal line, and the machine guns were hidden from\nour, our view ready to fire. And then all of the sudden he said to me, turned to me, this doctor, he\nsays, \"Alex, Alex, run, run!\" And I then realized that it was no evacuation, it is the end. And I ran\nright into the forest for cover, and as I was running again chanting the Shamah Israel, uh the\nShamah is Declaration of Faith of the Jew, something terribly hot entered my chest. And then I had\ndifficulty breathing and I fell, and I was on the ground and I saw that blood was going, falling\ndown on my body, and the doctor noticed the same thing, and I did not hear a shot. In other words,\nI did not hear the sound of the shot. I just heard something hit me and, and I was bloody, blood\nflowing, but I, I did not hear the shot, and then I had difficulty breathing. The doctor came right,\nright away ran toward me and he sort of on one knee down on the floor and took my pulse and, and\nSS guard was running right behind him with drawn revolver aiming to my head, and the this\nwonderful French doctor sort of turned back to him and he says, \"Don't shoot. Trois minutes--\nkaput. Don't shoot, in three minutes he'll be dead.\" So the SS turned to the doctor and says, \"Let",
        "this dirty Jewish dog suffer for 3 minutes because he's not worth the cost of another bullet. So he\nwent and signaled another one of his compatriots, and they started the shooting. And the machine\nguns, that day, were something like 17,000 killed. Machine gun. Of course, they started the day\nbefore I'm sure, or or two, but we didn't know about it, and when uh, the trucks came, and the\nbodies were thrown on the truck and carried back to the camp, uh to, to be uh cremated or thrown\nin the ditch. The doctor gave order that the, his French prisoners were the one who have, no they\nwere the Zonder Commando, and he told them that when they take the, pick me up and put \u2018em on\nthe, throw me on the top of the bodies. And I don't know anything about it, I was unconscious, but\nyou can see how many death or dead bodies were among them because I was just wounded.\nMortally wounded, but I wounded, I was not dead. Meanwhile, we were supposed to be thrown in\nthe ditch or be cremated, but as I said, he, when we arrived in the back to the uh to the uh camp,\nthey took me off of these bodies, and took me into a French barrack, and then he changed the\ninsignia of a Jew to a Frenchman, to a French origin. He had tweezer or pocket knife. He fished\nthe bullet out of my chest without any anesthetic, and next day, a wonderful Americans liberated\nDachau, and the first thing what we did, they were uh, with their attention, the American's attention\ncalled on the very sick ones and the mortally wounded ones or wounded ones, and this is how\nsomebody called the attention on me to the Americans, and they took me immediately to a hospital\nuh in Dachau right away, is there Dachau first, and they attended to me so I was told later that the\ndoctors found very definitely that I will not survive because I had --------------, I had blood\npoisoning, and I had typhoid fever, among other thing that were, plus being malnutritioned, and\nfrozen feet.",
        "Now I want to ask you a couple of questions. Can you tell me how much mental or spiritual\nresistance played a role do you feel in the camps, not just for you but for others around you? Was\nit important?\nI would say spiritual, my uh, uh, my opinion about it, did not play a lot of role because once we got\nin and we were coming down, lower, uh lower than animal, there was no more, no more any\nspiritual uh, most people did not believe anymore in God, and the very, very religious ones like my\nfather uh who did, and there were not that many who really believed. In other words, it was not,\nyou could say that the spiritual uh feelings what dominated uh the camp, not at all, this 1s my f-\nfindings and my opinion. In fact, so much so that a lot of people went or wanted to commit suicide\nby ------------. And the only reason they could not do that because of the mass suicide happened at\nAuschwitz, then later at Dachau which I experienced, were stopped by the SS, in a very stupid way,\nmay I say it since they said, \"If anybody comes three feet near to the barbed wire, they're gonna\nshoot him.\" I mean this is almost ridiculous because this is what you wanted, except you didn't\nwanted to, to die with blood flowing but you just touch it and then electrocuted. It's a better way\nthan being shot to death. And really honestly, it happened even if you just accidentally got three\nfeet or, or a little bit beyond that the, the SS from there, from their tower, would always the\nmachine gun was aimed out into, into the camp, they would shoot you so that the mass suicide\nstopped, but not because uh they were spiritual and, and they believed in, in something that they\nshould have believed in, you know?\nWhat about other physical resistance other than the sand in the rockets? Were there other times\nwhere you know of sabotage?\nUh, there were I'm sure uh many, now for instance we found out that the, the lager fuehrer which\nmeans the uh the elder, there was one who is equivalent to the kapo, but he was already there for\nGod knows how many years, and he was made by the SS, the head of the entire barrack. One\nperson, the head of the entire barrack then the one that we had as I understood, he was a double\nagent. A spy for the Americans, and, and secretly he was sending messages. Now I found that one\nout, out after liberation. However this one interesting uh note about Dachau, in spite of all that it\nwas my experience being shot and all this, I don't know 17,000 something killed, and there were\nstill several thousand left in the camp, which the Dachau, the camp Dachau was mined. Nobody\nknew that. And the only reason that the Americans liberated Dachau when they did instead of\ndoing it two or three days later because again an SS uh Guard or Officer, who was also a double\nagent, through the darkness during the night, went over the, the American line and throw that next",
        "very next day and I don't know the hour, the very next day, the entire Dachau is going to be mined,\nit was blown up. And not one of the prisoners is going to stay alive. So, the Americans came\nbefore that could have happened. Saved many, many lives. That was not known to many, and I\ncannot tell you, not because it's a secret, and I cannot tell you just how I found out, but I found out\nfrom a source, which very reliable.\nWe have to reload.\nBeep.\nI want to ask you about support systems. You had a family for a long time with you that helped\nyou in the camps. Did you see a lot of other people who had friends who helped them or, or did\nyou see the opposite? Was there, were ethics abandoned?\nWhat, you talking about a family meaning my brother and, and...\nAnd your father.\nYeah. Okay, I'll answer truthfully. There was a lot, very unfortunate what I seen in the camp\namong prisoners. They were instances when instead of some giving present as we did to our father,\nand giving up a piece of bread, which was, that was your ration, and we're talking about a piece of\nbread, I'm talking about it, was a little bit of size you know. Uh, they were stealing from each\nother, and there were unfortunately uh sons who turned against father or father against son, so that\nthey can survive. At that point, not everybody, but I have seen quite a few, that they turned against\neach other and they were really, as I mentioned earlier, they were animal, they became animalistic.\nIt was incredible. No matter how low we got, meaning me, uh and my, my brother plus of course\nfather, and also others, they would not do that, and I have seen it done, yes.\nI want you to tell me about age again. I want you to tell me how there was a selection in\nAuschwitz. Who was selected as if I don't know anything about it. And I want you to do the story\nof you coming up in the line with Mengele, again as though you haven't told me before, just do it\nfresh again. So maybe you want to do the whole selection of your family again just coming off the\ntrain. Give a good picture of how the selection was done.\nWell, when we, when we uh, the doors were opened and we had, we were ordered out, then, as I\nmentioned earlier, head prisoners called Kapos which were rushing toward us, and start hitting,",
        "kicking, beating, and the SS would hit us ----------faster, and stand in line, man in one, and women\nand small children in the other. And, after we lined up, I noticed a high-ranking SS officer, in fact,\nwhat I noticed he was a having a monocle and peering through that at us, peering at us with this\nmonocle, and that was the infamous Dr. Josef Mengele. The Angel of Death, so-called Angel of\nDeath, who decided our fate. Either you get immediately to the gas chamber or you had to stay\nand, and, and feel the pain of being alive. It was uh lingering torture --------------. And as I\nmentioned also that he had a stick in his hand which I identified as a baton, and he was like a\nconductor, conducting the people that they had to file by and, to the right and to the left. First was,\nfirst were in our family, my mother and uh younger sister, Goldie, her real name in Hungarian was\nOronco. And they were sent to one side, to the left. Violet was the next. She was 18. Oronco was\n9. She was sent to the opposite side to the right. That was followed by Zolton, and of course my\nfather and Zolton, they were also sent to the same side as Violet, whose real name in Hungarian is\nIboya, which means Viollet if you translate it into English. Then came my turn, and as I was, I was\nwalking, was almost by Mengele when he gestured to me to stop, and then turn to me, very sweet\nvoice, like a father, \"Tell me, little boy, how old are you?\" I said, \"I'm 16, and I have the proof.\"\nAnd he looked at me, I'm sure he didn't believe me. In fact he had a sneer, sort of a smile on his\nface, which later I identified or at least uh saying that maybe he said to himself, \"You're going to be\nsorry that you lied to me because death in a gas chamber will be easier than what you're going to go\nthrough,\" but nevertheless, he did motion me toward the group where my he ----------- my father\nand brother. When the selections were over, my mother, my younger sister and the group they\nwere in, they were led away. That was a time that I didn't know that I will never, never see them\nagain. They were, were taken directly to the gas chamber. They were actually taken to a, as I\nmentioned, there was building which, building there that lettering, 'Bade', Bath. And then, then\nthey were issued a towel and a bar of soap, and telling...",
        "That's, we got that part before. When you think back on all those things, tell me the things you\nremember from your senses. Sounds or smells or things like that that you that stick out in your\nmemory.",
        "Believe it or not, here sometimes, when I go by where, where the building streets, and those are the\nthat category of , what do you call this in English by that, it's, it's, it's tar I think, they're laying the\ntar down, the smell of the tar brings back awful memories to me because those tars we were\nworking on building also roads. Certain sounds, if you want me to uh tell you what kind of a\nsound, sometimes, I don't even realize why all of the sudden I just feel that I am, I am cornered, I\nam like the animals, it's, it's no, no way out, and then I realize that that's something triggered --------\n----In me, that what I saw in the concentration camp. And the worst thing probably is the",
        "occasional dreams that that my family appears and not in a favorable position. I see picking up my\nmother, although I did not pick up my mother, but picking up my mother and my little sister and\nputting on the cart, and carting to the crematorium, and I would like you to know that I never never,\nnever spoken to anyone about this, I I'm speaking about that. Do you know why I'm speaking\nabout this now? Because, I believe there's so many things that one locked in. Maybe if I speak\nabout it, I will be cured of these reoccurring dreams. And lately thank God, it's not coming back\nthat often as they used to, but it still does and then Sherry, who is sleeps right next to me, goes, she\nwill wake me up, and she knows, she does not ask me, \"What kind of a dream did you have?\" She\njust wakes me up and she knows. It was a bad dream going back to Auschwitz and Dachau.\nActually I was in four camps. Started with Auschwitz, France, Copendorf, and now, then Dachau.\nPeople like to believe in humankind, and to believe in heroism. How do you feel about that after\nwhat you lived through?\nWell, I will tell you one thing. I have to, of course, it's very personal. When I arrived and I uh, to\nCleveland as I mentioned and got to go with this uh, uh --------------. He finding out what I have\ndone was certainly not short of heroism, that what I was filling sands in capsules that I, that I know,\nwhich I already told you, there was ten, however since then, accidentally, one in a million again, I\nfound another fighter pilot who was saved, who was shot by one of these shells, one of these\nrockets and escaped certain death. But, he this Bank Director wanted to make me into a hero. He\nwanted to get the newspapers, in fact, the only thing what I accepted was an invitation to his son to\nmeet personally, and his family, and we had a dinner, but he wanted to alert the newspapers and all\nthis, I said, \"No. I did not do it for being a hero, for heroism, uh to take advantage of, maybe my\ncareer would go faster. I believe in something, and I was ready to give my life for that.\"\nWe have to reload.\nChanging film, Camera roll 8 is going up; Sync take 10 is up.\nBeep.\nOkay, so tell me why you risked your life and committed sabotage.\nWell, all honestly, I didn't believe that we would ever get out of there. Down deep in my\nsubconscious, maybe, I was hoping yes. Believe, no. And when he said, \"Will you give up your\nlife?\" that that really meant for me that I'm going to die because I didn't believe that we could get",
        "away with it, but since it wasn't only that conversation between me and the this captain, the French\ncaptain. It were much more that we talked, not uh we couldn't sit talk uh like I'm talking to you\nbecause there were SS guards around it, and they would not like prisoners to converse. However,\nhere and there we would, uh we could say a few words to each other. Uh, I really did not believe\nand I thought, if that helps, if just one person helps then Hitler did not uh get what he really wanted,\nto, to annihilate all the Jews, to kill all the Jews, or destroy the world. I was taken from home, a\nbeautiful home, meaning home life, not as a building I'm speaking of. Very orthodox family. Very\nclose-knit family. And, what I have seen over there and going to, I figured sooner or later I must\nmeet my death because I just couldn\u2019t go on dodging the, the bullets so to speak ---------------. I\nwas not picked and there I was not picked, and then one, one of these picking and innocently, the\npeople that they were around that managed the ammunition factory were taken at random. It was\n30 people, they were not saboteurs at all. I was a saboteur, the captain was saboteur, and somebody\nelse saboteur, and another thing, but they were not bad. If they were around anyone in the uh in\nCopendorf, which was the Salt Mine in Yom Kippur, I didn't cut the wire. It's only one man did it,\nbut he was from our group. Half of these people were picked and shot to death, and the other half\nwere beaten or, or almost to death, you know, so, how could I, how could I believe that I would be\nsurviving. In spite of all the with my father who was a very strong force, and I still feel his even,\neven beyond the grave, believe it or not, I still feel his, his force on me, but he told me, I still trying,\nand I wish to God I could be half what he was, but at least started to fashion my life according what\nhe, how he lived. Of course, I'm not speaking of keeping kosher, which we're not, but all the other\ndecent and good things what he did, and there was one decent thing to do: sabotage.

        "Well, the, I must uh very briefly say that uh, the Symphony of the Holocaust, the melodies came to\nme while in, in Con-Concentration Camp, and here is another thing that probably helped survive\nbes-beside God's will. Because when I got, they had this, this -------------, that terrible ------------,\nthat I was about to touch the uh barbed wire, I would say to myself first, \"Why don't you, why don't\nyou just \"play,\" (in quotation) meaning play, goes through in your head.
