        "Q: --when you were younger? Did you play with, did you have lots of Jewish friends\nand also gentile friends?",
        "A: Mostly it was Jewish friends. As a matter of fact, we are here like six or seven\nboys and one girl which we went together to school. Which they survived, a lot\nof them did not survive. That girl, right, she\u2019s a grandmother, she lives in New\nJersey. A few boys here, old friends, which we went together to cheder. We went\nfrom the first to the seventh class, we are together. I have a friend here, not far\nfrom here and we meet together. We have our -- everyone, that\u2019s since 1900\u2019s\nthat emigrated here, they made societies, like our society, the Krasnik Society,\nwhich we meet every month and we do in charity everything and so on between\nus and for Israel and in general. Now, for instance, in the wintertime we don\u2019t\n2\nhave because we all older people, so they are in Florida here and there. March,\nwe Start again, which we used to meet in Manhattan. Now, most live in Brooklyn\nSO we meet here in Heights Congregation. We make a party once a while;\nwe have our own cemetery and so on. That\u2019s almost every hometown has but a\nlot, like the youth, don\u2019t go in so they give up. Which I\u2019m trying now to take in\nmy kids to it. Of course we had friends; we played together, we went to school\ntogether, yes, yes. Other than Jewish friends, very little. I especially had a few\nbecause, as I said, we lived in a street, one side was Jews and one side was non-\nJews. But mostly like the little towns, most of 1t populated from the Jews. Like\nthe surroundings around, like the farmers and this, they lived around the town.\nThey called it in Jewish the shtetl.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I would say a big city for us a Lublin, that was different. But the little towns\nwhere I come from, that was --. The few Jews lived in the city and the\nsurrounding around lived the non-Jews but we went together to school and\neverything. Naturally, the public school, not the cheder. The cheder, Jews. It\nwas like a ghetto life. That time we didn\u2019t realize now. Now we realized, we live\nin a big city, all kinds of nationalities, we realized that it\u2019s a different life. But\nthose days, was that kind of life.",
        "Q: Do you remember any instances of anti-Semitism?",
        "A: Oh, yes, plenty.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about some of those?",
        "A: See here two bones? That\u2019s still a memory. When it came, not that I\u2019m going to\nbe prejudiced whatsoever but I have to talk out the way it was then.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: Yes. Like for instance, here we celebrate a Christmas altogether nice whether you\nbelieve or not, we celebrate together. I lived with neighbors, Italian; I am Jewish.\nIt\u2019s Hanukkah, I put out the candles; they put out whatever it is. It\u2019s mutual. But\nthere it wasn\u2019t unfortunately. I have to say the way it is whether you\u2019re Christian,\nwhether you\u2019re believer or not. You do this, to say as it was. Very anti-Semitic.\nThe Polaks, very stupid. They only know one thing. We Jews killed our God!\nThat\u2019s what they knew. For instance, it came, let\u2019s say twice a year you have for\ntwo or three weeks, a holiday from the school. Once a year, vacation, two\nmonths. Let\u2019s say that twice a year like Christmas time or Easter, right? The two\nholidays is about Jesus Christ -- I wouldn\u2019t say us Jews. We knew a little bit\nmore those days what\u2019s with Jesus and what\u2019s the story. They didn\u2019t know\nnothing; they only knew one thing. You killed our God! If he is a god, how can\nyou kill him? Alright, now I am different than I was then. Tough on Judaism\n3\nalso. Because I know more the reality; I am more educated and so on and so on.\nThat time I was Jew 100%. Now I\u2019m born Jew, I am Jew but I\u2019m different. Not\nagreeing with everything -- so going, let\u2019s say it was the Christmas holiday, the\nlast day of the holiday, the last day in school before the holiday. Then the action\nfor two, three weeks. They came with strings and to the string attached weights,\nlike a kilo weight, a half a kilo weight and that\u2019s the way. They knew that they\nwere going out from the school. If it happened during the day, I go to the teacher\nand I put a report, something happens. Not too much, but something. But this\ntime he knows in the afternoon, he\u2019s out from the school for three weeks -- kill\nthat Jew, hit that Jew. So that\u2019s the way they were hitting. You came home\nbloodied, with blood, with faces like this. You killed our God! That was the only\nthing. That was Christmas time. It came ---.",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: It came before Easter, I remember, like today, when you went to school, how far\nwas it? A mile? You went through the main street like they call it here Kasioska,\nthere was the movie. As a matter of fact, from the movie was a Jew. At that time\nwasn\u2019t movies like today. There was outside all the pictures what the movie 1s.\nThe movie was calling G___. Now, why, it\u2019s not Polish, maybe it was ---. That\nwas all the story when Christ raises and so on and so on.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: When you pass there, it\u2019s the same thing, it\u2019s the same thing. Anti-Semitism was\nvery big. Let\u2019s say Saturday afternoon, we were juvenile boys, we went out for a\nwalk in the main street. As I said, the whole shtetl was Jews. Around -- so\nPolaks when they came out. Unfortunately it happened to me this week\nI told you. When they came out, we were walking. Oh, you Jew! Bang! It\nhappened to me this week, almost the same thing. Where I work on Seventh\nAvenue between 38\" and 37\" Street. I leave work at a quarter to six. You go out,\nit\u2019s a big traffic of people. I have to go this way to 42\u2122 Street station but people,\nthey going en masse to the station, to the Penn station. One young fellow,\ntaller than you -- it was raining. Alright, a short fellow like me with the umbrella,\nmaybe I didn\u2019t have it down, the umbrella. Alright, while walking you walk this\nway, this walk that way. But one tall guy, a young fellow came towards me and\nlike this with his rear almost to my face. What\u2019s the memory? I shouldn\u2019t say\nwhat. You son-of-a-bitch \u2014 he could have gone and killed me. I was sorry after\nwhat I said but it remind me of the years in Poland. But alright, sometimes, as I\nsaid, you said excuse me, he didn\u2019t, alright. But this, a young fellow, so it remind\nme of this. Of course, there was anti-Semitic and so on and so on but I wouldn\u2019t\nlet them think you heard, you Jew, you Jew. You killed our God, you Jew killed\nour God. I loved the school, I was going to the school. I loved it, I wanted to go\nfurther whether I could afford or not. But unfortunately, the anti-Semitism was\nvery big. We had in our hometown, we had the gymnasium. It\u2019s like here,\n4\ncollege. Here gymnasium 1s like for the . But very seldom a Jew could go\nin, even if he could pay.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yes, anti-Semitism was very, very big. A Jew couldn\u2019t get too much of it. They\nsay it is -- they say -- he couldn\u2019t get to a higher -- no. They felt it in the school,\non the street; they felt it all over, all over. The Germans, they knew where to\nmake the crematoriums. They didn\u2019t make too many in Czechoslovakia, different\npeople. Same Catholics, different. But in Poland, all the crematoriums, all the\ncamps were in Poland. I was in the camp in the beginning, near our hometown. I\ndidn\u2019t have to run away. I could have walked away but where? You walk away\nand the Polak will give you for a kilo , for two pounds of sugar. If not for\nhim, I would run, always on the run. He didn\u2019t let me. The last three months we\nwere not together. This because they separated us whatever. But whenever I\nwanted to go, run --. One year we were on the camp near our hometown. I was\ngoing out from the camp. I was that time, I was a bricklayer. Bricklayer,\ncememting, this and that. You were looking for places that you should be inside.\nBecause fighting with hunger is one fight but fighting with the weather and the\ncold, two fights was way too hard. You were looking for \u2014 but looking; it\u2019s not\nyou\u2019re given application. But I ws a young fellow, I don\u2019t know. They tell me\nthat I am smart and this and that. Fine, inside, going out for sand, for this. Let\u2019s\nsay a village nearby and going out for lime, to dig lime, I could have gone away.\nThat was in 1942, I had no guards over me. Only me and the polka with the horse\nand carriage. All of a sudden I hear a voice. What is the voice? Hey you, boy-\nfellow, how can I get into the camp? I saw he\u2019s a Jew. I says, who are you? He\ntells me the name. In the villages, very few Jews lived. The ones who lived, you\nknew his name even if you didn\u2019t know him. I am Zalek Division he said. I look\nat him. Why do you want to go into the camp? I haven\u2019t got place where to go. I\ngave them away everything \u2014 all mine whatever, gone. I don\u2019t want to hear. I\nhaven\u2019t got where to go. I\u2019m sick and tired already. What\u2019ll happen, will happen,\nwhat we were told will be with me. I says don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not so easy to get in\nbecause you got all -- they counting you, you come in, they counting you. It was\nnot a question to run away. The question was, where will I hide? I see the\nGerman, the uniform, I run away from him. But I see a Polak, do I know which\none is good and which one is no good? But I still wanted to run away. But he\ndidn\u2019t let me. He was then -- he like 24 years difference from me. I was a young\nboy, 18, 19 years. Run, no. Besides this, if you going to run away, they take the\nnext ten and they kill. Especially first was the family, it\u2019s the same name, you\ncan\u2019t deny. So that was the story. We suffered in this hometown -- it was four\nkilometers from the hometown. When we got to work they came for this work\nwith a horse and carriage to give a day\u2019s duty, performance, whatever. What did\nthey do for us? They didn\u2019t have to do, just look away. yes, you gave them the\ngood shirt from your body, they gave you a kilo bread. But we knew, for two\npounds of sugar, the Germans gave a proclamation: If you bring one Jew a\n5\nfamily, two pounds of sugar, they did it. Isn\u2019t that a shame? Don\u2019t do for me\ngood but don\u2019t do it for me either.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit about when the Germans first got to your ---, when the\nwar started and the Germans first come to your town?",
        "A: Well, the war started September the 1\u2018. Naturally, as the war is, bombs with\neverything, whatever. I didn\u2019t understand too much. I didn\u2019t know too much.\nTwo weeks later, the Germans came into our hometown. It happened, it was the\nfirst, or the second day of Rosh Hashanah, the New Year\u2019s. Of course, we didn\u2019t\nbelieve it or not in the synagogue. It\u2019s not like the big town, every corner you had\na synagogue. In the little towns, I don\u2019t know how it was in the big towns, the\nlittle town was a shul and a basm . That means one is the synagogue and\none is like other than a synagogue. Let\u2019s say the synagogue every Saturday, the\nbasm____ was for every day, day and night, even to go in for a whole night, if\nyou were cold, to warm up. So it\u2019s Rosh Hashanah, New Year\u2019s. Before New\nYear\u2019s people like leaders grabbed the scrolls, the Torah, which you probably\nknow, the scroll and they brought them. Let\u2019s say, this one brought to his house\nand around the neighbors, we prayed there. Was the first day or the second day of\nRosh Hashanah, we heard, of course, shooting and this and that. A week before,\nit was bombs, which people got killed already, in front of me. One woman got\nkilled -- I run out with a cover to cover her and so on. The second day they came\nin so naturally, we all start praying, we were afraid. After the Germans start to go\naround, nothing will happen, everything is quiet, we should go out on the street\nnormal. About two, three days later started the feelings of the German. First they\ntook -- in Polish they call it , hostages. Let\u2019s say this one 1s a rich one, they\nwent into the magistrate, to the - and they got through the big Jews. They\ntook this one, they took this one, they took this one. One they killed right away to\nshow us what\u2019s all about it if we don\u2019t -- if we revolt against them or what. It\nstarted, they were there. Naturally -- and we didn\u2019t know. Now we know what\nthe politics was between Stalin and Hitler. They made some kind of --.",
        "Q: Pact?",
        "A: Pact. We didn\u2019t know that. All of a sudden, we hear the Russians are a couple of\nkilometers from our town. The next day they came in a patrol; with a tank and the\nschool square where I went to school. We all around to look; everybody looked.\nThe Germans were laying down looking at the tank and so on. I didn\u2019t\nunderstand Russian but it\u2019s almost similar. All the people understood. They said\nlike they are twenty kilometers from us. It\u2019s more possibility that they\u2019re going to\nturn back till the Bok, the River. That\u2019s what happened, they turned back. A lot\nof people in those towns where they were, not far from us, they went along with\nthem.",
        "Q: They went with the Russians?\n6",
        "A: Yeah. Youth, mostly youth.",
        "Q: Did you think about doing that?",
        "A: That\u2019s what I want to bring out. My grandmother, she was my mother, she\nbrought me up. She ways to me, Avul that means my name, Avul |\nrun, run. I said how can I leave you. The grandfather was laying in bed\nparalyzed. He couldn\u2019t move, he couldn\u2019t talk. It was naturally, seven years\nalready. The only one because he and me, we were 1n the town. But he was a\nbusinessman with his wife and children and I was near my grandmother. So\nnobody understood it, only me. For instance, they bombed before they came in. I\ntook him on my back, as little as I was, and I dragged him to a cellar whatever.\nHe says I don\u2019t want to live no more. So nobody understood him, that\u2019s enough\nfor me. My grandmother says, go run. I says, where I\u2019m going to run? Leave\nyou with the sick grandfather? No. Those days wasn\u2019t like today but I am today\nin this respect, I am today ess in this respect, no time old fashioned like.\nI\u2019m American, I\u2019m modernized but in this respect, I don\u2019t want my pleasure I\nwant my family to give . So I says no, that\u2019s all there is to it. After he run\naway with his wife and children to a village, people were running even before\nthey came in. How could I, I wouldn\u2019t go nowhere. Then it started with the\nGermans. They were there -- people ran, people came back. Naturally youth\npeople. I had friends, people came back; they got stuck. They couldn\u2019t go back,\nthey went to concentration camps. They started, every day, you have to go work.",
        "Q: What kind of work were they making people do?",
        "A: All kind of work.",
        "Q: Anything?",
        "A: Even, God forbid, it was a bad winter with snow. The fellows they came with\nhorse and carriages to the town, they were laughing like this. Hey Jew, hey Jews,\nyou cleaning for us. Like this, all standing in the road, that was the memory it\nwas. It was plenty snow; God gave us also plenty . Poland had also a pact\nwith Hitler and Stalin. Besides this, they found a lot of work. The minute they\ncame in, our hometown was an industrialized city. It was like in central Poland.\nMy grandmother told me in the other war, they came in and they got out. So they,\nthe Polaks, were building ammunition places and so on and so on. Lately they\nfound it out that mostly the architects and everything, they were Germans and it\nwas everything and they made big places around the city. There they took us to\nwork. What was then to do? The Polaks, the farmers, they had to bring in the\ntags like. What was the tags? The grain and so on and so on. We were working\nthere, shipping there on the wagons, it was all kinds of work to do. There was a\nbig \u2014 then the Germans started there to make, they figure out already that they\u2019re\ngoing to go in war with Russia. Now we know it. All of a sudden, there was a\nvalley which it was filled from the Polaks. They took it away and they started to\n7\nbuild a -- in German, they call it . What does it mean? That means\ngasolines, with oils, with everything towards the war. On the ground, they took\nus, we had to go every day from the house to work which the Judenrat -- probably\nyou heard of the Judenrat -- they send you -- every day off to work. If you didn\u2019t\ngo, they came for you with the Jewish police and they arrested you. Let\u2019s say if I\ndidn\u2019t have a few days\u2019 work for me, I went out on the square there; you came\nalong, you gave me ten zlotys, I work for you. First I look to who has. Every day\nI was at work. Whether voluntarily or not, being home, they going to catch me\njust the same. I needed a couple zlotys to make a living. In the meantime, you\nwere at work, the Polaks brought in potatoes and all kinds of vegetables.",
        "Q: You'd steal them, yeah?",
        "A: You steal something, you brought home and the grandmother cooked it and so on\nand so on. You worked there and we built a top that thing also. The rail was\ngoing and the by the Polaks and they did that. Enough so that half a year\nlater, they started the war so everything was from us. The first station to send\nthem the work. Then they make a hanger , It\u2019s a big \u2014 airplanes, they\nstarted. We didn\u2019t make them but we fixed them and everything and so on. Like\nin 1943, was the first aus ____s means to send away the people. They knocked it -\n- yes, before that, in spring, all of a sudden, that was \u00b043, in the middle of the\nnight, they came and says from Lublin to the Judenrat and they told them what\nthey want them to do. We didn\u2019t know. They knocked at every door, every\nJewish door, the Judenrat, the Jewish police, had to show them which is a Jewish\nhome. They knocked on every door and they kicked them out on the square, on\nthe school place there with Germans and Jewish police, Polish police around, to\nwatch them who they took out. I lived in that house, as I said, on the other side\nwas Polak. My grandfather died already. He died right in \u201940 which now, next\nmonth is the anniversary, 50 year, in 1940. He says 52. I, with the grandmother\nin our house. He lived at the end of the street with his in-laws. There was he and\nhis wife, three children. There was a brother-in-law. He came back from\nBrussels in \u00b038. Three years he couldn\u2019t stay, the war goes, he came back. When\nhe came back from Marseille till German -- he had to go by train -- when he saw\neverything, he said, give me a little boat and I go back already. He saw\neverything. Him and his son and his wife, and another brother-in-law with a son,\nthey all took out. There was the that saved him, from seven o\u2019clock\nuntil six in the morning. Six o\u2019clock in the morning, they knocking on our door.\nMy grandmother said, you don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll go to the door. You hide under the bed.\nShe yells out, who is it, who is 1t? She says, mother-in-law in Jewish, schiga, it\u2019s\nLiah, open up. She\u2019s crying. She opens up, she comes in and cries. They took\naway everybody from their house, except the women, except her with the\nchildren. The sister, the son they took and the mother. They took everybody. We\ndidn\u2019t know from nothing. They didn\u2019t act from under but she says it\u2019s going on\n\u2014 renting people to go. I said, you go out and see what you can do and I go and\nchange it. My grandmother, she should rest wherever she is, she says no. I says,\nlook if they are going to take away him , we all going to die from hunger.\n8\nIf I going to be away, he\u2019s going to be here. I was a child. They say what kind of\nbusiness you make, you didn\u2019t make business. But what he had, from the\ntailoring, from the magazines, he sold something. I couldn\u2019t do it, I didn\u2019t know,\nI was achild. I said, Jetma, please let me go and see. Naturally it was going on\nlike a stock market. Whoever gave money, got it. She didn\u2019t give money, I went\nto . She was running there and back. By four o\u2019clock was a shooting and\nthey took almost four kilometers to the station. They took them all to the station\nand from there they didn\u2019t know where. They started to find out, we find out\nwhere they are. They separate them into two camps. He was in a different camp,\nhis brothers-in-law were in a different. It was near the Russian border which\nbefore the war was there. I would say, very big jails from the Polaks. They called\nit Ka . There they send away like spies or whoever didn\u2019t make right\nbusiness or didn\u2019t pay taxes \u2014 there they land. Well, you start with some people\nwith a horse and carriage, they went there. They started, after six weeks, naturally\nyou have to give money. Me, and I have one fellow in Israel and one fellow here,\nwe went to change them. They came to, hey, you little guy, you going to change?\nI said, I firsr paid. After six weeks, I changed him. This was like forced labor.\nHe was writing if you not going to take me out, I\u2019Il die there. The water was\nstraight out of the river, which is going a little river to the big river, the Bok,\nwhich was the border between Russia and Germany. The water was so \u2014 you\nwent into the water, pieces of your foot fell out like.",
        "Q: From the water?",
        "A: From the waters -- something like. The air it was so light, you could have pulled\ndown so much and I was working there. Came in November, instead to go home,\nwe heard something going around. Every month, like say, came a horse and\ncarriage with food for me for this, because they were home. Came in November\ninstead to -- we thought we going to go home, we heard rumors that they were\ngoing to take us to the forest now to chop woods. He heard that, he paid off for\nme and I should come home. That was already November.",
        "Q: This is now 1943?",
        "A: Yeah. Then I don\u2019t remember exactly the date; they knocked at the doors on a\nSunday and all out on the market. I don\u2019t remember whether this was -- no, this\nwas after. It was like in April, May, no, no. This wasn\u2019t 1943. This was \u00b041, the\nstory what I told you.",
        "Q: The one you just told me was in \u201941?",
        "A: Forty-one.",
        "Q: Was that before \u2014 that was right after the war with the Soviet Union started?",
        "A: No, that was 1940.\n9",
        "Q: Forty. She left before they invaded the Soviet Union, the Germans did?",
        "A: Right, right. That was \u201940. Because they came in September, 1939. This was in\n1940. Grandfather died the beginning of 1940. This was 1940, Easter time. We\ncame home in 1940, the end of 1940. Then in 1941 --.",
        "Q: Can I ask a question real quick? Was there a ghetto -- when they came in, the\nGermans came in to your town -- did they set up a ghetto immediately?",
        "A: Not yet.",
        "Q: Not yet? Okay.",
        "A: I will come to it, not yet. This was 1940. In 1941, in March, April, they knocked\nat every door, it was on a Sunday, I think. They took us out on the market.\nEverybody. What can you take with you? My grandmother she had to take --\nwhatever she took with her, how you call it when you die? A shroud, that\u2019s what\nshe had with her because she wasn\u2019t as committed and that\u2019s what she had with\nher. They took us out and we\u2019re standing in the market; it\u2019s full. Here, over this\ngoes on a stock market, a bazaar. The Judenrat, was sitting there anold \u2014_\u2014_\u2014with\nbeard, came over the Judenrat to him and they wanted to take him out. He said\nno. What, what nobody knew. After an hour or two standing in the market, five\nby five, five by five, to the railroad station which I mentioned is four kilometers.\nWe came to the railroad station and standing there by the railroad station and they\nstart sorteering, sort-like. There was the arbeitzan, the guy from the labor\ndepartment from the Germans. We called him -- by everyone and usually in the\nlittle town, you had a nickname. You didn\u2019t know very many except in school.\nBut in order for the Germans not to know what we are saying, so we call here\nsuch a chin, so we call him the \u2014_ which in Polish \u2014 Jewish ----. It was a\nGerman but in civil. Every morning when you went to place yourself to go to\nwork, first by the Judenrat, then by the arbeitzen the Germans and the Judenrat\nand they saw that you were there, you were there, you were here. They were only\ninterested in staying and taking you. So naturally I was there almost every day.\nHe knew me very well. All of a sudden, he says to me in German, hey ;\nhey young fellow, what are you doing here? Where is your family. I had my\ngrandmother Ria. Over there, people were separate. I hear yelling, Avum\n\u2014__Avum____, that\u2019s me. Abraham, Avumeral, a little one is Avumeral, a big\none is Ava. David, Davidol. His wife and she is yelling. Her sister with her\nhusband --.",
        "Q: Your uncle\u2019s wife you mean?",
        "A: Yeah. Avumeral, I look she is yelling. Even now, fire, water, I don\u2019t care, I go.\nTo save someone, I go. My grandmother says where are you going? I says to\nTante _._ They hit me, go back. Her sister and the husband what I mentioned\n10\nand the other brother with a son and the mother, they pulling Liah, come, come,\nwe'll have a good place on the train. They were standing cattle and she, the\nminute, she had a feeling she didn\u2019t want to go, to have a good place. When swhe\nsaw me, then more of it. This going back to that labor department, that guy, he\npulls me out. Where is your family? My grandmother, next to me, and he pulls\nme standing people like by the building where the station is. We standing there\nand the police with guns, they push them to the wagons and us, they turning back\nto go home. While we were going home, they were waiting horse and carriage,\nthey prepared. They callitthe _ from the Polaks. They took people on back\nbut me with my grandmother till what, there was no. So we were walking. As we\nwere walking the four kilometers, we found plenty dead people; all the people\nwhich we knew them very well. Probably they couldn\u2019t walk, they shoot them.\nWe go about three kilometers, almost our town. Our town was on hills but the\nmain town was in a valley. But it was a lot of hill down. When you\u2019re standing\non this side of the town, you could see the whole town until over the other hill.\nWe come and already they call it the w b , the wide mountain. You\ngo into the town, comes along a Polak on his horse and carriage and he says to my\ngrandmother which he knew her when probably they came to buy suits, he says to\nher, Altaruver that means my grandfather was alta, she is Altaruver, die son\nHerschek is home. What did he say? I says, Grandma, you heard what he said.\nWhat, is he joking? They didn\u2019t do enough to us? The Polaks . AS we\ncome on the top of the hill to go down to the town, we see lights in his house. I\nsay grandmother; she says probably the Polaks they already plundering, stealing.\nIt was like half an hour ago, maybe took ten minutes. We come into the house.\nHe is there with his wife and with his children and crying over. the name\nof her sister to have a good place. When I saw you, she says, I didn\u2019t want to go.\nWhat was the reason? Now, we knew the reason after, when we came back.\nWhen that arbeit , 1t means the labor department, a German, he looked\naround, it was like to send away half a town. The Judenrat knew it but we didn\u2019t\nknow it. When he looked around, everybody looked for himself, especially the\nGermans. The German like this, if he wouldn\u2019t have that function, where will he\ngo? in the war. Nobody wanted to go in the war, no matter how patriotic they\nwere, how good it went for them. He had a function in this city, it\u2019s good. He\nlooked around, he saw that there is more than a half gone and who remained?\nOlder people, he wants to have the labor he needs. So he run to the station and he\ntook out the people. Of course we came into his house. Then he says right away,\ngo home to our house. Because in our house, was everything so we went there.\nThat was 1941. Every day, to work, we saw already what the Germans are and so\non and so on. There wasn\u2019t a family that people wasn\u2019t missing. After we found\nout, they took them to Belzec. There, nothing more to hear. What can I say how\nthe turn was black, like in Jewish they say, Schwarz. Every day goes on work in\nthis and that. I worked in the shop. Before they took away, as soon as the\nGermans came in, they took away 21 youths, I show you in the book, our\nhometown. The nicet youth, 21, 22, they took them away in the middle of the\nnight after they ---. So every day to work, it comes for the two. In 1941, broke\nout the war with Russia.\n11",
        "Q: In June?",
        "A: June 4, June 21*' I think, I remember it good because in our town, all the\nmachinery, all the Germans, military and everything that the people said look at\nthe road -- it\u2019s lower down almost a meter. Such a and everything. You\nnever saw anything like it and it started the war. When it started the war, it stayed\nin our place where we worked, was a whole, everything to fixing. There came\none soldier with 30, 40 tanks to repair. He begged us, he gave us to eat; slow\ndown, nonsense, slow down, slow down. Because otherwise, as soon as it\nfinished, have to go back. I don\u2019t want to go back. I want to stay with you there.\nEvery day in the morning we went to work. You walked like five, six kilometers\nevery day and in the evening you came home. Sometimes they gave a truck,\nsometimes no. This went on in that place, this went on in that part and we all\nwent to work till they didn\u2019t pay us. They didn\u2019t ask us where you make a living\nfrom and so on and so on. We did some military work especially the youth. A\nyouth like me, they took me, they came in, that means , that means\nbiggest craft mobilization. They came in a train. In the train, all of a sudden, they\ngave us to do. In the train, staying on the rails, (End of Side A)\nBut they were not finished so I was a bricklayer, maurer, they call it and I finished\ninside with the meisters, the way you would describe in Germany. They used to\nlive there. Next to those block, the empty ground, we made a camp. They said\nit\u2019s for Italian prisoners. This is the blocks, nice blocks. Here, for instance, in a\ncamp, they\u2019re working. Is in Israel but I wanted to show you those 21 boys, there\nare some pictures of them. Here it is a picture, they builded a home, our own\nhome in Israel. It\u2019s right by the beach. Whoever comes, we get together; we pray\nthere and one is empty wall. All the names they -- is honored. Cost us plenty\nmoney, we paid for it and we made it. This 1s like, this is the synagogue from our\nhometown. We want it in English because the second generation. They didn\u2019t\nagree with us and now it\u2019s a lot of money and this and that. This is like a street in\nKrasnik. I\u2019m looking for those, ah, memories, memories. See, this is the\nsynagogue. See what they had there, horses.",
        "Q: Put horses in the synagogue?",
        "A: When the Germans came in, yeah. Then it was the ghetto and this is -- inside so\nbeautiful, painted and everything. Twenty-one boys. While we were going, one\ntree, there was a lot of forest around. There were partisans, if you read the story\nmaybe, or you\u2019re familiar with the Monuk, Trawnik1?",
        "Q: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: That Trawniki wasn\u2019t far from us.",
        "Q: Oh, really? Okay.\n12",
        "A: Our region. Trawniki pointed us to . There is a big story to tell about\nthat. We wanted to go home already. There were partisans around in the big\nforest. We had a few incidents. All of a sudden there is a shooting and the bushes\nare burning. It\u2019s an unusual thing. We ran into the camp, there was no appell,\nnothing, that caused a panic. Every night when we came home, counting, an\nappell; somebody had to be punished or whatsoever. We read the story, good,\ngood, he will forget. That SOB didn\u2019t forget. The next day, yeah, where is that\nswine that he ran away from me? Anyway, we were discussing, me and uncle and\nsome friends around, if he calls you, no. We decided, if he calls you, first of all\nwhen he calls you, . Whatever he say, yessir, yessir, yessir. Don\u2019t say\nnothing else. I wanted to go for him. He says no, I go. He went out, stood like\nthis, Jew swine, you dog. No, first he says, where were you? He says and\nwe made up with that meister, with that German in case he asks to say the same\nthing. He gave him a deal, so you should say that I was calling you and you didn\u2019t\nhear him. In case they ask me, I will say the same thing. They were civilians\nfrom Yugoslav; they were like Germans, they brought them and they were our\nmasters. We worked together and so on and so on. But they were on the free;\nthey had living conditions and so we made up like this. When he went off and---\nWhere were you? So he said, you know the title. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t hear\nyou, my master called me -- that means the meister -- he always had that machine\ncarbine and a whip with end, a weight. You swine, he says, when I am calling\nyou, nobody\u2019s g--d-- business, you have to come to me. Everybody was looking\nin his hands, what he\u2019s taking, either the machine, carbine or the whip. He took\nthe whip. Give him like this over the head. that means disappear. He had\nhere, after the war in Germany, when liberated, a German big doctor told him to\nremove it because that might take cancer. I have here also, you see?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But I was tested, it\u2019s nothing. That is an appeal. That\u2019s a story that .",
        "Q:P That happened in \u201943, though?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That happened in \u201943? That happened in Krasnik?",
        "A: No, that happened already in the camp because 1942 was Judenrein, that means\nclean. Nobody\u2019s under free and that happened in the . Here, also, they\u2019re\nfixing the fence in Krasnik camp. Where they got those pictures, I don\u2019t know.\nHere, you see a horse and wagon and the dead people they put in there and",
        "Q: 1942, do you remember when in 1942?",
        "A: Around September, yes.\n13",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: It happened like this. We were at work. The women and the children were like in\nthe ghetto. The ghetto was around the synagogue. It wasn\u2019t fenced, you can call\nit a ghetto.",
        "Q: Was there some sort of barrier? So you couldn\u2019t get out or---?",
        "A: No, you could get out but where could you go? If you go outside the ghetto, the\nPolak will catch you and bring you to the Gestapo. Then they going to shoot you\nbecause you did something wrong. So there were the children, the women and the\nnon-working people. Otherwise, everybody was, whether in this place working;\nthey were in three places working, which after that they were camps. Naturally,\nyou ask me question, how did we live, from what? We had counts for provision.\nOne evening I come home from work -- yes, so they going to give Judenkarde,\nthat means a \u201cJ\u201d. A J that means Juden. Whoever get the J card is legal. Who\nwill get those J cards? My mother-in-law if I would have it, only a wife and thst\u2019s\nit. So whether it belonged to my grandmother, nowhere. We were hiding her, in\na basement. We brought her down to eat, within the ghetto. One evening I come\nhome for work, I says to my aunt, to uncle\u2019s wife, give me the soup, Pll go down\nto Grandmother and give it. She says I gave her already. What do you mean, you\ngave her. I want to go and see her. Don\u2019t go. I says no. Then she revealed to\nme, they took her away. All those that they didn\u2019t have the J-card, that means the\nwork-card, they took them away. Where they took them away, there is a town, 20\nkilometers, a little, little town. So they took them there. There is less publicity\nand from there the station four kilometers, and from there, it\u2019s gone. But in the\nsame time, when they took them, something was with the partisans, a shooting\nand a lot in the middle of the road. What\u2019s the difference, this way or the other\nway, they got killed or something, bombing, gone. Now remains all the legalized\npeople and all the working people and we are working. From Friday morning, it\nwas Friday morning, yeah I think. Friday morning, that all those up that have the\nJew card, they legalized; they have to go to the public bath. The public bath was\na Jewish bath, for religious purposes, forv cleaning purposes, the bude, the bath.\nThe Jewish, they have to, it was for all kind of purposes. Usually it is a Friday.\nwas working because for the Saturday; all those people have to go that have the\nJew card and clean themselves and so on and there they will get the real card and\nlegalize.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was the Jewish commandant of the town, his name was Piza . He knew\neverything before. Like if he knew something before, he gave a signal to his\nfamily and so it spread a little bit. He, even didn\u2019t know. Friday morning, they\ntook them all to the bath. The minute they took them to the bath , after they were\ninside, they supplied horse and wagons, they calledita =. When they came\n14\nout from bath comes around and says, they put him and also out of\nthat town. We came home Friday from work, nobody\u2019s there. That means it\u2019s\nJudenrein, that means clean of Jews. That was 1942 in September. From there it\nstarted. My uncle they took to Budzyn, me they took to that what I\nsaid and that\u2019s it. If you remained in the city, that means the shtot came, the shtetl\ncame.",
        "Q: So you went to this camp now?\nA; They took me to that camp.",
        "Q: How far from the city was it?",
        "A: That was like, I would say, two kilometers. That camp where uncle was, Budzyn,\nwas like four kilometers. After two weeks like or three weeks, they took thirty-\nfive people which I was in the 35 and they brought me to Budzyn, to Uncle. They\nmade a selection themselves. When I came into that camp, was a happy day, a\nblack day. 105 people that day, the minute they went out to work, they selected\nand there was the grave. What I tell you they took from the -- they shoot 105\npeople by the grave --that day I came to Budzyn. My uncle saw me and ---. Since\nthen, \u00b042, they were in Budzyn. So I would like to say we went to the camp, to\nthe camp was -- from the barracks, the camp, to the werk which they called in\nGerman, the werk, that mean the place where we working, all those men and\neverything was like four kilometers. But in the colony where you see those\nbuildings, where those Yugoslavia-German lived, there, all of a sudden I became\na bricklayer. So life fiest what was the fiest on those blocks. The kitchen wasn\u2019t\nlike here, 1t was a brick. They came from Yugoslavia and they lived there. We\nwent ahead and we lived there. That was like ten minutes to the camp\nwhich I told you the story with those bushes were burning. We were there and the\nUkrainian were our guards. It was hell.",
        "Q: Can you describe the town for me a little -- not the town, I\u2019m sorry, the camp for\nme a little bit?",
        "A: Budzyn.",
        "Q: Yeah. What it looked like? Was it fenced in or ---?",
        "A: It was like those barracks, you saw those barracks. No windows, nothing. You\nsaw more or less ---.",
        "Q: Was the camp fenced in?",
        "A: Fenced, double-fenced, with an electric fence.",
        "Q: It had an electric wire?\n15",
        "A: Electric wire and guards around day and night. Whoever didn\u2019t want to live no\nmore, he went to the wire. Either the wire killed him or the guard killed him. The\nUkrainians were the guards but beside the Ukrainians was the lagerfuhrer, the SS\nman, that Fiess and he has his helper and a few officers but they were with the\nguards. Those Ukrainian guards, they were not allowed to go in the camp. They\nwere allowed their duty, not in the camp. You ask me a question, what did they\nhave a business to go in the camp? there was a lot of business. For instance, you\ncame home -- we had a stock market, as I told you, we had bargain of this. They\ndidn\u2019t have too much to eat so they, from the guard, they came in, not all of them,\nwhoever was duty-free and they was looking by us. Or sometimes, when we\ncame in by the gate, counting so they can pull you out. In the boot, this they were\nallowed and to strip you and to look. Sometimes you find money also. Anything\nyou were not allowed you could find, otherwise, we were not able to survive and\nso on and so on. In 1943, when it was the Warsaw uprising and the rest of the\npeople, they brought to Treblinka. Why I mentioned this? it\u2019s a connection.\nFrom Treblinka, 800 people, they brought to us, to Budzyn in that camp. Eight\nhundred people, well-dressed, they brought them to us, 800. When they\nbrought them to us, so the Ukrainian I\u2019m an old calhoon but those arte the\nnew ones and they knew, the Germans didn\u2019t know so much as the Ukrainians,\nthey knew that they have money and so on and so on. Going in from work, ;\nthat\u2019s a new one, a Ukrainian pulled him out, stripped him --they stripped once\nmy uncle also. They came in, in the barracks. Once, if the lagerfuhrer, that Fiess\nor his helper, adjutant, came in and saw in the guard. And the guard said, this\none, where are they? Right away you guard, you are not allowed to do that \u2014\nshoot him. So they were sleeping, those var people and this and that. Many\ncame over to me, they say this all the time, I\u2019m an honest guy and so on. Abie, do\nme a favor. Here\u2019s 5, 600 zlotys, hide them. Where did you hide them? At\nwotrk. If tomorrow you didn\u2019t go there, -- I had a young fellow, a Yugoslavian.\nHe was a year older than I am. I remember his name, German, which he was my\nmaster, I worked for him. I had to . [hadahiding _, he knew. I\ndidn\u2019t tell him exactly and I had the key. There were no honest people, listen,\nwhen it comes to a piece of bread, it\u2019s a different story. But they saw the honesty\nin me, this one gave me 800 zlotys, this one gave me 500, to hide it every time.\nThey give me and I had it on the top, on the attic in the sand. Once I came there\nand it was dry there, nothing there. Somebody looked, they see what I\u2019m doing,\ncan\u2019t say a word, you got to keep your mouth shut because --. That\u2019s the way\nwhen the Russian people came to us and they were . They told us stories\nfrom Treblinka and so on and so on. Then they decided to liquuidate that camp.\nBefore that liquidation of the camp, all of a sudden, there was typhus. There was\nno water. That was, I think, in 43. There is typhus. Are you surprised?\nWhoever was sick, there were both \u2014 the stomach typhuses and there is a planastic\nlike arash from. I had both. Whoever sick, they took one barrack and there they\nput the people. Every morning that Fiess came in before breakfast. We called his\nmachine gun, this hunsagle. What is a hunsagle, we always called it, he shouldn\u2019t\nunderstand because a lot of Jewish is like German. Hunsagle means like hands-up\n16\nand that carbine, machine carbine looked like it. He\u2019s going already with the --.\nEvery morning he came in and he took us people, he rush them off from the\nbarrack and running. Besides this, there wasn\u2019t those blocks, those blocks you\nsaw. Was block 2, outside from the fence, right across the street. There was that\nblock and in that block was a lazarett. It means a hospital. If you was sick, they\ntook you there. It was like, it was -- in camp was tailor place, shoemaker place, it\nwas for us. But in that block was for the SS. Some people were there and there\nwas a lazarett also. Other times, he took out and he shoot. He was already in the\ntyphus. But listen, he was a man of 35 at that time, 38, a strong guy. He could\nmake it. I was a little kid 18 years old. But we didn\u2019t go that far, we worked in\nthe colony so it was like ten minutes from the camp. Every day I want to work. I\nwent to work. I dsat down, I sit. I couldn\u2019t do nothing. That guy, Brumula, what\nis the hell the matter with you? I said, keep your mouth shut. I was returned like\nthis. He only pray to God he should be an SS man and I should be in his camp. I\nsaid you shouldn\u2019t live to that. His father was one foot shorter and he wass in the\nwerk there and he was an SOB. He brought me to eat from his house. If he\nshould know that, he should spend with me again. It was \u2014 (female voice: it was\nlife or death every minute). So you go into a story. I could not survive to stay in\ncamp, it\u2019s the death. If I would have to go the three, four kilometers to the\nbarrack, but here ---. We had the obermeister, that was the head supervisor from\nthe milers. He was so short, Schultz, a German from Ostowiec. He had here an\nSTP National Organization with the H . He was a good guy, they were\ngood . Not from the Lithuanians, Ukrainians but from the Germans, but\nfortunately I have to say the truth. He comes in, hey Morris to him. What is with\nyour son Brumula. If he\u2019s sick, he has tp. He said to me, meister Schultz, sh --,\nsh --. No he has to stay in the lazarett. That means the hospital. Comes over to\nme, how you feel? I feel all right. You don\u2019t be ask me, you don\u2019t feel right.\nYou got to stay in the hospital. You were not allowed to tell outside what is going\non inside. If they found out, so you know what is the result, what the verdict is.\nBut whoever wanted to find out something, he found out. One day he comes over\nto me, tell you that time I was as tall as him. I know already what\u2019s going on\nhere. I keep my mouth shut. You\u2019re afraid to go because Fiess every time he\nshoots, you\u2019re dead. I don\u2019t say a word. That\u2019s an interesting story. I know\nalready what to do. I don\u2019t answer nothing. What is he going to do but ---. I says\nI\u2019m going, kill, kill me, what\u2019s the difference? He went over to that Fiess and he\ntold me, and Heil Hitler, you know, break bodice. Hey, listen, I have by\nme such a good faulker and so on and so on but he\u2019s thinking he needs a lazarett.\nSo let him go in. He says sh, sh. I won\u2019t guarantee, not in that barrack. I want\nhim in the lazarett. That\u2019s the way he told me the story. I didn\u2019t hear. You stay\ntomorrow in lager and you will go to the lazarett and don\u2019t be afraid of nothing.\nTomorrow they took me into that block 2, to that lazarett. Than that block 2 in\nlazarett in this bed was laying a man probably I have in the picture, that his sister,\nlike that Stochman was from the men, the leader, his sister was from the women.\nHer brother was laying in one bed with something I sign here. They put me next\nto his bed and they also put me in something like 00 I don\u2019t remember what it\nwas, asign. He, as he went to that camp in, how far was it? Across the street\n17\nfrom his location to run around to those people. Then he went to him to the\nlazarett in block 2 also. He comes in, he looks around and he goes away. he\nwanted, usually from there, they didn\u2019t take out. One day, I don\u2019t know that but\nthat\u2019s what they told me, I was in the high fever. You have high fever, you\nshouldn\u2019t know from it, and you don\u2019t know where you stand. Let\u2019s say every\nmorning he came in high bush, v how you feelo? Went away. He saw\nhim going away already, thank God, but I was in very high fever. He came in and\nhe asked something. Instead to say something, I swing with my arm. I don\u2019t\nknow, till today I don\u2019t believe it but the next door man, when he get out, he said\nto my Uncle Morris, you know what your Brumula did? I don\u2019t know of nothing.\nWhen I swung like this, of course I didn\u2019t hit him, he said (female voice: he was\ndelirious) in German, like the gendarme in German, du , that means you\ndog, a swine is like a pig, you had luck. If not for this, I don\u2019t know of nothing. I\ncan\u2019t say nothing. I don\u2019t want even to put in the record because ----.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember it?",
        "A: (He was delirious, he had periodic delirtum) That\u2019s what they said. You get out\nfrom the sickness, they give you three, four weeks, you can stay in the camp. A\nbig deal, you can stay in the camp. Everybody wants to get out from the camp.\nThe next day I\u2019m going to work. He sees me, he yells at me. I didn\u2019t answer. He\nwent through 14 days with it. I stood and I worked, that\u2019s all. The same story,\nwhen it came that typhus and everything, Trawniki, what I mentioned, there is\nPl another camp like this. We worked for Henklewerk. Henklewerk is a\nbig air/space ----.",
        "Q: German company, right?",
        "A: They, I don\u2019t know for who they worked. One Sunday, and we heard about\nPl , Trawniki, that they burned the camp because of the typhus, to the\nground. One Sunday, that was in \u201943, yeah, one Sunday, we are not going out to\nwork. The guards like double or tripled who knows. There is standing already\nlittle pumps with gasoline to do us the same thing. People want already to jump\non the wires. They say I rather get killed from the wire that he should kill me.\nAll of a sudden, stop. What is the stop? That Fiess, that lagerfuhrer, he didn\u2019t\nwant to lose his post. As I mentioned, because where is he going to go. In the\nfront, nobody want to go \u2014 all patriots up front. He\u2019s something, had a\nconversation with Lublin with Henklewerk there and Henklewerk stopped it.\nThey called to Germany, to the headquarters whatever that is. I don\u2019t Know thE\nStory goes. The story ends that they stopped, they took away everything and they\ndidn\u2019t burn us.",
        "Q: When was this, do you remember?",
        "A: Forty-three, I think, \u00b043.\n18",
        "Q: Late \u201943, do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Sometime in \u00b043?",
        "A: Sometime in \u201943. They didn\u2019t and the next day as usual, as before, whoever is\nsick stays in the barracks, whoever is good goes to work, thanks to Henklewerk\nand that SOB Fiess. Then in \u201943, things changed it. That was camp, things\nchanged. We were building the camp in the barrack because to say what will\nhave to go. There is no . They probably were afraid of the partisans\nbecause when we walked to work, a lot of times disappeared and so on and so on.\nThey had to cross the main road and this and that. They brought in a little town\nwhat they were still in that town; they brought them in. so they started to\ndisappear so they figured different. Why here, be there. They build another\ncamp. It became, instead of camp, became KZ. That means concentration camp.\nA lot of them have the KZ. Instead I have the number. In that time, from civil we\nchanged, if it\u2019s concentration camp, we had to change to the stripes.",
        "Q: You had civilian clothes on, up to this point?",
        "A: In Budzyn, yes. Some civilian clothes was here marked a KZ. It was something\nand we came to the verrick which you\u2019re familiar with what I mean the verrick.\nIn the same time, no more Ukrainians but SS replaced the guard, no more\nUkrainians. You can imagine SS and we were there. We were there and when it\nstarted more with the war and so on and so on and Germany is squeezed so they\nstarted little by little to liquidate that camp. Because they figured and so on and\nso on. As I said what they did there, they brought tanks, one soldier, we\nhad to fix in the tanks from the Ukrainians\u2019 Russia, they were pigs, dead\nones. which we had a by that and so on and so on. Then from that\nKZ camp which it was in the veld, every time we start fight from that people to\nsend some ;",
        "Q: Oh, you started sending 500 people out from camp?",
        "A: Every time, every time.",
        "Q: Did they know where they were going? Did anyone say where they were going?",
        "A: Yes, yes. One was going to another shtetl, one was going to another shtetl, where\nit was a camp like this. Finally, we are almost the last ones. They were sending\nto M Vv which there is also Henklewerk and there is salt,\nwhere you taking out salt from the ground. There they got the KZ. It remains\nlike the last groups. My uncle knew a little bit that Stochland so he always\nbegged him; written in camp, was like a Jewish shtetl let\u2019s say. We had our\npolice, we had our leaders. Let\u2019s say I had a complaint from you. I went in and I\n19\ncomplained to . In the nice Jewish way that ultimately they should know\nfrom it. So my uncle talked with that Stochland; I would like to go where you go.\nBesides this, if not, I would like you should not separate us, you should know it\u2019s\na father and son. It came before the last group to go where? To Majdanek. He\nsaid to my Uncle Morris, I can\u2019t help no more. I wish I knew where I am going.\nSo far, I don\u2019t know. You see, even which they are here, from one\nfamily, the mother, the husband and wife and two little boys; they survived all.\nHow, if you want to know the story, they survived with my Uncle Morris. The\nboys married, children. He was \u2014 that girl that he was going with in the camp was\nhis wife\u2019s a cousin. They are now in Minneapolis, wherever. So he says to me,\nyou see, even them, not all of them, but few I\u2019m sending this , | can\u2019t help\nmysrlf.",
        "Q: So now they sent you to Majdanek?",
        "A: To Majdanek. That was in 1944, I think. Yeah, in \u00b044.",
        "Q: Early \u201944?",
        "A: Early \u00b044.",
        "Q: Did they send you on trains?",
        "A: No. Was close ---.",
        "Q: It was close-by, it wasn\u2019t that far away?",
        "A: It was like 50 kilometers. It was like, you know, those trucks, open trucks and\nwith wires around and the guards standing that you shouldn\u2019t jump around. They\nbrought us to Majdanek. We saw Majdanek, we didn\u2019t see yet. All those guards\nand all those fields. Majdanek, if they didn\u2019t ten fields in a crematorium, they\ndidn\u2019t have nothing. They brought us in to field one. That was a camp set for\nevery field was a different field. In that camp, they took us out to work within the\ncamp. Nobody was there. Across the wires, in another field we saw fellows, one\nwithout an arm, one without a leg, one saw. We didn\u2019t know who they were but\nthey started rumors, they are Russians from the front. They are prisoners,\nwhatever.",
        "Q: POW\u2019s, prisoners of war?",
        "A: Yes. But no one, very seldom one was a full guy. Next day they take us on that\nappellplatz and they started. My uncle, he had broken a leg in Budzyn like two,\nthree months before. He was working by the kitchen because they gave him a\nbreak but that time when we went to the work, there was no more on the calendar\nto work. His foot wasn\u2019t so \u2014 so we get out on that appell. It was healed, he\nwasn\u2019t in the hospital at camp, he was healed. They go and they take us to\n20\nMajdanek out the next day and to separate us where to go to work. They call\nschneiders, tailors. Tailors, till he got with me, so many, he\u2019s behind. I didn\u2019t\nwant, I stepped out, want to be together. I didn\u2019t know it\u2019s in the place, I thought\nmaybe they send away. The policy was to look that you should be inside. As I\nsaid, ine fight with the hunger, with the weather, with the cold was ---. But you\ntried, you push yourself. He is behind. I stepped out. They call shoemakers, he\nsays where you going? I said my uncle there. Not his father, the other guy was a\nshoemaker and a shoemaker, he is behind. Finally that was for the SS working,\nfinally they call us in. I got in with him together because it wasn\u2019t too many\npeople. Shoemaker, shoemaker.",
        "Q: So he became a shoemaker then?",
        "A: I and him became a shoemaker, ten people. Ten people, they brought us in a\nbarrack. That\u2019s outside the fields. It\u2019s Majdanek the camp, but Majdanek had\nabout ten fields. Each field was a camp. But this was also a field where the\nwhole administrations are. The magazines with the and so on. Comes\nover a guy, here with a red triangle, red triangle is politicians. Green 1s like us.\nHe was with a high vake. My name is Franz, I\u2019m an arrister. I am from this\nmagazine but I am a prisoner just like you, he said. Arrister. He tells me, I was\nnot in touch with Hitler, you know what that means? To kill him, politic. He is\nfrom \u2014 there is a few guys, you will see them, political, German, Austrian. There\nis little tables like shoemakers\u2019 tables, ten people. Eight by a table there, me with\nmy uncle, he gives to the other table, four and across sitting four, those fellows.\nThose one with one arm. one --- and I know already who they are and another\ntable there. He comes over to me, what is your name? He says I call you\nBrumula. It seems to me by the German, Abraham is Brumula, Brumula, fine.\nWho is he? I says, this is my father. You be the kapo he says, you know what\nmeans kapo. I am the kapo but you\u2019re going to be like the foreman of over those\nten peoples. Say yes. Yes. I didn\u2019t like it. Then he calls me in in his magazine,\nwhole magazine, shoes, clothing and everything. He has the two Russians; they\nstanding with picks and picking these things. You see what they doing? I see.\nYou know why they doing, he tells me. You going to pick like this and the picker\ndon\u2019t go in, either bring 1t to me, whether it\u2019s a shoe or whether it\u2019s a garment or\nrip it and see what\u2019s there. Chances are there is gold. Do the same thing. I do, I\ndo. I don\u2019t find nothing. He took me by the collar and threw me out. Go back to\nyour place there. He brought in bread, this and that every morning, from where\nhe got that bread or whatever, I don\u2019t know. Across the street was the magazine,\nthere was an undersh , a German and another Ss man and there were three,\nfour Polish guys, intellectuals from the colleges which they were also like\nprisoners but in a different way. They were working and this and that. They kept\nrecords and everything. Every morning, he took a wagon, those German wagons\nand he packed himself in. You could, you wouldn\u2019t recognize whether he has in\nthe bag that thing or in the front with food with everything. He put clothing, dirty\nclothing and like horses,us, and we went to the vasherei to the washroom where\nthe women worked. Our women there from our townspeople. He gave them\n21\nbread, water, marmalade this and that enough. Every day like this. I was the -- he\nsaid take a few guys. Anyway, one day he comes over to me. He gives me a boot\nand my uncle one boot. He says Brumula be careful, your father too. I need the\nupper soft -- the bottom, never mind. But you can look maybe. I start to pinch, it\ndon\u2019t go. I\u2019m getting . Those Russians they were already experts. They\nsaw already what -- and my uncle does it the same thing; happens to him the same\nthing. He don\u2019t know what I am doing. When he took out, there is a piece where\nthey were laying in it. He took the pieces but this part of the shoe where it was\ninside, he threw it on the floor. Those Russians, they were so smarter, they were\nlonger than us there; he picked it up. It was their foreman like I was by the Jew.\nHe had one arm like this; he called him over and he shows him that and he\nsays that means 14, 14 pieces. I saw this, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I get\nup from my chair and I go into the magazine and I says to him Frank, I found\nsomething here. How much/ I took out, not all of them. I kept by me three\npieced and I give it to him. How about your father? I says I don\u2019t know. Before\nI says I don\u2019t know and I got back to my seat, that foreman from the Russian, he\ntook down my number, it wasn\u2019t numbers yet, this is in Auschwitz but we had\nhere a number and the uncle, he took down those numbers and went into the\nmagazine and told the over there. He was a Polish-German, he spoke\nPolish what happened here. The minute he comes in and he calls my uncle\u2019s\nname, number, there was no names. Called him and an SS man behind him and\nthey\u2019re taking him across the street in their office. I running to the magazine and\nsays Frank, look what happened here. Don\u2019t be afraid. When they called him in,\nhe took everything out and he put it on the table. You have no more? No. Those\nPolaks, those students back and they call him in. They call him in and that Frank,\ndon\u2019t be afraid. He didn\u2019t ask me if I have something or I don\u2019t have something,\nnothing.

That girl, right, she\u2019s a grandmother, she lives in New\nJersey. A few boys here, old friends, which we went together to cheder. We went\nfrom the first to the seventh class, we are together. I have a friend here, not far\nfrom here and we meet together. We have our -- everyone, that\u2019s since 1900\u2019s\nthat emigrated here, they made societies, like our society, the Krasnik Society,\nwhich we meet every month and we do in charity everything and so on between\nus and for Israel and in general. Now, for instance, in the wintertime we don\u2019t\n2\nhave because we all older people, so they are in Florida here and there. March,\nwe Start again, which we used to meet in Manhattan. Now, most live in Brooklyn\nSO we meet here in Heights Congregation. We make a party once a while;\nwe have our own cemetery and so on. That\u2019s almost every hometown has but a\nlot, like the youth, don\u2019t go in so they give up. Which I\u2019m trying now to take in\nmy kids to it. Of course we had friends; we played together, we went to school\ntogether, yes, yes. Other than Jewish friends, very little. I especially had a few\nbecause, as I said, we lived in a street, one side was Jews and one side was non-\nJews. But mostly like the little towns, most of 1t populated from the Jews. Like\nthe surroundings around, like the farmers and this, they lived around the town.\nThey called it in Jewish the shtetl.",

The few Jews lived in the city and the\nsurrounding around lived the non-Jews but we went together to school and\neverything. Naturally, the public school, not the cheder. The cheder, Jews. It\nwas like a ghetto life. That time we didn\u2019t realize now. Now we realized, we live\nin a big city, all kinds of nationalities, we realized that it\u2019s a different life.

        "A: Yes. Like for instance, here we celebrate a Christmas altogether nice whether you\nbelieve or not, we celebrate together. I lived with neighbors, Italian; I am Jewish.\nIt\u2019s Hanukkah, I put out the candles; they put out whatever it is. It\u2019s mutual. But\nthere it wasn\u2019t unfortunately. I have to say the way it is whether you\u2019re Christian,\nwhether you\u2019re believer or not. You do this, to say as it was. Very anti-Semitic.\nThe Polaks, very stupid. They only know one thing. We Jews killed our God!\nThat\u2019s what they knew. For instance, it came, let\u2019s say twice a year you have for\ntwo or three weeks, a holiday from the school. Once a year, vacation, two\nmonths. Let\u2019s say that twice a year like Christmas time or Easter, right? The two\nholidays is about Jesus Christ -- I wouldn\u2019t say us Jews. We knew a little bit\nmore those days what\u2019s with Jesus and what\u2019s the story. They didn\u2019t know\nnothing; they only knew one thing. You killed our God! If he is a god, how can\nyou kill him? Alright, now I am different than I was then. Tough on Judaism\n3\nalso. Because I know more the reality; I am more educated and so on and so on.\nThat time I was Jew 100%. Now I\u2019m born Jew, I am Jew but I\u2019m different. Not\nagreeing with everything -- so going, let\u2019s say it was the Christmas holiday, the\nlast day of the holiday, the last day in school before the holiday. Then the action\nfor two, three weeks. They came with strings and to the string attached weights,\nlike a kilo weight, a half a kilo weight and that\u2019s the way. They knew that they\nwere going out from the school. If it happened during the day, I go to the teacher\nand I put a report, something happens. Not too much, but something. But this\ntime he knows in the afternoon, he\u2019s out from the school for three weeks -- kill\nthat Jew, hit that Jew. So that\u2019s the way they were hitting. You came home\nbloodied, with blood, with faces like this. You killed our God! That was the only\nthing. That was Christmas time. It came ---.",
        "A: It came before Easter, I remember, like today, when you went to school, how far\nwas it? A mile? You went through the main street like they call it here Kasioska,\nthere was the movie. As a matter of fact, from the movie was a Jew. At that time\nwasn\u2019t movies like today. There was outside all the pictures what the movie 1s.\nThe movie was calling G___. Now, why, it\u2019s not Polish, maybe it was ---. That\nwas all the story when Christ raises and so on and so on.",
        "A: When you pass there, it\u2019s the same thing, it\u2019s the same thing. Anti-Semitism was\nvery big. Let\u2019s say Saturday afternoon, we were juvenile boys, we went out for a\nwalk in the main street. As I said, the whole shtetl was Jews. Around -- so\nPolaks when they came out. Unfortunately it happened to me this week\nI told you. When they came out, we were walking. Oh, you Jew! Bang! It\nhappened to me this week, almost the same thing. Where I work on Seventh\nAvenue between 38\" and 37\" Street. I leave work at a quarter to six. You go out,\nit\u2019s a big traffic of people. I have to go this way to 42\u2122 Street station but people,\nthey going en masse to the station, to the Penn station. One young fellow,\ntaller than you -- it was raining. Alright, a short fellow like me with the umbrella,\nmaybe I didn\u2019t have it down, the umbrella. Alright, while walking you walk this\nway, this walk that way. But one tall guy, a young fellow came towards me and\nlike this with his rear almost to my face. What\u2019s the memory? I shouldn\u2019t say\nwhat. You son-of-a-bitch \u2014 he could have gone and killed me. I was sorry after\nwhat I said but it remind me of the years in Poland. But alright, sometimes, as I\nsaid, you said excuse me, he didn\u2019t, alright. But this, a young fellow, so it remind\nme of this. Of course, there was anti-Semitic and so on and so on but I wouldn\u2019t\nlet them think you heard, you Jew, you Jew. You killed our God, you Jew killed\nour God. I loved the school, I was going to the school. I loved it, I wanted to go\nfurther whether I could afford or not. But unfortunately, the anti-Semitism was\nvery big. We had in our hometown, we had the gymnasium. It\u2019s like here,\n4\ncollege. Here gymnasium 1s like for the . But very seldom a Jew could go\nin, even if he could pay.",
        "A: Yes, anti-Semitism was very, very big. A Jew couldn\u2019t get too much of it. They\nsay it is -- they say -- he couldn\u2019t get to a higher -- no. They felt it in the school,\non the street; they felt it all over, all over. The Germans, they knew where to\nmake the crematoriums. They didn\u2019t make too many in Czechoslovakia, different\npeople. Same Catholics, different. But in Poland, all the crematoriums, all the\ncamps were in Poland. I was in the camp in the beginning, near our hometown. I\ndidn\u2019t have to run away. I could have walked away but where? You walk away\nand the Polak will give you for a kilo , for two pounds of sugar. If not for\nhim, I would run, always on the run. He didn\u2019t let me. The last three months we\nwere not together. This because they separated us whatever. But whenever I\nwanted to go, run --. One year we were on the camp near our hometown. I was\ngoing out from the camp. I was that time, I was a bricklayer. Bricklayer,\ncememting, this and that. You were looking for places that you should be inside.\nBecause fighting with hunger is one fight but fighting with the weather and the\ncold, two fights was way too hard. You were looking for \u2014 but looking; it\u2019s not\nyou\u2019re given application. But I ws a young fellow, I don\u2019t know. They tell me\nthat I am smart and this and that. Fine, inside, going out for sand, for this. Let\u2019s\nsay a village nearby and going out for lime, to dig lime, I could have gone away.\nThat was in 1942, I had no guards over me. Only me and the polka with the horse\nand carriage. All of a sudden I hear a voice. What is the voice? Hey you, boy-\nfellow, how can I get into the camp? I saw he\u2019s a Jew. I says, who are you? He\ntells me the name. In the villages, very few Jews lived. The ones who lived, you\nknew his name even if you didn\u2019t know him. I am Zalek Division he said. I look\nat him. Why do you want to go into the camp? I haven\u2019t got place where to go. I\ngave them away everything \u2014 all mine whatever, gone. I don\u2019t want to hear. I\nhaven\u2019t got where to go. I\u2019m sick and tired already. What\u2019ll happen, will happen,\nwhat we were told will be with me. I says don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not so easy to get in\nbecause you got all -- they counting you, you come in, they counting you. It was\nnot a question to run away. The question was, where will I hide? I see the\nGerman, the uniform, I run away from him. But I see a Polak, do I know which\none is good and which one is no good? But I still wanted to run away. But he\ndidn\u2019t let me. He was then -- he like 24 years difference from me. I was a young\nboy, 18, 19 years. Run, no. Besides this, if you going to run away, they take the\nnext ten and they kill. Especially first was the family, it\u2019s the same name, you\ncan\u2019t deny. So that was the story. We suffered in this hometown -- it was four\nkilometers from the hometown. When we got to work they came for this work\nwith a horse and carriage to give a day\u2019s duty, performance, whatever. What did\nthey do for us? They didn\u2019t have to do, just look away. yes, you gave them the\ngood shirt from your body, they gave you a kilo bread. But we knew, for two\npounds of sugar, the Germans gave a proclamation: If you bring one Jew a\n5\nfamily, two pounds of sugar, they did it. Isn\u2019t that a shame? Don\u2019t do for me\ngood but don\u2019t do it for me either.",
        "A: Well, the war started September the 1\u2018. Naturally, as the war is, bombs with\neverything, whatever. I didn\u2019t understand too much. I didn\u2019t know too much.\nTwo weeks later, the Germans came into our hometown. It happened, it was the\nfirst, or the second day of Rosh Hashanah, the New Year\u2019s. Of course, we didn\u2019t\nbelieve it or not in the synagogue. It\u2019s not like the big town, every corner you had\na synagogue. In the little towns, I don\u2019t know how it was in the big towns, the\nlittle town was a shul and a basm . That means one is the synagogue and\none is like other than a synagogue. Let\u2019s say the synagogue every Saturday, the\nbasm____ was for every day, day and night, even to go in for a whole night, if\nyou were cold, to warm up. So it\u2019s Rosh Hashanah, New Year\u2019s. Before New\nYear\u2019s people like leaders grabbed the scrolls, the Torah, which you probably\nknow, the scroll and they brought them. Let\u2019s say, this one brought to his house\nand around the neighbors, we prayed there. Was the first day or the second day of\nRosh Hashanah, we heard, of course, shooting and this and that. A week before,\nit was bombs, which people got killed already, in front of me. One woman got\nkilled -- I run out with a cover to cover her and so on. The second day they came\nin so naturally, we all start praying, we were afraid. After the Germans start to go\naround, nothing will happen, everything is quiet, we should go out on the street\nnormal. About two, three days later started the feelings of the German. First they\ntook -- in Polish they call it , hostages. Let\u2019s say this one 1s a rich one, they\nwent into the magistrate, to the - and they got through the big Jews. They\ntook this one, they took this one, they took this one. One they killed right away to\nshow us what\u2019s all about it if we don\u2019t -- if we revolt against them or what. It\nstarted, they were there. Naturally -- and we didn\u2019t know. Now we know what\nthe politics was between Stalin and Hitler. They made some kind of --.",
        "A: Pact. We didn\u2019t know that. All of a sudden, we hear the Russians are a couple of\nkilometers from our town. The next day they came in a patrol; with a tank and the\nschool square where I went to school. We all around to look; everybody looked.\nThe Germans were laying down looking at the tank and so on. I didn\u2019t\nunderstand Russian but it\u2019s almost similar. All the people understood. They said\nlike they are twenty kilometers from us. It\u2019s more possibility that they\u2019re going to\nturn back till the Bok, the River. That\u2019s what happened, they turned back. A lot\nof people in those towns where they were, not far from us, they went along with\nthem.\n6",
        "A: Yeah. Youth, mostly youth.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I want to bring out. My grandmother, she was my mother, she\nbrought me up. She ways to me, Avul that means my name, Avul |\nrun, run. I said how can I leave you. The grandfather was laying in bed\nparalyzed. He couldn\u2019t move, he couldn\u2019t talk. It was naturally, seven years\nalready. The only one because he and me, we were 1n the town. But he was a\nbusinessman with his wife and children and I was near my grandmother. So\nnobody understood it, only me. For instance, they bombed before they came in. I\ntook him on my back, as little as I was, and I dragged him to a cellar whatever.\nHe says I don\u2019t want to live no more. So nobody understood him, that\u2019s enough\nfor me. My grandmother says, go run. I says, where I\u2019m going to run? Leave\nyou with the sick grandfather? No. Those days wasn\u2019t like today but I am today\nin this respect, I am today ess in this respect, no time old fashioned like.\nI\u2019m American, I\u2019m modernized but in this respect, I don\u2019t want my pleasure I\nwant my family to give . So I says no, that\u2019s all there is to it. After he run\naway with his wife and children to a village, people were running even before\nthey came in. How could I, I wouldn\u2019t go nowhere. Then it started with the\nGermans. They were there -- people ran, people came back. Naturally youth\npeople. I had friends, people came back; they got stuck. They couldn\u2019t go back,\nthey went to concentration camps. They started, every day, you have to go work.",
        "A: All kind of work.",
        "A: Even, God forbid, it was a bad winter with snow. The fellows they came with\nhorse and carriages to the town, they were laughing like this. Hey Jew, hey Jews,\nyou cleaning for us. Like this, all standing in the road, that was the memory it\nwas. It was plenty snow; God gave us also plenty . Poland had also a pact\nwith Hitler and Stalin. Besides this, they found a lot of work. The minute they\ncame in, our hometown was an industrialized city. It was like in central Poland.\nMy grandmother told me in the other war, they came in and they got out. So they,\nthe Polaks, were building ammunition places and so on and so on. Lately they\nfound it out that mostly the architects and everything, they were Germans and it\nwas everything and they made big places around the city. There they took us to\nwork. What was then to do? The Polaks, the farmers, they had to bring in the\ntags like. What was the tags? The grain and so on and so on. We were working\nthere, shipping there on the wagons, it was all kinds of work to do. There was a\nbig \u2014 then the Germans started there to make, they figure out already that they\u2019re\ngoing to go in war with Russia. Now we know it. All of a sudden, there was a\nvalley which it was filled from the Polaks. They took it away and they started to\n7\nbuild a -- in German, they call it . What does it mean? That means\ngasolines, with oils, with everything towards the war. On the ground, they took\nus, we had to go every day from the house to work which the Judenrat -- probably\nyou heard of the Judenrat -- they send you -- every day off to work. If you didn\u2019t\ngo, they came for you with the Jewish police and they arrested you. Let\u2019s say if I\ndidn\u2019t have a few days\u2019 work for me, I went out on the square there; you came\nalong, you gave me ten zlotys, I work for you. First I look to who has. Every day\nI was at work. Whether voluntarily or not, being home, they going to catch me\njust the same. I needed a couple zlotys to make a living. In the meantime, you\nwere at work, the Polaks brought in potatoes and all kinds of vegetables.",
        "A: You steal something, you brought home and the grandmother cooked it and so on\nand so on. You worked there and we built a top that thing also. The rail was\ngoing and the by the Polaks and they did that. Enough so that half a year\nlater, they started the war so everything was from us. The first station to send\nthem the work. Then they make a hanger , It\u2019s a big \u2014 airplanes, they\nstarted. We didn\u2019t make them but we fixed them and everything and so on. Like\nin 1943, was the first aus ____s means to send away the people. They knocked it -\n- yes, before that, in spring, all of a sudden, that was \u00b043, in the middle of the\nnight, they came and says from Lublin to the Judenrat and they told them what\nthey want them to do. We didn\u2019t know. They knocked at every door, every\nJewish door, the Judenrat, the Jewish police, had to show them which is a Jewish\nhome. They knocked on every door and they kicked them out on the square, on\nthe school place there with Germans and Jewish police, Polish police around, to\nwatch them who they took out. I lived in that house, as I said, on the other side\nwas Polak. My grandfather died already. He died right in \u201940 which now, next\nmonth is the anniversary, 50 year, in 1940. He says 52. I, with the grandmother\nin our house. He lived at the end of the street with his in-laws. There was he and\nhis wife, three children. There was a brother-in-law. He came back from\nBrussels in \u00b038. Three years he couldn\u2019t stay, the war goes, he came back. When\nhe came back from Marseille till German -- he had to go by train -- when he saw\neverything, he said, give me a little boat and I go back already. He saw\neverything. Him and his son and his wife, and another brother-in-law with a son,\nthey all took out. There was the that saved him, from seven o\u2019clock\nuntil six in the morning. Six o\u2019clock in the morning, they knocking on our door.\nMy grandmother said, you don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll go to the door. You hide under the bed.\nShe yells out, who is it, who is 1t? She says, mother-in-law in Jewish, schiga, it\u2019s\nLiah, open up. She\u2019s crying. She opens up, she comes in and cries. They took\naway everybody from their house, except the women, except her with the\nchildren. The sister, the son they took and the mother. They took everybody. We\ndidn\u2019t know from nothing. They didn\u2019t act from under but she says it\u2019s going on\n\u2014 renting people to go. I said, you go out and see what you can do and I go and\nchange it. My grandmother, she should rest wherever she is, she says no. I says,\nlook if they are going to take away him , we all going to die from hunger.\n8\nIf I going to be away, he\u2019s going to be here. I was a child. They say what kind of\nbusiness you make, you didn\u2019t make business. But what he had, from the\ntailoring, from the magazines, he sold something. I couldn\u2019t do it, I didn\u2019t know,\nI was achild. I said, Jetma, please let me go and see. Naturally it was going on\nlike a stock market. Whoever gave money, got it. She didn\u2019t give money, I went\nto . She was running there and back. By four o\u2019clock was a shooting and\nthey took almost four kilometers to the station. They took them all to the station\nand from there they didn\u2019t know where. They started to find out, we find out\nwhere they are. They separate them into two camps. He was in a different camp,\nhis brothers-in-law were in a different. It was near the Russian border which\nbefore the war was there. I would say, very big jails from the Polaks. They called\nit Ka . There they send away like spies or whoever didn\u2019t make right\nbusiness or didn\u2019t pay taxes \u2014 there they land. Well, you start with some people\nwith a horse and carriage, they went there. They started, after six weeks, naturally\nyou have to give money. Me, and I have one fellow in Israel and one fellow here,\nwe went to change them. They came to, hey, you little guy, you going to change?\nI said, I firsr paid. After six weeks, I changed him. This was like forced labor.\nHe was writing if you not going to take me out, I\u2019Il die there. The water was\nstraight out of the river, which is going a little river to the big river, the Bok,\nwhich was the border between Russia and Germany. The water was so \u2014 you\nwent into the water, pieces of your foot fell out like.",
        "A: From the waters -- something like. The air it was so light, you could have pulled\ndown so much and I was working there. Came in November, instead to go home,\nwe heard something going around. Every month, like say, came a horse and\ncarriage with food for me for this, because they were home. Came in November\ninstead to -- we thought we going to go home, we heard rumors that they were\ngoing to take us to the forest now to chop woods. He heard that, he paid off for\nme and I should come home. That was already November.",
        "A: Yeah. Then I don\u2019t remember exactly the date; they knocked at the doors on a\nSunday and all out on the market. I don\u2019t remember whether this was -- no, this\nwas after. It was like in April, May, no, no. This wasn\u2019t 1943. This was \u00b041, the\nstory what I told you.",
        "A: Forty-one.",
        "A: No, that was 1940.\n9",
        "A: Right, right. That was \u201940. Because they came in September, 1939. This was in\n1940. Grandfather died the beginning of 1940. This was 1940, Easter time. We\ncame home in 1940, the end of 1940. Then in 1941 --.",
        "A: Not yet.",
        "A: I will come to it, not yet. This was 1940. In 1941, in March, April, they knocked\nat every door, it was on a Sunday, I think. They took us out on the market.\nEverybody. What can you take with you? My grandmother she had to take --\nwhatever she took with her, how you call it when you die? A shroud, that\u2019s what\nshe had with her because she wasn\u2019t as committed and that\u2019s what she had with\nher. They took us out and we\u2019re standing in the market; it\u2019s full. Here, over this\ngoes on a stock market, a bazaar. The Judenrat, was sitting there anold \u2014_\u2014_\u2014with\nbeard, came over the Judenrat to him and they wanted to take him out. He said\nno. What, what nobody knew. After an hour or two standing in the market, five\nby five, five by five, to the railroad station which I mentioned is four kilometers.\nWe came to the railroad station and standing there by the railroad station and they\nstart sorteering, sort-like. There was the arbeitzan, the guy from the labor\ndepartment from the Germans. We called him -- by everyone and usually in the\nlittle town, you had a nickname. You didn\u2019t know very many except in school.\nBut in order for the Germans not to know what we are saying, so we call here\nsuch a chin, so we call him the \u2014_ which in Polish \u2014 Jewish ----. It was a\nGerman but in civil. Every morning when you went to place yourself to go to\nwork, first by the Judenrat, then by the arbeitzen the Germans and the Judenrat\nand they saw that you were there, you were there, you were here. They were only\ninterested in staying and taking you. So naturally I was there almost every day.\nHe knew me very well. All of a sudden, he says to me in German, hey ;\nhey young fellow, what are you doing here? Where is your family. I had my\ngrandmother Ria. Over there, people were separate. I hear yelling, Avum\n\u2014__Avum____, that\u2019s me. Abraham, Avumeral, a little one is Avumeral, a big\none is Ava. David, Davidol. His wife and she is yelling. Her sister with her\nhusband --.",
        "A: Yeah. Avumeral, I look she is yelling. Even now, fire, water, I don\u2019t care, I go.\nTo save someone, I go. My grandmother says where are you going? I says to\nTante _._ They hit me, go back. Her sister and the husband what I mentioned\n10\nand the other brother with a son and the mother, they pulling Liah, come, come,\nwe'll have a good place on the train. They were standing cattle and she, the\nminute, she had a feeling she didn\u2019t want to go, to have a good place. When swhe\nsaw me, then more of it. This going back to that labor department, that guy, he\npulls me out. Where is your family? My grandmother, next to me, and he pulls\nme standing people like by the building where the station is. We standing there\nand the police with guns, they push them to the wagons and us, they turning back\nto go home. While we were going home, they were waiting horse and carriage,\nthey prepared. They callitthe _ from the Polaks. They took people on back\nbut me with my grandmother till what, there was no. So we were walking. As we\nwere walking the four kilometers, we found plenty dead people; all the people\nwhich we knew them very well. Probably they couldn\u2019t walk, they shoot them.\nWe go about three kilometers, almost our town. Our town was on hills but the\nmain town was in a valley. But it was a lot of hill down. When you\u2019re standing\non this side of the town, you could see the whole town until over the other hill.\nWe come and already they call it the w b , the wide mountain. You\ngo into the town, comes along a Polak on his horse and carriage and he says to my\ngrandmother which he knew her when probably they came to buy suits, he says to\nher, Altaruver that means my grandfather was alta, she is Altaruver, die son\nHerschek is home. What did he say? I says, Grandma, you heard what he said.\nWhat, is he joking? They didn\u2019t do enough to us? The Polaks . AS we\ncome on the top of the hill to go down to the town, we see lights in his house. I\nsay grandmother; she says probably the Polaks they already plundering, stealing.\nIt was like half an hour ago, maybe took ten minutes. We come into the house.\nHe is there with his wife and with his children and crying over. the name\nof her sister to have a good place. When I saw you, she says, I didn\u2019t want to go.\nWhat was the reason? Now, we knew the reason after, when we came back.\nWhen that arbeit , 1t means the labor department, a German, he looked\naround, it was like to send away half a town. The Judenrat knew it but we didn\u2019t\nknow it. When he looked around, everybody looked for himself, especially the\nGermans. The German like this, if he wouldn\u2019t have that function, where will he\ngo? in the war. Nobody wanted to go in the war, no matter how patriotic they\nwere, how good it went for them. He had a function in this city, it\u2019s good. He\nlooked around, he saw that there is more than a half gone and who remained?\nOlder people, he wants to have the labor he needs. So he run to the station and he\ntook out the people. Of course we came into his house. Then he says right away,\ngo home to our house. Because in our house, was everything so we went there.\nThat was 1941. Every day, to work, we saw already what the Germans are and so\non and so on. There wasn\u2019t a family that people wasn\u2019t missing. After we found\nout, they took them to Belzec. There, nothing more to hear. What can I say how\nthe turn was black, like in Jewish they say, Schwarz. Every day goes on work in\nthis and that. I worked in the shop. Before they took away, as soon as the\nGermans came in, they took away 21 youths, I show you in the book, our\nhometown. The nicet youth, 21, 22, they took them away in the middle of the\nnight after they ---. So every day to work, it comes for the two. In 1941, broke\nout the war with Russia.\n11",
        "A: June 4, June 21*' I think, I remember it good because in our town, all the\nmachinery, all the Germans, military and everything that the people said look at\nthe road -- it\u2019s lower down almost a meter. Such a and everything. You\nnever saw anything like it and it started the war. When it started the war, it stayed\nin our place where we worked, was a whole, everything to fixing. There came\none soldier with 30, 40 tanks to repair. He begged us, he gave us to eat; slow\ndown, nonsense, slow down, slow down. Because otherwise, as soon as it\nfinished, have to go back. I don\u2019t want to go back. I want to stay with you there.\nEvery day in the morning we went to work. You walked like five, six kilometers\nevery day and in the evening you came home. Sometimes they gave a truck,\nsometimes no. This went on in that place, this went on in that part and we all\nwent to work till they didn\u2019t pay us. They didn\u2019t ask us where you make a living\nfrom and so on and so on. We did some military work especially the youth. A\nyouth like me, they took me, they came in, that means , that means\nbiggest craft mobilization. They came in a train. In the train, all of a sudden, they\ngave us to do. In the train, staying on the rails, (End of Side A)\nBut they were not finished so I was a bricklayer, maurer, they call it and I finished\ninside with the meisters, the way you would describe in Germany. They used to\nlive there. Next to those block, the empty ground, we made a camp. They said\nit\u2019s for Italian prisoners. This is the blocks, nice blocks. Here, for instance, in a\ncamp, they\u2019re working. Is in Israel but I wanted to show you those 21 boys, there\nare some pictures of them. Here it is a picture, they builded a home, our own\nhome in Israel. It\u2019s right by the beach. Whoever comes, we get together; we pray\nthere and one is empty wall. All the names they -- is honored. Cost us plenty\nmoney, we paid for it and we made it. This 1s like, this is the synagogue from our\nhometown. We want it in English because the second generation. They didn\u2019t\nagree with us and now it\u2019s a lot of money and this and that. This is like a street in\nKrasnik. I\u2019m looking for those, ah, memories, memories. See, this is the\nsynagogue. See what they had there, horses.",
        "A: When the Germans came in, yeah. Then it was the ghetto and this is -- inside so\nbeautiful, painted and everything. Twenty-one boys. While we were going, one\ntree, there was a lot of forest around. There were partisans, if you read the story\nmaybe, or you\u2019re familiar with the Monuk, Trawnik1?",
        "A: That Trawniki wasn\u2019t far from us.\n12",
        "A: Our region. Trawniki pointed us to . There is a big story to tell about\nthat. We wanted to go home already. There were partisans around in the big\nforest. We had a few incidents. All of a sudden there is a shooting and the bushes\nare burning. It\u2019s an unusual thing. We ran into the camp, there was no appell,\nnothing, that caused a panic. Every night when we came home, counting, an\nappell; somebody had to be punished or whatsoever. We read the story, good,\ngood, he will forget. That SOB didn\u2019t forget. The next day, yeah, where is that\nswine that he ran away from me? Anyway, we were discussing, me and uncle and\nsome friends around, if he calls you, no. We decided, if he calls you, first of all\nwhen he calls you, . Whatever he say, yessir, yessir, yessir. Don\u2019t say\nnothing else. I wanted to go for him. He says no, I go. He went out, stood like\nthis, Jew swine, you dog. No, first he says, where were you? He says and\nwe made up with that meister, with that German in case he asks to say the same\nthing. He gave him a deal, so you should say that I was calling you and you didn\u2019t\nhear him. In case they ask me, I will say the same thing. They were civilians\nfrom Yugoslav; they were like Germans, they brought them and they were our\nmasters. We worked together and so on and so on. But they were on the free;\nthey had living conditions and so we made up like this. When he went off and---\nWhere were you? So he said, you know the title. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t hear\nyou, my master called me -- that means the meister -- he always had that machine\ncarbine and a whip with end, a weight. You swine, he says, when I am calling\nyou, nobody\u2019s g--d-- business, you have to come to me. Everybody was looking\nin his hands, what he\u2019s taking, either the machine, carbine or the whip. He took\nthe whip. Give him like this over the head. that means disappear. He had\nhere, after the war in Germany, when liberated, a German big doctor told him to\nremove it because that might take cancer. I have here also, you see?",
        "A: But I was tested, it\u2019s nothing. That is an appeal. That\u2019s a story that .",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, that happened already in the camp because 1942 was Judenrein, that means\nclean. Nobody\u2019s under free and that happened in the . Here, also, they\u2019re\nfixing the fence in Krasnik camp. Where they got those pictures, I don\u2019t know.\nHere, you see a horse and wagon and the dead people they put in there and",
        "A: Around September, yes.\n13",
        "A: It happened like this. We were at work. The women and the children were like in\nthe ghetto. The ghetto was around the synagogue. It wasn\u2019t fenced, you can call\nit a ghetto.",
        "A: No, you could get out but where could you go? If you go outside the ghetto, the\nPolak will catch you and bring you to the Gestapo. Then they going to shoot you\nbecause you did something wrong. So there were the children, the women and the\nnon-working people. Otherwise, everybody was, whether in this place working;\nthey were in three places working, which after that they were camps. Naturally,\nyou ask me question, how did we live, from what? We had counts for provision.\nOne evening I come home from work -- yes, so they going to give Judenkarde,\nthat means a \u201cJ\u201d. A J that means Juden. Whoever get the J card is legal. Who\nwill get those J cards? My mother-in-law if I would have it, only a wife and thst\u2019s\nit. So whether it belonged to my grandmother, nowhere. We were hiding her, in\na basement. We brought her down to eat, within the ghetto. One evening I come\nhome for work, I says to my aunt, to uncle\u2019s wife, give me the soup, Pll go down\nto Grandmother and give it. She says I gave her already. What do you mean, you\ngave her. I want to go and see her. Don\u2019t go. I says no. Then she revealed to\nme, they took her away. All those that they didn\u2019t have the J-card, that means the\nwork-card, they took them away. Where they took them away, there is a town, 20\nkilometers, a little, little town. So they took them there. There is less publicity\nand from there the station four kilometers, and from there, it\u2019s gone. But in the\nsame time, when they took them, something was with the partisans, a shooting\nand a lot in the middle of the road. What\u2019s the difference, this way or the other\nway, they got killed or something, bombing, gone. Now remains all the legalized\npeople and all the working people and we are working. From Friday morning, it\nwas Friday morning, yeah I think. Friday morning, that all those up that have the\nJew card, they legalized; they have to go to the public bath. The public bath was\na Jewish bath, for religious purposes, forv cleaning purposes, the bude, the bath.\nThe Jewish, they have to, it was for all kind of purposes. Usually it is a Friday.\nwas working because for the Saturday; all those people have to go that have the\nJew card and clean themselves and so on and there they will get the real card and\nlegalize.",
        "A: It was the Jewish commandant of the town, his name was Piza . He knew\neverything before. Like if he knew something before, he gave a signal to his\nfamily and so it spread a little bit. He, even didn\u2019t know. Friday morning, they\ntook them all to the bath. The minute they took them to the bath , after they were\ninside, they supplied horse and wagons, they calledita =. When they came\n14\nout from bath comes around and says, they put him and also out of\nthat town. We came home Friday from work, nobody\u2019s there. That means it\u2019s\nJudenrein, that means clean of Jews. That was 1942 in September. From there it\nstarted. My uncle they took to Budzyn, me they took to that what I\nsaid and that\u2019s it. If you remained in the city, that means the shtot came, the shtetl\ncame.\nA; They took me to that camp.",
        "A: That was like, I would say, two kilometers. That camp where uncle was, Budzyn,\nwas like four kilometers. After two weeks like or three weeks, they took thirty-\nfive people which I was in the 35 and they brought me to Budzyn, to Uncle. They\nmade a selection themselves. When I came into that camp, was a happy day, a\nblack day. 105 people that day, the minute they went out to work, they selected\nand there was the grave. What I tell you they took from the -- they shoot 105\npeople by the grave --that day I came to Budzyn. My uncle saw me and ---. Since\nthen, \u00b042, they were in Budzyn. So I would like to say we went to the camp, to\nthe camp was -- from the barracks, the camp, to the werk which they called in\nGerman, the werk, that mean the place where we working, all those men and\neverything was like four kilometers. But in the colony where you see those\nbuildings, where those Yugoslavia-German lived, there, all of a sudden I became\na bricklayer. So life fiest what was the fiest on those blocks. The kitchen wasn\u2019t\nlike here, 1t was a brick. They came from Yugoslavia and they lived there. We\nwent ahead and we lived there. That was like ten minutes to the camp\nwhich I told you the story with those bushes were burning. We were there and the\nUkrainian were our guards. It was hell.",
        "A: Budzyn.",
        "A: It was like those barracks, you saw those barracks. No windows, nothing. You\nsaw more or less ---.",
        "A: Fenced, double-fenced, with an electric fence.\n15",
        "A: Electric wire and guards around day and night. Whoever didn\u2019t want to live no\nmore, he went to the wire. Either the wire killed him or the guard killed him. The\nUkrainians were the guards but beside the Ukrainians was the lagerfuhrer, the SS\nman, that Fiess and he has his helper and a few officers but they were with the\nguards. Those Ukrainian guards, they were not allowed to go in the camp. They\nwere allowed their duty, not in the camp. You ask me a question, what did they\nhave a business to go in the camp? there was a lot of business. For instance, you\ncame home -- we had a stock market, as I told you, we had bargain of this. They\ndidn\u2019t have too much to eat so they, from the guard, they came in, not all of them,\nwhoever was duty-free and they was looking by us. Or sometimes, when we\ncame in by the gate, counting so they can pull you out. In the boot, this they were\nallowed and to strip you and to look. Sometimes you find money also. Anything\nyou were not allowed you could find, otherwise, we were not able to survive and\nso on and so on. In 1943, when it was the Warsaw uprising and the rest of the\npeople, they brought to Treblinka. Why I mentioned this? it\u2019s a connection.\nFrom Treblinka, 800 people, they brought to us, to Budzyn in that camp. Eight\nhundred people, well-dressed, they brought them to us, 800. When they\nbrought them to us, so the Ukrainian I\u2019m an old calhoon but those arte the\nnew ones and they knew, the Germans didn\u2019t know so much as the Ukrainians,\nthey knew that they have money and so on and so on. Going in from work, ;\nthat\u2019s a new one, a Ukrainian pulled him out, stripped him --they stripped once\nmy uncle also. They came in, in the barracks. Once, if the lagerfuhrer, that Fiess\nor his helper, adjutant, came in and saw in the guard. And the guard said, this\none, where are they? Right away you guard, you are not allowed to do that \u2014\nshoot him. So they were sleeping, those var people and this and that. Many\ncame over to me, they say this all the time, I\u2019m an honest guy and so on. Abie, do\nme a favor. Here\u2019s 5, 600 zlotys, hide them. Where did you hide them? At\nwotrk. If tomorrow you didn\u2019t go there, -- I had a young fellow, a Yugoslavian.\nHe was a year older than I am. I remember his name, German, which he was my\nmaster, I worked for him. I had to . [hadahiding _, he knew. I\ndidn\u2019t tell him exactly and I had the key. There were no honest people, listen,\nwhen it comes to a piece of bread, it\u2019s a different story. But they saw the honesty\nin me, this one gave me 800 zlotys, this one gave me 500, to hide it every time.\nThey give me and I had it on the top, on the attic in the sand. Once I came there\nand it was dry there, nothing there. Somebody looked, they see what I\u2019m doing,\ncan\u2019t say a word, you got to keep your mouth shut because --. That\u2019s the way\nwhen the Russian people came to us and they were . They told us stories\nfrom Treblinka and so on and so on. Then they decided to liquuidate that camp.\nBefore that liquidation of the camp, all of a sudden, there was typhus. There was\nno water. That was, I think, in 43. There is typhus. Are you surprised?\nWhoever was sick, there were both \u2014 the stomach typhuses and there is a planastic\nlike arash from. I had both. Whoever sick, they took one barrack and there they\nput the people. Every morning that Fiess came in before breakfast. We called his\nmachine gun, this hunsagle. What is a hunsagle, we always called it, he shouldn\u2019t\nunderstand because a lot of Jewish is like German. Hunsagle means like hands-up\n16\nand that carbine, machine carbine looked like it. He\u2019s going already with the --.\nEvery morning he came in and he took us people, he rush them off from the\nbarrack and running. Besides this, there wasn\u2019t those blocks, those blocks you\nsaw. Was block 2, outside from the fence, right across the street. There was that\nblock and in that block was a lazarett. It means a hospital. If you was sick, they\ntook you there. It was like, it was -- in camp was tailor place, shoemaker place, it\nwas for us. But in that block was for the SS. Some people were there and there\nwas a lazarett also. Other times, he took out and he shoot. He was already in the\ntyphus. But listen, he was a man of 35 at that time, 38, a strong guy. He could\nmake it. I was a little kid 18 years old. But we didn\u2019t go that far, we worked in\nthe colony so it was like ten minutes from the camp. Every day I want to work. I\nwent to work. I dsat down, I sit. I couldn\u2019t do nothing. That guy, Brumula, what\nis the hell the matter with you? I said, keep your mouth shut. I was returned like\nthis. He only pray to God he should be an SS man and I should be in his camp. I\nsaid you shouldn\u2019t live to that. His father was one foot shorter and he wass in the\nwerk there and he was an SOB. He brought me to eat from his house. If he\nshould know that, he should spend with me again. It was \u2014 (female voice: it was\nlife or death every minute). So you go into a story. I could not survive to stay in\ncamp, it\u2019s the death. If I would have to go the three, four kilometers to the\nbarrack, but here ---. We had the obermeister, that was the head supervisor from\nthe milers. He was so short, Schultz, a German from Ostowiec. He had here an\nSTP National Organization with the H . He was a good guy, they were\ngood . Not from the Lithuanians, Ukrainians but from the Germans, but\nfortunately I have to say the truth. He comes in, hey Morris to him. What is with\nyour son Brumula. If he\u2019s sick, he has tp. He said to me, meister Schultz, sh --,\nsh --. No he has to stay in the lazarett. That means the hospital. Comes over to\nme, how you feel? I feel all right. You don\u2019t be ask me, you don\u2019t feel right.\nYou got to stay in the hospital. You were not allowed to tell outside what is going\non inside. If they found out, so you know what is the result, what the verdict is.\nBut whoever wanted to find out something, he found out. One day he comes over\nto me, tell you that time I was as tall as him. I know already what\u2019s going on\nhere. I keep my mouth shut. You\u2019re afraid to go because Fiess every time he\nshoots, you\u2019re dead. I don\u2019t say a word. That\u2019s an interesting story. I know\nalready what to do. I don\u2019t answer nothing. What is he going to do but ---. I says\nI\u2019m going, kill, kill me, what\u2019s the difference? He went over to that Fiess and he\ntold me, and Heil Hitler, you know, break bodice. Hey, listen, I have by\nme such a good faulker and so on and so on but he\u2019s thinking he needs a lazarett.\nSo let him go in. He says sh, sh. I won\u2019t guarantee, not in that barrack. I want\nhim in the lazarett. That\u2019s the way he told me the story. I didn\u2019t hear. You stay\ntomorrow in lager and you will go to the lazarett and don\u2019t be afraid of nothing.\nTomorrow they took me into that block 2, to that lazarett. Than that block 2 in\nlazarett in this bed was laying a man probably I have in the picture, that his sister,\nlike that Stochman was from the men, the leader, his sister was from the women.\nHer brother was laying in one bed with something I sign here. They put me next\nto his bed and they also put me in something like 00 I don\u2019t remember what it\nwas, asign. He, as he went to that camp in, how far was it? Across the street\n17\nfrom his location to run around to those people. Then he went to him to the\nlazarett in block 2 also. He comes in, he looks around and he goes away. he\nwanted, usually from there, they didn\u2019t take out. One day, I don\u2019t know that but\nthat\u2019s what they told me, I was in the high fever. You have high fever, you\nshouldn\u2019t know from it, and you don\u2019t know where you stand. Let\u2019s say every\nmorning he came in high bush, v how you feelo? Went away. He saw\nhim going away already, thank God, but I was in very high fever. He came in and\nhe asked something. Instead to say something, I swing with my arm. I don\u2019t\nknow, till today I don\u2019t believe it but the next door man, when he get out, he said\nto my Uncle Morris, you know what your Brumula did? I don\u2019t know of nothing.\nWhen I swung like this, of course I didn\u2019t hit him, he said (female voice: he was\ndelirious) in German, like the gendarme in German, du , that means you\ndog, a swine is like a pig, you had luck. If not for this, I don\u2019t know of nothing. I\ncan\u2019t say nothing. I don\u2019t want even to put in the record because ----.",
        "A: (He was delirious, he had periodic delirtum) That\u2019s what they said. You get out\nfrom the sickness, they give you three, four weeks, you can stay in the camp. A\nbig deal, you can stay in the camp. Everybody wants to get out from the camp.\nThe next day I\u2019m going to work. He sees me, he yells at me. I didn\u2019t answer. He\nwent through 14 days with it. I stood and I worked, that\u2019s all. The same story,\nwhen it came that typhus and everything, Trawniki, what I mentioned, there is\nPl another camp like this. We worked for Henklewerk. Henklewerk is a\nbig air/space ----.",
        "A: They, I don\u2019t know for who they worked. One Sunday, and we heard about\nPl , Trawniki, that they burned the camp because of the typhus, to the\nground. One Sunday, that was in \u201943, yeah, one Sunday, we are not going out to\nwork. The guards like double or tripled who knows. There is standing already\nlittle pumps with gasoline to do us the same thing. People want already to jump\non the wires. They say I rather get killed from the wire that he should kill me.\nAll of a sudden, stop. What is the stop? That Fiess, that lagerfuhrer, he didn\u2019t\nwant to lose his post. As I mentioned, because where is he going to go. In the\nfront, nobody want to go \u2014 all patriots up front. He\u2019s something, had a\nconversation with Lublin with Henklewerk there and Henklewerk stopped it.\nThey called to Germany, to the headquarters whatever that is. I don\u2019t Know thE\nStory goes. The story ends that they stopped, they took away everything and they\ndidn\u2019t burn us.",
        "A: Forty-three, I think, \u00b043.\n18",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Sometime in \u201943. They didn\u2019t and the next day as usual, as before, whoever is\nsick stays in the barracks, whoever is good goes to work, thanks to Henklewerk\nand that SOB Fiess. Then in \u201943, things changed it. That was camp, things\nchanged. We were building the camp in the barrack because to say what will\nhave to go. There is no . They probably were afraid of the partisans\nbecause when we walked to work, a lot of times disappeared and so on and so on.\nThey had to cross the main road and this and that. They brought in a little town\nwhat they were still in that town; they brought them in. so they started to\ndisappear so they figured different. Why here, be there. They build another\ncamp. It became, instead of camp, became KZ. That means concentration camp.\nA lot of them have the KZ. Instead I have the number. In that time, from civil we\nchanged, if it\u2019s concentration camp, we had to change to the stripes.",
        "A: In Budzyn, yes. Some civilian clothes was here marked a KZ. It was something\nand we came to the verrick which you\u2019re familiar with what I mean the verrick.\nIn the same time, no more Ukrainians but SS replaced the guard, no more\nUkrainians. You can imagine SS and we were there. We were there and when it\nstarted more with the war and so on and so on and Germany is squeezed so they\nstarted little by little to liquidate that camp. Because they figured and so on and\nso on. As I said what they did there, they brought tanks, one soldier, we\nhad to fix in the tanks from the Ukrainians\u2019 Russia, they were pigs, dead\nones. which we had a by that and so on and so on. Then from that\nKZ camp which it was in the veld, every time we start fight from that people to\nsend some ;",
        "A: Every time, every time.",
        "A: Yes, yes. One was going to another shtetl, one was going to another shtetl, where\nit was a camp like this. Finally, we are almost the last ones. They were sending\nto M Vv which there is also Henklewerk and there is salt,\nwhere you taking out salt from the ground. There they got the KZ. It remains\nlike the last groups. My uncle knew a little bit that Stochland so he always\nbegged him; written in camp, was like a Jewish shtetl let\u2019s say. We had our\npolice, we had our leaders. Let\u2019s say I had a complaint from you. I went in and I\n19\ncomplained to . In the nice Jewish way that ultimately they should know\nfrom it. So my uncle talked with that Stochland; I would like to go where you go.\nBesides this, if not, I would like you should not separate us, you should know it\u2019s\na father and son. It came before the last group to go where? To Majdanek. He\nsaid to my Uncle Morris, I can\u2019t help no more. I wish I knew where I am going.\nSo far, I don\u2019t know. You see, even which they are here, from one\nfamily, the mother, the husband and wife and two little boys; they survived all.\nHow, if you want to know the story, they survived with my Uncle Morris. The\nboys married, children. He was \u2014 that girl that he was going with in the camp was\nhis wife\u2019s a cousin. They are now in Minneapolis, wherever. So he says to me,\nyou see, even them, not all of them, but few I\u2019m sending this , | can\u2019t help\nmysrlf.",
        "A: To Majdanek. That was in 1944, I think. Yeah, in \u00b044.",
        "A: Early \u00b044.",
        "A: No. Was close ---.",
        "A: It was like 50 kilometers. It was like, you know, those trucks, open trucks and\nwith wires around and the guards standing that you shouldn\u2019t jump around. They\nbrought us to Majdanek. We saw Majdanek, we didn\u2019t see yet. All those guards\nand all those fields. Majdanek, if they didn\u2019t ten fields in a crematorium, they\ndidn\u2019t have nothing. They brought us in to field one. That was a camp set for\nevery field was a different field. In that camp, they took us out to work within the\ncamp. Nobody was there. Across the wires, in another field we saw fellows, one\nwithout an arm, one without a leg, one saw. We didn\u2019t know who they were but\nthey started rumors, they are Russians from the front. They are prisoners,\nwhatever.",
        "A: Yes. But no one, very seldom one was a full guy. Next day they take us on that\nappellplatz and they started. My uncle, he had broken a leg in Budzyn like two,\nthree months before. He was working by the kitchen because they gave him a\nbreak but that time when we went to the work, there was no more on the calendar\nto work. His foot wasn\u2019t so \u2014 so we get out on that appell. It was healed, he\nwasn\u2019t in the hospital at camp, he was healed. They go and they take us to\n20\nMajdanek out the next day and to separate us where to go to work. They call\nschneiders, tailors. Tailors, till he got with me, so many, he\u2019s behind. I didn\u2019t\nwant, I stepped out, want to be together. I didn\u2019t know it\u2019s in the place, I thought\nmaybe they send away. The policy was to look that you should be inside. As I\nsaid, ine fight with the hunger, with the weather, with the cold was ---. But you\ntried, you push yourself. He is behind. I stepped out. They call shoemakers, he\nsays where you going? I said my uncle there. Not his father, the other guy was a\nshoemaker and a shoemaker, he is behind. Finally that was for the SS working,\nfinally they call us in. I got in with him together because it wasn\u2019t too many\npeople. Shoemaker, shoemaker.",
        "A: I and him became a shoemaker, ten people. Ten people, they brought us in a\nbarrack. That\u2019s outside the fields. It\u2019s Majdanek the camp, but Majdanek had\nabout ten fields. Each field was a camp. But this was also a field where the\nwhole administrations are. The magazines with the and so on. Comes\nover a guy, here with a red triangle, red triangle is politicians. Green 1s like us.\nHe was with a high vake. My name is Franz, I\u2019m an arrister. I am from this\nmagazine but I am a prisoner just like you, he said. Arrister. He tells me, I was\nnot in touch with Hitler, you know what that means? To kill him, politic. He is\nfrom \u2014 there is a few guys, you will see them, political, German, Austrian. There\nis little tables like shoemakers\u2019 tables, ten people. Eight by a table there, me with\nmy uncle, he gives to the other table, four and across sitting four, those fellows.\nThose one with one arm. one --- and I know already who they are and another\ntable there. He comes over to me, what is your name? He says I call you\nBrumula. It seems to me by the German, Abraham is Brumula, Brumula, fine.\nWho is he? I says, this is my father. You be the kapo he says, you know what\nmeans kapo. I am the kapo but you\u2019re going to be like the foreman of over those\nten peoples. Say yes. Yes. I didn\u2019t like it. Then he calls me in in his magazine,\nwhole magazine, shoes, clothing and everything. He has the two Russians; they\nstanding with picks and picking these things. You see what they doing? I see.\nYou know why they doing, he tells me. You going to pick like this and the picker\ndon\u2019t go in, either bring 1t to me, whether it\u2019s a shoe or whether it\u2019s a garment or\nrip it and see what\u2019s there. Chances are there is gold. Do the same thing. I do, I\ndo. I don\u2019t find nothing. He took me by the collar and threw me out. Go back to\nyour place there. He brought in bread, this and that every morning, from where\nhe got that bread or whatever, I don\u2019t know. Across the street was the magazine,\nthere was an undersh , a German and another Ss man and there were three,\nfour Polish guys, intellectuals from the colleges which they were also like\nprisoners but in a different way. They were working and this and that. They kept\nrecords and everything. Every morning, he took a wagon, those German wagons\nand he packed himself in. You could, you wouldn\u2019t recognize whether he has in\nthe bag that thing or in the front with food with everything. He put clothing, dirty\nclothing and like horses,us, and we went to the vasherei to the washroom where\nthe women worked. Our women there from our townspeople. He gave them\n21\nbread, water, marmalade this and that enough. Every day like this. I was the -- he\nsaid take a few guys. Anyway, one day he comes over to me. He gives me a boot\nand my uncle one boot. He says Brumula be careful, your father too. I need the\nupper soft -- the bottom, never mind. But you can look maybe. I start to pinch, it\ndon\u2019t go. I\u2019m getting . Those Russians they were already experts. They\nsaw already what -- and my uncle does it the same thing; happens to him the same\nthing. He don\u2019t know what I am doing. When he took out, there is a piece where\nthey were laying in it. He took the pieces but this part of the shoe where it was\ninside, he threw it on the floor. Those Russians, they were so smarter, they were\nlonger than us there; he picked it up. It was their foreman like I was by the Jew.\nHe had one arm like this; he called him over and he shows him that and he\nsays that means 14, 14 pieces. I saw this, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I get\nup from my chair and I go into the magazine and I says to him Frank, I found\nsomething here. How much/ I took out, not all of them. I kept by me three\npieced and I give it to him. How about your father? I says I don\u2019t know. Before\nI says I don\u2019t know and I got back to my seat, that foreman from the Russian, he\ntook down my number, it wasn\u2019t numbers yet, this is in Auschwitz but we had\nhere a number and the uncle, he took down those numbers and went into the\nmagazine and told the over there. He was a Polish-German, he spoke\nPolish what happened here. The minute he comes in and he calls my uncle\u2019s\nname, number, there was no names. Called him and an SS man behind him and\nthey\u2019re taking him across the street in their office. I running to the magazine and\nsays Frank, look what happened here. Don\u2019t be afraid. When they called him in,\nhe took everything out and he put it on the table. You have no more? No. Those\nPolaks, those students back and they call him in.
