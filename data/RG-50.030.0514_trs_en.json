        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: If you pick up a Russian map of New York City, the river is not Hudson River, but Kudson\nRiver. It\u2019s it --",

        "A: -- it literally is so.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So as you know, Poland was dismembered at the end of the 18\" century. The part which\nunder the control of either Prussia or Austria, th-the -- the Jews there are Cohens, with a C-o-h-e-\nn. All the ones who were on -- on the eastern end of it, which 1s most of what used to be Poland,\neastern Poland and so on, ended up as Kaggans, Kogens, Koganovic\u2019s and so on, but --",
        "Q: So that\u2019s how you got your name?",
        "A: And that [indecipherable] name is, if you\u2019Il open up a f -- and -- the Manhattan phone book,\nor -- you\u2019ll find a lot of K-a-g-a-n\u2019s, and so that -- that\u2019s the name.",

        "Q: And what month?",
        "A: July the 20\".",
        "Q: July the 20\", in Wilna, and it was then Poland.",
        "A: Poland. It was -- if you look at the pre -- pre-World War II map of Poland, the only time\nPoland existed as an independent country was from 1918 to 1939, after which it was\ndismembered again. And prior to that it -- it -- 1t wa -- there was the independent Poland since\n1790-something. That\u2019s how we ended up with Koshchensko and Pulaski highways around here.\nThey -- yeah, they were running from -- they were fighting for 1-independence of Poland. Poland\nwas being dismembered, so they had to run. Where did they run? They ran to a country which --\nwhich was trying to -- to -- to liberate itself, or -- or -- or to become independent.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Anyway, there was no independent Poland really, for -- from the end of the 18\" century until\n1918. And in 21 years it disappeared again.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: And was it called Wilno, or Wilna?",
        "A: It was called Wilna in Polish, and Vilna in Yiddish.",
        "Q: In Yiddish, oh.",
        "A: And it was a very active center of Yiddish life. There were 60,000 Jews in Wilna, but they\nhad a very active organizational institutional. For instance, the one scientific institute focused on\nthe history of central European Jewry, and the center for the study of Yiddish as a language was\nestablished in Wilna, it\u2019s called the YIVO.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It is today in New York on -- on -- on West 16\" Street. And -- and that was established there\nand it was there until at the end of it, the -- the -- the Nazi [indecipherable] the Rosenberg\u2019s team\ntook over the yu -- the YIVO and -- and to some extent they -- they salvaged a good part of it,\nand the YIVO has it now in its archives.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The U.S. army found it in -- yeah.",
        "Q: Do you know what the overall population of Wilno -- you said sixt --",
        "A: Two hun -- 200,000 at that time.",
        "Q: And 60,000 were Jews.",
        "A: 60,000 were Jews, and y -- and [indecipherable] probably around 120 or thereabouts\n[indecipherable] were Poles, and I -- I may be off by, but I mean it was -- and -- and a small\nnumber of Lithuanians, Ukrainians and so on. But -- and it -- it has, as far as the Jewish\ncommunity is concerned, it has a very well developed communal intra -- infrastructure. It has\nday -- Jewish day schools, both Yiddish day schools, Hebrew day schools. And it -- it had, as I\nsay, it had a hospital, it had -- it had a very famous library, one of the oldest libraries, Jewish\nlibraries in Europe called the Strashun Library, was located in Wilno. And of course the gowan\nof Wilno, who was the -- was the great rabbinical authority and scholar, and he lived in there\nlatter part of the 18\" century, and to this day there is the -- the -- the home of the Gaon. Gaon is\nthe sage of Wilna is -- is there, and he was actually the -- the spiritual and the -- and the\ntheological head of -- of the [indecipherable] movement which is the one he -- he considered that\nH-Has-Chasidism to be a -- actually a -- an aberration.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because -- because, as you know, the basic Jewish theology is based on interpretation of\nbooks and of -- of commentary, etcetera, etcetera. I\u2019m not autho -- an authority on it, but I\u2019m\nsimply pointing out that Wilno had that tradition.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And in the post-war period, in some ways, if you like analogies [indecipherable] in a sense\nlike -- like Berlin in the Weimar days, in this very short period between Versailles and Hitler, it\nwas -- was really a center of -- of a lot of culture, and [indecipherable] in the Jewish world really\nwas it. Between \u00b018 and -- and \u00b039 in this [indecipherable] period, it was a lot of young poets,\nyou know, K-Kovner and all -- all kinds of others, and -- and writers, and -- and idealogues of all\nkinds, I mean it had every political movement from -- from the Agudas Yisroel, which was the\nvery -- the very Orthodox political movement, and it was a political movement alongside to the -\n- through all the variations for Zionist movements, up to and including the Bund, which was a --\na social democratic labor movement with -- with very strong trade unions and so on, with a very\nactive political life because, for instance, the boards of [indecipherable], the boards of the\ncommunities were boards that were elected in political -- in political campaigns. There were five\nparties or six parties, or whatever it is, throughout Poland. And -- and so th-there was a very\nlively, active -- active youth movement of all kinds, and -- and --",
        "Q: So your life was a very full one when you lived there?",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: What was -- what was your family like? What did your father do?",
        "A: My father was the head of the j -- of the single -- of the one Jewish hospital in Wilna. And our\napartment was on the top floor of that hospital. So as a child I would -- I would look out in the\nwindows and see -- and see patients walking around in the courtyard [indecipherable] and --",
        "Q: Did every religious group have their own hospital? Why was there a Je-Jewish hospital?",
        "A: No, no, no, defin -- no, besides, you should know that Jewish communal life in contrast to this\nc-country was an organized -- the Jewish kehilla -- the Jewish community was an organized,\nlegal entity, like in Germany, for instance, the Gemeinde was an entity under public law, and it --\nand it had the border directors, or -- or wa -- the equivalent, which was elected in these political\nelections.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And dic -- and dic -- and the kehilla and the co-community had institutions; it ha -- it had\norphanages, it had -- it had all types of institutions. The hospital 1n-interestingly enough was\ncreated, I guess, and born as a Jewish hospital, I don\u2019t know how far back. But it was a -- a\nhospital which was also a municipal hospital. In other words, it was under the -- the -- the\nDepartment of Heath of the municipality. But 1t was known as the Jewish hospital.",
        "Q: Was your father a doctor, or -- no. He was -- administrator.",
        "A: No, he was -- administrator.",
        "Q: And -- and did you mother work as well?",
        "A: Not -- not by the time I was born. She was -- she was trained as a teacher. You also have to\nre-remember that my parents were a generation that was educated in Russian schools. Their --\ntheir language of, let\u2019s say of academic education or professional education was Russian. Think\nabout it. until 1917, Ru-Russia, or [indecipherable] whenever it was, until let\u2019s say, the -- the end\nof 1916, the beginning of 1917, when the -- the revolution started and the Russian armies were\npulling eastward, Wilna was -- was under Russian rules for -- for -- for over a hundred years.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Goes back to the [indecipherable]",

        "Q: So what language did you speak at home?",
        "A: Mostly Yiddish.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Although my parents would have a tendency naturally so -- also to -- occasionally to fall back\ninto Russian, but -- but Yiddish was -- Yiddish was really the language of that -- of the\npopulation.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Much older?",
        "A: Yes, well, he was eight years older than I was, and -- and that was it. There [indecipherable]\nthere were two children the -- the -- the f -- it was -- what was -- what do we call it now, a\nnuclear family?",
        "Q: The nuclear family of four, right. And were most of your friends Jewish? Did you live in a\nJewish neighborhood?",
        "A: Yes. I would say that -- I would say that I hardly had any non-Jewish friends. I mean, I have\nknown non-Jews because people in th -- in the staff of the hospital, and -- and nurses and doctors\nand so on. We had very good and friendly relations with -- with people, but -- yet they were not\nsocial relations, they were essentially sort of -- I mean, I was the son of the -- of the boss of the --\nthe hospital and there, of course, as a kid, I -- I -- I moved around, and the -- the people around\nand everybody was -- certainly the people were -- of course we had the -- we had the maid and\nwe had the cook and we had whatever.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Oh yeah, they were -- these were non-Jews.",
        "Q: So you were fairly well off, or was this typical, to have a maid and a cook?",
        "A: Well, I would say by today\u2019s standards, I would say it was upper middle class. I mean, it was\nnot where -- it was -- it was not businessman\u2019s wealth.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I mean, he was a salaried person, but, fact he was relatively well, by the standards --",
        "Q: Standards.",
        "A: -- of the time, compensated, and -- and the apartment that we had was an -- was an apartment\nwhich -- which he had as part of -- of his job. That was on -- it was part of hospital property.",
        "Q: I see.",

        "Q: Yeah, yes.",
        "A: I mean, the big brother -- I -- I mean, if I was five -- when I was five he was already 13 or 12\nor whatever it was. I don\u2019t think the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So it was a big gap between you.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I -- I was -- I guess it was kind of natural, maybe because of the environment, because I\ndon\u2019t know what the notion was, that -- that I was to st -- to study medicine. That was the notion.",
        "Q: That wa -- but, was that yours, or that was your dad\u2019s?",

        "Q: Being in the hospital, I guess, huh?",
        "A: I guess so and -- and y-you should know that Poland had a serious institutionalized anti-\nSemitism as far as higher education is concerned. It had what was almost officially called\n[indecipherable] clauses. A quota system. I don\u2019t know why I should complain about, Harvard\nhad a quota system too, as -- as you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Otherwise Brandeis and -- and -- and Einstein School of Medicine probably don\u2019t be ex -- in\nexistence.

        "A: And they were very militant anti-Semitic student groups in Polish universities, who were\ntrying to compel -- particularly after Hitler came to power, in the 1930\u2019s, which was the time\nclause that -- if I was born in \u201922, so my -- my high school period, or gymnasium, as it is called\nin Europe --",
        "Q: Was -- right, was that --",
        "A: -- and in Poland was -- was in the 30\u2019s, obviously, in the middle 1930\u2019s and -- and so on, were\n-- were pretty openly and aggressive anti-Semitic, and they were trying to compel the students to\nsit on the left side of the classrooms. And the Jewish students obviously [indecipherable]\nrebelled against it, and ended up standing in the back of -- of lecture halls for hours and so on.\nAnd middle class and upper middle class families that wanted their -- their sons and daughters\nwho -- I guess primarily sons maybe, but sons and daughters to get academic education,\nparticularly in medicine and other things, would send these students abroad.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Students were sent to -- to Bologna to study medicine. It-Italy was quite apparently open in\nthat respect, and -- and so on and so it -- it --",
        "Q: Did you stand in the back?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t. You have to figure out in -- by 1939, I was only 17 years old.",

        "Q: Uh-huh, right, right.",
        "A: It was -- it was under the public school system, in other words it had to meet a proper series of\n-- of subjects and examinations which had to be taken in order to obtain what was called a\nmatura, which was called the certificate of graduation of -- of the gymnasium.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Matura [indecipherable] Latin terms o-of -- of maturation.",

        "Q: I think so.",
        "A: -- in those parts of the world.",
        "Q: I think so.",
        "A: And -- and that was k-kind of -- eventually the equivalent of -- probably of junior college\nhere, or something like that. A-Anyway, so it -- th-then the war broke out in September of \u201939,\nand Poland was -- was divided that like all in three parts within two parts.",
        "Q: Two parts, right.",
        "A: And Stalin took over everything east of the Bug river, including -- including obviously,\neventually Wilna and -- and --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and the Baltic states and -- and it was at that point that Wilna was shifted onto Lithuania,\ngoing back to its historic roots and so on, we don\u2019t have to lose time on that at the moment.",
        "Q: Was -- did your father retain his job?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: After the war? But --",
        "A: This -- this -- the -- my father retained -- retained the job and I was still there in -- only 1n a --\nin a transitional peris -- stage, because [indecipherable] a few months after the end of the war,\nmy family and so on decided that -- that -- that I will not be able to pursue proper education and\nso on, and -- and we had family and relatives in this country, and then -- and we were able to --\nto arrange for me to be able to -- to get out.",
        "Q: Did you want to leave? Do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: Did I want to leave?",
        "Q: Yeah. I mean, you were 17 or 18 years old, right?",
        "A: Yeah, I mean, there was -- there was -- I mean, there was the fa -- the family -- the family\nthought that -- that you know, this is gonna be a -- a period of time we\u2019re in -- let you put it this\nway, I grew up in the -- in the atmosphere where people would go to -- to -- to Italy for\n[indecipherable] difference about going to the United States and Italy, but the idea that -- that\nyou went to -- to get your professional education abroad, in Jewish middle class families was not\nsuch a very strange concept.",
        "Q: [coughing] Excuse me, but -- excuse me, but Italy is much closer.",
        "A: Oh, of course, yeah [indecipherable |",
        "Q: You were going to go to the United States --",
        "A: Remember, it was also -- these were times of war, we didn\u2019t know. It was a very un -- a very\nun -- unsettled [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- the whole time. Was not an easy decision, but 1t was made.",
        "Q: It was made. So how did your f -- but, did your father have to get permission for you to leave?",
        "A: At that point you could still -- it was still under -- 1f you look at it there was a -- a very limited\ntime period where Lithuania was still a -- a sort of -- th-the Soviets didn\u2019t completely at once\nmove in with -- with full blast. The -- the -- the embassies and the -- and the consulates and all\nthis were still around, and -- and you could travel eastward.",
        "Q: But not westward, obviously. Westward was --",
        "A: Westward you certainly didn\u2019t travel.",
        "Q: Right. So you -- you were going to take a huge trip.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: But I wasn\u2019t alone, I mean, there were -- there were other people, not -- not -- not thousands,\nbut there were people who -- you know, I wasn't the -- the only Jew with -- with relatives and --\nand -- and visas to -- to get out of -- of -- of Wilna, or of -- or of Lithuania.",
        "Q: And was that fairly easy to get the visa to come to the United States in 19 -- this is 1940, yes?",
        "A: I mean, it was -- it was it -- that the tail end of \u201939 there, it was the early part of --",
        "Q: Of \u00b040.",
        "A: -- of \u201940. I cannot tell you exactly the -- you know, the -- the -- the -- the mechanics of it, but -",
        "Q: Right. Did you travel with any of your friends? Did you know some of these people?",
        "A: No, I mean I -- I\u2019ve go -- you know, you meet people --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- you meet people on trains and so on.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And I moved along with -- I got to know people, and it\u2019s just a long trip. Y- You see, you go --\nyou go on the trains, eventually you go on the Trans-Siberian railroad and so on.",
        "Q: And then you went to Japan?",
        "A: To Japan.",
        "Q: And then to the United States.",
        "A: By ship.",
        "Q: By ship",
        "A: Was that ship. Took quite awhile.",
        "Q: How long did it take you? Four weeks, three weeks, five weeks?",
        "A: No, I had to wait in Japan for th -- because, you know, ships, I cannot tell you, I -- I have -- I\ndidn\u2019t do any research, I only know that I had to wait for awhile. Maybe there wasn\u2019t much\npassenger traffic, or maybe there was traffic and there weren\u2019t too many seats and so on.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But eventually I -- I -- I got -- I got -- I went by ship to -- to -- to west coast, I\u2019m trying to\nthink now which it really was kind of strange, I think it was San Francisco.",
        "Q: You think it was San Francisco?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Probably was.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And then of course I went across by railroad to -- to New York.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s where you had relatives?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: And were these relatives on your mother\u2019s side or your father\u2019s side?",
        "A: Father\u2019s side.",
        "Q: Your father\u2019s side. A brother?",
        "A: No, these were -- these were actually -- these were actually cousins and but they were -- they\nwere close, very close and it was very wonderful for me because I was really received with --",

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: That was quite an entry I can imagine.",
        "A: Oh, the Bronx, remember the Bronx in those days was. if you still go to the Bronx, if you\nknow New York --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: One of the major area, which 1s as -- as big as the Champs-Elys\u00e9e or Broadway was called the\nGrand Concourse.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And the Grand Concourse was a Jewish middle class s-section of New York in the -- in the\n1940\u2019s and the 1930\u2019s.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know, I -- I th -- I th -- not -- not too long, certainly took -- to -- to communicate. I\nthink that I have an ap-aptitude for languages.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I -- I -- Ica -- I seem to be able to absorb it because subsequently when I was in the Air Force,\nand there was a sign down there, and that was specialized training for to -- to study Russian for --\nfor eight months. I loved it and I to -- and to this day we employ a lot of -- of Russian refugees\nand -- and I have no problem understanding them. I speak -- they tell me that I -- that I speak\nrather freely and so on, so --",
        "Q: Huh.",
        "A: It\u2019s --",
        "Q: Did you start school fairly quickly?",
        "A: [ll tell you where the -- what -- what happened was, first of all I wa -- by the time I arrived it\nwas already, I guess mid -- mid-1940 because I -- there was a layover in -- in -- in Japan for\nawhile, and def -- for quite awhile, for a number of months, I was simply with -- with the family\nand -- and just -- just -- just finding my way, in a sense, and that was very good because I didn\u2019t -\n- I didn\u2019t have to -- to -- to worry about, you know, about what just -- by just surviving, or living,\nor whatever it was. And for awhile during the -- during a period where I was sort of, in my mind\nth -- th -- and also in my mind of the -- of the relatives, the idea was that -- that I should have a\nyear or more just to -- to get command of the language and so on and not be plunged into a -- and\nit was interesting, I grew -- you know, I graduated from a school where Yiddish was a -- was one\nof the major languages in Yiddish literature. And they -- I got to know people in New York who\nhad -- and there were -- there were si -- Yiddish Sunday schools in the Bronx and in areas like\nthis. And somebody introduced me to some of these people, and I started earning a bit of money\nby -- by teaching kids in the -- you know, th-they had these -- just as they have Hebrew, quote,\nSunday schools, which are not always Sunday schools, sometimes they were Wednesday and\nSunday mornings.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I started just making some little money out of this, you know, just to -- when at the same\ntime, of course trying to develop my -- my English language skills and so on. And that, believe it\nor not, dragged into \u00b041. It ki -- dragged into -- it was a period of actually about -- 1t ended up\nbeing about 18 -- 18 months or so. Then ca --",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And during this time you\u2019 re living with your relatives?",
        "A: Yes, and then came Pearl Harbor.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And shortly thereafter I -- I went into service.",
        "Q: You -- so you enlisted?",
        "A: Yeah. I was -- I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve also -- you also have to know that by that time, June 21, 1940 wa --\none occurred.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: An-And the -- the Germans invaded -- attacked the Soviet Union, which means they -- within\n-- within a week they were in Wilna. And they were [indecipherable] cut off.",
        "Q: So that must have been very scary. Had you been receiving letters from your parents before?",
        "A: Yeah, I mean, there was a ki-ki-ki -- mail was -- mail was still going -- going across from --\nby that time -- I mean, that part was already under Soviet control, but that doesn\u2019t stop a postcard\nwhich would -- which essential -- essentially would come in Russian to my -- to my aunt, I guess\nit would be, to my fa-father\u2019s cousin.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Wh-Who also grew up in Russian, you know, 1-in Russian schools, you --",
        "Q: Right, right, right.",
        "A: She came to this country, let\u2019s say in -- in -- in 1912, or something like that, so she -- so\nwhatever education she had was -- was in Russian.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So she would get postcards in -- 1n -- in -- in Russian and sometimes it would come in\nYiddish and so on.",
        "Q: So it -- th-the postcard would make the same trip that you did. You went up --",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: -- after a -- after awhile 1t came with Russian postage stamps.",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: And wi-with s-sa -- with -- with s -- s -- S-Soviet stamps.",
        "Q: Why did you decide to enlist, do you think?",
        "A: [indecipherable] I remember by -- a day, it wasn\u2019t very long after -- after June, July and so on,\nof -- of \u201941, that -- that -- that there -- there\u2019s a lot of -- a lot of the ugly th-things began seeping\nout, and -- and it looked like Hitler was just going to -- to rule the world. It was after the London\nblitz, it was after all kinds of things, I mean, I cannot -- it ca -- ca -- ca -- ca -- cannot\n[indecipherable] it was -- anyway, I don\u2019t consider myself a -- what shall I say, a great hero in\nthat sense, I mean it was -- if I would have -- I would a -- I assume if I would have waited a-\nanother six months, I would have probably been in -- drafted anyway, but I mean, th -- I\u2019m not\ntrying to -- to -- to -- to make anything special out of it, but it was in some way to me it was very\nclear that -- that I cannot just si-sit around in New York, and -- and -- and go into a -- into\nuniversity and -- and -- and -- and so on, like -- like -- like where I came from didn\u2019t matter any\nmore.",
        "Q: Right. Were your -- were your relatives upset that you enlisted, or were they supportive, do\nyou think?",
        "A: They were supportive, I mean --",
        "Q: They were.",
        "A: -- I mean, it was -- it was -- I would say -- I was going to say it was always a matter of course.\nOf course, nothing at this stage was a matter of course.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: And it was actually, I mean, between -- between -- it was in -- I guess by the -- by the time all\nthe -- from relatives and everything else, it must have been the -- the late spring of \u201942, or be\nJune or somewhere like that. And -- and then you know, starts basic training, and --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and combat conditioning and on and on and on and on. But one nice day something very\nunusual happened to me.",
        "Q: What?",
        "A: I was pulled out from whatever my unit was, I was in -- in Missouri somewhere, in -- 1n\ncovert conditioning training, which is -- which was just great fun. You get into a foxhole and you\nbend your head and a tank rolls over you so that you would get used to it. And -- but anyway, I\nwas pulled out and given orders to report to -- to a unit in the campus of Syracuse University,\nperiod. I arrived there, and the -- and I reported to a unit that was a s -- an office with a -- a small\noffice with a junior officer and a sergeant over there, and there were another 14 or 13 or 14\nyoung men, and we were assigned to an army specialized training program to study Russian. I\nhad no idea why. It was under -- 1t was under the auspices of the Air Force. And we were --\neverything was done in the army formation, where we marched into a classroom, the door\nopened up and the lady walked in, and she said, my name is Ekatarina Yavonavapastrahova, and\nthis is the last English word you\u2019ll hear from me. This was the beginning of the army\u2019s total\nimmersion program, what the Israelis now call the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Or what Berlitz calls whatever, total immersion. What turned out subsequently, because I\ndidn\u2019t know exactly where -- where it was leading to, but subsequently, I think in Averell\nHarriman\u2019s memoirs or somewhere -- he was our ambassador to the Soviet Union, there is that\nwhole business of the U.S. Air Force wanting to get permission to land our heavy planes from\nsouthern England into Poltava, into -- into the Ukraine, so that there could be deeper penetration\ninto Germany. And Stalin being his paranoid dictator as he was, resis -- resisted it very much, he\ndidn\u2019t want. Every foreigner was a spy by definition, including half of his [indecipherable] was a\nspy as well as, you know? He killed them off one after the other.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But what we -- we were being trained, obviously, to be the liaison unit on the -- on the\nground. And for eight months it was a fantastic experience to this day for me, because she was a\nfirst rate teacher, she was the wife of a white Russian diplomat of the League of Nations, they\nwere in -- after 1917 they were in, you know, from -- from Russia. And they ended up in -- in\nGeneva, with the League of Nations. By 1940 I assume things got uncomfortable for them, so\nthey made their way to the United States and she got a job with the army, teaching -- the army\ntaught languages of every possible language. The army taught -- taught Filipino dialects and so\non be-because that\u2019s to enable -- but in our case it\u2019s was a -- we were supposed to be an\nunderground liaison unit and it was a very interesting experience because in addition to the\nlanguage and in addition to subjecting us to have to -- to learn the bible of the Soviet political\nparty, which is called the history of the Communist party of the -- of the USSR, as they called it,\nwhich was in [indecipherable] Russian, she taught us literary Russian, and she taught us Russian\nhistory. So a -- a-after 18 and a half months, one nice day the door opened up and this lieutenant\ntold us the program is finished, no explanation. In wartime in the army you get no explanation,\nyou get orders. We were shipped off to a -- to s -- north -- G-Greensboro, North Carolina, as a --\nGreensboro is either in North Carolina or South Carolina, you\u2019ll have to correct me on that one.\nAnd this was a big staging area and we was shipped off to southern England and by the\nbeginning of May of 1944, I was in southern England with probably close to a million or so of\nother American troops, getting ready for the invasion. And as I was in the Air Force, I was lucky,\nI never got my feet wet.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: On -- on -- on [indecipherable] three I was flown over from southern England to Normandy.\nAnd I was assigned to a -- what was called a fighter bomber unit, which 1s a -- a u -- a unit of\nplanes with a single pilot. One pilot wou -- cou-could dive-bomb to give close support to\ninfantry. So we were always 10 kilometers behind the infantry people, who were --",
        "Q: Were you flying?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I was, I gather because of my language training and so on, I must have been classified in there\nfor s-something to do with Intelligence.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So I was assigned to the Intelligence unit of that particular fighter bomber unit in th -- in -- in\nthe Air Force. And my job was to brief the pilots every morning on whatever missions they had,\nand that was it. And y-y -- don\u2019t know when [indecipherable] airfields and we had at that time\nstill a segregated army. The black engineers were there 24 hours ahead of us, and they leveled\noff the [indecipherable] of Normandy. And later on a temporary airfield consisted of heavy metal\nrolls, and which -- which gave traction to the -- to the planes when they landed. But of course,\nNormandy 1s also -- has a lot of clay, so when it rained the metal would sink and our planes\nwould flop over, but we always had enough trucks and [indecipherable] and so on, that that\nwasn\u2019t -- anyway, we were -- we -- I was from -- from [indecipherable] three onward with --\nwith the -- with the whole invasion of Normandy, and we -- we had some experiences, but that\u2019s\n-- am n -- I am not -- and I don\u2019t belong to the war veterans, who are busy talking about their --\ntheir army exploits. Anyway, it was -- I went through the whole business and we had some tough\ntimes because in the beginning the Luftwaffe still was very strong, and they would -- they would\ntry to bomb the -- the beaches, because in order to be able to supply the forces, the beaches had\nto be lit up 24 hours a day, but they had tremendous anti-aircraft protection. But we were -- but\nwe were -- be 10 kilometers behind, deeper into the country. We did not have all this protection,\nso whatever they couldn\u2019t drop on the beaches, they dropped on us. But -- but obviously I -- I\nsurvived, and most of us did. The pilot -- the pilots is another story. And -- and then we -- we\nbroke through and we went through France and through the Battle of the Bulge and saw all these\nother things that you can read in the -- in the history of that period, and we -- then we inc -- w-we\ngot into Germany, and -- and we went all the way, as I said you, to the Elbe river, waiting for --",
        "Q: Directions.",
        "A: -- directions to come.",
        "Q: Right. So were you actually fighting in certain areas, or were you just -- not just, but you were\nvulnerable to being bombed?",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you e-exactly that an Air Force unit is in the airfield with planes, which are\nbeing fueled up and maintained --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- all the time. They go out on missions. Their missions are to provide support the infantry\nwhich means they -- they have to attack whatever moves on the other side of --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- whatever the front line is. And they come back, and they have to report on what they doing,\nthese reports have to go back. We are also being the most forward th -- A-American airfield who\nare on the receiving end of all the big planes that were coming back with dead and wounded on\nit.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Because th-the -- the -- the -- I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t -- I can just that I can tell you I don\u2019t want to\ntalk about it, it -- basically the heavy bombers, they were huge planes with four engines and they\nhad maybe eight -- eight or nine crews of -- per -- per plane. And they would fly in -- in -- in\nwaves of several hundred at a time, to protect each other and so on against fight [indecipherable]\nagainst the Luftwaffe and so on. And they would go into German cities and factories and\nwhatever it is, and -- and bomb them, that\u2019s what they did. When I eventually -- after the war I\nhad to fly in from Frankfurt to Berlin, I could look into the basement of every building.",
        "Q: Yes, right.",
        "A: Cause we managed to -- to burn through every -- every -- now, of course they, many of them\nwould have to go back damaged, for when the aircraft and the people wounded and dead over\nthere, it is probably the nearest air -- airfield, so it is -- they would come back, they would put\nout flares, and we would know whether we were dead or wounded or whether there\u2019s a serious\nmechanical problem. They would land at our airfield because we were the closest. We were not\nthe only ones, all of these close report fighter units were along the front lines 1n these places, part\nof which I was to debrief them and so on.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: During the Battle of the Bulge, we were physically attacked by the Luftwaffe, this -- this was\n[indecipherable]. And we had to, of course, protect ourselves as we did in s -- and then they were\nshot down and I had to be involved in the interrogation of them and so on, but this is what you\ndid.",
        "Q: Cause you were fluent in German also?",
        "A: Oh, that helped.",
        "Q: Yeah, yes.",
        "A: A -- very --",
        "Q: Yes, if you were going to do interrogation, right?",
        "A: The funny part of the -- of the German was in -- in that particular e-episode, which is a very\nfamous one if you read the -- the history of the Battle of the Bulge in December, that was the last\nattempt German General Rundstedt would try, they thought they could really break through and\ngo to the -- and they gave us a rough time, and it was -- you -- you\u2019ll -- you\u2019Il read about it if you\nread that history. They surrounded a -- wa -- one of the famous paratroop units, 101*' airborne\nand so on, and we were -- th-the unit was totally surrounded, you can read all about it. And th-the\nGerman general send the -- a unit with the right flag to talk to the -- to the general who is the\nhead of the airborne th-that th-th-they should surrender, and the great joke was, and that\u2019s a fact,\nh-he -- he said -- he told whoever was on our side, he\u2019s -- who was only a German, he said, tell\nhim in English, nuts to their offer. And the joke was literally that the -- th-the -- the Germans\nwent back and translated that into nusa, meaning nuts are to eat, and they didn't know what the\nhell he was [indecipherable] was, but -- but basically what I\u2019m trying to tell you basically is that\nthat was -- that was the grimmest part of it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they dropped paratroopers in American uniforms, consisting of -- of American high\nschool graduates whose parents were part of the German American Bund.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And in the 1930\u2019s they were -- you know -- you know, there were rallies of the German\nAmerican Bund, 20,000 strong in the -- in the ca -- Madison Square Garden. And some of them -\n- and some of them emigrated to -- to Nazi Germany, and took their teenage children with them,\nwho spoke fluent -- they were am -- American kids, they --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- they have no accent, nothing. Some of those were mobilized and put into American\nuniforms by the Germans and dropped as paratroopers behind our lines and did a lot of damage.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: We had among our people German Jewish refugees with German accents as thick as -- as a\nknockwurst, and -- and th -- and the MP\u2019s who became aware of this business started stopping\nJeeps along the way, and suddenly they would pick up somebody with a heavy German accent,\nso that they would take him into an MP -- military police stockade, and we would get a call,\ntelephone call, do you have a Hans Rosenfeld in your unit? If you do, then you better come and\nbail him out. But that was all part of -- of the -- that was the last big episode that -- we had some\ncasualties obviously, but then the war came to an end.",
        "Q: Were -- were you during this period hearing about what the -- the Germans were doing in\noccupied territory with Jews and with others, that there was mass killing?",
        "A: Oh, we were totally dependent upon something which was the -- the -- the aring -- the army\nnewspapers.",
        "Q: The \u201cStars and Stripes\u2019?",
        "A: The g -- \u201cStars and Stripes\u201d, and the radios. And they reported whatever was reportable, but\nwhat we saw, of course, was moved into Germany, and we began liberating, you know, these\ntowns and so on, we begin to see people out of the labor camps, and then walking on the streets\nwith -- with -- with people who -- who -- who turned to us and -- and -- and so on, that we -- we\nknew. We -- we -- we saw what was going on, plus -- plus a -- obviously th-th-thin -- the \u201cStars\nand Stripes\u201d had quite a few reports. I di -- I knew one thing which was very important to me\npersonally because my father was the only member of the family who -- who survived, and he\nsurvived by a fluke. He survived by ending up in eastern Russia.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: And -- and from time to time he was able to send a postcard to my aunt in -- in New York,\nand she would forward it on. So I knew that -- I knew that he was alive, but totally cut off from\nWilna and cut off from the rest of the family. That -- that I knew.",
        "Q: And that you knew at the end of the war.",
        "A: That I knew even after -- after the Normandy landing [indecipherable]",

        "A: I mean the -- if you look in retrospect, there are people who survived Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Yes. Right. So who knew? So you\u2019re in Europe -- you\u2019re in Germany when the war ends, is\nthat correct?",
        "A: Right. And the U.S. State Department comes across -- comes around with a mission to recruit\nyoung foreign service officers for American military government administration.",
        "Q: And you say okay?",
        "A: They obviously also must have had some kind of list. Whether it had to do with -- with my\nbackground by now, I have no idea, but I -- y-you know, if -- it\u2019s r-really peculiar, I -- I don\u2019t\nrecall the precise incident. It was at the point where it was maybe the end of -- maybe beginning\nof June, something like that.",

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",

After all the war with -- with -- in -- with Japan was still on, if -- as you\nknow, until the middle of August. One didn\u2019t know at that time when the war will end, anyway.\nOr whether one will begin to begin to be sent back home for -- to be demobilized or whatever.\nAnd I was approached and I said yes. There was -- there was nothing at that point for me in a\nsense, in a sense, to go back to.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: All I knew is that my father was somewhere in -- in the depth of Asiatic Russia. I was -- I had\nto -- to assume always the worst as far as the rest of my family 1s concerned.

I was -- I was officially discharged from the army, assigned to military government\nadministration and I was -- and I had to travel to Frankfurt to report to a unit of the finance\ndivision of the office of military government, U.S. for short OMGUS, O-M-G-U-S, that was its\nofficial name, and all of the documents and so on. And I was assigned to a -- to the -- to the unit\nwithin the finance division, who was supposed to do res-research on the German banking system\nduring the Nazi period, for two purposes. One, because the United States military government\ncame in with a program of decentralization and -- and decartelization of the whole German\nfinancial and economic system because that was, of course, also the -- the interlocking\ndirectorates of the banks and big industry and so on is a concentrated for -- element and force in -\n- in -- in helping the Nazi regime to -- to -- to prosper and to -- and to the military to be able to.\nAnd then of course as an instrument subsequently of -- of looting the occupied countries of -- of\nEurope.",

        "A: And -- and the other part of it is to develop whatever material could develop to send to the --\nto Nuremberg for the worker\u2019s trials, which had economic elements to it. I mean, the head of the\nReichsbank, Mr. Schacht, and the Chief Economics Minister Funk, and the others were part of\nthat -- of the Goering trial, and so on. And it was at that point where I began to develop working\ncontacts and working relationships with the prosecutors in -- in Nuremberg, whi -- that led later\non to a very close working relationship in connection with the first restitution program in the\nAmerican zone.",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And we -- there -- there were massive records in a place called Offenbach, which was about\neight kilometers from -- from the heart of Frankfurt. My first office in Frankfurt was in the\nbuilding of the Reichsbank branch, which is like the Federal Reserve bank. In Frankfurt that\nbuilding is still there, and of course the great luxury that I acquired and from which I didn\u2019t want\nto part was a -- was a rocking chair. After -- after a couple of years of army service in a tent in\nother places, the rocking chair was something special anyway. But that is what we did for several\nmonths, and that was also during the period when the Soviets, as you know, would not let the\nAmerican forces into Berlin. Although officially, according to the Alta agreement, we were\nsupposed to be in Berlin practically from the beginning, the Soviets needed a couple of months\nto -- to loot, rape and whatever. And -- and so I wer -- I worked out of Frankfurt until the\nbeginning of January, by which time already the military governor of -- was -- our military\ngovernor was -- was already in Berlin. His name was General Lucius Clay. And all the other\nmilitary governors were sitting there, and there was, at that time still that instrument which was\nsupposed to be the coordinating instrument, using the Russian term kommandatura, spelled with\na K, and that had to be -- that was part of our of-official vocabulary, and -- and I was then\ndirected to move from Frankfurt to Berlin, and I moved there in January of 1946. Berlin was in a\nshambles, of course. It was a very cold winter. The U.S. army did some lovely things for the\ncivilian population. Had tents on crossings and little islands with army potbelly stoves that were\ngoing all the time so people could go in and warm their hands, which I thought was -- was proper\nhumane thing to do and -- and -- and we did it. In any event, I was then assigned to the\nIntelligence division of the finance department, and my first assignment involved the writing of a\nreport on the largest of the German banks, which was called the Deutsche bank. The Germans\nhad three major banks. They were called the gross bank and the giant banks, that was the official\nGerman terminology. And that was the Deutsche bank, the Dresdner bank and the Commerce\nbank. Deutsche is deutsche in German and Dresdner is based on the city of Dresden, and\nCommerce is commerce. And they were in -- in that order in the size, and of course once we --\nwe got into their -- their records and -- and we interrogated a lot of people, and the picture was\nvery clear, they -- they -- the first step was the -- the [indecipherable] of the banking system, ri --\nright after January 30, 1933 when Hitler came to power, started the removal of -- of Jews from\nleading positions in the banking system, both in the -- in the board of directors, which was called\nthe [indecipherable] and the board of management, which 1s called the Vorstand. In this way, by\nthe way, is -- 1s with a V, written as a V and pronounced as a V. Vorstand, V-o-r-s-t-a-n-d. They\nremoved the Jews, there were -- there were prominent Jews as bankers, and prominent Jews on --\non the boards of directors and so on. That was the first step of elimination. Then the banks\nproceeded to Aryanize, to take over control of -- of many of the private banks which were Jewish\nowned. Germany had a -- a -- a whole series, starting with the Rothschild banks of course, but\nover the years private banks quite well known, Mendelssohn and -- and Aufweiser and etcetera,\netcetera, and Oppenheimer and so on. [indecipherable] up and down, and with the Aryanization\nof those banks and became instruments of the Aryanization of Jewish businesses. And that they\ndid very effectively and very e-e-efficiently between then -- \u00b033 and -- and -- and \u00b038 - \u00b039. And\nthen as -- as the war broke out, and particular it started first with the anschluss of Austria in\nMarch of 1938, the Deutsche bank moved in and took over the largest Austrian bank. The\nDresdner bank moved in and took over the second largest Austrian bank, called the Lander bank,\nthe first one was the [indecipherable], I mean, I -- I won\u2019t b-bore you with all this, but yeah, this\nis now what, \u201946, we did all this. And -- and so -- and so they went when th -- when -- when\nSudetenland was taken over and subsequently Czechoslovakia, the Deutsche bank took over the\nlargest --",
        "Q: Largest.",
        "A: -- Czech bank and so on, very systematic, very orderly. And there was even a sort of a --\nbecame almost like a little rhyme, it -- 1t rhymes in German. Zuerst kommen die tanken, first\ncome the tanks, and then kommen die banken, and then come the banks. That rhymes in German,\nobviously, the tanken and banken rhyme. But it was like [indecipherable] the same thing applied\nto western Europe. When they moved into Belgium they took the control of the major banks,\nthey di -- took control in -- in Holland, etcetera. And so the first report was the report on the\nactivities of the Deutsche bank, and simultaneously the Dresdner bank w -- very -- it was a --\nwhere they -- a special unit, and I was part of it, and somewhere along the way I -- I was given\nmore responsibility and -- and in some of the subsequent investigations, I was the chief\ninvestigator of it and so on, and in any event, the objective of these reports was that th-the -- the\nmilitary government had to establish a policy on what is -- what kind of a bank is this\n[indecipherable]. One thing was very clear, that A, we will not allow a -- a intermingling of\nbanking and industrial corporations, because the German system, particular the -- the Nazi period\nis that the major banks ended up being the -- providing the chairmanships of the main major\nindustrial companies. It was a real intertwining of interlocking directorates, it 1s called in the\ndecartelization world. And in addition to that, we came with a tradition of decentralized banking\nin this country. In the state of New York at that time, believe it or not, Chase Manhattan had no\nright to have a branch in Buffalo.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: The state of New York was divided into banking districts, and if a bank was in Manhattan and\nin the Manhattan district of banking, it could not be in Buffalo and it could not be in Syracuse in\nthose days. So the whole idea of -- of extreme decentralization of banking, very important\n[indecipherable] anyways, but in this case it was important not to allow the reconstitution of -- of\nthe instruments which were important instruments in the whole Nazi program of -- of -- of -- of\ncontrol and -- and -- and centralization of economic power.",
        "Q: So the research that you and your colleagues were doing were absolutely essential --",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: -- to -- to being able to make a decision like that.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: A-And we -- and -- and then of course, in this process was -- was more than that. These\npeople were responsible for -- for economic war crimes. This was -- this is called spoliation. This\nis a concept in -- in international law. And -- and Aryanization, which was taken -- was carried\nout, financed with the major banks involved the periodic arrests of the Jewish owners into\nGestapo jails and say, you know, you either sign or -- or you gotta spend the rest of your life over\nthere. And all of this was [indecipherable] it was -- it was made possible with the funding of -- of\nthe banks, of the -- the -- of the banks. And it was not only confined to the big ones, there were\nsmaller banks and so on. In any event, subsequently I was assigned and -- and I became the -- the\nchief of financial Intelligence of the U.S. military government for Germany, at -- at a rather\ntender age, but anyway, this is --",
        "Q: Yes, you were what, 23 years old, or 24?",
        "A: No, I was -- I was [indecipherable] by that time in 1948, I was an --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- old man of -- of --",
        "Q: 28.",
        "A: -- of -- of 26.",
        "Q: Six, 26, right, a real old man.",
        "A: Look, 1 -- nothing was known in those days.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: The army had a rule, I -- I don\u2019t know whether the rule applies still today. You get an\nassignment, they throw you in the water. If you swim, then you -- then you swim and then you\nmove. And it makes no difference, you\u2019re 26, you\u2019re -- you\u2019re -- you\u2019re 36, if you sink, you\u2019re\nout.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Anyway, somebody -- somebody decided that -- that I didn\u2019t sink. And that -- and in the\nmeantime, of course, other things are -- beca -- became very important. The -- in conne -- in\nconnection with the whole process of Aryanization and so on, there was very serious\nnegotiations on the part of the Jewish organizations in Washington. With the -- the -- remember,\nmilitary government was under the -- under the War Department.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Not the State Department --",
        "Q: Not the State.",
        "A: -- the War Department.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Although the State Department had a senior political officer, there was General Clay, and\nthere was a senior State Department official as the political officer. But General Clay was here.\nAnd -- and then negotiations were going on for property restitution, the -- there was an\norganization that had to be -- the Jewish organizations properly advanced this whole issue. And\nthe major battle, and that was -- that was one of the great, basic, historic developments, which\nwas historic in the whole international law. In the normal, civilized life, if I die tomorrow in the\nstate of New York without heirs, the state of New York inherits me. You can go back to the\n[indecipherable] of 2,000 years plus, and you will find the principle intended for normal,\ncivilized societies. The Jewish organizations came to the U.S. government and said, that is not\nacceptable after the extermination of six million Jews. The successor -- the successor state of the\nThird Reich cannot become the beneficiary of the efficiency of their extermination program. I\nmean, you can go back to the -- to the old Biblical expression, you cannot mur-murder and\ninherit. And -- but that was a difficult battle, because the battle had to be th-the battle with\ninternational lawyers who said, too bad, this is ironclad concept and it cannot be a-any other\nway. And reparations -- remember historically, if you go back to World War I and so on, it was\nalways an issue between states. The -- the victorious state could exact reparations from the --\nfrom that state wa -- which was defeated, but it was always interstate dealings.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Here obviously we were coming with -- the organizations were coming with demands for\nrestitution programs to individuals, regardless of what their nationality may be at the -- at the\nmoment that [indecipherable] had to be done, but most importantly with respect to the heir list,\nand unclaimed Jewish property, and to the property of Jewish communities and organizations\nthat were obliterated by the Nazi regime, that -- that it -- 1t could not [indecipherable] is the legal\nexpression is to this -- to the state in which the property was located. That took a long time and a\nlong fight, but the Jewish organizations prevailed, and the U.S. government agreed, and the first\nproperty restitution law was enacted as a United States military government law number 59, in\nNovember of 1947. And in that law there is a provision which says, unclaimed property of\nvictims of Nazi persecution as defined in the beginning of the law, shall accrue to a successor\norganization, which shall use the proceeds for the benefit of the class of persecutees.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: And this was a genuine revolutionary concept and development in international law. And it is\nto the everlasting credit, as far as I\u2019m concerned, of the United States government, that stood up\nall by itself, because I\u2019Il tell you in a moment for how long it stood up all by itself. The British\nand the French did not go along initially with this concept, and enacted this as valid for the\nAmericans [indecipherable] of Germany.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: There was no central government in Germany until the fall of 1949. Between \u00b045 and \u201949\nthere was no central government. Every military governor was the absolute ruler of his zone of\noccupation and this sector of Berlin. And there were municipal governments, and there\neventually were state governments, you know, Bavaria and Hassen and whatever. But there was\nno central government until four -- for over four years. And in November of 1947, this law was\nenacted in the American zone of Germany. American zone of Germany to give you an idea in\npresent day -- day Germany was cities like Frankfurt and Munich and Nuremberg and -- and\nKassel and Bremen as a port, and Stuttgart and etcetera, I mean it -- it was sort of the center of\nthe -- the British had th-the -- the industrial heart of Germany, the whole -- the Dusseldorf and\nCologne and the coal mines and the steel mills and so on, and Hamburg. And the French had the\nmost western part, bordering on Alsace, and -- on Alsatia and Alsace and -- and then -- and on\nthe lake area and so on, and the Black Forest, the Schwarzweld and so on, they had -- they had\nnice countryside, but that -- they, of course, were the smallest of the -- of the zones. When that\nwas enacted, General Clay wanted the British and the French, his counterparts to enact a similar\nlaw -- laws for their zones so there would be a single property restitution law in West Germany.\nThe Soviets you could forget about, they were not interested in private property, they were not\ninterested in the whole concept of compensation and restitution and so on. There was nothing to\ntalk about with them. The British and the French would not go along. Th-This was not in their --\nthe military governors obviously ca -- don\u2019t make these decisions, the decisions go back to the\ngovernments. And in the case of the governments, it of course goes to the foreign office in\nLondon, and to the [indecipherable] in Paris. The international lawyers over there said, no how.\nSo General Clay went in and -- and promulgated it in the American zone, and the Jewish\norganizations established in New York the first si -- Jewish successor organization called the\nJewish Restitution Success Organization, or JRSO for short.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That was created almost at the same time when the law was enacted, it was in the last\nNovember of \u00b047, but it didn\u2019t come into real operation until the late spring of \u201948 because -- and\nthat is very difficult for us imag -- to imagine today -- you could not create from the outside any\nkind of an operation in the occupied parts of Germany unless you were somehow hooked up to\nmilitary government. You couldn\u2019t get housing, you couldn\u2019t get access to food, you couldn't --\nyou -- you could not function, ordinarily. So the -- the Jewish organizations, primarily the Joint\nDistribution Committee, which was -- had a massive operation in Germany because they were\nrunning the Jewish Displaced Persons camps. My s -- first contacts with the Joint were in the\nspring of 1946 in Berlin, because within a month or so when I came to Berlin, I discovered that\nthere was a Jewish Displaced Persons camp in the American sector of Berlin called Zehlendorf.\nSo of course I ber -- I marched myself over to Zehlendorf and I br -- and I met my JDC friends\nfrom that point on. And I would go to the army post exchange and buy cartons of cigarettes at a\ndollar -- Camels at a dollar apiece, 10 cents a pack, and schlep it to the -- to the DP camp\nbecause that was the currency, the reichsmark didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- didn\u2019t mean very much. I had to deliver the [indecipherable] she was the happiest woman,\nshe would get two ca -- two cartons of Camels a week. She was a rich woman in Berlin in those\ndays. Anyway, so if -- the JDC then was very much involved in establishing the JRSO, so they\nsent the general consul to the -- to -- of the JDC to two people, to Ben Ferencz in Nuremberg\nwho had just finished being the prosecutor of the Einsatzgruppen. And I don\u2019t have to tell you\nthe Einsatzgruppen was the most organized killer organization that went -- that went right behind\nthe ar -- the German army after June 1941, and every day would telegraph a report, so many\nJews and so many Bolsheviks, and of course they did [indecipherable] and a few other nice\nplaces like that. And -- and he just finished his tour of duty -- I mean his -- the -- the -- the\nEinsatzgruppen trial, and by the way, hi-his was the only trial which sent the largest number of\nSS officers and generals to the gallows. And we -- Ben -- Benny and I know each other from --\nalready from before in terms of -- of the -- of my -- my feeding them material on the -- out of the\neconomic records. At that point we were blockaded by Stalin. In the spring of 1948, Joseph\nStalin thought that the moment has come to try and push us out of Berlin as the beginning of\npushing us out of Germany and western Europe. The Communist parties of France were\npowerful. The Communist parties of Italy were powerful, and it was -- economic conditions were\nterrible. Marshall plan was just beginning to -- to -- to get into full gear, and Stalin thought this\nwas a good moment. So he cut off rail access to -- to -- to West Berlin, and water access, you\nknow, there were canals and so on that would go into Berlin. And there was -- if you -- if you go\ninto the histories, you can read and find that there was serious discussion in Washington as to\nwhether or not the U.S. and the western powers should pull out of Berlin and give him -- give\nhim -- and give Stalin [indecipherable]. It was Clay who went to Harry Truman and came up\nwith the idea of the airlift. And from that -- and that coincided with something else, I mean that\u2019s\nthe reason I say to you that -- that some of the historic context of how some of these things that\nwe are talking about [indecipherable] today were born, have not been properly and in depth\nresearched and put in the proper context. Simultaneously, in order to begin to rebuild the\neconomy of -- of West Germany, the allied powers [indecipherable] when they talk about the\nallied powers, you ca -- have to assume the U.S. being in the lead. The U.S. was in the lead miles\nahead of everybody else. We were strongest militarily, economically, we were [indecipherable |\nas a country, we -- you know, the British and -- and the French and so on were -- were physically\nand otherwise exhausted. And a -- the decision was made to in -- to introduce the deutsche mark,\nthe idea being that you introduce a new currency and you build a new economy base.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And the new currency was introduced in June of 1948. [indecipherable] it takes a year for\nsuch a decision to be implemented. The first deutsche marks were printed by the American bank\nnote company in the United States. I mean, if you have to project yourself to -- to this whole time",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- who -- who would anticipated in the spring of \u201948 that Stalin will decide to blockade us in\nBerlin and we would have to protect the new currency from falling into the wrong hands. There\nwas no Berlin wall at that time, and the Communist party of West Germany was swimming in\nreichsmarks. There were Bavarian villages that never in the Weimar Republic ever had the\nCommunist vote, that had a small Communist party office, because when the Soviets moved into\neast Germany and so on, they cleaned out every German bank that was there, Reichsbank, and so\non, and they had railroads full of reichsmark. And although the reichsmark didn\u2019t have great\nvalue, but mountains of them would still some value, and we introduced the mark -- the deutsche\nmark and there\u2019s -- and there\u2019s -- if you read the papers from that time, the hens began laying\neggs overnight. Suddenly, suddenly goods and things began coming up and the economy began\nto -- to -- to develop and so on, and the Soviets were trying desperately to -- to -- to lay their\nhands on this currency. And we had to -- we had to run an economy of the western sectors of\nBerlin with a majority of the va -- population unemployed, with airlifted coal and airlifted goods,\nand to keep the -- this economy going, and to protect our currency from -- from being depleted.\nAnd suddenly I found myself as the chief of financial Intelligence of military government to be\nresponsible for doing things that nobody has ever been taught in the -- in the economics school,\nand never probably taught again.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: May I call you Saul?",
        "A: By all means.",
        "Q: When -- when we were talking in between the tapes, you started to talk about the fact that you\nthought you were talking too much about Saul Kagan, about yourself, and not about the issue\nthat was most important to you. So tell me what you think is the really important issue here, with\nrespect to this interview.",
        "A: As I see it, and it -- and you can say eventually it is subjective because of -- of my own\nimmersion in this -- in this whole area. But as I -- as I keep thinking over the years that there is\none area which in my judgment is that had been fully and properly researched and -- and\nexamined, and that is what were the particular forces and elements in the -- in the lil -- late\n1930\u2019s and the early 1940\u2019s that -- that made it possible for organized world Jewry, and I use -- I\nsay organized because unless -- unless something is organized, unless there 1s some sort of an\ninstrumentality, then it is a lot of conversation. Maybe conversation 1s important, yo-you -- you\nmay not come to the -- to the action before -- be-before you -- before you -- you -- you\ncontemplate the problem, but nonetheless, for the first time -- and I\u2019m not a professional\nhistorian, so I say it with all these caveats and reservations, but I think it\u2019s the first time where\nthe organized Jewish community in this global sense has -- has decided, in response to -- to 1n-\nincredible tragedy that has befallen the Jewish people, to -- to confront the perpetrators or -- or\ntheir successors. Because if I go back, at least to the extent which -- and I have spent obviously,\ntime going back to -- to periods of -- of disaster and catastrophe in Jewish life, there was an\nevent, or events of -- of persecution and of -- and of physical damaging injury and -- and murder\nwith the survivors ultimately going into some kind of exile or into some -- away from wherever\nit is, leaving behind all their worldly goods, basically, and building a new life and a new\nexistence and new communities in hope that -- that it will not be destroyed or damaged again.\nAnd you see rip -- that repeatedly but frequently enough, whether you go back to the destructions\nof the temple, the -- the temples of the -- of the Babylonian period or -- or s -- or subsequently in\nthe -- in the Middle Ages, the pogroms and the Crusaders and the period about -- which Barbara\nTuchman described in -- in -- in some of her books and so on, what you saw was, the Jews\npicked themselves up from the area where the Crusaders and so on persecuted them. Fortunately\nthe kings of Poland wanted -- needed craftsmen, and that in -- created an open door, and the Jews\nwere moved from the Rhine area into Poland, etcetera and a new chapter in Jewish history\nopened up [indecipherable] Jewish community in Poland, in eastern Europe and so on. And --\nand -- and then subsequently came all kinds of -- forms of persecution, some of them --\nobviously 1492 in Spain, and again the Jews ran and left everything behind and build new lives\nand -- and those who were caught by the Inquisition of course, perished. And -- and then came\nthe whole si -- middle -- middle of 17\" century with the [indecipherable] pogroms. Again the\nsame -- the same phenomenon. Persecution, murder, exile, escape, flight, whatever. I am\nobviously not going into the intricacies, but [indecipherable] that -- that\u2019s the picture. And -- and\neven as late as -- as the beginning of the 20\" century, with the pogroms of [indecipherable] and\nwhat was the response there? The massive migration out of Russia to -- to -- to the United States.\nThe roots of the vast majority of American Jews today are the -- the gr-grand -- the grand or gr --\nor great-grandparents of those who ran from the pogroms of -- of -- of Tsarist Russia. No-\nNobody dug in their heels and said, we were -- we were driven out, we were hurt, we were\ndamaged, we were persecuted. S-S -- this -- this government, or this successor government\ncannot get away with this. Now you can say that -- that -- that the [indecipherable] and that\nHitler and -- and -- and the Third Reich and the industrialized, massive, incredible industrialized\npersecution and -- and -- and annihilation of -- of six million people in -- in five years was so\nearth-shaking and [indecipherable] earth-shaking. Sometimes I ask myself -- I don\u2019t know, 1s it --\nwas it for the days of the [indecipherable] pogroms for -- for the Jews at that time as great a\nhorror as -- as -- as Kristallnacht? I-I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t judge it. Or -- or -- or the\n[indecipherable] of a whole people out of the Iberian peninsula? I mean, that certainly was not a -\n- a local -- a small local event of -- of some people in the village of [indecipherable] getting cr-\ncrazy. Now, the other possibility is -- is, of course, maybe by the 1930\u2019s, there were things\naround us at the world at large that -- that established some kind of precedence, in other words of\n-- of some forms of collective response to something. I -- I\u2019m not sure. The one thing that comes\nto mind for instance was the -- was the Armenian -- the persecution of the Armenians by the\nTurks in 1915, the World War I. I haven\u2019t researched that for myself well enough to know\nwhether there was, first of all on the part of the Armenians outside of Turkey, some organized\neffort to attempt to confront the Turkish government with it. I\u2019m not sure, at least I\u2019m not aware\nthat it was of such open and -- and strong [indecipherable] fashion as I think happened finally in\n-- in the early 1940\u2019s with respect to -- to -- to the human and material consequences o-of the\nHolocaust. And that -- and that -- I mean, I share a result of -- of a layman\u2019s perception of a\nfeeling that something extra historically, certainly, in my opinion, in Jewish history, historically\nsomething extraordinary happened, and then so on. And even -- and e -- and it, to me it would be\nthat even be necessarily confined to Jewish history alone. The question of a -- of a persecuted\ngroup which is not represented by a state, that does not have an army, that does not have the --\nthe -- the basic indices of -- of -- of power, has somehow developed first -- first -- first agreed or\nbegin to -- to -- to find this -- this whole approach, and then -- and then ended up building, if you\nwill, the infrastructure to -- to -- to -- to -- to carry it forward and to -- and to turn it into\nsomething tangible, for the benefit of the victims, for [indecipherable] th-the victims themselves.\nAnd -- and -- and that -- that has to be analyzed. One has to analyze the elements of American\nJewish history 1-1n -- in the -- in the 19 -- in the 1930\u2019s, in Palestine, in -- in -- in -- in how -- in\nhow the German Jewish community reacted. In what it ca -- what it carried with it when -- when\nit began en masse to -- to leave. What is connected with it, of course, I mean I -- I\u2019m drifting, but\nPll get back on the main track, is also where were the fi -- where were the -- the failings? The\nfailings being did the organized Jewish world after 1933 sufficiently analyze where the Third\nReich and -- and the Nazis and Hitler were leading? After all, of the 600,000 German Jews,\n300,000 remain in Germany. Now, again, I make a statement like that and it sounds again like an\nexaggeration an-and unqualified. I realize that among the 300,000 that stayed may have been\ntens of thousands who would have been -- who wanted to get out and the world wouldn\u2019t take\nthem in, including this country. But nonetheless, there were large numbers of people, some of\nwhom I\u2019ve known among -- among German Jewry and subsequently Austrian Jewry and so on,\nwho thought, you know, this is a passing business, and now we\u2019re -- and now we\u2019re -- good\nGermans will -- will take care of this upstart over there because in other words, where th -- I f -- I\nforget about the world, but where -- where did the Jewish leadership? And I am not trying to be\nac-accusatory, I\u2019m trying to -- to save what -- what did we f -- when I say we, I\u2019m talking in the\nbroad, historical [indecipherable] sense, failed to see as to where it was going. Now you can\nmake the argument I ca -- I talk to myself, you know, I -- yo-you -- you can make the argument\non the other side to say there was no precedent for this type of -- of -- of organized massacres,\nalthough there were massacres in history. What follows from it? Had we -- had we really,\ncollectively, deeply analyzed where this was going? Maybe we could have done more than we --\nthan we did to get people out. To protect, to save, to -- to -- to d -- I don\u2019t know to do what. So to\n-- to me, as I -- you know, being -- being immersed into this -- I don\u2019t know, up to the -- the tip\nof my head or whatever it is, or beyond it. I -- I say to myself, this -- this has to be more\nprofoundly examined. I don\u2019t know how else to [indecipherable] sometimes I am at a loss for\nwords. But -- and -- and I think this is -- this is subjects for philosophers, this is subjects for\nethicists, this is subjects for historians. The Jews -- the Jews would not be -- were not alone in\nthis world. As a matter of fact the Jews were -- were more intertwined with the world than\nmaybe any other people because they were -- because they were scattered and because they had\nto survive always as minorities.

        "A: I don\u2019t know I -- I want to say special. I think we knew that we couldn\u2019t remain either silent\nor passive. When I was approached in the middle of the Berlin blockade in the summer of 1948\nby the general consul of the JDC, that I should take together the [indecipherable] and airlift\nmyself out with -- with my pregnant wife out of -- out of Berlin [indecipherable] I think what\npeople were telling me at that time, at beginning of a promising career in -- in foreign service of\nthe United States, which interested me immensely intellectually, I mean this is -- you know? I\ncan tell you to this day that -- that -- that my few months in the Berlin blockade is -- is something\nthat I have not yet in a similar way personally duplicated in a sense. Because it was a -- sucha\nconfluence of -- of -- of incredible historic events in which [indecipherable] found -- maybe I\nfind myself as a -- as a small pawn, but a pawn in this -- in th-this particular moment. And of\ncourse I s -- I saw enough of the DP\u2019s and I saw enough of everything else. And -- and by that\ntime I have seen enough also what has been done economically and so we talked about in the --\nin -- in -- in war crimes, etcetera. And -- and I said, I cannot say no. Simple. Am I a great hero?\nNothing, nonsense. I said one thing. I said the Berlin blockade was to me like another act of war.\nAnd I said I was quite deeply involved in -- in dealing with it in -- in one aspect of it. I said, I\nwill request one year leave of absence from General Clay, saying very clear for what purpose, for\nthe purpose of helping to establish or implement a program of which he was the [indecipherable]\nsponsor. It was part of that military government law. But it meant, if you will, removing myself\nand my family from the front line. The Berlin block -- they blockaded Berlin was the front line.\nEvery night the lights were off like in -- like in the blitz Berlin -- the bl-blitz London, literally,\nokay\u2019? And then I got permission. The [indecipherable] leave of absence still continues, but --",

        "Q: And so you went to Nuremberg?",
        "A: So my pregnant wife and my dog and I went to Berlin -- went to Nuremberg, and that\u2019s how it\nstarted. And -- and that\u2019s how we -- we built an organization overnight. We filed -- the law had --\nhad, from our point of view, a terrible limitation. By the 31\u2018' of December 1948, we had to file\nclaims. Any claim that would not be dated by th-that date 1s [indecipherable]. What did we do?\nWe hired every retired clerk from a real estate registry, and s -- and remember, it was right -- the\ndeutsche mark was just coming in. We had deutsche marks, Benny was able to negotiate a loan\nfrom General Clay. Money -- we had no money to -- you know. And -- and we had these people.\nWe told them, any change of -- of title, after \u00b033, if a name sounds Jewish -- in Germany as you\nknow, you can be Alfred Rosenberg [indecipherable] when you can be Robert Alfred Rosenberg,\nliterally. And Schneider and I have to tell you and -- and [indecipherable] and Hamburger and\nwhatever and whatever. I\u2019Il tell you what -- one episode which is really very funny. And within\nfive month we filed 163,000 pieces of paper because we knew that on the first of January we can\ntear up anything. But if it didn\u2019t have a stamp of 31 December, 1948, finished. This is older --\nold -- today too. All the property restitution laws -- by the way, you should know that what we\nhave today in East Germany, the former East Germany, which started in [indecipherable] 1s\nbased practically word for word on everything we drew in -- negotiated out in \u201947, and\nsubsequently. And these are the foundations.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That\u2019s what people have to take a look and see. It didn\u2019t come, you know, like a -- as my\nLatin teacher used to say, like there was [indecipherable] from somewhere or -- or whatever. Or -\n- or -- who jumped out of Zeus\u2019 brow? I forgot.",

        "Q: Oh, Venus.",
        "A: I think Venus jumped out of Zeus\u2019 brow. I be -- I better look it up when I go home. But -- a-\nand so it -- it comes from something. And -- and that\u2019s what we did. And you know, f-for us, for\nBenny, for me, with the first money that we were able to realize from the recovery process, we\nhelped the Jewish agency to buy prefabs and [indecipherable] so the DP\u2019s who were sitting in old\nBritish army barracks in 1949 and in 1950 in [indecipherable] in the -- in the transit camps and\nso on, could be taken out and put into decent housing. That, to him, to me, to us, I mean it -- by\nthat time -- by that time we had the whole army.

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It was only in 1949 when the British and the French, but pri-primarily the British because\nwe\u2019re put on in a enormous pressure in the British parliament. When -- when the -- when th-the -\n- the foreign office refused in 1947 to elect a parallel law to the American military government\nrestitution law, we cranked up pressure in Britain. And the British Jewish organizations started\nstorming the -- the British parliament. And the British came around two years later, okay? As the\nGermans say [indecipherable] wasn\u2019t so simple. You know, these -- we had to -- we had to blast\nout. But, I wouldn\u2019t even say it was the hostile, it was just -- it\u2019s not done.

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- we told all these clerks from the real estate registers to register any transfer of title which\noccurred after 1933, involving someone with a Jewish sounding name. So we get a claim by a\nman called Alfred Rosenberg, who has sold a villa in Berlin. Until we -- and so it was a proper\nclaim filed, you know, with a restitution agency. When we finally came around to investigate it,\nbecause each claim had to be substantiated eventually. You had to establish that there was a\nforced sale, you had to establish that these people were Jewish. You have to establish that the\nproper consideration was paid, etcetera, etcetera. We started digging into the antecedents of\nAlfred Rosenberg, it was the ideologue of the Nazi party, whose villa in 1937 was not good\nenough for him. He sold the old villa and then proceeded to buy a new villa. So -- so we filed a\nclaim for the -- for the restitution of -- of the villa of -- of Alfred Rosenberg and the -- and it was\nunder -- for years 1t was pending because, you know, with 163,000 pieces of paper, it took\nawhile until -- until it all got processed. And this -- this -- this is not a made up story, this 1s a\ntrue thing.",
        "Q: But it got processed?",
        "A: It got processed, we had to withdraw it, we had to tear it up. He was -- he was not a Jew,\nnobody persecuted him. And he, by the way, we talked in the car about looted art. He was the\nmastermind of the massive campaign of -- of looting art, and building the museum to the extinct\nrace. That was Alfred, these are documents, memos that Alfred Rosenberg was going to build it.\nAnd he needed all -- he needed -- he was going to do it the way he would have built the museum\nof Gr-Greek antiquities. Everything from Torah scrolls, to ceremonial objects, to -- to -- to\nrabbinical [indecipherable] to whatever would establish the -- the artifacts and the -- or the\nevidence of this -- of this strange, evil tribe that -- that polluted the -- the wor -- the -- the human\nrace.",
        "Q: But when you and Ben were doing this work together, you were in a sense making up things,\nbecause there was no precedent for any of this, am I correct? There was a law, but there was no\nprecedent.",
        "A: As far as we knew we had to improvise, or --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- or -- or develop simply the -- the -- the system, the methodology, the -- for instance, [Il\ngive you an example. These funds had to be -- we -- we -- we -- we -- we wanted to raise money\nas quickly as possible, to help the resettlement process. At that point there were still survivors in\nDP camps in Germany, particularly camps like Fernwald or so on, where the -- were the DP\ncamps wh-whom other countries, except Israel were not willing to take. People with tu-\ntuberculosis, people with m-mental problems and so on. So, pra -- to -- to generate funds claim\nby claim, claim by claim, claim by -- to develop the technique of bulk settlements, we turned to\nthe state governments and we said, look, we got 10,000 claims in -- in -- in Bavaria. At this point\nthe -- the German owners of these properties are not very happy to see us. Nevermind how they\nacquired it, but they -- they -- they been sitting on it, in some cases for -- for 15 years or\nwhatever. They got used to that. And you buy up our claims and you settle 1t with your own\ncitizens at your own time in [indecipherable] and so on. There\u2019s no precedent. We developed a\ntechnique to generate funds quicker and -- and -- and to -- to -- to make it -- th-the funds were --\nwent primarily to the Joint Distribution Committee, and to the Jewish agency, which were the\ntwo major organizations resettling the Holocaust survivors, the Jewish agency in Israel and the --\nthe JDC with HIAS and so on throughout the world, and then rebuilding the Jewish\ncommunities.",
        "Q: So you did not give out the money directly. You funneled it through these two primary\nagencies, 1s that correct?",

I can take you to\nQueens, and you will find one housing project after the other, for elderly [indecipherable]\nvictims run by [indecipherable], which came out of this money and so on, and in -- and in Israel,\nand so -- so we had to -- obviously we had to, as I said to you earlier, reparations as such were\nalways done state to state, even today.

When\nGermany, in 1949, when the first central government was established in West Germany and\nKonrad Adenauer became its chancellor, and the fir -- and the first attempts were -- begin to\nmake the first attempts, believe it or not, were addressed to the four powers.

        "A: It is the [indecipherable] Republic, it\u2019s the Federal Republic of Germany, but it was West\nGermany, obviously. From that point on, there -- the whole effort to -- to be -- to -- to ca -- to\nreach s-s-some kind of an understanding with this government, and the United States helped us a\ngreat deal. John McCloy as the high commissioner was on good terms with Konrad Adenauer,\nand -- and McCloy encouraged Adenauer, but it wasn\u2019t only -- Adenauer was not a -- a passive\nlittle nobody whom somebody could push around. Adenauer and -- and part of the post-war\nGerman political establishment saw two things. One, cold, if you will, cold -- cold calculation, if\n-- that if Germany is to enter into the family of western nations, it cannot ignore this chapter, it\nhas to do -- do something with this -- with this problem. And I would say for both Adenauer\nhimself, and people like Kurt Schumacher, who -- who -- who is the head of the Social\nDemocratic party and -- and himself a concentration camp inmate -- remember from \u201933 to \u201938\nthe German concentration camps were populated by non-Jews, by German political opponents of\n-- of -- of the Nazis.

I can tell you that on the 10\" of September 1952, when the\nagreements were signed in the old rathouse of Luxembourg, and all the signing was over, and it\nwas very solemn and very tense, I would say, and there were three documents that were signed,\nAdenauer with Moshe Sharett, the first one is so Israel and the so-called [indecipherable]\nagreement of the -- the German -- the German Israeli reparations agreement -- the word\nreparations was not used. Somebody invented a very nice word called collective recompense.\nYou can write it down, it\u2019s a -- a term attributed to that particular thing, because there was no\nstate of Israel during the Hitler period, etcetera, okay. And then the two documents that were\nsigned by Nahum Goldmann as the founding president of the Claims Conference, and Adenauer,\nafter all this was finished, Mr. Adenauer got up and went into the chapel, which was in the\nrathouse of -- old rathouse of Luxembourg and closed the door, and was there for quite awhile.\nAnd I always thought that that was genuine. That that was now -- there was no question 1n my\nmind about the c -- [indecipherable] was subsequently very critical of Adenauer and Adenauer\u2019s\nparty because Adenauer could not deliver 100 percent of his -- members of his party to ratify the\n-- the Luxembourg agreements.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Schumacher delivered all the social democrats, every one of them. Adenauer si -- delivered\nthe majority but not -- but not all of them. Anyway, that\u2019s part of politics, but it is the -- but --\nbut what became clear is that when finally Adenauer appeared in September of \u201951 in the Bundist\n[indecipherable] Rosh Hashanah and delivered that famous statement about unspeakable crimes\nwere committed in the name of the German people, etcetera, and extended an invitation to the\nstate of Israel and to representative the world [indecipherable], and wanted to create an\ninstrument of voluntary agencies, which would be as broad and as representative to be a proper\nnegotiating party to a government. All this was unprecedented. And Nahum Goldmann then\nconvened the 23 member organizations in the Waldorf Astoria in October of \u201951, and that\u2019s\nwhere the Claims Conference was born, first of all i-in -- initially, A, to provide worldwide\nbacking to the state of Israel is -- in its ne-negotiations with -- with the German Federal\nRepublic, and then to develop the programs of claims and demands on behalf the Holocaust\nsurvivors wherever they were. And -- and if you\u2019ll take so that the -- the JRSO as such had too\nnarrow an institutional base at that time. [indecipherable] these 10 -- 10 organizations. And it had\nto be as broad geographically, ideologically and philosophically. And if you take a look at the\nmembership from -- from \u201951 to this day, you will find geographically the Canadian Jewish\nCongress, the major American organizations, the leading Argentinean organizations, the leading\nAustralian organization, the leading South African organization, the Jewish agency for Israel, the\n-- the leading French, British, the German, the world organizations. [indecipherable] Israel world\norganization on one hand, and the World Union of Progressive Judaism, who were fighting tooth\nand nail each other philosophically, clear. This is fire and water, theologically.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And it was -- it was, I think Nahum Goldmann\u2019s genius ability, but also the -- the -- the\nmaturity and the responsiveness of all the organizations who recognize this, on this issue, we all\nhave to come together. Like in the old days of -- I don\u2019t know, of the -- of the court of King\nArthur, all the swords had to -- had to be left in the -- in the anteroom, because we, within the\nparameters, we were established. We had to be united and representatives and we were.\nOrganizations that continued to fight each other philosophically and publicly, I mean the\nAmerican Jewish Committee and the World Jewish Congress were -- were philosophically at\nloggerheads much less su-su-subsequently. This whole Claims Conference experiment turned out\nfrom the -- this is another aspect, turned out to be from -- from the Jewish communal -- the\ndevelopment of Jewish communal structures. A tremendous experiment with -- consequently\nwould have never had a president\u2019s conference in the United States today if the Claims\nConference would not have been there before. Because these -- these divergent organizations\ndiscovered that they could sit around one table, had a clearly defined agenda and clearly\ndesignated parameters. In the Claims Conference, neither Nahum Goldmann as the president,\nfrom October -- from 1951 until his death in August of \u201982, [indecipherable] as the top\nprofessional whatever [indecipherable] the board of the Claims Conference on any issue which\nwas other than within the clear parameters and confines of the Claims Conference mandate.\nOtherwise it couldn\u2019t --",

        "Q: I understand that at the beginning of the Claims Conference, when you all went to -- how do\nyou pronounce the name of that town, Visenar?",
        "A: Well, Wassenaar.",

        "A: There were more than that, the -- the -- that --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] people, there was a m -- in Israel itself, this became a -- the most explosive\nissue that if -- that the Ben Gurion government, which was the first government of Israel faced.\nMenachem Begin led the opposition to the Ben Gurion government on all kinds of issues, and\nthis became one of the major issues in his battle with Ben Gurion. The argument was when we\nshould take th -- we should not take any blood money, and -- and the -- it -- it took the form of\ndemonstrations, it took the form of -- of such serious demonstrations that I think for the first time\nin the history of the state of Israel, the Kenesit had to be surrounded by police, maybe by army\ntoo, but when Ben Gurion went in January of 1952 to the Kenesit to rec -- to receive a majority\nvote for Israel entering into negotiations with Germany. So that controversy was partially\nphilosophical, or partially moral if you will. I mean, there were people who -- who really, out of\ngenuine inner convictions, and there were people who -- who mixed the opposition with -- with\ndirect political -- this was a -- a -- a very strong issue, you have to think about it. Th -- by that\ntime there were several hundred thousand survivors already in -- in Israel, and it was a-- av --a\nvery controversial issue, and it -- it took the form of -- as I say of -- of -- of very major\ndemonstrations in Israel. In the United States, in New York, we had one really serious episode.\nAnd that is, we had one day a meeting, after the original meeting in the Waldorf, in another hotel\nin New York, and a group of a young -- there was a youth o-organization of the -- of Begin\u2019s\nparty, and -- and they -- that organization was called Betar. This is -- today it would be the youth\nmovement of the Likud in Israel, the -- the -- the -- the logical political extension of that\nmovement. And they came into the hotel where we had the meeting, and they had a -- a sit down\nstrike. They sat down in the hallway blocking the access -- exit and the entrance to my meetings,\nand we had to get -- after, when the meetings were over, we wanted to get Nahum Goldmann and\nother of the people out because you never know if you get, particularly that this was -- Betar is a\n-- was a pretty militant group anyway, but in New York -- in New York they were -- I mean,\noutside of Israel there were f -- people ideologically, philosophically, there are people today who\nsay they\u2019re not going to go to Germany to visit, or I will not buy a German product and so on. I\nmean, even today, to this day, but certainly in -- in -- in those days. And it was -- it went so far,\nfor instance, that there was one group of -- of Holocaust survivors who organized themselves\ngenerally, and those were the people who came out of Bergen-Belsen, of the Bergen-Belsen\ncamp. And although the -- the chairman of their group, a man called Joseph Rosensaft was\nactually helpful in connection with the negotiations, his organization and these people would --\nwould -- they would not want -- they did not want to become members of the Claims Conference\nbecause they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to negotiate with the Germans, regardless of who the\nGermans were who were negotiating partners. Anyway, by January of \u201952, Ben Gurion got his\napproval of the majority of the Kenesit, the Claims Conference was ready to go, and we had\ninternal discussions between the Claims Conference and Mr. Sharett in preparation for the\nnegotiations. But that -- we were -- one thing at that time was clear, none of us would go to\nGermany for negotiations. So this -- the -- the government of Israel had to find a neutral country\nthat was willing to host us. And that was not so simple because it required security. We never\nknew whether neo-Nazi elements or any other elements were going to -- to cause problems. The\nDutch government agreed and made available to us, a chateau. A medieval castle with a moat\nand a drawbridge, literally. You can still see it, it\u2019s now a conference center. And the German\ndelegation, headed by 20 Nazis and the Claims Conference delegation and the Israel delegation\nwere all housed in the same chateau, in different wings and so on, in the same place. And the\nnegotiations were, as a rule, in the morning between the Germans and the Israelis, and in the\nafternoon between the Germans and the Claims Conference, and in the evenings and in between,\nof course, the Claims Conference, and the Israeli delegates were together, obviously together\n[indecipherable]. And there were, of course, crises, and periods when we had to interrupt the\nnegotiations and go over there to f -- had to fly from Paris to -- to Bonn to negotiate with\nAdenauer on the contentious issues and to find some kind of compromise. This happened several\ntimes. I personally had to shuttle more frequently, because as the executive director of the\nClaims Conference, our negotiations policy committee was sitting in New York, of the top lay\nleadership of the Claims Conference, and I would -- and first of all the Claims Conference as an\norganization had to function. So I would sh -- spend a couple of weeks in -- in negotiations and\nfly back to New York and -- and we -- the organization go back and forth. But we also had\nperiods when the negotiations were suspended because there were serious differences of opinion.\nThe negotiations lasted from the 22\" of March -- as a matter of fact, a day after tomorrow will\nbe -- 207 -- 52 -- 55 years.",
        "Q: Really.",
        "A: Exactly. I ca -- didn\u2019t think about it. 55 years since we landed in a separate runway in -- in --\nin Amsterdam. We were flown in because Dutch security didn\u2019t want us to c -- to come in with\nthe regular business. So -- so they landed us on a -- on a secluded -- and packed us into cars, and\nbrought us to the Kasteel oud Wassenaar, the castle of old Wassenaar. Had one great vir -- virtue\nas far as I was concerned. Was withi -- within the walking distance of a beautiful museum which\nhas a fantastic Rembrandt, and that is called the Mauritshuis House, the house of a man called\nMauritshuis. And there is \u201cThe Anatomy Lesson\u201d by Rembrandt which 1s as big as this wall.\nAnd after 12 - 14 hours, I would run a -- run away from the chateau with a Dutch security guard\nwho hated museums passionately. Probably as a kid he must have been dragged by his hair to a\nmuseum and I would say to him, you can sit outside and smoke your lousy cigarettes, and I'll\ngive you a piece of paper if anything happens to me inside of the museum, it\u2019s my responsibility.\nAnd that -- that then, after awhile I thought that these characters from the -- from the painting\nwill start talking to me. I mean it -- this 1s a fantastic painting, it\u2019s still there. Anyway, and we\nwere there with intervals for -- until the third week of August, more or less.",
        "Q: Really? So long?",
        "A: I mean, but there were intervals.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Sub [indecipherable] delegation had to go back and we\u2019d come back and -- and they were\nvery complicated issues, they were issues of -- that overlapped, because we negotiated\ncompensation agreements which affected all victims of Nazi persecution, whether they were\nIsraeli citizens, or American citizens, or Australian ci -- or [indecipherable]. And -- and there\nwere overlaps. The German delegation, by the way, was headed initially by two anti-Nazis, one a\nProfessor Burn, a professor of civil law from Frankfurt University, who I believe was -- was\ntowards the end of the war in a Gestapo jail. And a man called Dr. Otto Kirsten, who was a\nleading Protestant pol-politician o-opposing the Hitler regime. He was a lawyer in Stuttgart, and\n-- and there was a t -- an issue a-and they were our negotiating partners. Of course, they would\nreceive instructions from the Adenauer government, and at times there were issues where --\nwhere we knew that -- that they were communicating to us positions that they personally were\nnot necessarily in favor of. And this was the time that we instinctually would call time out and\nget ahold of -- of Nahum Goldmann in Paris and tell him to -- and ask him to fly to -- to Bonn to\nnegotiate with Adenauer. And -- and Goldmann was fantastic in that respect, I mean. This 1 --\nthis was a man with a broad intellectual horizon, a broad western intellect. Although he was born\nin -- in -- 1n a small town in -- in what would be Lithuania, I think, today, but his parents early\nwent to Germany, and he was a product of Heidelberg and I don\u2019t know what other universities.\nAnd during World War I, believe it or not, as a very young academic, I think he worked for the --\nfor the Kaiser\u2019s foreign ministry on some -- you know, routine job over there, it is -- was -- the\nreason I mention all this is -- is because his -- his cultural roots -- I\u2019m talking -- I\u2019m not talking\nabout the Jewish cultural roots, I\u2019m talking his general roots. His academic roots were, to a very\ngreat extent, similar to the -- to the people -- the policy makers of the new -- of the new German -\n- of the new post-war Germany. I mean, he and Adenauer would -- would -- he would go to\nSwitzerland to -- to -- to spend hours and hours with Adenauer on issues that had nothing to do\nwith us. Va-Vacation issues, the -- whatever. And -- but this was a man with a -- with a very\nbroad political, international, diplomatic talents, and a man from whom I learned a great deal. He\nwas old enough to be my father. He was born in \u201995, and I was born in \u201922.",
        "Q: Right. It\u2019s a big difference.",
        "A: And I\u2019m right, he was -- correct. And --",

        "A: [indecipherable] put it this way first. Pll be very precise on this point, because I wrestled with\nit. There were individuals who had an inner moral, ethical, personal inability to face anything or\nanybody which reminded them of Germany. Then there were politicians, who -- about whom I\nwas not always sure where the political consideration, that this 1s a hot issue under which I can --\nI can undercut my opponent, or whether there was -- this was a pure moral issue. So I -- I -- I di -\n- I do -- I don\u2019t tend to pass judgment on it, but my view is completely different.",
        "Q: And what was your view?",
        "A: My view was and 1s and always will be, we were there demanding what is rightfully ours, and\nwe were demanding it from those who were -- who had responsibility. In many cases who even\ncontrolled the assets and -- and overall who had the moral, legal, historic responsibility to make\namends for what their predecessor government had done. The f-first post-war German\ngovernment said very clearly and unequivocally, it is the succe -- for better or for worse, it is the\nsuccessor state of the Third Reich.

        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Right.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t say that everything that -- that\nwas already accomplished 1s all that should have been accomplished, and so on. There will never\nbe what the Germans call [speaks German here]. The term [speaks German] means to make\nwhole.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: What has been done can never be made whole. I\u2019m not talking, obviously about six million\ndead human beings that can\u2019t -- even the material losses cannot be made whole.

        "Q: Right. Well, let me ask you about the Israeli government at that time.

So they were in a very difficult position financially.",
        "A: [indecipherable] know that the whole basis of the negotiations were -- they had -- there was a\nclear distinction of the foundation of the negotiations between the government of Israel and\nGermany, and the Claims Conference. The government of Israel requested or sought 1.5 billion\ndollars on the basis of the cost of absorption of 500,000 Jewish victims of Nazi persecution, first\nin the [indecipherable], first in the Palestine and subsequently in the -- 1n Israel itself. And it was\nthis one billion 500 million dollars which was the basis of the negotiation. The settlement was\nthen -- a portion of it was roughly half of it. But -- but that was the basis.

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The German finance ministry published at its own expense, seven thick volumes on the\nspecific implementation of these agreements. They\u2019re innumerable -- they are basic laws, they\nare regulations, they are court rulings.

        "Q: Right. Now why --",
        "A: Now, for Israel --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- their -- the repar -- the -- the [indecipherable] agreement was vital for its economic\ndevelopment. You also have to bear in mind something which you -- which sounds incredible\ntoday. The German government at that point was not in a position to settle this claim for money,\nso it ended up working out an agreement with the provision of goods and services to Israel, with\na limited monetary component for the purchase of petroleum from Great Britain. It was a time\nwhen the state of Israel -- when the agreement was signed, the state of Israel was four years and -\n- and four month old, and in those days it couldn\u2019t get a letter of credit in a Swiss bank for love\nor money. The first bank that really opened up to the state of Israel, believe it or not, was the\nBank of America, which was created and established by -- by an Italian immigrant in California.\nIf you look into the history of the Bank of America, it was established -- the name will come to\nme in a minute -- and the American banking system in those days was -- was run by WASPs, by\ngood -- by good -- you know -- but Bank of America was created by [indecipherable] like -- I\nmean it -- it-it\u20191l co -- anyway, the first real strong foreign bank that was ready to do business\nwith Israel was the Bank of America. Now I -- I say all this to you because the -- the -- a good\npart of the infrastructure of Israel was -- was established as a result of this agreement. The first\nmerchant marine, the Zimlines as they were called, were -- were ships built in -- in Hamburg and\nin other -- and in other port cities of Germany. The port of Ashdod, which is the second port after\nHaifa was built out of German reparations money. The -- a good part of the electric grid of Israel.\nSo -- so for Israel, this was a -- a very important agreement in its practical --",
        "Q: Now, the arrangement also was that the goods and services would go to Israel and then 20\npercent would come --",
        "A: No, th -- the -- [Il tell you exactly. The claims -- the total agreement was three billion 450\nmillion deutsche marks. In those days it was the equivalent of 712 million dollars. You -- you\ntake the sum, divide it by 4.2. Th-That was the ratio. Can you imagine? Today the dollar is a\nfraction of -- of the Euro, but -- so --",
        "Q: Can you hold that? Cause we have to change the tape --",
        "A: Okay, and I\u2019m gonna --",
        "Q: -- and we\u2019ll start right -- right there.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "Q: S-So Pll give you a sense of -- of the people. You wanted to go back to --",
        "A: Yeah, I wanted to go back to, because you asked me earlier about who -- who were the people\ninvolved in -- in this whole process and -- and I think I -- I -- I didn\u2019t answer it as fully as I th-\nthink I -- I want to and I should. But as I say, whatever has been accomplished 1-initially and\nsince and now and I\u2019m sure going forward, is a product and the result of a collective effort of a\ngroup of individuals who are involved in a professional lay capacity that depends upon which\nindividual and what phase and at what stage o-of -- of the various processes. When I -- when we\nspoke earlier about the a-antecedents of all of these programs in the immediate postwar period,\nand th-the -- the main issues had to be negotiated with the U.S. government as the most powerful\nof the -- of the allied victorious powers, there were essentially four Jewish organizations that\nworked together in that effort, and that was the American Jewish Committee, the American Joint\nDistribution Committee, the Jewish Agency for Palestine at that time, and the World Jewish\nCongress. And -- and these were essentially, as far as the -- the Jewish agency for -- the Jewish\nAgency for Palestine were the American representatives, and of course Nahum Goldmann, who\nlived in the United States at that time and was the chairman of the -- executive of the Jewish\nagency in addition to being the chairman of the -- executive of the World Jewish Congress and\nso on and I -- I may be off by a year or two [indecipherable] the titles, but in those two\norganizations they played a leading role already at th -- at the -- at the end of the war. And -- and\nof the two American organizations, of course, they were domiciled in New York, and -- and th-\ntheir -- particularly the American Jewish committee had a -- a legal council in Washington, a\nman wh-who was also at times with the State Department, his name was Seymour Ruben. And --\nand the American Je -- th-the Jewish agency on these issues was represented by their American\ncouncil, a man called Maurice Bookstein, who was sitting -- who was living in New York as an\nAmerican Jew. And -- a -- a -- and then of the -- the World Jewish Congress, there were two\nbrothers, Jacob and Nehemiah Robinson. They both came from Lithuania. Jacob was already an\ninternational lawyer of some standing in the -- in the 1930\u2019s in -- in Lithuania, and Nehemiah\nwas a outstanding scholar and he headed up the World Jewish Congress, created an institute of\nJewish affairs it was called, it\u2019s official title. It was a -- a research facility, a research\norganization which Nehemiah led and directed. And in many, many ways he was -- he was the\nco-conceptualizer of -- of a lot of -- of what we developed subsequently as our specific programs\nfor demands, etcetera. In addition to that, and of course in the -- in the -- in the Joint Distribution\nCommittee, they had the co-council in Europe as well, a man called Jerome Jacobsen and -- and\npeople in -- in New York in the headquarters -- oh, for God sakes. Come to me 1n a minute. Eli\nRock. E-]-i R-o-c-k. And of course, Mo-Moses Levitt is the -- as the chief executive in -- in the\nAmerican Jewish Committee, the head of the -- their international department was a prominent\nEuropean lawyer of Polish origin called Si-Simon Siegel. And his deputy was the father of the\nrecent -- of Alan Habershi. Would you believe? His name was Eugene Habershi, he was a\nHungarian diplomat and the son of the conservative chief rabbi of Hungary, okay? I be -- I met\nAlan Habershi -- Alan Habershi when [indecipherable] would bring him to the office at age 15 or\nwhatever. So anyway, I g -- I -- I give you the -- the -- the players at that point, because although\nthey came from different corners organizationally and so on, and there were no previous\nstructural arrangements for cooperative activities, around this issue, these people and these\nindividuals were closer together and very, very, very effective. And of course by the -- by the\ntime it came to 1952, or fi -- or \u00b051 and -- and \u201952 negotiations, by that time of course, Ben\nFerencz and I were involved out of the operation in Germany itself of the successor organization,\nand we worked with all these people because the American Jewish Committee and the World\nJewish Congress. And -- and the American Joint Distribution Committee, and whom did I leave\nout? And the Jewish agency were founding members of the JRSO.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Every year when we would elect officers in the g -- in the j -- JRSO, one year the chairman\nwas a g -- a JDC designee, and the next year was a Jewish agency designee and so on. So by the\ntime the Claims Conference came into being, there was already a -- a group of -- of experts,\nprofessionals plus laypeople in these respective organizations, who were involved in the subject\nmatter. And the delegation was expanded in The Hague because we brought in people from\nEngland. First of all 1t was important, remember, we had to make sure that the principle, western\npowers were -- were there, and it was important also to us. So a -- a man who was a member of\nparliament, whose name was Alec Easterman, who was member of our delegation, at least that\nhe -- he didn\u2019t sit all the time in The Hague, he had to be an -- an MP in -- in London, too, but --\nand what was important, the German refugee organization called the Council of Jews from\nGermany was headquartered in London. And Rabbi Leo Baeck, after whom the Baeck Institute\nwas named subsequently, was, so to say the -- the spiritual and the -- and the -- a-and the sort of\nleader of -- of this whole movement. So we -- we brought in -- in -- into the delegation the then\nexecutive head of their organization, a man called Goldschmidt, first name will come to me in a\nminute. And he was also, of course [indecipherable] familiar with German law. Remember, we\nhad to negotiate ultimately, German legal commitments, etcetera. And th-this was -- this was the\nprofessional team, together with Jerry Jacobsen, who was council of the JDC sitting in Paris.\nAnd then of course, the Claims Conference leadership itself, the -- wh-which was supervising the\nnegotiating, laying out the policies, because we couldn\u2019t have 24 organizations being in\npermanent session, whereas Jacob Blaustein, who was -- obviously Nahum Goldmann as the\npresident, Jacob Blaustein as the senior vice president, he was the head of the American Jewish\nCommittee. A -- by today\u2019s standards he would be one of the billionaires. In those days he was a\nmulti-millionaire [indecipherable] Baltimore 011 company. Amoco, American Oil Company, that\nwas the Blaustein family. And then Israel Goldstein, the head of the American Jewish Congress,\nRabbi Israel Goldstein, a leading conservative rabbi with a large congregation on the west side of\nNew York, and a leading member of the Jewish agency executive. I mean, these are people\n[indecipherable]. And Moses Leavitt who was the -- today would probably be the executive vice\npresident of the American Joint Distribution Committee. And as I told you, became the chairman\nof our delegation in The Hague. And Bookstein [indecipherable] and a man called Adolph Held,\na president of the Jewish Labor Committee. In those days, a much more str -- a stronger\norganization than the Jewish Labor Committee is today, they are still an organization covering a\nsegment of Jewish life, but you have to know, particular for our negotiations, during the Nazi\nperiod, the Jewish Labor Committee in this country brought some of the German social\ndemocrats, some of the German trade unionists, even if they were in Sweden and in exile, they\nwould raise money and support them financially. They had a close, ongoing personal relationship\nwith the second largest political party in Germany after the war, the Social Democratic party.\nAnd Adolph Held himself, came from the trade union movement. He was a senior official of the\nInternational Ladies Garment Worker\u2019s Union.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Of Mr. Dubinsky\u2019s union, if that means anything to you. And so it was Adolph Held, Jacob\nBlaustein, Israel Goldstein, Nahum Goldmann, Frank Goldmann, who was the president of B\u2019nai\nB\u2019rith, which was very important to us at that time. And then from Britain was Sir Barnett\nJanner, who was the chairman of the board of deputies of British Jews, who is the oldest Jewish\ncommunal organization in Britain, I think going back to -- to the end of the 18\u2122 century or\nsomething, anyway, or maybe -- or maybe the beginning of the 19\" century, anyway, one of the -\n- I think the oldest central organization still exists, still a member organization of the -- of the\nClaims Conference. They all are. Different leadership and so on, but the -- so --",
        "Q: You\u2019re saying that it\u2019s not one or two people or three people, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a hu -- a rather large\ngroup, and a wide group?",
        "A: Obviously as the -- a good -- a good deal of the -- of the nitty gritty and of the really the day\nto day and night and day type of work, it always had to co -- to come down to a smaller number\nof people who had to devote all their time to 1t.

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to operate at that time. We continued to operate much past \u201952 in -- in -- in Germany.",
        "Q: What was --- what was your role as what -- what were you supposed to be doing in this? What\nare the kinds of things you were doing?",
        "A: I mean, first of all, I was the executive director of the Claims Conference, which means I was\nthe chief operating officer of the organization per se, because in addition to everything else, it\nhad to be a functional organization. It had to have meetings, and it had committees and it had the\nboard. And the moment we got money we had to haul out our location apparatus. We -- we were\nallocating 10 million dollars a year, which in today\u2019s purchasing power we -- was at least a\nhundred million plus.",
        "Q: Lot of money.",
        "A: Somewhere between a hundred and 150 million dollars. So we had to build another\nmachinery for the allocation of funds and so on. And then I continued to be the executive\ndirector of the WJ -- of the JRSO, parallel function and so forth. And a-as I say, it was -- the\nnegotiations themselves were of course a time limited operation. After we signed the agreements,\nthis group dispersed.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And -- and we then continued to carry this Claims Conference. We established immediately\nan office in Germany, headed by f-former German lawyer, with -- as we always -- we were\nalways teased our Israeli friends, the first Jewish embassy in postwar Germany was the Claims\nConference office in Bonn, because diplo -- believe it or not, diplomatic relations between Israel\nand the Federal Republic were only established in 1965, 13 years later. The Israel government\nhad a purchasing mission, sitting in Cologne, we tracked it as a [indecipherable] embassy, but it\ndid not have a full status of -- of an embassy. And -- and we then -- our objective then was to see\nthat all these commitments were being implemented and we had an agreement with the Germans\nthat any draft legislation would come to us first for comment before 1t would be -- be presented\nfor a vote to the Bundestag. And for decades there was a compensation committee of the\nBundestag as a standing committee, called in German the [speaks German here] Ausschuss.\nAusschuss being the German word for committee. And then w-we worked periodically, I would\ngo from New York for periodic meetings with them, and -- but our representative would -- would\nbe in daily contact with them.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And all of the li -- the laws that followed, and they were not one time pieces of legislation,\nthere was a first compensation law, and there was an amended compensation law, and there was\nsubsequently the regulations, and there was a property restitution law, Germany, on top of the\nmilitary government restitution law for a certain type of assets which were not covered by the\ninitial legislation. And then -- and then -- so --",
        "Q: So the law becomes more complex --",
        "A: Of course.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you can come in my office and see, they are like that. They are volumes covering the law\nand their implementation. And then th -- remember, there was a major judicial machinery. A\nclaim for -- if somebody filed a claim for a compensation for imprisonment in the ghetto and the\nconcentration camp, it went to an administrative local regional agency. In any of the -- of the\n[indecipherable] in any of the states, they had f -- various jurisdiction claims to Israel were\nprocessed here, and claims from the United States there and so on.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That was first. If they approved, then the matter was finished. If they rejected, it could go to a\n-- to an appellate party to a court of [indecipherable] citizens. It could go to an appellate court,\nand there was a Supreme Court, there was a high court s -- exclusively on issues of\ncompensation.",
        "Q: But these claimants had to go through the Claims Conference first --",

        "Q: They could go separately, as individuals?",
        "A: Everything until 1980 was the individual filing a direct claim with the German compensation\nagency. We created an organization called the United Restitution Organization --",

        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: -- residual operation in Israel, Canada and -- and the United States and Germany.",
        "Q: So then, explain what it was that the Claims Conference was doing. What kinds of claims\nwere you getting then?",
        "A: The Claims Conference negotiated the legislation.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Monitored the implementation.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Financed the legal aid services machinery and -- and continuously fought for expansion\nimprovement, correction and [indecipherable]. Pll give you the example, at one point the\nprocessing of the claims were exceedingly slow, and we brought about something that never\nhappened in Germany before and since. We had the chancellor convene the minister presidents,\nwhich would be the equivalent of the governors of all the states of Germany, it\u2019s like the\npresident of the United States would bring together the 50 governors in a two day session,\nbecause the governors were responsible for the initial administration of the laws. In other words,\nthe operating local agencies, the agencies of first administrative were state agencies. And Nahum\nGoldmann addressed that gathering and laid out all of our complaints and so on, and -- and cr --\nand obtained secured commitments on -- on how to accelerate the process [indecipherable] the\nclaims. That was the claims end of it. On the allocation part of it, the money was given -- we had\nan agreement under which -- from The Hague days -- the Luxembourg days under which we\nreceived money for allocations. We had to furnish annual reports to the German government as\nto what we did with the money, and how it was done and so on. And we had some difficult issues\nwith them as well, particularly issues wi -- about which we could not write very much about,\nbecause we had to use -- we found that we had to use some of these funds to assist Nazi victims\nbehind the Iron Curtain.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And that was verbote -- not verboten so much from the German side, but the Soviets were --\nwere violently opposed to it, and so on. And we had to do it in such a way that we couldn\u2019t make\nit public, and we had to get the consent of the German government to do it, etcetera, I mean, we\ncan talk about that one day, but then in some of those were the ways is written up in the book by\n[indecipherable] Zweig, Ronald Zweig on -- on our location.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But let -- let me ask you this. There was a period of time, and maybe it still goes on,\nthat when you gave a fair amount of money so that 1-it would help Yad Vashem. Am I correct?\nThat it was established --",
        "A: From -- from day one.",
        "Q: From day one. So there -- there are allotments of money that you -- that the Claims\nConference was giving to certain --",
        "A: Oh, absolutely.",
        "Q: Right? But you\u2019re saying that individual claims did not come through the Claims Conference?",
        "A: No, the individual claims -- initially the individual claims based on the legislation that was\napproved, based on the agreements which were approved in Luxembourg, wherein the form of\nindividuals filing claims direct --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- from the German administrative agencies, and subsequently, if need be, carrying into\nGerman courts.",

        "A: -- when the hardship fund was created --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and when we came to the Germans prior to that and said, you have to open the filing\ndeadlines for the benefit of the Holocaust survivors who are coming out of the Soviet Union, and\nwho were barred by -- by these laws from filing claims because the -- the geographic jurisdiction\nof the f -- ger -- of the German compensation laws which came out from our Luxembourg\nagreements, were limited to -- to -- to the western world. It did not penetrate the Iron Curtain.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Okay?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We did not, as I told you in the car, we did not prevail with that. Nahum Goldmann\u2019s traveled\nfor four years. He and -- and -- and our colleagues in Germany, I mean, we had extraordinary\nrepresentatives in Germany, outstanding people. There was a man called Aroz Kashenstein who\nwas -- who was our representative in Germany for nearly 30 years, I would say. Then there was\nhis predecessor, another German lawyer. His successor, a Czech lawyer and so on. They -- they\nwere our fulltime negotiators on the spot. And th -- it was only at that point when the Germans\nsaid, look, we finished the [indecipherable] we -- our administrator apparatus is finished. We\ndon\u2019t want any more our courts to be loaded, because they had to -- they had the whole judicial\nstructure. From the courts [indecipherable] instance through a Supreme Court. Germany, even\ntoday does that every single Supreme Court on those subjects. There\u2019s a high 1n-institutional\ncourt, there\u2019s a high social security court, there\u2019s a high labor court. They have for each major\narea the equivalent of a Supreme Court. In this country everything goes to one court. And\nKarlsruhe is the seat of all of these parallel high courts. So if you go to Karlsruhe you can go\nfrom -- from one high court to the next high court. And there was for years and years a oberster -\n- he\u2019s a good [indecipherable] a high compensation court.",
        "Q: And that stopped eventually.",
        "A: In any event, so only from that point on, we were very reluctant to do it. And I can tell you\nobviously why, because it wasn\u2019t the pi -- part of money which said here you have at your\ndiscretion, you decide the criteria. We had to negotiate under great -- under intensive\nnegotiations the criteria to this day on various programs, and then we are committed to apply\nthese criteria. And the --",
        "Q: And it\u2019s not yours.",
        "A: -- and the German -- and the German -- the German co-controller general equivalent can\ncome at any time and inspect our records.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we kn -- we knew -- I\u2019Il give one si-simple [indecipherable] example. We have a\nprogram under which we pay pensions, under a so-called article two program, which was\nestablished after the unification of Germany. One of the criteria is you had to be six months in\nthe concentration camp. And if you were five month in the concentration camp, you were out.\nAnd for a Jewish organization called Conference of Jewish [indecipherable] Germany to send a\nletter to somebody who was five month in the concentration camp, you -- your application for\ncompensation is rejected, is a minor pleasure.",
        "Q: Yeah. We have to stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape Seven\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "Q: Saul, in 1971 this was a quote from you, \u201cAny time a survivor complains that compensation is\ninadequate, they will never have an argument from me.\u201d",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: And you still believe this?",
        "A: That\u2019s correct. Particularly in the area of -- of personal suffering and personal injuries. How\ncan one put a dollar number on psychological, emotional, and on -- and also physical\nconsequences? We always say, and I\u2019m not alone in that, that what -- what we succeeded to\nsome extent is to provide a measure of compensation, some degree, combined with what I said to\nyou before, which is not tangible, but wh-what -- but to me extremely important, and that is the\nbasic acknowledgment on the part of either the government or the entity or the agency that\nprovides compensation, that it had responsibility, legal, moral, but responsibility. And on the\nother hand, among the hundreds of thousands of survivors, not everybody was able to make the\nkind of economic to build a new existence for oneself, economically, professional, business-wise\nor otherwise that -- that the compensation that they obtained for that -- for many it has genuine\neconomic significance. For people for whom -- who as I said to you before, whether it 1s in the\ndepth of Brooklyn or -- or in the -- or in the resettlement towns of Israel, or -- or in eastern\nEurope, or wherever it is, when the compensation coming as a result of our negotiations and so\non, may equal and exceed old age assistance or Social Security, or whatever it is, and it makes a\ndifference between marginal existence in a late stage of people\u2019s lives, and a sense of -- of some\nacceptable minimum with a -- with a minimum of -- of -- of dignity and of -- and of self respect\nin a sense that an individual can have, that is of great importance. And -- and particularly in this\nstage where the vast majority of the survivors are 80 and over, remember anybody who was born\nin, let\u2019s say who was 10 years old when World War II broke out in Poland, okay? Born in 1929.\nThat individual today 1s 78, okay? This is a child survivor. There are organizations of child\nsurvivors. Kindertransport people, okay? This is the young end of the -- of this population. And\nparticularly in the western world, with progress of -- of medical care and so on, people live\nlonger. I say people exist longer, you know, to me there 1s a great distinction between those two\nwords. But people are there longer, in mo -- requiring much more care and attention for their\nmedical needs and so on, with a greater strain and s -- on -- on their financial resources. So in a --\nin a strange way, some of the compensation benefits today for the people who ended up retiring\non a -- on a very modest basis and in some parts of the world on a below modest basis, or in a\nnon-existent basis, th-this compensation 1s -- is truly meaningful, and is of great importance. We\nnegotiate periodically cost of living adjustments on the pensions. One of -- I think one of the\nbrilliant things that we did in the -- in The Hague, is we wrote in a clause that the pensions, that\nthe compensation pensions will be adjusted on a cost of living basis as the pensions of civil\nservants of Germany, because we knew that the civil servants of Germany have a powerful\norganization and they will fight for cost of living adjustments. And we got the Germans to agree\nthat the compensation -- we knew it is the compensation pensions will be adjusted cost of living-\nwise in the same percentage as those. So I say that to illustrate that the -- the economic impact\nfor certain categories of survivors was and is important. And as I say in some -- in some strange\nway, becoming more important now for those who were to retire in a -- on a -- on a very limited\nbasis.",
        "Q: Can I ask you if -- the description that you gave towards the end of the last tape, when there\nare certain regulations that you had to follow on the hardship fund because those were -- those\nwere regulations made up by the German government. Do you --",
        "A: When the [indecipherable] we have to be more precise.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Every agreement is a compromise.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Even when the United States won the war on an unconditional surrender, it couldn\u2019t force\nupon Germany all that it may have set out to force upon Germany, and then think of -- any\nagreement is a compromise.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And a compromise means that after X efforts to negotiate, if you agree on a settlement, that is\nwhat you have agreed.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And you have to have the -- the -- the moral courage and the -- and the honesty to say in the\nbest judgment of this body, like -- like a congress, like a legislature or whatever it is. In the best\njudgment of this body, this agreement had to be accepted in the form in which it was finally\nnegotiated out.",
        "Q: Right. But this is my question. Did you ever get discouraged?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No? Not in all these years?",
        "A: Wh -- what do you mean by discouraged?",
        "Q: Discouraged that you --",
        "A: To say gave up? [ll give you a classic example. In 1974, the two Germanys, East and West\nwere admitted to the United Nations. Following that the United States established diplomatic\nrelations with East Germany. We assisted and we had the support of the U.S. government, at that\ntime the assistant secretary for European affairs was Mr. Hartman, telling the East Germans that\nthe United States will not enter into diplomatic relations unless the East Germans will agree to\nnegotiate with the Claims Conference concerning issues of compensation, something like that.\nThe Communist East Germans resisted it v-violently. They are a state and they are not\nnegotiating with some non -- non-governmental agency, or something like that. Finally, th-they -\n- they knew that they couldn\u2019t get around it, so they created an anti-Fascist committee to be our\nnon-governmental partner. And from 1974 to 1989, we negotiated with the bloody German --\nEast Germans, and w -- and we were getting nowhere. We were periodically going there every\nyear at the time of the general assembly of the United Nations. The foreign minister of East\nGermany would come here, and on Park Avenue [indecipherable] we would meet. Ben Ferencz\nand Israels -- and Israel Miller and Saul Kagan and whatever, and in 1987 I think I told you we\nhad -- they officially invited us as their guests for negotiations with them in Germany, and they\nwanted that we should deliver to them most favored nations status in the United States so they --\nand then maybe they would consider doing it. At one point Benny went for a meeting with the\nanti-Fascist committee and totally unexpectedly was handed a one million dollar check to -- to\nthe Claims Conference that we should, with a million dollars, help needy Nazi victims in -- in the\nUnited States. Within 48 hours the check was sent back to the German -- to the German\nCommunists, and believe me, through this whole period, people in our board were telling Israel\nMiller and Ben Ferencz and Saul Kagan and a few other people, stop banging your head against\nthis wall, nothing will happen. We never let up. We didn\u2019t accomplish anything, but we never let\nup. We -- there were poi -- there were moments where the -- where they were making offers to us\nwhich we -- of the cali -- cal -- caliber which -- which were unacceptable, but you can get really\ndiscouraged, you know? You go back on the back -- even with the west Germans, as I told you,\nbetween 1975, when d\u00e9tente came in, again you see, you got to relate that to [indecipherable]\ndevelopment. D\u00e9tente, Helsinki, negotiations between -- between President Ford and the\nHelsinki agreements, and the great pressure with the Jackson-Vanik pressure to let Jews out of --\nemigrate from the Soviet Union. Among them, I don\u2019t have to tell you, hundred -- tens of\nthousands of -- of vict -- of Holocaust survivors of -- of -- of the most horrible persecution. Th-\nThe survivors of the [indecipherable] group, and I mean I -- with you I can talk it\n[indecipherable] than that. We came back to the Germans and said, you have to open the filing\nperiod of the compensation laws. These are not people who were lazy. It was forced\n[indecipherable] they were barred by your laws and by your provisions from f-filing claims. We\ncould not get the opposition, we could not get the government to agree. We dismantled the\nmachinery, we cannot do any more. We couldn\u2019t get Willie Brandt, who certainly was a -- Willie\nBrandt who went to Warsaw on his knees, you know, a -- ap -- apologizing on behalf of\nGermany for what has been done to -- to the -- in the Warsaw ghetto to the Jews of Poland.\nCouldn\u2019t budge him, couldn\u2019t budge the -- the chr -- the Christian democrat opposition. Couldn\u2019t\nbud -- budge his successor who was Helmut Schmidt, another Social Democrat. Finally, after\nfive years practically -- and believe me, people are now, and -- and I don\u2019t -- I -- I\u2019m not being\ncritical of anybody -- you know, if you come to meetings a few times a year and whatever it is,\nand you -- and you hear the same -- the same sad song about we met with this one, we met with\nthat one, we met with this parliamentarian, and that politician. We were here and we were there,\nand we had the press conference, and we did this and that. And what have you got to show? And\nwhen finally, finally they came up with this hardship fund one time payment and you, Claims\nConference, administer it. And Nahum Goldmann turned to me and said, \u201cNow you gotta set up\nan organization.\u201d Which as I said to you before, you -- an organization which would have to tell\nsome people no.

There are moments where we -- when we broke off\nnegotiations. And we had to decide, are we going to go back to it or not. And -- and it -- and it\nwas always -- and it had to be a compromise. The reality in life, whether it\u2019s Jewish\norganizational life, whether it is American public life, whether it is -- is anything else, ultimately\nit\u2019s a compromise. There are people who consider this a dirty word. I\u2019ve never considered this a\ndirty word.

        "A: Now, these kind of speeches, or these kind of statements will not get you elected to the -- as\nthe chief dogcatcher over there, because u-unfortunately political life, and I\u2019m sorry to say at\nleast maybe -- maybe it\u2019s a sign of we\u2019re ge -- of we\u2019re getting old, but by the standards of\npolitical discourse, from -- from the days, let\u2019s say in th -- in American standards of the New\nDeal to today is by and large a record of ever lower -- of ever lower -- lower sinking levels and\nstandards of political discourse.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And that is heartbreaking to me. If you stand up and make a sober, intelligent statement, this\nis political poison. Correct?",

Just pick up the phone, send me an email, or whatever it is, I\nwill --",
        "Q: Okay, or I\u20191l come to New York and visit with you. How\u2019s that?",
        "A: By all means, by all means. I said it to somebody here before that -- I said -- doesn\u2019t apply\nhere at all, but I am, particularly in the last 10 years, I am very often approached by young\nhistorians, by -- by people writing Ph.D.\u2019s and so on, from this country, from Israel, from\nGermany, by the way. You would be amazed how many young German historians are seriously\nstudying the Holocaust. Seriously.",
        "Q: No, I know.",
        "A: With a great inner commitment. We have an office in Germany now that -- that has been in\noperation since 1952, that\u2019s 55 years. The vast majority of our staff was German, German\nGerman.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Not German Jews, German German. We had -- we have some Jews, obviously, and we had\npeople and have people who are deeply committed to what we are trying to do.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Inner commitment.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: In some -- in some cases and in some ways more intensely than a Jew would do. And I don\u2019t\nsay it critically of the Jew. For -- for the Jew it is -- for -- for -- let\u2019s say for a Jew particularly\nsomehow related to or exposed to Holocaust survivors or something like that, it\u2019s almost sort of\nmatter of course, if you will, or ho-how else. But young Germans who feel very deeply the\nresponsibility. I mean, one of -- one of our best lawyers, he really battling our battle, he is a\nyoungish -- or -- or at least by my standards, he is around 50, c-close to it, young German lawyer\nwith -- not only with that he is a brilliant lawyer as a lawyer, but -- but with a real inner\ncommitment to this thing. So it -- to -- to go back, and what I was -- wanted to tell you s-simply\nis that any Ph.D. student who calls me or sends me an email or wants to see me, I ac --\nsometimes go to Germany and I meet somebody seven o\u2019clock in the morning because that\u2019s the\none hour I can spend with them.",

        "A: And so to me this aspect of it 1s of in -- tremendous importance.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because not only that -- that the -- the hi -- the history of the period, the teaching of this\nperiod, the -- th-the -- what I call the broad lessons of it, human lessons, not only in Jewish life,\nbut in the -- in the -- in the world at large, are crucial to go past the lifetime of the -- of the\nSUIVIVOTS.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And -- and the only place to look to that are the teachers, are the academics, are the -- are the\ngovernments, for instance there is now, as you know, the international task force on Holocaust\neducation, I think it\u2019s a fantastic, tremendous development.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: To introduce that subject matter into the -- into the public school systems of the world, and of\nEurope 1n particular, is -- is -- is a tremendous goal and objective.",

And for awhile during the -- during a period where I was sort of, in my mind\nth -- th -- and also in my mind of the -- of the relatives, the idea was that -- that I should have a\nyear or more just to -- to get command of the language and so on and not be plunged into a -- and\nit was interesting, I grew -- you know, I graduated from a school where Yiddish was a -- was one\nof the major languages in Yiddish literature. And they -- I got to know people in New York who\nhad -- and there were -- there were si -- Yiddish Sunday schools in the Bronx and in areas like\nthis. And somebody introduced me to some of these people, and I started earning a bit of money\nby -- by teaching kids in the -- you know, th-they had these -- just as they have Hebrew, quote,\nSunday schools, which are not always Sunday schools, sometimes they were Wednesday and\nSunday mornings.",
        "A: And I started just making some little money out of this, you know, just to -- when at the same\ntime, of course trying to develop my -- my English language skills and so on.

        "A: I was pulled out from whatever my unit was, I was in -- in Missouri somewhere, in -- 1n\ncovert conditioning training, which is -- which was just great fun. You get into a foxhole and you\nbend your head and a tank rolls over you so that you would get used to it. And -- but anyway, I\nwas pulled out and given orders to report to -- to a unit in the campus of Syracuse University,\nperiod. I arrived there, and the -- and I reported to a unit that was a s -- an office with a -- a small\noffice with a junior officer and a sergeant over there, and there were another 14 or 13 or 14\nyoung men, and we were assigned to an army specialized training program to study Russian. I\nhad no idea why. It was under -- 1t was under the auspices of the Air Force. And we were --\neverything was done in the army formation, where we marched into a classroom, the door\nopened up and the lady walked in, and she said, my name is Ekatarina Yavonavapastrahova, and\nthis is the last English word you\u2019ll hear from me. This was the beginning of the army\u2019s total\nimmersion program, what the Israelis now call the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Or what Berlitz calls whatever, total immersion. What turned out subsequently, because I\ndidn\u2019t know exactly where -- where it was leading to, but subsequently, I think in Averell\nHarriman\u2019s memoirs or somewhere -- he was our ambassador to the Soviet Union, there is that\nwhole business of the U.S. Air Force wanting to get permission to land our heavy planes from\nsouthern England into Poltava, into -- into the Ukraine, so that there could be deeper penetration\ninto Germany. And Stalin being his paranoid dictator as he was, resis -- resisted it very much, he\ndidn\u2019t want. Every foreigner was a spy by definition, including half of his [indecipherable] was a\nspy as well as, you know? He killed them off one after the other.",
        "A: But what we -- we were being trained, obviously, to be the liaison unit on the -- on the\nground. And for eight months it was a fantastic experience to this day for me, because she was a\nfirst rate teacher, she was the wife of a white Russian diplomat of the League of Nations, they\nwere in -- after 1917 they were in, you know, from -- from Russia. And they ended up in -- in\nGeneva, with the League of Nations. By 1940 I assume things got uncomfortable for them, so\nthey made their way to the United States and she got a job with the army, teaching -- the army\ntaught languages of every possible language. The army taught -- taught Filipino dialects and so\non be-because that\u2019s to enable -- but in our case it\u2019s was a -- we were supposed to be an\nunderground liaison unit and it was a very interesting experience because in addition to the\nlanguage and in addition to subjecting us to have to -- to learn the bible of the Soviet political\nparty, which is called the history of the Communist party of the -- of the USSR, as they called it,\nwhich was in [indecipherable] Russian, she taught us literary Russian, and she taught us Russian\nhistory. So a -- a-after 18 and a half months, one nice day the door opened up and this lieutenant\ntold us the program is finished, no explanation. In wartime in the army you get no explanation,\nyou get orders. We were shipped off to a -- to s -- north -- G-Greensboro, North Carolina, as a --\nGreensboro is either in North Carolina or South Carolina, you\u2019ll have to correct me on that one.\nAnd this was a big staging area and we was shipped off to southern England and by the\nbeginning of May of 1944, I was in southern England with probably close to a million or so of\nother American troops, getting ready for the invasion. And as I was in the Air Force, I was lucky,\nI never got my feet wet.",
        "A: On -- on -- on [indecipherable] three I was flown over from southern England to Normandy.\nAnd I was assigned to a -- what was called a fighter bomber unit, which 1s a -- a u -- a unit of\nplanes with a single pilot.

        "A: No.",
        "A: I was, I gather because of my language training and so on, I must have been classified in there\nfor s-something to do with Intelligence.",
        "A: So I was assigned to the Intelligence unit of that particular fighter bomber unit in th -- in -- in\nthe Air Force. And my job was to brief the pilots every morning on whatever missions they had,\nand that was it. And y-y -- don\u2019t know when [indecipherable] airfields and we had at that time\nstill a segregated army. The black engineers were there 24 hours ahead of us, and they leveled\noff the [indecipherable] of Normandy. And later on a temporary airfield consisted of heavy metal\nrolls, and which -- which gave traction to the -- to the planes when they landed. But of course,\nNormandy 1s also -- has a lot of clay, so when it rained the metal would sink and our planes\nwould flop over, but we always had enough trucks and [indecipherable] and so on, that that\nwasn\u2019t -- anyway, we were -- we -- I was from -- from [indecipherable] three onward with --\nwith the -- with the whole invasion of Normandy, and we -- we had some experiences, but that\u2019s\n-- am n -- I am not -- and I don\u2019t belong to the war veterans, who are busy talking about their --\ntheir army exploits. Anyway, it was -- I went through the whole business and we had some tough\ntimes because in the beginning the Luftwaffe still was very strong, and they would -- they would\ntry to bomb the -- the beaches, because in order to be able to supply the forces, the beaches had\nto be lit up 24 hours a day, but they had tremendous anti-aircraft protection. But we were -- but\nwe were -- be 10 kilometers behind, deeper into the country. We did not have all this protection,\nso whatever they couldn\u2019t drop on the beaches, they dropped on us. But -- but obviously I -- I\nsurvived, and most of us did. The pilot -- the pilots is another story. And -- and then we -- we\nbroke through and we went through France and through the Battle of the Bulge and saw all these\nother things that you can read in the -- in the history of that period, and we -- then we inc -- w-we\ngot into Germany, and -- and we went all the way, as I said you, to the Elbe river, waiting for --",
        "A: -- directions to come.",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you e-exactly that an Air Force unit is in the airfield with planes, which are\nbeing fueled up and maintained --",
        "A: -- all the time. They go out on missions. Their missions are to provide support the infantry\nwhich means they -- they have to attack whatever moves on the other side of --",
        "A: -- whatever the front line is. And they come back, and they have to report on what they doing,\nthese reports have to go back. We are also being the most forward th -- A-American airfield who\nare on the receiving end of all the big planes that were coming back with dead and wounded on\nit.",
        "A: Because th-the -- the -- the -- I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t -- I can just that I can tell you I don\u2019t want to\ntalk about it, it -- basically the heavy bombers, they were huge planes with four engines and they\nhad maybe eight -- eight or nine crews of -- per -- per plane. And they would fly in -- in -- in\nwaves of several hundred at a time, to protect each other and so on against fight [indecipherable]\nagainst the Luftwaffe and so on. And they would go into German cities and factories and\nwhatever it is, and -- and bomb them, that\u2019s what they did. When I eventually -- after the war I\nhad to fly in from Frankfurt to Berlin, I could look into the basement of every building.",
        "A: Cause we managed to -- to burn through every -- every -- now, of course they, many of them\nwould have to go back damaged, for when the aircraft and the people wounded and dead over\nthere, it is probably the nearest air -- airfield, so it is -- they would come back, they would put\nout flares, and we would know whether we were dead or wounded or whether there\u2019s a serious\nmechanical problem. They would land at our airfield because we were the closest. We were not\nthe only ones, all of these close report fighter units were along the front lines 1n these places, part\nof which I was to debrief them and so on.",
        "A: During the Battle of the Bulge, we were physically attacked by the Luftwaffe, this -- this was\n[indecipherable]. And we had to, of course, protect ourselves as we did in s -- and then they were\nshot down and I had to be involved in the interrogation of them and so on, but this is what you\ndid.",
        "A: Oh, that helped.",
        "A: A -- very --",
        "A: The funny part of the -- of the German was in -- in that particular e-episode, which is a very\nfamous one if you read the -- the history of the Battle of the Bulge in December, that was the last\nattempt German General Rundstedt would try, they thought they could really break through and\ngo to the -- and they gave us a rough time, and it was -- you -- you\u2019ll -- you\u2019Il read about it if you\nread that history. They surrounded a -- wa -- one of the famous paratroop units, 101*' airborne\nand so on, and we were -- th-the unit was totally surrounded, you can read all about it. And th-the\nGerman general send the -- a unit with the right flag to talk to the -- to the general who is the\nhead of the airborne th-that th-th-they should surrender, and the great joke was, and that\u2019s a fact,\nh-he -- he said -- he told whoever was on our side, he\u2019s -- who was only a German, he said, tell\nhim in English, nuts to their offer. And the joke was literally that the -- th-the -- the Germans\nwent back and translated that into nusa, meaning nuts are to eat, and they didn't know what the\nhell he was [indecipherable] was, but -- but basically what I\u2019m trying to tell you basically is that\nthat was -- that was the grimmest part of it.",
        "A: And they dropped paratroopers in American uniforms, consisting of -- of American high\nschool graduates whose parents were part of the German American Bund.",
        "A: And in the 1930\u2019s they were -- you know -- you know, there were rallies of the German\nAmerican Bund, 20,000 strong in the -- in the ca -- Madison Square Garden. And some of them -\n- and some of them emigrated to -- to Nazi Germany, and took their teenage children with them,\nwho spoke fluent -- they were am -- American kids, they --",
        "A: -- they have no accent, nothing. Some of those were mobilized and put into American\nuniforms by the Germans and dropped as paratroopers behind our lines and did a lot of damage.",
        "A: We had among our people German Jewish refugees with German accents as thick as -- as a\nknockwurst, and -- and th -- and the MP\u2019s who became aware of this business started stopping\nJeeps along the way, and suddenly they would pick up somebody with a heavy German accent,\nso that they would take him into an MP -- military police stockade, and we would get a call,\ntelephone call, do you have a Hans Rosenfeld in your unit? If you do, then you better come and\nbail him out. But that was all part of -- of the -- that was the last big episode that -- we had some\ncasualties obviously, but then the war came to an end.",

We -- we -- we saw what was going on, plus -- plus a -- obviously th-th-thin -- the \u201cStars\nand Stripes\u201d had quite a few reports. I di -- I knew one thing which was very important to me\npersonally because my father was the only member of the family who -- who survived, and he\nsurvived by a fluke. He survived by ending up in eastern Russia.",
        "A: And -- and from time to time he was able to send a postcard to my aunt in -- in New York,\nand she would forward it on. So I knew that -- I knew that he was alive, but totally cut off from\nWilna and cut off from the rest of the family. That -- that I knew.",

        "A: They obviously also must have had some kind of list. Whether it had to do with -- with my\nbackground by now, I have no idea, but I -- y-you know, if -- it\u2019s r-really peculiar, I -- I don\u2019t\nrecall the precise incident.

One didn\u2019t know at that time when the war will end, anyway.\nOr whether one will begin to begin to be sent back home for -- to be demobilized or whatever.\nAnd I was approached and I said yes.

        "A: Yeah. I was -- I was officially discharged from the army, assigned to military government\nadministration and I was -- and I had to travel to Frankfurt to report to a unit of the finance\ndivision of the office of military government, U.S. for short OMGUS, O-M-G-U-S, that was its\nofficial name, and all of the documents and so on. And I was assigned to a -- to the -- to the unit\nwithin the finance division, who was supposed to do res-research on the German banking system\nduring the Nazi period, for two purposes. One, because the United States military government\ncame in with a program of decentralization and -- and decartelization of the whole German\nfinancial and economic system because that was, of course, also the -- the interlocking\ndirectorates of the banks and big industry and so on is a concentrated for -- element and force in -\n- in -- in helping the Nazi regime to -- to -- to prosper and to -- and to the military to be able to.\nAnd then of course as an instrument subsequently of -- of looting the occupied countries of -- of\nEurope.",

        "A: And -- and the other part of it is to develop whatever material could develop to send to the --\nto Nuremberg for the worker\u2019s trials, which had economic elements to it. I mean, the head of the\nReichsbank, Mr. Schacht, and the Chief Economics Minister Funk, and the others were part of\nthat -- of the Goering trial, and so on. And it was at that point where I began to develop working\ncontacts and working relationships with the prosecutors in -- in Nuremberg, whi -- that led later\non to a very close working relationship in connection with the first restitution program in the\nAmerican zone.",
        "A: Ben Ferencz, of course.",
        "A: I mean, in that context --",
        "A: -- where we got to know each other.",
        "A: And we -- there -- there were massive records in a place called Offenbach, which was about\neight kilometers from -- from the heart of Frankfurt. My first office in Frankfurt was in the\nbuilding of the Reichsbank branch, which is like the Federal Reserve bank. In Frankfurt that\nbuilding is still there, and of course the great luxury that I acquired and from which I didn\u2019t want\nto part was a -- was a rocking chair. After -- after a couple of years of army service in a tent in\nother places, the rocking chair was something special anyway. But that is what we did for several\nmonths, and that was also during the period when the Soviets, as you know, would not let the\nAmerican forces into Berlin. Although officially, according to the Alta agreement, we were\nsupposed to be in Berlin practically from the beginning, the Soviets needed a couple of months\nto -- to loot, rape and whatever. And -- and so I wer -- I worked out of Frankfurt until the\nbeginning of January, by which time already the military governor of -- was -- our military\ngovernor was -- was already in Berlin. His name was General Lucius Clay. And all the other\nmilitary governors were sitting there, and there was, at that time still that instrument which was\nsupposed to be the coordinating instrument, using the Russian term kommandatura, spelled with\na K, and that had to be -- that was part of our of-official vocabulary, and -- and I was then\ndirected to move from Frankfurt to Berlin, and I moved there in January of 1946. Berlin was in a\nshambles, of course. It was a very cold winter. The U.S. army did some lovely things for the\ncivilian population. Had tents on crossings and little islands with army potbelly stoves that were\ngoing all the time so people could go in and warm their hands, which I thought was -- was proper\nhumane thing to do and -- and -- and we did it. In any event, I was then assigned to the\nIntelligence division of the finance department, and my first assignment involved the writing of a\nreport on the largest of the German banks, which was called the Deutsche bank. The Germans\nhad three major banks. They were called the gross bank and the giant banks, that was the official\nGerman terminology. And that was the Deutsche bank, the Dresdner bank and the Commerce\nbank. Deutsche is deutsche in German and Dresdner is based on the city of Dresden, and\nCommerce is commerce. And they were in -- in that order in the size, and of course once we --\nwe got into their -- their records and -- and we interrogated a lot of people, and the picture was\nvery clear, they -- they -- the first step was the -- the [indecipherable] of the banking system, ri --\nright after January 30, 1933 when Hitler came to power, started the removal of -- of Jews from\nleading positions in the banking system, both in the -- in the board of directors, which was called\nthe [indecipherable] and the board of management, which 1s called the Vorstand. In this way, by\nthe way, is -- 1s with a V, written as a V and pronounced as a V. Vorstand, V-o-r-s-t-a-n-d. They\nremoved the Jews, there were -- there were prominent Jews as bankers, and prominent Jews on --\non the boards of directors and so on. That was the first step of elimination. Then the banks\nproceeded to Aryanize, to take over control of -- of many of the private banks which were Jewish\nowned. Germany had a -- a -- a whole series, starting with the Rothschild banks of course, but\nover the years private banks quite well known, Mendelssohn and -- and Aufweiser and etcetera,\netcetera, and Oppenheimer and so on. [indecipherable] up and down, and with the Aryanization\nof those banks and became instruments of the Aryanization of Jewish businesses. And that they\ndid very effectively and very e-e-efficiently between then -- \u00b033 and -- and -- and \u00b038 - \u00b039. And\nthen as -- as the war broke out, and particular it started first with the anschluss of Austria in\nMarch of 1938, the Deutsche bank moved in and took over the largest Austrian bank. The\nDresdner bank moved in and took over the second largest Austrian bank, called the Lander bank,\nthe first one was the [indecipherable], I mean, I -- I won\u2019t b-bore you with all this, but yeah, this\nis now what, \u201946, we did all this. And -- and so -- and so they went when th -- when -- when\nSudetenland was taken over and subsequently Czechoslovakia, the Deutsche bank took over the\nlargest --",
        "A: -- Czech bank and so on, very systematic, very orderly. And there was even a sort of a --\nbecame almost like a little rhyme, it -- 1t rhymes in German. Zuerst kommen die tanken, first\ncome the tanks, and then kommen die banken, and then come the banks. That rhymes in German,\nobviously, the tanken and banken rhyme. But it was like [indecipherable] the same thing applied\nto western Europe. When they moved into Belgium they took the control of the major banks,\nthey di -- took control in -- in Holland, etcetera. And so the first report was the report on the\nactivities of the Deutsche bank, and simultaneously the Dresdner bank w -- very -- it was a --\nwhere they -- a special unit, and I was part of it, and somewhere along the way I -- I was given\nmore responsibility and -- and in some of the subsequent investigations, I was the chief\ninvestigator of it and so on, and in any event, the objective of these reports was that th-the -- the\nmilitary government had to establish a policy on what is -- what kind of a bank is this\n[indecipherable]. One thing was very clear, that A, we will not allow a -- a intermingling of\nbanking and industrial corporations, because the German system, particular the -- the Nazi period\nis that the major banks ended up being the -- providing the chairmanships of the main major\nindustrial companies. It was a real intertwining of interlocking directorates, it 1s called in the\ndecartelization world. And in addition to that, we came with a tradition of decentralized banking\nin this country.

        "A: The state of New York was divided into banking districts, and if a bank was in Manhattan and\nin the Manhattan district of banking, it could not be in Buffalo and it could not be in Syracuse in\nthose days. So the whole idea of -- of extreme decentralization of banking, very important\n[indecipherable] anyways, but in this case it was important not to allow the reconstitution of -- of\nthe instruments which were important instruments in the whole Nazi program of -- of -- of -- of\ncontrol and -- and -- and centralization of economic power.",

But General Clay was here.\nAnd -- and then negotiations were going on for property restitution, the -- there was an\norganization that had to be -- the Jewish organizations properly advanced this whole issue. And\nthe major battle, and that was -- that was one of the great, basic, historic developments, which\nwas historic in the whole international law. In the normal, civilized life, if I die tomorrow in the\nstate of New York without heirs, the state of New York inherits me. You can go back to the\n[indecipherable] of 2,000 years plus, and you will find the principle intended for normal,\ncivilized societies. The Jewish organizations came to the U.S. government and said, that is not\nacceptable after the extermination of six million Jews. The successor -- the successor state of the\nThird Reich cannot become the beneficiary of the efficiency of their extermination program. I\nmean, you can go back to the -- to the old Biblical expression, you cannot mur-murder and\ninherit. And -- but that was a difficult battle, because the battle had to be th-the battle with\ninternational lawyers who said, too bad, this is ironclad concept and it cannot be a-any other\nway. And reparations -- remember historically, if you go back to World War I and so on, it was\nalways an issue between states. The -- the victorious state could exact reparations from the --\nfrom that state wa -- which was defeated, but it was always interstate dealings.",
        "A: Here obviously we were coming with -- the organizations were coming with demands for\nrestitution programs to individuals, regardless of what their nationality may be at the -- at the\nmoment that [indecipherable] had to be done, but most importantly with respect to the heir list,\nand unclaimed Jewish property, and to the property of Jewish communities and organizations\nthat were obliterated by the Nazi regime, that -- that it -- 1t could not [indecipherable] is the legal\nexpression is to this -- to the state in which the property was located. That took a long time and a\nlong fight, but the Jewish organizations prevailed, and the U.S. government agreed, and the first\nproperty restitution law was enacted as a United States military government law number 59, in\nNovember of 1947. And in that law there is a provision which says, unclaimed property of\nvictims of Nazi persecution as defined in the beginning of the law, shall accrue to a successor\norganization, which shall use the proceeds for the benefit of the class of persecutees.",
        "A: And this was a genuine revolutionary concept and development in international law. And it is\nto the everlasting credit, as far as I\u2019m concerned, of the United States government, that stood up\nall by itself, because I\u2019Il tell you in a moment for how long it stood up all by itself. The British\nand the French did not go along initially with this concept, and enacted this as valid for the\nAmericans [indecipherable] of Germany.",
        "A: There was no central government in Germany until the fall of 1949. Between \u00b045 and \u201949\nthere was no central government. Every military governor was the absolute ruler of his zone of\noccupation and this sector of Berlin. And there were municipal governments, and there\neventually were state governments, you know, Bavaria and Hassen and whatever. But there was\nno central government until four -- for over four years. And in November of 1947, this law was\nenacted in the American zone of Germany. American zone of Germany to give you an idea in\npresent day -- day Germany was cities like Frankfurt and Munich and Nuremberg and -- and\nKassel and Bremen as a port, and Stuttgart and etcetera, I mean it -- it was sort of the center of\nthe -- the British had th-the -- the industrial heart of Germany, the whole -- the Dusseldorf and\nCologne and the coal mines and the steel mills and so on, and Hamburg. And the French had the\nmost western part, bordering on Alsace, and -- on Alsatia and Alsace and -- and then -- and on\nthe lake area and so on, and the Black Forest, the Schwarzweld and so on, they had -- they had\nnice countryside, but that -- they, of course, were the smallest of the -- of the zones. When that\nwas enacted, General Clay wanted the British and the French, his counterparts to enact a similar\nlaw -- laws for their zones so there would be a single property restitution law in West Germany.\nThe Soviets you could forget about, they were not interested in private property, they were not\ninterested in the whole concept of compensation and restitution and so on. There was nothing to\ntalk about with them. The British and the French would not go along. Th-This was not in their --\nthe military governors obviously ca -- don\u2019t make these decisions, the decisions go back to the\ngovernments. And in the case of the governments, it of course goes to the foreign office in\nLondon, and to the [indecipherable] in Paris. The international lawyers over there said, no how.\nSo General Clay went in and -- and promulgated it in the American zone, and the Jewish\norganizations established in New York the first si -- Jewish successor organization called the\nJewish Restitution Success Organization, or JRSO for short.",
        "A: That was created almost at the same time when the law was enacted, it was in the last\nNovember of \u00b047, but it didn\u2019t come into real operation until the late spring of \u201948 because -- and\nthat is very difficult for us imag -- to imagine today -- you could not create from the outside any\nkind of an operation in the occupied parts of Germany unless you were somehow hooked up to\nmilitary government. You couldn\u2019t get housing, you couldn\u2019t get access to food, you couldn't --\nyou -- you could not function, ordinarily. So the -- the Jewish organizations, primarily the Joint\nDistribution Committee, which was -- had a massive operation in Germany because they were\nrunning the Jewish Displaced Persons camps. My s -- first contacts with the Joint were in the\nspring of 1946 in Berlin, because within a month or so when I came to Berlin, I discovered that\nthere was a Jewish Displaced Persons camp in the American sector of Berlin called Zehlendorf.\nSo of course I ber -- I marched myself over to Zehlendorf and I br -- and I met my JDC friends\nfrom that point on. And I would go to the army post exchange and buy cartons of cigarettes at a\ndollar -- Camels at a dollar apiece, 10 cents a pack, and schlep it to the -- to the DP camp\nbecause that was the currency, the reichsmark didn\u2019t --",
        "A: -- didn\u2019t mean very much. I had to deliver the [indecipherable] she was the happiest woman,\nshe would get two ca -- two cartons of Camels a week. She was a rich woman in Berlin in those\ndays. Anyway, so if -- the JDC then was very much involved in establishing the JRSO, so they\nsent the general consul to the -- to -- of the JDC to two people, to Ben Ferencz in Nuremberg\nwho had just finished being the prosecutor of the Einsatzgruppen. And I don\u2019t have to tell you\nthe Einsatzgruppen was the most organized killer organization that went -- that went right behind\nthe ar -- the German army after June 1941, and every day would telegraph a report, so many\nJews and so many Bolsheviks, and of course they did [indecipherable] and a few other nice\nplaces like that. And -- and he just finished his tour of duty -- I mean his -- the -- the -- the\nEinsatzgruppen trial, and by the way, hi-his was the only trial which sent the largest number of\nSS officers and generals to the gallows. And we -- Ben -- Benny and I know each other from --\nalready from before in terms of -- of the -- of my -- my feeding them material on the -- out of the\neconomic records. At that point we were blockaded by Stalin. In the spring of 1948, Joseph\nStalin thought that the moment has come to try and push us out of Berlin as the beginning of\npushing us out of Germany and western Europe. The Communist parties of France were\npowerful. The Communist parties of Italy were powerful, and it was -- economic conditions were\nterrible. Marshall plan was just beginning to -- to -- to get into full gear, and Stalin thought this\nwas a good moment. So he cut off rail access to -- to -- to West Berlin, and water access, you\nknow, there were canals and so on that would go into Berlin. And there was -- if you -- if you go\ninto the histories, you can read and find that there was serious discussion in Washington as to\nwhether or not the U.S. and the western powers should pull out of Berlin and give him -- give\nhim -- and give Stalin [indecipherable]. It was Clay who went to Harry Truman and came up\nwith the idea of the airlift. And from that -- and that coincided with something else, I mean that\u2019s\nthe reason I say to you that -- that some of the historic context of how some of these things that\nwe are talking about [indecipherable] today were born, have not been properly and in depth\nresearched and put in the proper context. Simultaneously, in order to begin to rebuild the\neconomy of -- of West Germany, the allied powers [indecipherable] when they talk about the\nallied powers, you ca -- have to assume the U.S. being in the lead. The U.S. was in the lead miles\nahead of everybody else. We were strongest militarily, economically, we were [indecipherable |\nas a country, we -- you know, the British and -- and the French and so on were -- were physically\nand otherwise exhausted. And a -- the decision was made to in -- to introduce the deutsche mark,\nthe idea being that you introduce a new currency and you build a new economy base.",
        "A: And the new currency was introduced in June of 1948. [indecipherable] it takes a year for\nsuch a decision to be implemented. The first deutsche marks were printed by the American bank\nnote company in the United States. I mean, if you have to project yourself to -- to this whole time",
        "A: -- who -- who would anticipated in the spring of \u201948 that Stalin will decide to blockade us in\nBerlin and we would have to protect the new currency from falling into the wrong hands. There\nwas no Berlin wall at that time, and the Communist party of West Germany was swimming in\nreichsmarks. There were Bavarian villages that never in the Weimar Republic ever had the\nCommunist vote, that had a small Communist party office, because when the Soviets moved into\neast Germany and so on, they cleaned out every German bank that was there, Reichsbank, and so\non, and they had railroads full of reichsmark. And although the reichsmark didn\u2019t have great\nvalue, but mountains of them would still some value, and we introduced the mark -- the deutsche\nmark and there\u2019s -- and there\u2019s -- if you read the papers from that time, the hens began laying\neggs overnight. Suddenly, suddenly goods and things began coming up and the economy began\nto -- to -- to develop and so on, and the Soviets were trying desperately to -- to -- to lay their\nhands on this currency. And we had to -- we had to run an economy of the western sectors of\nBerlin with a majority of the va -- population unemployed, with airlifted coal and airlifted goods,\nand to keep the -- this economy going, and to protect our currency from -- from being depleted.\nAnd suddenly I found myself as the chief of financial Intelligence of military government to be\nresponsible for doing things that nobody has ever been taught in the -- in the economics school,\nand never probably taught again.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: By all means.",
        "A: As I see it, and it -- and you can say eventually it is subjective because of -- of my own\nimmersion in this -- in this whole area. But as I -- as I keep thinking over the years that there is\none area which in my judgment is that had been fully and properly researched and -- and\nexamined, and that is what were the particular forces and elements in the -- in the lil -- late\n1930\u2019s and the early 1940\u2019s that -- that made it possible for organized world Jewry, and I use -- I\nsay organized because unless -- unless something is organized, unless there 1s some sort of an\ninstrumentality, then it is a lot of conversation. Maybe conversation 1s important, yo-you -- you\nmay not come to the -- to the action before -- be-before you -- before you -- you -- you\ncontemplate the problem, but nonetheless, for the first time -- and I\u2019m not a professional\nhistorian, so I say it with all these caveats and reservations, but I think it\u2019s the first time where\nthe organized Jewish community in this global sense has -- has decided, in response to -- to 1n-\nincredible tragedy that has befallen the Jewish people, to -- to confront the perpetrators or -- or\ntheir successors. Because if I go back, at least to the extent which -- and I have spent obviously,\ntime going back to -- to periods of -- of disaster and catastrophe in Jewish life, there was an\nevent, or events of -- of persecution and of -- and of physical damaging injury and -- and murder\nwith the survivors ultimately going into some kind of exile or into some -- away from wherever\nit is, leaving behind all their worldly goods, basically, and building a new life and a new\nexistence and new communities in hope that -- that it will not be destroyed or damaged again.\nAnd you see rip -- that repeatedly but frequently enough, whether you go back to the destructions\nof the temple, the -- the temples of the -- of the Babylonian period or -- or s -- or subsequently in\nthe -- in the Middle Ages, the pogroms and the Crusaders and the period about -- which Barbara\nTuchman described in -- in -- in some of her books and so on, what you saw was, the Jews\npicked themselves up from the area where the Crusaders and so on persecuted them. Fortunately\nthe kings of Poland wanted -- needed craftsmen, and that in -- created an open door, and the Jews\nwere moved from the Rhine area into Poland, etcetera and a new chapter in Jewish history\nopened up [indecipherable] Jewish community in Poland, in eastern Europe and so on. And --\nand -- and then subsequently came all kinds of -- forms of persecution, some of them --\nobviously 1492 in Spain, and again the Jews ran and left everything behind and build new lives\nand -- and those who were caught by the Inquisition of course, perished. And -- and then came\nthe whole si -- middle -- middle of 17\" century with the [indecipherable] pogroms. Again the\nsame -- the same phenomenon. Persecution, murder, exile, escape, flight, whatever. I am\nobviously not going into the intricacies, but [indecipherable] that -- that\u2019s the picture. And -- and\neven as late as -- as the beginning of the 20\" century, with the pogroms of [indecipherable] and\nwhat was the response there? The massive migration out of Russia to -- to -- to the United States.\nThe roots of the vast majority of American Jews today are the -- the gr-grand -- the grand or gr --\nor great-grandparents of those who ran from the pogroms of -- of -- of Tsarist Russia. No-\nNobody dug in their heels and said, we were -- we were driven out, we were hurt, we were\ndamaged, we were persecuted. S-S -- this -- this government, or this successor government\ncannot get away with this. Now you can say that -- that -- that the [indecipherable] and that\nHitler and -- and -- and the Third Reich and the industrialized, massive, incredible industrialized\npersecution and -- and -- and annihilation of -- of six million people in -- in five years was so\nearth-shaking and [indecipherable] earth-shaking. Sometimes I ask myself -- I don\u2019t know, 1s it --\nwas it for the days of the [indecipherable] pogroms for -- for the Jews at that time as great a\nhorror as -- as -- as Kristallnacht? I-I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t judge it. Or -- or -- or the\n[indecipherable] of a whole people out of the Iberian peninsula? I mean, that certainly was not a -\n- a local -- a small local event of -- of some people in the village of [indecipherable] getting cr-\ncrazy. Now, the other possibility is -- is, of course, maybe by the 1930\u2019s, there were things\naround us at the world at large that -- that established some kind of precedence, in other words of\n-- of some forms of collective response to something. I -- I\u2019m not sure. The one thing that comes\nto mind for instance was the -- was the Armenian -- the persecution of the Armenians by the\nTurks in 1915, the World War I. I haven\u2019t researched that for myself well enough to know\nwhether there was, first of all on the part of the Armenians outside of Turkey, some organized\neffort to attempt to confront the Turkish government with it. I\u2019m not sure, at least I\u2019m not aware\nthat it was of such open and -- and strong [indecipherable] fashion as I think happened finally in\n-- in the early 1940\u2019s with respect to -- to -- to the human and material consequences o-of the\nHolocaust. And that -- and that -- I mean, I share a result of -- of a layman\u2019s perception of a\nfeeling that something extra historically, certainly, in my opinion, in Jewish history, historically\nsomething extraordinary happened, and then so on. And even -- and e -- and it, to me it would be\nthat even be necessarily confined to Jewish history alone. The question of a -- of a persecuted\ngroup which is not represented by a state, that does not have an army, that does not have the --\nthe -- the basic indices of -- of -- of power, has somehow developed first -- first -- first agreed or\nbegin to -- to -- to find this -- this whole approach, and then -- and then ended up building, if you\nwill, the infrastructure to -- to -- to -- to -- to carry it forward and to -- and to turn it into\nsomething tangible, for the benefit of the victims, for [indecipherable] th-the victims themselves.\nAnd -- and -- and that -- that has to be analyzed. One has to analyze the elements of American\nJewish history 1-1n -- in the -- in the 19 -- in the 1930\u2019s, in Palestine, in -- in -- in -- in how -- in\nhow the German Jewish community reacted. In what it ca -- what it carried with it when -- when\nit began en masse to -- to leave. What is connected with it, of course, I mean I -- I\u2019m drifting, but\nPll get back on the main track, is also where were the fi -- where were the -- the failings? The\nfailings being did the organized Jewish world after 1933 sufficiently analyze where the Third\nReich and -- and the Nazis and Hitler were leading? After all, of the 600,000 German Jews,\n300,000 remain in Germany. Now, again, I make a statement like that and it sounds again like an\nexaggeration an-and unqualified. I realize that among the 300,000 that stayed may have been\ntens of thousands who would have been -- who wanted to get out and the world wouldn\u2019t take\nthem in, including this country. But nonetheless, there were large numbers of people, some of\nwhom I\u2019ve known among -- among German Jewry and subsequently Austrian Jewry and so on,\nwho thought, you know, this is a passing business, and now we\u2019re -- and now we\u2019re -- good\nGermans will -- will take care of this upstart over there because in other words, where th -- I f -- I\nforget about the world, but where -- where did the Jewish leadership? And I am not trying to be\nac-accusatory, I\u2019m trying to -- to save what -- what did we f -- when I say we, I\u2019m talking in the\nbroad, historical [indecipherable] sense, failed to see as to where it was going. Now you can\nmake the argument I ca -- I talk to myself, you know, I -- yo-you -- you can make the argument\non the other side to say there was no precedent for this type of -- of -- of organized massacres,\nalthough there were massacres in history. What follows from it? Had we -- had we really,\ncollectively, deeply analyzed where this was going? Maybe we could have done more than we --\nthan we did to get people out. To protect, to save, to -- to -- to d -- I don\u2019t know to do what. So to\n-- to me, as I -- you know, being -- being immersed into this -- I don\u2019t know, up to the -- the tip\nof my head or whatever it is, or beyond it. I -- I say to myself, this -- this has to be more\nprofoundly examined. I don\u2019t know how else to [indecipherable] sometimes I am at a loss for\nwords. But -- and -- and I think this is -- this is subjects for philosophers, this is subjects for\nethicists, this is subjects for historians. The Jews -- the Jews would not be -- were not alone in\nthis world. As a matter of fact the Jews were -- were more intertwined with the world than\nmaybe any other people because they were -- because they were scattered and because they had\nto survive always as minorities.

You had to establish that there was a\nforced sale, you had to establish that these people were Jewish. You have to establish that the\nproper consideration was paid, etcetera, etcetera. We started digging into the antecedents of\nAlfred Rosenberg, it was the ideologue of the Nazi party, whose villa in 1937 was not good\nenough for him. He sold the old villa and then proceeded to buy a new villa. So -- so we filed a\nclaim for the -- for the restitution of -- of the villa of -- of Alfred Rosenberg and the -- and it was\nunder -- for years 1t was pending because, you know, with 163,000 pieces of paper, it took\nawhile until -- until it all got processed.

I can tell you that on the 10\" of September 1952, when the\nagreements were signed in the old rathouse of Luxembourg, and all the signing was over, and it\nwas very solemn and very tense, I would say, and there were three documents that were signed,\nAdenauer with Moshe Sharett, the first one is so Israel and the so-called [indecipherable]\nagreement of the -- the German -- the German Israeli reparations agreement -- the word\nreparations was not used. Somebody invented a very nice word called collective recompense.\nYou can write it down, it\u2019s a -- a term attributed to that particular thing, because there was no\nstate of Israel during the Hitler period, etcetera, okay.

Anyway, that\u2019s part of politics, but it is the -- but --\nbut what became clear is that when finally Adenauer appeared in September of \u201951 in the Bundist\n[indecipherable] Rosh Hashanah and delivered that famous statement about unspeakable crimes\nwere committed in the name of the German people, etcetera, and extended an invitation to the\nstate of Israel and to representative the world [indecipherable], and wanted to create an\ninstrument of voluntary agencies, which would be as broad and as representative to be a proper\nnegotiating party to a government.

And Nahum Goldmann then\nconvened the 23 member organizations in the Waldorf Astoria in October of \u201951, and that\u2019s\nwhere the Claims Conference was born, first of all i-in -- initially, A, to provide worldwide\nbacking to the state of Israel is -- in its ne-negotiations with -- with the German Federal\nRepublic, and then to develop the programs of claims and demands on behalf the Holocaust\nsurvivors wherever they were. And -- and if you\u2019ll take so that the -- the JRSO as such had too\nnarrow an institutional base at that time. [indecipherable] these 10 -- 10 organizations. And it had\nto be as broad geographically, ideologically and philosophically. And if you take a look at the\nmembership from -- from \u201951 to this day, you will find geographically the Canadian Jewish\nCongress, the major American organizations, the leading Argentinean organizations, the leading\nAustralian organization, the leading South African organization, the Jewish agency for Israel, the\n-- the leading French, British, the German, the world organizations. [indecipherable] Israel world\norganization on one hand, and the World Union of Progressive Judaism, who were fighting tooth\nand nail each other philosophically, clear. This is fire and water, theologically.",
        "A: And it was -- it was, I think Nahum Goldmann\u2019s genius ability, but also the -- the -- the\nmaturity and the responsiveness of all the organizations who recognize this, on this issue, we all\nhave to come together. Like in the old days of -- I don\u2019t know, of the -- of the court of King\nArthur, all the swords had to -- had to be left in the -- in the anteroom, because we, within the\nparameters, we were established. We had to be united and representatives and we were.\nOrganizations that continued to fight each other philosophically and publicly, I mean the\nAmerican Jewish Committee and the World Jewish Congress were -- were philosophically at\nloggerheads much less su-su-subsequently. This whole Claims Conference experiment turned out\nfrom the -- this is another aspect, turned out to be from -- from the Jewish communal -- the\ndevelopment of Jewish communal structures. A tremendous experiment with -- consequently\nwould have never had a president\u2019s conference in the United States today if the Claims\nConference would not have been there before. Because these -- these divergent organizations\ndiscovered that they could sit around one table, had a clearly defined agenda and clearly\ndesignated parameters.

        "A: -- [indecipherable] people, there was a m -- in Israel itself, this became a -- the most explosive\nissue that if -- that the Ben Gurion government, which was the first government of Israel faced.\nMenachem Begin led the opposition to the Ben Gurion government on all kinds of issues, and\nthis became one of the major issues in his battle with Ben Gurion. The argument was when we\nshould take th -- we should not take any blood money, and -- and the -- it -- it took the form of\ndemonstrations, it took the form of -- of such serious demonstrations that I think for the first time\nin the history of the state of Israel, the Kenesit had to be surrounded by police, maybe by army\ntoo, but when Ben Gurion went in January of 1952 to the Kenesit to rec -- to receive a majority\nvote for Israel entering into negotiations with Germany. So that controversy was partially\nphilosophical, or partially moral if you will. I mean, there were people who -- who really, out of\ngenuine inner convictions, and there were people who -- who mixed the opposition with -- with\ndirect political -- this was a -- a -- a very strong issue, you have to think about it. Th -- by that\ntime there were several hundred thousand survivors already in -- in Israel, and it was a-- av --a\nvery controversial issue, and it -- it took the form of -- as I say of -- of -- of very major\ndemonstrations in Israel. In the United States, in New York, we had one really serious episode.\nAnd that is, we had one day a meeting, after the original meeting in the Waldorf, in another hotel\nin New York, and a group of a young -- there was a youth o-organization of the -- of Begin\u2019s\nparty, and -- and they -- that organization was called Betar. This is -- today it would be the youth\nmovement of the Likud in Israel, the -- the -- the -- the logical political extension of that\nmovement. And they came into the hotel where we had the meeting, and they had a -- a sit down\nstrike. They sat down in the hallway blocking the access -- exit and the entrance to my meetings,\nand we had to get -- after, when the meetings were over, we wanted to get Nahum Goldmann and\nother of the people out because you never know if you get, particularly that this was -- Betar is a\n-- was a pretty militant group anyway, but in New York -- in New York they were -- I mean,\noutside of Israel there were f -- people ideologically, philosophically, there are people today who\nsay they\u2019re not going to go to Germany to visit, or I will not buy a German product and so on. I\nmean, even today, to this day, but certainly in -- in -- in those days. And it was -- it went so far,\nfor instance, that there was one group of -- of Holocaust survivors who organized themselves\ngenerally, and those were the people who came out of Bergen-Belsen, of the Bergen-Belsen\ncamp. And although the -- the chairman of their group, a man called Joseph Rosensaft was\nactually helpful in connection with the negotiations, his organization and these people would --\nwould -- they would not want -- they did not want to become members of the Claims Conference\nbecause they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to negotiate with the Germans, regardless of who the\nGermans were who were negotiating partners. Anyway, by January of \u201952, Ben Gurion got his\napproval of the majority of the Kenesit, the Claims Conference was ready to go, and we had\ninternal discussions between the Claims Conference and Mr. Sharett in preparation for the\nnegotiations. But that -- we were -- one thing at that time was clear, none of us would go to\nGermany for negotiations. So this -- the -- the government of Israel had to find a neutral country\nthat was willing to host us. And that was not so simple because it required security. We never\nknew whether neo-Nazi elements or any other elements were going to -- to cause problems. The\nDutch government agreed and made available to us, a chateau. A medieval castle with a moat\nand a drawbridge, literally. You can still see it, it\u2019s now a conference center. And the German\ndelegation, headed by 20 Nazis and the Claims Conference delegation and the Israel delegation\nwere all housed in the same chateau, in different wings and so on, in the same place. And the\nnegotiations were, as a rule, in the morning between the Germans and the Israelis, and in the\nafternoon between the Germans and the Claims Conference, and in the evenings and in between,\nof course, the Claims Conference, and the Israeli delegates were together, obviously together\n[indecipherable]. And there were, of course, crises, and periods when we had to interrupt the\nnegotiations and go over there to f -- had to fly from Paris to -- to Bonn to negotiate with\nAdenauer on the contentious issues and to find some kind of compromise. This happened several\ntimes. I personally had to shuttle more frequently, because as the executive director of the\nClaims Conference, our negotiations policy committee was sitting in New York, of the top lay\nleadership of the Claims Conference, and I would -- and first of all the Claims Conference as an\norganization had to function. So I would sh -- spend a couple of weeks in -- in negotiations and\nfly back to New York and -- and we -- the organization go back and forth. But we also had\nperiods when the negotiations were suspended because there were serious differences of opinion.\nThe negotiations lasted from the 22\" of March -- as a matter of fact, a day after tomorrow will\nbe -- 207 -- 52 -- 55 years.",
        "A: Exactly. I ca -- didn\u2019t think about it. 55 years since we landed in a separate runway in -- in --\nin Amsterdam. We were flown in because Dutch security didn\u2019t want us to c -- to come in with\nthe regular business. So -- so they landed us on a -- on a secluded -- and packed us into cars, and\nbrought us to the Kasteel oud Wassenaar, the castle of old Wassenaar. Had one great vir -- virtue\nas far as I was concerned. Was withi -- within the walking distance of a beautiful museum which\nhas a fantastic Rembrandt, and that is called the Mauritshuis House, the house of a man called\nMauritshuis. And there is \u201cThe Anatomy Lesson\u201d by Rembrandt which 1s as big as this wall.\nAnd after 12 - 14 hours, I would run a -- run away from the chateau with a Dutch security guard\nwho hated museums passionately. Probably as a kid he must have been dragged by his hair to a\nmuseum and I would say to him, you can sit outside and smoke your lousy cigarettes, and I'll\ngive you a piece of paper if anything happens to me inside of the museum, it\u2019s my responsibility.\nAnd that -- that then, after awhile I thought that these characters from the -- from the painting\nwill start talking to me. I mean it -- this 1s a fantastic painting, it\u2019s still there. Anyway, and we\nwere there with intervals for -- until the third week of August, more or less.",

        "A: Sub [indecipherable] delegation had to go back and we\u2019d come back and -- and they were\nvery complicated issues, they were issues of -- that overlapped, because we negotiated\ncompensation agreements which affected all victims of Nazi persecution, whether they were\nIsraeli citizens, or American citizens, or Australian ci -- or [indecipherable]. And -- and there\nwere overlaps. The German delegation, by the way, was headed initially by two anti-Nazis, one a\nProfessor Burn, a professor of civil law from Frankfurt University, who I believe was -- was\ntowards the end of the war in a Gestapo jail. And a man called Dr. Otto Kirsten, who was a\nleading Protestant pol-politician o-opposing the Hitler regime. He was a lawyer in Stuttgart, and\n-- and there was a t -- an issue a-and they were our negotiating partners. Of course, they would\nreceive instructions from the Adenauer government, and at times there were issues where --\nwhere we knew that -- that they were communicating to us positions that they personally were\nnot necessarily in favor of. And this was the time that we instinctually would call time out and\nget ahold of -- of Nahum Goldmann in Paris and tell him to -- and ask him to fly to -- to Bonn to\nnegotiate with Adenauer. And -- and Goldmann was fantastic in that respect, I mean. This 1 --\nthis was a man with a broad intellectual horizon, a broad western intellect. Although he was born\nin -- in -- 1n a small town in -- in what would be Lithuania, I think, today, but his parents early\nwent to Germany, and he was a product of Heidelberg and I don\u2019t know what other universities.\nAnd during World War I, believe it or not, as a very young academic, I think he worked for the --\nfor the Kaiser\u2019s foreign ministry on some -- you know, routine job over there, it is -- was -- the\nreason I mention all this is -- is because his -- his cultural roots -- I\u2019m talking -- I\u2019m not talking\nabout the Jewish cultural roots, I\u2019m talking his general roots. His academic roots were, to a very\ngreat extent, similar to the -- to the people -- the policy makers of the new -- of the new German -\n- of the new post-war Germany. I mean, he and Adenauer would -- would -- he would go to\nSwitzerland to -- to -- to spend hours and hours with Adenauer on issues that had nothing to do\nwith us. Va-Vacation issues, the -- whatever. And -- but this was a man with a -- with a very\nbroad political, international, diplomatic talents, and a man from whom I learned a great deal. He\nwas old enough to be my father. He was born in \u201995, and I was born in \u201922.",
        "A: And I\u2019m right, he was -- correct. And --",
        "A: [indecipherable] put it this way first. Pll be very precise on this point, because I wrestled with\nit. There were individuals who had an inner moral, ethical, personal inability to face anything or\nanybody which reminded them of Germany. Then there were politicians, who -- about whom I\nwas not always sure where the political consideration, that this 1s a hot issue under which I can --\nI can undercut my opponent, or whether there was -- this was a pure moral issue. So I -- I -- I di -\n- I do -- I don\u2019t tend to pass judgment on it, but my view is completely different.",
        "A: My view was and 1s and always will be, we were there demanding what is rightfully ours, and\nwe were demanding it from those who were -- who had responsibility. In many cases who even\ncontrolled the assets and -- and overall who had the moral, legal, historic responsibility to make\namends for what their predecessor government had done. The f-first post-war German\ngovernment said very clearly and unequivocally, it is the succe -- for better or for worse, it is the\nsuccessor state of the Third Reich. He didn\u2019t play games like cur -- like [indecipherable]",
        "A: So to me, we -- we were not there seeking charity, or pleading for -- t-to be nice to us, or to\nhave mercy on us. We were there demanding our rights.",
        "A: And in the individual basis, what will I say if -- if -- 1f somebody injured me bodily and -- and\n-- and the person will be -- we will go to court, I will refuse to confront him? I mean, to me that -\n- to me this was -- w-was -- was a clear cut issue. I always felt -- well, now we\u2019re not talking\nabout I -- I would say we collectively felt -- after all, this was not an individual --",
        "A: -- exercise. We collectively felt that A, there had to be an acknowledgement of responsibility,\nwhether it was Konrad Adenauer\u2019s statement, or whether it was at the time when -- when it -- the\nyear 2000 we signed the agreement on the slave labor business, the president of the Federal\nRepublic of Germany in the year 2000, on the day when we signed the agreement establishing\nthe slave labor fund, delivered a clear, unequivocal statement acknowledging responsibility, even\n-- he went even emotionally asking for forgiveness, etcetera, and he certainly was an anti-Nazi or\nwhatever it is, but he was the head of the successor state of the Third Reich, and they were\ndealing with the consequences of it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t say that everything that -- that\nwas already accomplished 1s all that should have been accomplished, and so on. There will never\nbe what the Germans call [speaks German here]. The term [speaks German] means to make\nwhole.",
        "A: What has been done can never be made whole. I\u2019m not talking, obviously about six million\ndead human beings that can\u2019t -- even the material losses cannot be made whole. The -- the full\namends cannot be made to anybody who survived a concentration camp or a ghetto, or -- or -- or\nwho lost somebody who was -- who was near and dear. But -- but it -- 1t -- we a -- we -- we\napproached and [indecipherable] properly, as a matter of right, seeking the acknowledgement\nand then negotiating some forms of -- of -- what\u2019s -- wh-what I would say simply, a measure of\njustice. That\u2019s the best I can say.",
        "A: [indecipherable] know that the whole basis of the negotiations were -- they had -- there was a\nclear distinction of the foundation of the negotiations between the government of Israel and\nGermany, and the Claims Conference. The government of Israel requested or sought 1.5 billion\ndollars on the basis of the cost of absorption of 500,000 Jewish victims of Nazi persecution, first\nin the [indecipherable], first in the Palestine and subsequently in the -- 1n Israel itself. And it was\nthis one billion 500 million dollars which was the basis of the negotiation. The settlement was\nthen -- a portion of it was roughly half of it. But -- but that was the basis. The Claims Conference\nbasis was compensation for depravation of liberty, for loss of provider, for damage to health, for\ninterrupted --",
        "A: -- occupation. For assets that were confiscated, lost or destroyed. For communal institutions\nthat were obliterated, and on and on and on. If you will take a look at our documents, they had\ntwo protocols. The -- the -- the legislative protocol is pages and pages and pages not of laws, of\ncommitments to enact laws.",
        "A: The German finance ministry published at its own expense, seven thick volumes on the\nspecific implementation of these agreements. They\u2019re innumerable -- they are basic laws, they\nare regulations, they are court rulings. I mean, this is a massive legislative, administrative body\nof work that has -- that has evolved out of this.",
        "A: Now, for Israel --",
        "A: -- their -- the repar -- the -- the [indecipherable] agreement was vital for its economic\ndevelopment. You also have to bear in mind something which you -- which sounds incredible\ntoday. The German government at that point was not in a position to settle this claim for money,\nso it ended up working out an agreement with the provision of goods and services to Israel, with\na limited monetary component for the purchase of petroleum from Great Britain. It was a time\nwhen the state of Israel -- when the agreement was signed, the state of Israel was four years and -\n- and four month old, and in those days it couldn\u2019t get a letter of credit in a Swiss bank for love\nor money. The first bank that really opened up to the state of Israel, believe it or not, was the\nBank of America, which was created and established by -- by an Italian immigrant in California.\nIf you look into the history of the Bank of America, it was established -- the name will come to\nme in a minute -- and the American banking system in those days was -- was run by WASPs, by\ngood -- by good -- you know -- but Bank of America was created by [indecipherable] like -- I\nmean it -- it-it\u20191l co -- anyway, the first real strong foreign bank that was ready to do business\nwith Israel was the Bank of America. Now I -- I say all this to you because the -- the -- a good\npart of the infrastructure of Israel was -- was established as a result of this agreement. The first\nmerchant marine, the Zimlines as they were called, were -- were ships built in -- in Hamburg and\nin other -- and in other port cities of Germany. The port of Ashdod, which is the second port after\nHaifa was built out of German reparations money. The -- a good part of the electric grid of Israel.\nSo -- so for Israel, this was a -- a very important agreement in its practical --",
        "A: No, th -- the -- [Il tell you exactly. The claims -- the total agreement was three billion 450\nmillion deutsche marks. In those days it was the equivalent of 712 million dollars. You -- you\ntake the sum, divide it by 4.2. Th-That was the ratio. Can you imagine? Today the dollar is a\nfraction of -- of the Euro, but -- so --",
        "A: Okay, and I\u2019m gonna --\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: Yeah, I wanted to go back to, because you asked me earlier about who -- who were the people\ninvolved in -- in this whole process and -- and I think I -- I -- I didn\u2019t answer it as fully as I th-\nthink I -- I want to and I should. But as I say, whatever has been accomplished 1-initially and\nsince and now and I\u2019m sure going forward, is a product and the result of a collective effort of a\ngroup of individuals who are involved in a professional lay capacity that depends upon which\nindividual and what phase and at what stage o-of -- of the various processes. When I -- when we\nspoke earlier about the a-antecedents of all of these programs in the immediate postwar period,\nand th-the -- the main issues had to be negotiated with the U.S. government as the most powerful\nof the -- of the allied victorious powers, there were essentially four Jewish organizations that\nworked together in that effort, and that was the American Jewish Committee, the American Joint\nDistribution Committee, the Jewish Agency for Palestine at that time, and the World Jewish\nCongress. And -- and these were essentially, as far as the -- the Jewish agency for -- the Jewish\nAgency for Palestine were the American representatives, and of course Nahum Goldmann, who\nlived in the United States at that time and was the chairman of the -- executive of the Jewish\nagency in addition to being the chairman of the -- executive of the World Jewish Congress and\nso on and I -- I may be off by a year or two [indecipherable] the titles, but in those two\norganizations they played a leading role already at th -- at the -- at the end of the war. And -- and\nof the two American organizations, of course, they were domiciled in New York, and -- and th-\ntheir -- particularly the American Jewish committee had a -- a legal council in Washington, a\nman wh-who was also at times with the State Department, his name was Seymour Ruben. And --\nand the American Je -- th-the Jewish agency on these issues was represented by their American\ncouncil, a man called Maurice Bookstein, who was sitting -- who was living in New York as an\nAmerican Jew. And -- a -- a -- and then of the -- the World Jewish Congress, there were two\nbrothers, Jacob and Nehemiah Robinson. They both came from Lithuania. Jacob was already an\ninternational lawyer of some standing in the -- in the 1930\u2019s in -- in Lithuania, and Nehemiah\nwas a outstanding scholar and he headed up the World Jewish Congress, created an institute of\nJewish affairs it was called, it\u2019s official title. It was a -- a research facility, a research\norganization which Nehemiah led and directed. And in many, many ways he was -- he was the\nco-conceptualizer of -- of a lot of -- of what we developed subsequently as our specific programs\nfor demands, etcetera. In addition to that, and of course in the -- in the -- in the Joint Distribution\nCommittee, they had the co-council in Europe as well, a man called Jerome Jacobsen and -- and\npeople in -- in New York in the headquarters -- oh, for God sakes. Come to me 1n a minute. Eli\nRock. E-]-i R-o-c-k. And of course, Mo-Moses Levitt is the -- as the chief executive in -- in the\nAmerican Jewish Committee, the head of the -- their international department was a prominent\nEuropean lawyer of Polish origin called Si-Simon Siegel. And his deputy was the father of the\nrecent -- of Alan Habershi. Would you believe? His name was Eugene Habershi, he was a\nHungarian diplomat and the son of the conservative chief rabbi of Hungary, okay? I be -- I met\nAlan Habershi -- Alan Habershi when [indecipherable] would bring him to the office at age 15 or\nwhatever. So anyway, I g -- I -- I give you the -- the -- the players at that point, because although\nthey came from different corners organizationally and so on, and there were no previous\nstructural arrangements for cooperative activities, around this issue, these people and these\nindividuals were closer together and very, very, very effective. And of course by the -- by the\ntime it came to 1952, or fi -- or \u00b051 and -- and \u201952 negotiations, by that time of course, Ben\nFerencz and I were involved out of the operation in Germany itself of the successor organization,\nand we worked with all these people because the American Jewish Committee and the World\nJewish Congress. And -- and the American Joint Distribution Committee, and whom did I leave\nout? And the Jewish agency were founding members of the JRSO.",
        "A: Every year when we would elect officers in the g -- in the j -- JRSO, one year the chairman\nwas a g -- a JDC designee, and the next year was a Jewish agency designee and so on. So by the\ntime the Claims Conference came into being, there was already a -- a group of -- of experts,\nprofessionals plus laypeople in these respective organizations, who were involved in the subject\nmatter. And the delegation was expanded in The Hague because we brought in people from\nEngland. First of all 1t was important, remember, we had to make sure that the principle, western\npowers were -- were there, and it was important also to us. So a -- a man who was a member of\nparliament, whose name was Alec Easterman, who was member of our delegation, at least that\nhe -- he didn\u2019t sit all the time in The Hague, he had to be an -- an MP in -- in London, too, but --\nand what was important, the German refugee organization called the Council of Jews from\nGermany was headquartered in London. And Rabbi Leo Baeck, after whom the Baeck Institute\nwas named subsequently, was, so to say the -- the spiritual and the -- and the -- a-and the sort of\nleader of -- of this whole movement. So we -- we brought in -- in -- into the delegation the then\nexecutive head of their organization, a man called Goldschmidt, first name will come to me in a\nminute. And he was also, of course [indecipherable] familiar with German law. Remember, we\nhad to negotiate ultimately, German legal commitments, etcetera. And th-this was -- this was the\nprofessional team, together with Jerry Jacobsen, who was council of the JDC sitting in Paris.\nAnd then of course, the Claims Conference leadership itself, the -- wh-which was supervising the\nnegotiating, laying out the policies, because we couldn\u2019t have 24 organizations being in\npermanent session, whereas Jacob Blaustein, who was -- obviously Nahum Goldmann as the\npresident, Jacob Blaustein as the senior vice president, he was the head of the American Jewish\nCommittee. A -- by today\u2019s standards he would be one of the billionaires. In those days he was a\nmulti-millionaire [indecipherable] Baltimore 011 company. Amoco, American Oil Company, that\nwas the Blaustein family. And then Israel Goldstein, the head of the American Jewish Congress,\nRabbi Israel Goldstein, a leading conservative rabbi with a large congregation on the west side of\nNew York, and a leading member of the Jewish agency executive. I mean, these are people\n[indecipherable]. And Moses Leavitt who was the -- today would probably be the executive vice\npresident of the American Joint Distribution Committee. And as I told you, became the chairman\nof our delegation in The Hague. And Bookstein [indecipherable] and a man called Adolph Held,\na president of the Jewish Labor Committee. In those days, a much more str -- a stronger\norganization than the Jewish Labor Committee is today, they are still an organization covering a\nsegment of Jewish life, but you have to know, particular for our negotiations, during the Nazi\nperiod, the Jewish Labor Committee in this country brought some of the German social\ndemocrats, some of the German trade unionists, even if they were in Sweden and in exile, they\nwould raise money and support them financially. They had a close, ongoing personal relationship\nwith the second largest political party in Germany after the war, the Social Democratic party.\nAnd Adolph Held himself, came from the trade union movement. He was a senior official of the\nInternational Ladies Garment Worker\u2019s Union.",
        "A: Of Mr. Dubinsky\u2019s union, if that means anything to you. And so it was Adolph Held, Jacob\nBlaustein, Israel Goldstein, Nahum Goldmann, Frank Goldmann, who was the president of B\u2019nai\nB\u2019rith, which was very important to us at that time. And then from Britain was Sir Barnett\nJanner, who was the chairman of the board of deputies of British Jews, who is the oldest Jewish\ncommunal organization in Britain, I think going back to -- to the end of the 18\u2122 century or\nsomething, anyway, or maybe -- or maybe the beginning of the 19\" century, anyway, one of the -\n- I think the oldest central organization still exists, still a member organization of the -- of the\nClaims Conference. They all are. Different leadership and so on, but the -- so --",
        "A: Obviously as the -- a good -- a good deal of the -- of the nitty gritty and of the really the day\nto day and night and day type of work, it always had to co -- to come down to a smaller number\nof people who had to devote all their time to 1t. Nehemiah Robinson and -- and then -- and\nmyself and Ben Ferencz and I for -- I shou -- I mean I -- I took it for granted that Ben Ferencz\nwas part of it, although Ben Ferencz would shuttle between fur -- between Nuremberg and -- and\n-- and The Hague, because he -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the WJ -- the JRSO had to continue to --",
        "A: -- to operate at that time. We continued to operate much past \u201952 in -- in -- in Germany.",
        "A: I mean, first of all, I was the executive director of the Claims Conference, which means I was\nthe chief operating officer of the organization per se, because in addition to everything else, it\nhad to be a functional organization. It had to have meetings, and it had committees and it had the\nboard. And the moment we got money we had to haul out our location apparatus. We -- we were\nallocating 10 million dollars a year, which in today\u2019s purchasing power we -- was at least a\nhundred million plus.",
        "A: Somewhere between a hundred and 150 million dollars. So we had to build another\nmachinery for the allocation of funds and so on. And then I continued to be the executive\ndirector of the WJ -- of the JRSO, parallel function and so forth. And a-as I say, it was -- the\nnegotiations themselves were of course a time limited operation. After we signed the agreements,\nthis group dispersed.",
        "A: And -- and we then continued to carry this Claims Conference. We established immediately\nan office in Germany, headed by f-former German lawyer, with -- as we always -- we were\nalways teased our Israeli friends, the first Jewish embassy in postwar Germany was the Claims\nConference office in Bonn, because diplo -- believe it or not, diplomatic relations between Israel\nand the Federal Republic were only established in 1965, 13 years later. The Israel government\nhad a purchasing mission, sitting in Cologne, we tracked it as a [indecipherable] embassy, but it\ndid not have a full status of -- of an embassy. And -- and we then -- our objective then was to see\nthat all these commitments were being implemented and we had an agreement with the Germans\nthat any draft legislation would come to us first for comment before 1t would be -- be presented\nfor a vote to the Bundestag. And for decades there was a compensation committee of the\nBundestag as a standing committee, called in German the [speaks German here] Ausschuss.\nAusschuss being the German word for committee. And then w-we worked periodically, I would\ngo from New York for periodic meetings with them, and -- but our representative would -- would\nbe in daily contact with them.",
        "A: And all of the li -- the laws that followed, and they were not one time pieces of legislation,\nthere was a first compensation law, and there was an amended compensation law, and there was\nsubsequently the regulations, and there was a property restitution law, Germany, on top of the\nmilitary government restitution law for a certain type of assets which were not covered by the\ninitial legislation. And then -- and then -- so --",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: When I said to you that there were seven volumes --",
        "A: -- you can come in my office and see, they are like that. They are volumes covering the law\nand their implementation. And then th -- remember, there was a major judicial machinery. A\nclaim for -- if somebody filed a claim for a compensation for imprisonment in the ghetto and the\nconcentration camp, it went to an administrative local regional agency. In any of the -- of the\n[indecipherable] in any of the states, they had f -- various jurisdiction claims to Israel were\nprocessed here, and claims from the United States there and so on.",
        "A: That was first. If they approved, then the matter was finished. If they rejected, it could go to a\n-- to an appellate party to a court of [indecipherable] citizens. It could go to an appellate court,\nand there was a Supreme Court, there was a high court s -- exclusively on issues of\ncompensation.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Everything until 1980 was the individual filing a direct claim with the German compensation\nagency. We created an organization called the United Restitution Organization --",
        "A: -- which provided legal aid.",
        "A: And at the peak of its activities, it -- 1t had a hundred thousand claim -- it represented a\nhundred thousand claims in 15 countries. Today the URO is a small operation --",
        "A: -- residual operation in Israel, Canada and -- and the United States and Germany.",
        "A: The Claims Conference negotiated the legislation.",
        "A: Monitored the implementation.",
        "A: Financed the legal aid services machinery and -- and continuously fought for expansion\nimprovement, correction and [indecipherable]. Pll give you the example, at one point the\nprocessing of the claims were exceedingly slow, and we brought about something that never\nhappened in Germany before and since. We had the chancellor convene the minister presidents,\nwhich would be the equivalent of the governors of all the states of Germany, it\u2019s like the\npresident of the United States would bring together the 50 governors in a two day session,\nbecause the governors were responsible for the initial administration of the laws. In other words,\nthe operating local agencies, the agencies of first administrative were state agencies. And Nahum\nGoldmann addressed that gathering and laid out all of our complaints and so on, and -- and cr --\nand obtained secured commitments on -- on how to accelerate the process [indecipherable] the\nclaims. That was the claims end of it. On the allocation part of it, the money was given -- we had\nan agreement under which -- from The Hague days -- the Luxembourg days under which we\nreceived money for allocations. We had to furnish annual reports to the German government as\nto what we did with the money, and how it was done and so on. And we had some difficult issues\nwith them as well, particularly issues wi -- about which we could not write very much about,\nbecause we had to use -- we found that we had to use some of these funds to assist Nazi victims\nbehind the Iron Curtain.",
        "A: And that was verbote -- not verboten so much from the German side, but the Soviets were --\nwere violently opposed to it, and so on. And we had to do it in such a way that we couldn\u2019t make\nit public, and we had to get the consent of the German government to do it, etcetera, I mean, we\ncan talk about that one day, but then in some of those were the ways is written up in the book by\n[indecipherable] Zweig, Ronald Zweig on -- on our location.",
        "A: From -- from day one.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely.",
        "A: No, the individual claims -- initially the individual claims based on the legislation that was\napproved, based on the agreements which were approved in Luxembourg, wherein the form of\nindividuals filing claims direct --",
        "A: -- from the German administrative agencies, and subsequently, if need be, carrying into\nGerman courts.",
        "A: It was until -- it was not until 1980 --",
        "A: -- when the hardship fund was created --",
        "A: -- and when we came to the Germans prior to that and said, you have to open the filing\ndeadlines for the benefit of the Holocaust survivors who are coming out of the Soviet Union, and\nwho were barred by -- by these laws from filing claims because the -- the geographic jurisdiction\nof the f -- ger -- of the German compensation laws which came out from our Luxembourg\nagreements, were limited to -- to -- to the western world. It did not penetrate the Iron Curtain.",
        "A: Okay?",
        "A: We did not, as I told you in the car, we did not prevail with that. Nahum Goldmann\u2019s traveled\nfor four years. He and -- and -- and our colleagues in Germany, I mean, we had extraordinary\nrepresentatives in Germany, outstanding people. There was a man called Aroz Kashenstein who\nwas -- who was our representative in Germany for nearly 30 years, I would say. Then there was\nhis predecessor, another German lawyer. His successor, a Czech lawyer and so on. They -- they\nwere our fulltime negotiators on the spot. And th -- it was only at that point when the Germans\nsaid, look, we finished the [indecipherable] we -- our administrator apparatus is finished. We\ndon\u2019t want any more our courts to be loaded, because they had to -- they had the whole judicial\nstructure. From the courts [indecipherable] instance through a Supreme Court. Germany, even\ntoday does that every single Supreme Court on those subjects. There\u2019s a high 1n-institutional\ncourt, there\u2019s a high social security court, there\u2019s a high labor court. They have for each major\narea the equivalent of a Supreme Court. In this country everything goes to one court. And\nKarlsruhe is the seat of all of these parallel high courts. So if you go to Karlsruhe you can go\nfrom -- from one high court to the next high court. And there was for years and years a oberster -\n- he\u2019s a good [indecipherable] a high compensation court.",
        "A: In any event, so only from that point on, we were very reluctant to do it. And I can tell you\nobviously why, because it wasn\u2019t the pi -- part of money which said here you have at your\ndiscretion, you decide the criteria. We had to negotiate under great -- under intensive\nnegotiations the criteria to this day on various programs, and then we are committed to apply\nthese criteria. And the --",
        "A: -- and the German -- and the German -- the German co-controller general equivalent can\ncome at any time and inspect our records.",
        "A: And we kn -- we knew -- I\u2019Il give one si-simple [indecipherable] example. We have a\nprogram under which we pay pensions, under a so-called article two program, which was\nestablished after the unification of Germany. One of the criteria is you had to be six months in\nthe concentration camp. And if you were five month in the concentration camp, you were out.\nAnd for a Jewish organization called Conference of Jewish [indecipherable] Germany to send a\nletter to somebody who was five month in the concentration camp, you -- your application for\ncompensation is rejected, is a minor pleasure.\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct. Particularly in the area of -- of personal suffering and personal injuries. How\ncan one put a dollar number on psychological, emotional, and on -- and also physical\nconsequences? We always say, and I\u2019m not alone in that, that what -- what we succeeded to\nsome extent is to provide a measure of compensation, some degree, combined with what I said to\nyou before, which is not tangible, but wh-what -- but to me extremely important, and that is the\nbasic acknowledgment on the part of either the government or the entity or the agency that\nprovides compensation, that it had responsibility, legal, moral, but responsibility. And on the\nother hand, among the hundreds of thousands of survivors, not everybody was able to make the\nkind of economic to build a new existence for oneself, economically, professional, business-wise\nor otherwise that -- that the compensation that they obtained for that -- for many it has genuine\neconomic significance. For people for whom -- who as I said to you before, whether it 1s in the\ndepth of Brooklyn or -- or in the -- or in the resettlement towns of Israel, or -- or in eastern\nEurope, or wherever it is, when the compensation coming as a result of our negotiations and so\non, may equal and exceed old age assistance or Social Security, or whatever it is, and it makes a\ndifference between marginal existence in a late stage of people\u2019s lives, and a sense of -- of some\nacceptable minimum with a -- with a minimum of -- of -- of dignity and of -- and of self respect\nin a sense that an individual can have, that is of great importance. And -- and particularly in this\nstage where the vast majority of the survivors are 80 and over, remember anybody who was born\nin, let\u2019s say who was 10 years old when World War II broke out in Poland, okay? Born in 1929.\nThat individual today 1s 78, okay? This is a child survivor. There are organizations of child\nsurvivors. Kindertransport people, okay? This is the young end of the -- of this population. And\nparticularly in the western world, with progress of -- of medical care and so on, people live\nlonger. I say people exist longer, you know, to me there 1s a great distinction between those two\nwords. But people are there longer, in mo -- requiring much more care and attention for their\nmedical needs and so on, with a greater strain and s -- on -- on their financial resources. So in a --\nin a strange way, some of the compensation benefits today for the people who ended up retiring\non a -- on a very modest basis and in some parts of the world on a below modest basis, or in a\nnon-existent basis, th-this compensation 1s -- is truly meaningful, and is of great importance. We\nnegotiate periodically cost of living adjustments on the pensions. One of -- I think one of the\nbrilliant things that we did in the -- in The Hague, is we wrote in a clause that the pensions, that\nthe compensation pensions will be adjusted on a cost of living basis as the pensions of civil\nservants of Germany, because we knew that the civil servants of Germany have a powerful\norganization and they will fight for cost of living adjustments. And we got the Germans to agree\nthat the compensation -- we knew it is the compensation pensions will be adjusted cost of living-\nwise in the same percentage as those. So I say that to illustrate that the -- the economic impact\nfor certain categories of survivors was and is important. And as I say in some -- in some strange\nway, becoming more important now for those who were to retire in a -- on a -- on a very limited\nbasis.",
        "A: When the [indecipherable] we have to be more precise.",
        "A: Every agreement is a compromise.",
        "A: Even when the United States won the war on an unconditional surrender, it couldn\u2019t force\nupon Germany all that it may have set out to force upon Germany, and then think of -- any\nagreement is a compromise.",
        "A: And a compromise means that after X efforts to negotiate, if you agree on a settlement, that is\nwhat you have agreed.",
        "A: And you have to have the -- the -- the moral courage and the -- and the honesty to say in the\nbest judgment of this body, like -- like a congress, like a legislature or whatever it is. In the best\njudgment of this body, this agreement had to be accepted in the form in which it was finally\nnegotiated out.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Wh -- what do you mean by discouraged?",
        "A: To say gave up? [ll give you a classic example. In 1974, the two Germanys, East and West\nwere admitted to the United Nations. Following that the United States established diplomatic\nrelations with East Germany. We assisted and we had the support of the U.S. government, at that\ntime the assistant secretary for European affairs was Mr. Hartman, telling the East Germans that\nthe United States will not enter into diplomatic relations unless the East Germans will agree to\nnegotiate with the Claims Conference concerning issues of compensation, something like that.\nThe Communist East Germans resisted it v-violently. They are a state and they are not\nnegotiating with some non -- non-governmental agency, or something like that. Finally, th-they -\n- they knew that they couldn\u2019t get around it, so they created an anti-Fascist committee to be our\nnon-governmental partner. And from 1974 to 1989, we negotiated with the bloody German --\nEast Germans, and w -- and we were getting nowhere. We were periodically going there every\nyear at the time of the general assembly of the United Nations. The foreign minister of East\nGermany would come here, and on Park Avenue [indecipherable] we would meet. Ben Ferencz\nand Israels -- and Israel Miller and Saul Kagan and whatever, and in 1987 I think I told you we\nhad -- they officially invited us as their guests for negotiations with them in Germany, and they\nwanted that we should deliver to them most favored nations status in the United States so they --\nand then maybe they would consider doing it. At one point Benny went for a meeting with the\nanti-Fascist committee and totally unexpectedly was handed a one million dollar check to -- to\nthe Claims Conference that we should, with a million dollars, help needy Nazi victims in -- in the\nUnited States. Within 48 hours the check was sent back to the German -- to the German\nCommunists, and believe me, through this whole period, people in our board were telling Israel\nMiller and Ben Ferencz and Saul Kagan and a few other people, stop banging your head against\nthis wall, nothing will happen. We never let up. We didn\u2019t accomplish anything, but we never let\nup. We -- there were poi -- there were moments where the -- where they were making offers to us\nwhich we -- of the cali -- cal -- caliber which -- which were unacceptable, but you can get really\ndiscouraged, you know? You go back on the back -- even with the west Germans, as I told you,\nbetween 1975, when d\u00e9tente came in, again you see, you got to relate that to [indecipherable]\ndevelopment. D\u00e9tente, Helsinki, negotiations between -- between President Ford and the\nHelsinki agreements, and the great pressure with the Jackson-Vanik pressure to let Jews out of --\nemigrate from the Soviet Union. Among them, I don\u2019t have to tell you, hundred -- tens of\nthousands of -- of vict -- of Holocaust survivors of -- of -- of the most horrible persecution. Th-\nThe survivors of the [indecipherable] group, and I mean I -- with you I can talk it\n[indecipherable] than that. We came back to the Germans and said, you have to open the filing\nperiod of the compensation laws. These are not people who were lazy. It was forced\n[indecipherable] they were barred by your laws and by your provisions from f-filing claims. We\ncould not get the opposition, we could not get the government to agree. We dismantled the\nmachinery, we cannot do any more. We couldn\u2019t get Willie Brandt, who certainly was a -- Willie\nBrandt who went to Warsaw on his knees, you know, a -- ap -- apologizing on behalf of\nGermany for what has been done to -- to the -- in the Warsaw ghetto to the Jews of Poland.\nCouldn\u2019t budge him, couldn\u2019t budge the -- the chr -- the Christian democrat opposition. Couldn\u2019t\nbud -- budge his successor who was Helmut Schmidt, another Social Democrat. Finally, after\nfive years practically -- and believe me, people are now, and -- and I don\u2019t -- I -- I\u2019m not being\ncritical of anybody -- you know, if you come to meetings a few times a year and whatever it is,\nand you -- and you hear the same -- the same sad song about we met with this one, we met with\nthat one, we met with this parliamentarian, and that politician. We were here and we were there,\nand we had the press conference, and we did this and that. And what have you got to show? And\nwhen finally, finally they came up with this hardship fund one time payment and you, Claims\nConference, administer it. And Nahum Goldmann turned to me and said, \u201cNow you gotta set up\nan organization.\u201d Which as I said to you before, you -- an organization which would have to tell\nsome people no. Without judicial recourse, by the way.",
        "A: So -- but if you believe that -- that there 1s something that -- that you cannot leave -- that you\ncannot put aside, then you do as long as -- as your institutional strength is there, as your physical\nstrength is there, as your emotional strength is there. Not easy. Not easy at all.",
        "A: Ah.",
        "A: This is not a job you -- this is something that -- that -- that you do because -- because within\nyou, you have no alternative. For yourself. You don\u2019t get rich in these jobs, I can assure you.\nAnd -- but ultimately, you -- you know, took very personally. Ultimately each of us has to live\nwith his own self.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: Ic -- Ic -- I will tell you this much; I could not divorce myself voluntarily from it. I could\nvisualize myself being in a lay capacity.",
        "A: I could visualize, I don\u2019t know, the organization decided to retire me, I mean, you know, the\nold gray mare it ain\u2019t what she used to be, you know, so -- but they haven\u2019t yet reached this wise\ndecision, so -- but -- but [indecipherable]",
        "A: Of course mistakes. I mean, th-the -- the answer to the question of whether it would have been\npossible to achieve more --",
        "A: -- I would -- I have to be the last person, or those of us who were -- I mean if Nehemiah\nRobinson would be today alive, if -- if all of my colleagues or -- or -- or [indecipherable] and --\nand -- and -- and my -- in -- 1n our new -- in our current professional leadership, I cannot answer\nthat. We think that we tried to do our utmost.",
        "A: Is our utmost good enough? Could somebody accomplish more? I would be the last person to\nsay no.",
        "A: It would be presumptuous, it would be arrogant. And you know, there are elements beyond --\nbeyond real -- real objective determination. There are moments where we -- when we broke off\nnegotiations. And we had to decide, are we going to go back to it or not. And -- and it -- and it\nwas always -- and it had to be a compromise. The reality in life, whether it\u2019s Jewish\norganizational life, whether it is American public life, whether it is -- is anything else, ultimately\nit\u2019s a compromise. There are people who consider this a dirty word. I\u2019ve never considered this a\ndirty word. I consider this a fact of life and the issue is always a determination which is very\noften a subjective determination as to what is an acceptable compromise. That\u2019s where the issue\nlies.",
        "A: Now, these kind of speeches, or these kind of statements will not get you elected to the -- as\nthe chief dogcatcher over there, because u-unfortunately political life, and I\u2019m sorry to say at\nleast maybe -- maybe it\u2019s a sign of we\u2019re ge -- of we\u2019re getting old, but by the standards of\npolitical discourse, from -- from the days, let\u2019s say in th -- in American standards of the New\nDeal to today is by and large a record of ever lower -- of ever lower -- lower sinking levels and\nstandards of political discourse.",
        "A: And that is heartbreaking to me. If you stand up and make a sober, intelligent statement, this\nis political poison. Correct?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Look, [Il tell you this much, what you -- what you can do. First of all, I want to know\nwhether I -- I -- I know a -- a transcript comes alo -- comes late, but I hope that a -- a copy of the\n[indecipherable] tape can be available eventually, or the --",
        "A: The other thing that I have to think about and you have to give me a little bit of time that --\nnot very much, is what is for general public consumption, what I\u2019m not sure that [indecipherable]\nI told you that\u2019s a very -- you can tell me it\u2019s a personal hang-up.",
        "A: No, I t -- because there are people -- there are people who -- you know, whose personal life is\nsomething that -- that they have no problem sharing with the world, or displaying to the world, or\neven -- or even enjoying doing that.",
        "A: I -- maybe unfortunately even for me, belong to the people who mourn in private, literally.",
        "A: A-After midnight.",
        "A: I say, after midnight. You know, we all have characteristics, good or bad.",
        "A: And what I -- what I say to you is also seriously, because I think of you as I think of it right\nnow, is you\u2019ll try to put things together, there will be some kind of holes or gaps, or simply\nthings that have to be connected. Just pick up the phone, send me an email, or whatever it is, I\nwill --",
        "A: By all means, by all means. I said it to somebody here before that -- I said -- doesn\u2019t apply\nhere at all, but I am, particularly in the last 10 years, I am very often approached by young\nhistorians, by -- by people writing Ph.D.\u2019s and so on, from this country, from Israel, from\nGermany, by the way. You would be amazed how many young German historians are seriously\nstudying the Holocaust. Seriously.",
        "A: With a great inner commitment. We have an office in Germany now that -- that has been in\noperation since 1952, that\u2019s 55 years. The vast majority of our staff was German, German\nGerman.",
        "A: Not German Jews, German German. We had -- we have some Jews, obviously, and we had\npeople and have people who are deeply committed to what we are trying to do.",
        "A: Inner commitment.",
        "A: In some -- in some cases and in some ways more intensely than a Jew would do. And I don\u2019t\nsay it critically of the Jew. For -- for the Jew it is -- for -- for -- let\u2019s say for a Jew particularly\nsomehow related to or exposed to Holocaust survivors or something like that, it\u2019s almost sort of\nmatter of course, if you will, or ho-how else. But young Germans who feel very deeply the\nresponsibility. I mean, one of -- one of our best lawyers, he really battling our battle, he is a\nyoungish -- or -- or at least by my standards, he is around 50, c-close to it, young German lawyer\nwith -- not only with that he is a brilliant lawyer as a lawyer, but -- but with a real inner\ncommitment to this thing. So it -- to -- to go back, and what I was -- wanted to tell you s-simply\nis that any Ph.D. student who calls me or sends me an email or wants to see me, I ac --\nsometimes go to Germany and I meet somebody seven o\u2019clock in the morning because that\u2019s the\none hour I can spend with them.",
        "A: And so to me this aspect of it 1s of in -- tremendous importance.",
        "A: Because not only that -- that the -- the hi -- the history of the period, the teaching of this\nperiod, the -- th-the -- what I call the broad lessons of it, human lessons, not only in Jewish life,\nbut in the -- in the -- in the world at large, are crucial to go past the lifetime of the -- of the\nSUIVIVOTS.",
        "A: And -- and the only place to look to that are the teachers, are the academics, are the -- are the\ngovernments, for instance there is now, as you know, the international task force on Holocaust\neducation, I think it\u2019s a fantastic, tremendous development.",
        "A: To introduce that subject matter into the -- into the public school systems of the world, and of\nEurope 1n particular, is -- is -- is a tremendous goal and objective.",
