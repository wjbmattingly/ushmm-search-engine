We\nhad to learn every single day Polish poetry and French\npoetry and German poetry and Hebrew poetry. While in\nschool I was very fortunate because I had a beautiful\nbicycle, playing lots of football, and while I gradu-\nated high school, my father was able to send me to\nFrance to a city by the name Strasbourg where I took up\nengineering. And, uh, maybe I was very very lucky\nbecause some of my friends in life, from my class, were",
        "not able to get better education. The community, while\nbeing young was very active, especially young boys and\nyoung girls because we just didn t feel comfortable to\nlive in Poland due to the fact that the Polish popula-\ntion was not friendly to us and we knew that we need a\nnew homeland. Therefore, there were no persecutions to\ntalk about in Poland, however we thought that the anti-\nSemitism was basically coming from the church and also\neconomical. Uh, altogether, the Jewish, the general\npopulation of Poland did amount to 30 million and 10%\nwas Jewish, in other words 3 million Jewish people. The\nmain concentrations was Warsaw and Lodz. I also was a\nBoy Scout and myself didn t feel too much hatred from\nthe Polish Christian people, because, like I said a few\nminutes ago, I attended the Hebrew day school and we\nwere only Jewish children. Uh, and uh, talking about\nthe economical structure, as much as I know, uh, 10% of\nthe Jewish population, if you can say, did belong to\nthe upper class, very assimilated. 40% were, I would\nsay, well to do, but let s say middle class. The other\n50% of the Jewish population was very very poor. And\nVideo Tape No. Camera Roll No. Sound Roll No.\nKOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 3\nInterviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W.

And they were (?) busy, especially helping\nthe poor people. Well, my name was Henry Katzenellen-\npollen, which was changed when I came to America in\n1946 to Kellen because when I got my first papers, the\njudge in El Paso Texas said that he cannot pronounce my\nname and he did advise me to make it a little bit\nshorter, so consequently from Katzenellpollen my name\nis Kellen, K-E-L-L-E-N.\nSB: Tell me about the eve of World War Two, what things\nwere like and what you remember.\nHK: I graduated college in 1938 in France. My parents,\nSince they were born in Lithuania, while I was in\nFrance, they moved back home and we were living ina\ntown by the name of Memel where my father was always an\nexpert in textile, in textile fabrication. And we were\nrunning at the time a textile factory in Memel. While\nHitler in all his speeches kept always repeating that,",
        "All I want is peace, by what he meant by peace was a\npiece of Czechoslovakia, a piece of Austria, a piece of\nLithuania, and eventually, he ended up with Poland\ndemanding, you know, a piece of Danzig, which did\nbelong to Germany before 1914.

Uh, Lithuania was independent for\nawhile, and the war broke out on September the First of\n1939 when Nazi Germany invaded Poland. Uh, I want to\nemphasize that while Poland had a powerful army, they\ndid surrender in 19, 20 days. And this was naturally\nthe beginning of the Holocaust because the German army\nwhile occupied Poland started without having a program\nwhat to do with the Jewish population, the Holocaust\nstarted in 1939 and kept on going through 1940 before\nconcentration camps were established. Uh.\nSB: What did you hear when the war started?\nHK: Well, unfortunately, my sister, her husband, and\ntheir son Jerry were in Poland and we were cut off for\na long time without getting any news from them. But\nSince my sister was a Lithuanian citizen, I did manage\nto bring her from Poland, her and her son Jerry to\nLithuania. Unfortunately, her husband was staying\nbehind because he never got Lithuanian citizenship. Uh,\nshe came, she came to Kaunus, her husband, like I said\nwas left behind, and while he looked very much like a\nChristian having blond hair and blue eyes and very\nwhite complexion, somehow he was on the train going\nfrom Lodz to Warsaw, uh, I don t know, no difference\nhow he was caught, and he was arrested and he ended up\nin Warsaw in the well known prison Paviachin (SP?) and\nhe was shot over there.

In the\nmeantime, in the Spring of 1940, the German army man-\naged to occupy Belgium and Holland and France. And\nStalin who was in charge of the Soviet Union, in order\nto prevent the Germans to occupy the Baltic countries,\nthey marched in on June the 15th of 1941, excuse me\n1940. They occupied the Baltic countries so Kovno,\nLithuania, and Latvia, Estonia became part of the\nSoviet Union. Naturally to live under the Communist\nregime is far away from being pleasant, however, we\nthought maybe we are better off under the Communists\nthan the Nazis because there was not such a thing as a\nmass killing.

And in the beginning we were not\nsuspicious of something was going on.

        "spoke in German and he said, While I m here on the\nradio, we are marching into Russia and in the name of\nGod, we will be successful, we are going to destroy the\nsystem and the Jews, and then we knew that we are at\nwar. We were living at that time on the outskirts of\nthe city, uh, mostly Christian population, we didn t\nknow exactly what was going on because by the time we\ngot news from our local radio it was almost noon, and\nthe rumors were that the Red army was already in East\nPrussia, what means in the German territories. However,\nI understood that the members of the Communist party\nwere already packing and they were running to the\nrailroad station. Monday, there were all kinds of\nrumors, but Tuesday afternoon, we saw, I Saw on the\noutskirts the German motorcycles coming.

However, I do recall that a soldier\nwhich came with them was standing right by, and he had\na buckle like all the soldiers do have, you know, a\nbelt with a buckle. And on the buckle it said, Gott\nmitt uns which means in English, God with us. And I\nfigured out, knowing exactly what was going on in\nGermany because while going to school in France\n(coughs) I was always in Berlin at least one day while\nwaiting for changing trains. And I figured out that if\nthe slogan is God with us, God is with us, nothing\nwill happen, and, to us. Unfortunately, the slaughter\nof the Jewish population did not start immediately,\nhowever the terror came from the Lithuanian population,\nand Im sorry to tell you that while being in the\nLithuanian army, I never felt any hatred to the Jewish\nsoldiers who were in my company. Um, I even played\nchess with my Lieutenant Mikalowskos and why the Lith-\nuanian populations, and I would say population because\nnaturally you can t accuse the whole population. But\nwhy such a big percentage of Lithuanians started,\nespecially in small towns and villages, the bloodshed\nagainst the Jews can not be understood, you know, by\nanybody because the Jewish, the Jews were living in\nLithuania for 11 centuries, and they were just part of",

And by August 15th of 1941, we\nwere locked up in the suburb of the city, Vialompula\nor Slobodka, and we were behind the fence which was\nseven feet high, not a big problem how to escape be-\ncause this was not a wall like the Warsaw ghetto. This\nwas on a Friday and next day there was already posters\nall over the ghetto saying in German and Lithuanian\nthat the German authorities are demanding 500 men,\ngraduated, college graduated and professional people to\nbe at a certain place to be sent to the city hall to do\nsome paperwork with the guarantee that they would come\nback that very same night. We were supposed to be there\nMonday morning, my brother was college graduate, gradu-\nated, and so was me. And I do recall June the 18th of\n1941, Monday morning, my mother, may she rest in peace,\ntold both of us to go because there s nothing to it and\nthey guaranteed that we would be back. I cannot explain\nwhy I didn t go, eh, my brother went. This was the\nfirst what we call the Intelligentsia Action, or Opera-\ntion Intellectuals. My brother never came back and\nwhile we were waiting for him at the gate from 6\no clock in the evening and the rest of the night, the\nrumors came that they would stay there overnight, they\nwould maybe come tomorrow, and then since they were not\ncoming tomorrow, uh, maybe they were sent out somewhere\nelse. After the war was over, I found out that just a\nfew hours later they were taken to a Fortification 7\nand they were all shot over there.

And then the next days, or maybe\na week later, as you probably know, that in the ghetto,\nthere was a big advantage to being in the ghetto than\nthe concentration camps because first of all the fami-\nlies were together and we didn t have any Germans there\nat night and the way the ghetto was established we had\nwhat we called the Judenraute (SP?) which was, the head\nin our camp, you know, was Dr. Elkes a well know eye\ndoctor. And there were just like a city hall because\nthey had different departments. The most important\ndepartment was the Labor Department which would sup-\nplied so many people every morning to go for different\nassignments. Then the Police Department, the Sanitation\nDepartment, and you mention, and after the Operation\nIntellectuals, 3 or 4 Germans came to the ghetto and\nwe were ordered to deliver everything or value. Our\nrings, Silver spoons, silver forks, whatever it was,\nradios, Filetilistic (?) stamps, and instruments. I do\nemphasize instruments because I will tell you later on\nwhat happened with the instruments. Ah, then the next\nepisode I do recall was sending daily the 5,000 men and\nwomen to build the runways for the German airforce and\nthere s nothing wrong building a highway or a runway,\nbut it is absolutely beyond your comprehension what\nmeans to be constantly hunger without having proper\nclothes and being beaten up and cursed by the guards.\nWe go back to a very important event which took place\non October the 28th, 1941.\nVideo Tape No. Camera Roll No. Sound Roll No.\nKOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 10\nInterviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W.

And my father, who didn t expect atrocities,",
        "he went to town because his sister called him up that\nshe didn t have any sugar and he never came back.

My\nfather was, there s always a miracle because in many\nmany cases one or two people somehow having some good\nconnections were able to get out and so they told us\nthe story. And also, all the events which did happen\nall over, not just in Lithuania or Latvia, Estonia,\nuh, photos were taken by German photographers, and they\nare here.

Uh, while we were building the airforce, the\nrunways for the German airforce day and night, 5,000\npeople on one shift, 5,000 people on the night shift,\nwe got back to the camp on October the 27th and then\nthere were already loudspeakers and also posters all\nover the camp that Helmut Rauke, who was at that time\nin charge of the camp, was demanding the entire popula-\ntion of the camp to be at a certain place in order to\nbe counted. The excuse was that he does not trust the\nJudenraute, ah, giving him the amount of inmates in\norder to know how much bread to give us, we must be\ncounted. And regardless of age, children, old people,\nsick or well, they must be there. Anybody who would be\non the premises would be shot. The doors must be open.\nAnd we were no na<ve that we did believe what we were\ntold.

We were lined up with\nour families, I was standing with my mother, sister,\nand Jerry and my girlfriend. And, uh, we didn t know\nexactly at the beginning what was going on, but while\nwe were getting closer and closer t Rauke, we saw\npeople being divided. Some went left and some went\nright. While I was in line a friend of mine who was a\nJewish policeman said, and I want you to know that in\nour police force which consisted out of 200 people,\nthey were very very fine, intelligent men, not like in\nsome other ghettos, and he says to me, Look, I don t\nknow, I don t know, but he says to me, he doesn t know\nexactly what is happening, but, try to pull always\nback, don t try to go ahead. Pull back. And this is\nexactly what I did, and more or less by 4 0 clock in\nthe afternoon ah, all the people who went to the left\nwere taken away. I never faced Rauke because, like I\nsaid, ah, eh, by now we do know that all the orders\nwere coming from Berlin from the headquarters and on\nthe 20th of October, 10,500 were sent to the left and\nnext morning, the 29th, I was staying very close to the\nfence and I saw, unfortunately, groups of hundreds of\npeople going up the hill, which was in the direction of\nthe IXth Fort, and all day long we just heard machine\nguns noise and again, one boy, one boy, ten years old,\nhe was already in the ditch, it seems to be he was not\nshot, and at night time he came back to the ghetto and\nhe told us more details how the executions took place.\nSo, for future generation, it would be interesting that\nwhile you saw only hundred people at a time going up in\nVideo Tape No. Camera Roll No. Sound Roll No.\nKOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 13\nInterviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W.

They were going there, but while a hundred\nwere shot, another 100 were taken. And uh, next day we\nwent back to the airport and I do remember that my\nparticular guard, a German Alpha soldier who was from\nSudentanland, which was a Czech, asked us how come we\ndidn t come to work yesterday and when we told him and\nhe said, Well, I m very sorry but I really don t\nbelieve it. But I think that it was, we made a mistake.\nSomething did happen, by mistake they took away, but I\ndon t believe that, you know, civilized people like we\nare doing the killing. So just imagine, he by himself\ndidn t believe what was happening. Then there s no way\nto tell you what happened in 1942 and 43, all we knew,\nSince we were completely isolated in the camp, without\ngetting any news, because there was no such a thing\nlike mail or telephone or newspapers, but in order to\nfind out more or less what was going on, when we saw\nthe guards were smiling, we knew things were very good\nfor them. But then, at the end of 42, when the German\ngot as far as Stalingrad and the Volga, as you probably\nknow, this was the beginning of the defeat of the\nGerman army, at the same time the American and British\nairforce started to bomb German cities and I presume\nthat the German guards were getting news that maybe\ntheir families, maybe their homes were getting de-\nstroyed, you saw the faces change a little bit.

Hunger and cold became, you\nknow, so severe that while working at the airport, we\ndidn t have any chance to get food with exception at\nmidnight we re getting a little bit warm soup, which if\nsomebody would have this soup in America, you would\nthink this is not even good for a hungry dog or cat.\nOnce in awhile maybe a rotten carrot or potato. Ah, now\nonce the airport assignment came to an end, a smaller\ngroup was sent to different places, and there was the\npossibility whatever we still had left, and it didn t\nreally, ah, didn t mean anything what it was. A pair of\nsocks, underwear, a belt, or a suit, Lithuanians were\ncoming to the places where we were working and giving,\nah, exchanging in other words for a little food. And\nthe food which we were getting was not easy to smuggle\ninto the ghetto because they were always, the guards\nwere searching us and we were very lucky when the\nguards were lenient, and we could bring something.

The whole city of Kaunus, which was only 40 miles\nfrom the German borders with lots of fortifications.\nThis is the meaning of a European fort, not American.\nSB: Can you tell me about your father again.

Tell me about that\nand tell me about your father again.\nHK: The telephone system in Europe was just the same\nlike in America. His sister was living in the city, and\nwe were living in the suburb, divided by a river. And\nuh, when the Germans came, my mother, like any other\nhousewife, has always some food in the kitchen. Uh, not\nfresh vegetables, which you couldn t preserve, and not\nbutter because anything of perishable goods at that\ntime was spoiling because we didn t have any such thing\n50-60 years ago like Frigidaires or iceboxes. But, like\nI said, we had a call from his sister asking him if he\ncan bring some sugar, which my mother presumably had\nsome. And he just took the sugar and was crossing the\nbridge and he was stopped by two Lithuanian uniformed\nsoldiers who were collaborating with the Germans, and\nthey arrested him, and this was it and I never saw him\nagain. And then I found out he was in the group of the\nthree thousand Jewish people who were massacred on the\n7th Fort, because they were taking advantage of all the\nforts. But they were suffering for three days, and two\npeople who were let out, having some connections, they\ntold us how it happened. Photos are available of this\ntoo. Like I said, my brother, to my knowledge was shot\nright away, I was shot in the camp right here (??).\nPeople ask me quite often if I have a number.

There were two Lithuanian guards who brought\nus over there and while were there they told us to\nunload everything and have the pipes taken off of the\nopen railroad cars and throw them on the ground. Some-\nhow, because I always did my best to keep myself clean,\nuh, shaved, and by the way, believe it or not, the one\nrazorblade I used for three years and somehow I managed\nto have it. Today a razorblade is good for maybe 3-4\nShaves.

But being on\nthe bottom, only a crane could take them out. And when\nthey came back at noon, and they saw that the train is\nnot unloaded, he got to me and started to curse me and\nsays, Well, uh, why didn t you do what I told you?\nand I said it was impossible. He did hit me with the\nrifle in the back of my head, this must be made out\nsteel because I don t know how he didn t kill me.

I\nSurvived without medication, without food, and if this\nwasn t bad enough, while constantly the number of\ninmates were getting smaller, they were always cutting\nthe fences smaller, so consequently we wouldn t have a\nlittle bit more room for ourselves. And while I was not\ngoing to work because I couldn t even walk, the order\ncame out that we had to get out of this particular\nhouse, because in the meantime maybe thousands, maybe\n1,500 were deported. And I do remember that my wife,\nJulia, may she rest in peace, uh, looked for another\nQuarters and, eh, somehow we found another place to\nstay and I survived.
