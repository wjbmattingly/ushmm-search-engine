Where the others went, I really don\u2019t know. But for about three months, I\ndidn\u2019t know where they were. My father found a place in Holland where he could\ngo to and he even opened a practice in Holland but it was undercover because he\ndid not have the doctor\u2019s license in Holland. So it was undercover in Holland.",
        "Q: Your father said no more, we\u2019re going to leave Heidelberg and everyone split up?",
        "A: Well, yes. I don\u2019t know where my sisters went.",
        "Q: But they told you, you\u2019re going to Switzerland?",

That\u2019s right, it was May and I had to prepare for the bar mitzvah in\ntwo and a half months. It was very difficult. I really didn\u2019t know much about the\nJews at all but I\u2019m circumsised and I didn\u2019t know any further. The people, the\nrabbi in Holland who taught me, I don\u2019t really remember him at all. He prepared\nme for the bar mitzvah. I was bar mitzvahed in August 1933.",
        "Q: Where in Holland were you?",
        "A: We were in The Hague. We were in The Hague, t-h-e h-a-g-u-e. The Hague in\nHolland. I even remember my address it\u2019s , 37. I remember that.\nWe lived there and more or less okay at that time. You don\u2019t really know when\nyou\u2019re so young like I was 12 years old and my brother who was then seven years\nold, six years old, he was very small. He didn\u2019t know either. I remember that I\nwas in this house, in the highest room there was in the house, I was there. That\nwas my room, the very highest.",
        "Q: So you had a house, just your family had a house?\n3",

        "Q: Was this a Jew, do you know?",
        "A: The boarder was not, no. He was very strongly not Jewish at all. Andrew von\nAmeron. I heard of him later. He was not a Jew at all but anyway, I was bar\nmitzvahed. A little bit later I went to Hachshara which prepared people for Israel\nwith a different instruction such as for instance, I did cabinet making. I was for\nHachshara, I was there four years.",
        "Q: Where was that?",
        "A: In The Hague, that was in -- well it was out in the . Not very far\nfrom Texel, T-e-x-e-l. Again the name is the Texel, t-h-e.",
        "Q: So you were intending to go to Israel or to Palestine?",
        "A: At that time, yes, at that time. But then after a while my father became a\nFrenchman. His grandfather was a Frenchman in 1820 or 30. Also his name was\nAdolph and I remember that he is the one who gave us the French nationality\nbecause he was an Alsatian and my father was able to get his French nationality\nand we too got the French nationality. We moved to France.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: We moved to France a little bit between 1933 and 36. About 1936 and I came in\n\u00b037. Father was already in France and he was very well established.",
        "Q: Where were you in France?",
        "A: In Paris. After Father came to France, his practice was very, very well known and\nwell received by the people.",
        "Q: There he was a legitimate physician?",
        "A: A legitimate physician, yes. There were lots of people there even though he\ndidn\u2019t speak too well French. He did very well, he did very well after that. I\nspoke very well French, afterwards. It took me a while to get the French accent.",
        "Q: I guess you had been speaking Dutch?",
        "A: Dutch. I was so good in Dutch that a Dutch person said I didn\u2019t know you were\nfrom Germany. Apparently I didn\u2019t and I also remember what car this man was\ndriving. Was a LaSalle at the time, was 1937.\n4",
        "Q: That\u2019s when you were leaving to go to France?",
        "A: That\u2019s when later on I left France. I saw the International Exposition in France\nwhich was starting in 1936 to 1937. I was much more impressed by the Germans\nat that time, cast a one-meter block of steel. That is a difficult thing to do. A one-\nmeter square, cube, a one-meter cube, block of steel. Now that\u2019s a difficult thing\nto do. They did this and I saw this. They had everything, the Germans had\neverything at that time. Well, when I came to France, I just didn\u2019t have very\nmuch to offer the people. I worked in a couple of shops. One was the piano\nfactory, Pleyel, and I worked in several places.",
        "Q: Here you were tapping your skills as a cabinetmaker?",
        "A: Yes. I worked as a cabinetmaker in Pleyel and I made radio enclosures which at\nthe time were made of wood and very fancy.",
        "Q: This was at another factory?",
        "A: No, no it was the same factory Pleyel, yes. We also made the composites of\nupper deck of the pianos and all those things. I did those at Pleyel. After a while\nI got sick and tired of that, I enlisted in the French army. That was 1939 and I\nenlisted September and got called up in October, 1939.",
        "Q: Did you enlist because of the war? The war had begun already in Poland?",
        "A: Oh, yes. The war had begun in France too in September 1. I enlisted in the\nFrench army in October or November. Anyway I got assigned to the artillery in\nOrleans and I remember my father came to Orleans and I had to ---. He took me\nout and gave me all of the things that they would like, the grown-up persons and I\ndidn\u2019t like at all. Like how do you call these mussels that you eat?",
        "Q: Escargot?",
        "A: No, the mussels, escargot are snails. I hate them.",
        "Q: Oysters?",
        "A: Oysters, oysters! He gave me oysters and champagne.",
        "Q: Your father brought this for you?",
        "A: My father invited me to eat oysters and champagne in Orleans and I couldn\u2019t eat\nthat. I could not eat that.",
        "Q: Just didn\u2019t like it?\n5",
        "A: I never did try it before and this was the first time and I just couldn\u2019t eat it at that\ntime. I was a lot thinner at that time too.",
        "Q: Was your basic training in Orleans?",
        "A: The basic training was, no the basic training was -- we were shipped from Orleans\nto some other place. We went into the Maginot Line, and were trained there.\nAfter I enlisted in Orleans and I guess we were educated in military manners in\nOrleans, then we were shipped to the Maginot Line. Then I drove a car that was\nabsolutely 1919, unbelievable with its handles, unbelievable. It was 1917 I think,\nit was unbelievable. I said I drove a car to the instructor, I said I drove a car. But\nthat car I could not drive.",
        "Q: He was looking for somebody to drive?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. I tried and I tried and I could not so I was shipped to the\nMaginot Line anyway.",
        "Q: If you could have driven the car, you would have stayed in Orleans for some\ntime?",
        "A: No, no. I would have been in the Maginot Line to drive that thing. That was\nwhen I did that. Later on, it was a much better car, I had a transporter that get\nmunitions to the line. That I could drive, that I could drive.",
        "Q: I guess it was a newer model?",
        "A: Was a newer model, correct. They also taught us 175 gun. Yes, 75 mm gun, yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember the feeling at that time? Did those with you in the army feel\nthat there is going to be a war with Germany? That is a physical war with\nGermany?",
        "A: There was a physical war with Germany. You\u2019re mistaken. There was a physical\nwar declared by France in 1939.",
        "Q: But the invasion wasn\u2019t until \u201940.",
        "A: The invasion wasn\u2019t until 19490, that\u2019s correct. I think it was May \u00b040, May 10\".",
        "Q: Did you all feel that you would be actually seeing battle?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t see any battle until May, 1940. At that time, the Germans attacked\nus from Germany and at that time, I --.... Was a funny thing, there were no more\nofficers. I was not promoted at all. I was not promoted at all and I was in charge\nat the end of four guns.\n6",
        "Q: Of these 175 mm guns?",
        "A: Seventy-five mm guns. I was in charge of four of those. I don\u2019t know how but I\nshot until there was no more munitions and that was the end of it. There were no\nmore officers, there were no people around to instruct us this, to instruct us that.\nOnce we got rid of our guns after a while, the Germans were very close at that\ntime. I mean with a 75 mm you shot up to about those hills over there. That\u2019s\nhow we did it. We shot at them, I learned how to do that. Then we were out of\nmunitions, no more officers, nobody else.",
        "Q: So we\u2019re in May 1940?",
        "A: That was towards the end of May, yes.",
        "Q: The officers left or were captured?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. The officers apparently left. As my brother gave me an account of\nthat time, is that the officers had cars and they left in cars. We didn\u2019t know what\nto do. We were left alone. A few days before the Germans arrived really. I got\nout and put my identification which I had -- which was at that time, I was then\ncalled Kurt Braunschweig. That was the German name, Kurt Braunschweig.",
        "Q: That was the name you were born with?",
        "A: That\u2019s the born name I was born under, Kurt Braunschweig. When I saw that the\nGermans are going to come, I better get rid of my military identification and\nchanged the name to Brunswic. There comes the name Brunswic.",
        "Q: You just didn\u2019t want them to know that you were --?",
        "A: Well of course not. These are our mortal enemies. It was very difficult to keep\nup the time anyway in captivity too.",
        "Q: So shortly before, you took your ID and revised the name on it?",
        "A: No, no. I buried it.",
        "Q: You were able to obtain a new one?",
        "A: No, I had nothing.",
        "Q: You had nothing?",
        "A: I had nothing. I had absolutely nothing. I know that the Germans they drove the\npeople in front of them. They fired on the people from planes, just like in -- just\n7\nlike Mr. Picasso showed it in his famous picture. The famous picture from\nPicasso, -- my mind is not so --.",
        "Q: Vernacov\u2019?",
        "A: In Vernacov. They drove us down the road and they shot at all of us, everybody.",
        "Q: Describe to me the capture, how you were captured.",
        "A: Well they drove us all together in one big place. The soldiers are on one side and\nthe civilians are on another side. They did separate us. I still had my soldier\u2019s\nuniform at that time. Well, I was a French soldier at that time and was taken\nprisoner as a soldier.",
        "Q: How long did you actually hold the line? How long did you actually fight before\nyou were overrun by the Germans?",
        "A: That was about two days, 2 \u20192 days until we learned how to get the thing going.\nThere were four guys that got the ammunition. We had 80 rounds, how long does\nthat take for a 75 mm gun?",
        "Q: Probably not long?",
        "A: Not long at all. I took maybe an hour. That was the actual resistance, an hour.\nThen we stayed around there and then we went there, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really\nknow.",
        "Q: Did you have any idea of what was really happening? Did you know where --\nwas there anybody reporting to you, telling you what was going on? Run, the\nGermans are coming?",
        "A: That\u2019s about the size of it. Run, the Germans were coming; run the Germans\nwere coming. Everybody ran and I did too. I remember that I got a bicycle on\nwhich there weren\u2019t any tires on it and it just -- it worked.",
        "Q: So you were able to ride away?",
        "A: I ride a little bit, not very long. Then I gave that up too and I was taken prisoner.\nThey were just coming, so many of them. So many Germans come through and\nthey were well organized, well organized. They were not on horses at all.\nEverything was motorized, everything.",
        "Q: What did you see first in terms of the German army? Did you see infantry or --?",
        "A: Infantry, always infantry and planes, yes. Always planes, always overhead. The\ninfantry came after the planes, the planes strafed us and then came the infantry.\n8\nThey were as if they were on a picnic, these guys. They said, well these are the\nFrench army. That\u2019s all there was at that time, there wasn\u2019t very much. I know\nthat I went to -- I was evacuated at that time. I don\u2019t know how I got there but I\ngot to Bacarah and that\u2019s about 30, 40 miles off there. From Bacarah I was\ntransported in the forty men, no, a hundred men, 50 men and 10 horses on these\ntrains. They had us on those trains and shipped us back to Germany.",
        "Q: So you were in there with horses?",
        "A: No, no, not me, not me, not with horses. The train is called either 50 men or ---..",
        "Q: Oh, in terms of the size? I see. This is a boxcar of some kind?",
        "A: A boxcar, it is a boxcar. We were in there. We were moved to Bacarah, from\nBacarah to -- I don\u2019t know where. We ended up we ended up in Trier and that\u2019s\nwhere I was registered as a prisoner of war.",
        "Q: How long was that journey?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I can remember. I\u2019m sure it was longer than one day, I think two or\nthree days. From Bacarah to Trier, it\u2019s not very far really and that\u2019s where I was\nregistered, 10,088, my number. I remember my number.",
        "Q: You were with other prisoners?",
        "A: Oh, plenty, plenty.",
        "Q: You were with people, you still, anybody from your company was with you?",
        "A: They were not from my company, they were all mixed up. There was nobody\nfrom my company. Really I don\u2019t understand how it was around there that I was\nnot together with permanent people but I always changed so quickly. Anyway it\nwas a hard time. This was definitely one of the worst times I passed in Germany\nwhen I was shipped out from that camp to get the barbed wire out of the west\ncoast of Germany to the east coast. We got the wire from the west coast and\nrolled it up and they transported it to the east in preparation for the Russians.\nThey took us right away. Finally they learned that I spoke German and from then\non, it was better time.",
        "Q: So how long were you held in Trier?",
        "A: Oh, I was all the way in Trier until late 1944. In the meantime I was shipped back\nand forth to a farm in Trier.",
        "Q: Just for forced labor?\n9",
        "A: Forced labor and I was shipped back into Trier to cure me of an infection and then\nback to Laufeld that\u2019s where the camp was, Laufeld.",
        "Q: How do you spell that?",
        "A: L-a-u-f-e-l-d, Laufeld.",
        "Q: What do you remember about the conditions there, at the camp?",
        "A: Once we were back with the peasants, we were pretty well off. Once we were\nback with the peasants, we had much more liberty.",
        "Q: That 1s working on the farm?",
        "A: On the farm, yes. Much more liberty and at that time, again I didn\u2019t speak\nGerman at all. Again after a while, they learned how I spoke it, what can I do\nhuh.",
        "Q: But that worked to your advantage?",
        "A: It worked to my advantage, yes, it worked to my advantage.\nI can\u2019t say that it didn\u2019t because if I said that, it wouldn\u2019t be true, it worked to my\nadvantage. But the Germans are our enemies, they are, they were and they will\nbe. The Germans are our enemies, they do not like Jews. I remember one time\nwhen we were in 1943 when we were in that camp, there came a delegation of\nGerman soldiers and they asked us, which one is a Jew? Which of you is a Jew?\nI didn\u2019t speak German at all at that time? When they came, I didn\u2019t of course. I\ndon\u2019t know why the other guys didn\u2019t tell these guys, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Tell them that they knew that you were or --?",
        "A: Sure, they knew that I spoke German at that time. But they didn\u2019t tell the other\nguys and I don\u2019t know why. Anyway there was a delegation there looking for\nJews. They were looking for Jews, which one of you is a Jew. My friend Jacques\nde Fren, good John, came forward and said, there are no Jews here. We are all\nFrench soldiers. I thought he\u2019d shoot us right away but he didn\u2019t and they left. I\ndon\u2019t know who was what and where but I spoke German when I was in this\nfarm, in several forms. I worked in one, two, three, four different farms. At the\nend, I even got a tractor. This one I was able to operate, a tractor with the\nplowing and all of that. He gave this to me, the foreman gave this to me. The\nforeman couldn\u2019t work anymore so he gave this to me to operate, so I operated it.",
        "Q: What was the nature of the work on the farm? Was it just -- were these all to help\nout the general farm work?\n10",
        "A: General farm work, yes, general farm work. I think that the hardest work\nwas to pick up potatoes. When you cut the potatoes out of the ground, you have\nto pick them up into these baskets and I tell you it was very, very hard, very hard\nwork. When the foreman on the farm gave us something to carry around, he\nwanted this oats to be moved up -- from downstairs to upstairs. He gave me a\nlittle les. He gave me a little less.",
        "Q: These were sacks?",
        "A: Sacks of oats. Gave me a little less. Transport the oats. This is the oats from I\ndon\u2019t know how many fields, I don\u2019t know. Five of us carried the stuff upstairs.\nThis was quite a bit of drudgery but we did it.",
        "Q: Did you sleep at the farms?",
        "A: No, we slept ina camp. We had to come back from these peasants, back to camp\nevery day and we slept ina camp. There were eight of us, Laufeld had 8\nprisoners.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s all?",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s a small hamlet.",
        "Q: Where did they hold you?",
        "A: They held me in one of these little barrack type of thing.",
        "Q: All together everybody was?",
        "A: Yeah, eight of us altogether. It was a small room, smaller than the outside of this,\nnot very large.",
        "Q: So each morning you\u2019d be woken up --?",
        "A: Sure and the soldier, he was very proud to wake us up. He said rous .",
        "Q: Did you work every day?",
        "A: Yes, well except Sundays. Sundays we did not. As a matter of fact, most of the\ntime when I was in camp, I went to church on Sundays. But no longer when I was\nin Laufeld, I didn\u2019t go to church. Also we were not supposed to go to the\npeasants on Sundays because apparently Sunday was their rest day. Six days we\nworked, that\u2019s all right with me.",

        "A: Yes, do that.\nEnd of Side A, Tape 1.",
        "Q: You\u2019d work six days a week on the peasants\u2019 ---, on the farms?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: What about food?",
        "A: The peasants gave us very good food. I mean it was probably Russian, whatever,\nbut to me it was plenty. Anyway I didn\u2019t eat too much at that time. It was just\nfine with me at those four places.",
        "Q: Those four places, were they all in the same area?",
        "A: They were all around Laufeld.",
        "Q: So Laufeld was your hub?",
        "A: That was the hub, yes, that was the hub. I stayed in Laufeld until late 1944 at\nwhich time the soldiers said, now you have to out and you have to repair the\nrailroad tracks in Trier. That\u2019s where we went first, in Trier. Of course the\nrailroad tracks was a mess. That lasted for a couple of months.",
        "Q: They were destroyed during Allied attacks?",
        "A: Yeah, Allied attacks, sure.",
        "Q: You probably heard those attacks?",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure. No problem at all. I mean we saw them come over every time.\nWe were even, we bucked this German guard a little bit but not too much.\nOtherwise, boy, he was so nasty, would have kicked us or something like that.\nBut we showed him the planes going through. We were in the right area between\nTrier and the Moselle River, on the uplands of the Moselle River. It\u2019s called the\nScnei, the snow . The planes came over there, not very far and we saw\nthem, yes. At the end, we were moved from there, from the railroad tracks to -- I\ndon\u2019t really know where. Anyway, I don\u2019t know what happened then and I don\u2019t\nremember very well because between September or October, 1944 and January,\nwe were moved on and certainly moved in several places that I don\u2019t remember at\nall.",
        "Q: Many prisoners were moved?\n12",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: Again in cattle cars or --?",
        "A: That was marched, we marched a lot at that time. The winter came, the winter of\n\"44,45 and how was it that I got into a hospital. I got into a hospital at\nsometime. We had enough to eat in that hospital for us to eat, several prisoners\nand several Soviet refugees and all that. There was such a mix of people, I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: What kind of hospital was this?",
        "A: It was a hospital in -- it was bombed -- a bombed out hospital. The lower floors\nwere still going, were still intact and the top was bombed out.",
        "Q: Were you just being held there?",
        "A: We weren\u2019t held any more. That was between September, October, November\nand then the snow came. I know that one of those planes, from the British plane,\nshot up one of those trains going through the rail that we were guarding or\nwhatever and they were shot down terribly. They were saved for their lives so I\nfelt through with them, that this was going to be the end. Then I got into that\nhospital. The hospital finally in January or February, no January 1945 was\nliberated by American troops.",
        "Q: So this hospital, the Germans left?",
        "A: Most of them, yes. There were some nurses there.",
        "Q: They had supplies? These were---?",
        "A: They had supplies, I don\u2019t know, I just don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: But it was within Germany you were still?",
        "A: Oh, yes, oh yes. I was still within Germany. As a matter of fact, at the time I\nfinally left Germany it must have been the end of January, 1945. There were a lot\nof people, a lot of girls too on that train that finally left Germany. I think I was\nliberated according to -- I was demobilized on February 7 1945.",
        "Q: What do you remember about the liberation?",
        "A: The first guys that came to us, to me anyway, pointed the gun at me and said who\nare you? I said I\u2019m a French citizen and we are all prisoners here and we can\u2019t do\nanything and we are not against you at all.\n13",
        "Q: This was an American?",
        "A: An American soldier, yes. He accepted that. I guess I\u2019m a little bit forward so I\nspoke to them first. Then they came to us from a French -- not that time. anyway\nI know that I was demobilized in France. We had gone by cattle cars and\nwhatever to get to Paris. We were demobilized in France February 7 1945.",
        "Q: Were you shipped back with other French prisoners?",
        "A: Lots.",
        "Q: Lots of everybody?",
        "A: Lots. They didn\u2019t ask us anybody who is what. They asked us what\u2019s your\nnationality? You say French so you get into this car. The other ones go in the\nother car.",
        "Q: Once you got into Paris ---0\u201d",
        "A: No, I got to my parents by way of the Red Cross. They find out where my parents\nwere and I went there about the 10\" of February.",
        "Q: Where were they during the war?",
        "A: Oh, my parents were, first of all my father was hidden in pension in the south,\nway in the south near the Pyrenees. My father, mother and my sister they were in\n-- I\u2019m sorry I have this stuff over here. I can\u2019t get it because I gave it to my\ndaughter to read it. I didn\u2019t preclude that you would interrogate me on this. My\nsister was in the resistance, in the French resistance. She was in danger very\noften. Her husband was in danger very much so.",
        "Q: Also in the resistance?",
        "A: Also in the resistance and my brother-in-law, which is my sister\u2019s husband was\ngoing to be deported from France too. It was a matter of minutes that he was\ngoing to be deported. He managed not to be deported and they married later on.\nYes. That was quite an interesting thing.",
        "Q: When you came back into Paris, where did you go from that point?",
        "A: When I came back to Paris, my brother said he saw me and I was full of filth\nwhen I came to Paris. I was just full of filth. It was from every place, it was not\nvery good. I was not very nice and clean.",
        "Q: When you were first taken prisoner, had they issued you a uniform to wear?\n14",
        "A: Yes. They gave a form of despates. In France you have these colonial troops,\ndespates. This you don\u2019t want to see because these are very large trousers that are\nattached to the belt. This is very funny, this is ridiculous and I had the despates\nuniform on for at least three months, four months.",
        "Q: The same uniform?",
        "A: What do you think, the same uniform. What do you think of?",
        "A: I think that -- I like to make sure we get it on the tape.",
        "Q: Oh, sure absolutely. There was no way to wash the stuff. There\u2019s no way I could\nwash It. As you know, even at that time we wore one shirt and then we wore the\nnext shirt and when that was more dirty than the first shirt, we wore the first shirt.\nThis is what there was, there was not very much. But once we were out with the\npeasants we could wash our shirts, we could even prepare some food here and\nthere. When we were with the peasants, we were treated very well. One thing\nthat we were always afraid of is that one German soldier.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: I have no idea, I have no idea.",
        "Q: Had he beaten other prisoners?",
        "A: Oh, yes. But he didn\u2019t touch me; why, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did you speak German with him?",
        "A: Yes. I spoke German with him and why they didn\u2019t say that I actually originated\nin Germany, I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t tell you.",
        "Q: Did you hear any news from your parents?",
        "A: Well, we were prisoners of war. Mail was collected every several months. I do\nknow that I wrote to my parents. First of all, I didn\u2019t write at all because I didn\u2019t\nwant my name in the German files. In 1943, I did write and the parents answered.\nThey were already in Poland and they changed their name to Bactel.",
        "Q: How did the letter ever get to them?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: How did that letter ever find them?\n15",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what happened, I don\u2019t know. I always wrote to\nBrunswic and I don\u2019t know how this worked. It never was very regular but I did\nget a letter about like once a year, twice a year.",
        "Q: From your parents?",
        "A: From my parents, yes. My father signed P, papa.",
        "Q: Just the letter \u201c\u2018p\u2019\u2019?",
        "A: Nothing else, but that was just enough for me. I knew it was them. After we saw\nthe planes coming over in September 1944, we were out with -- there was\nabsolutely no correspondence at all. I don\u2019t know where they went. I just don\u2019t\nknow. You just told me the thing that I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know how to\naddress my father. My father\u2019s Bactel name. I never addressed anybody to the\nBactel name. No letter came to Bactel name. I was always Brunswic. I don\u2019t\nknow how they got it but they did get it though. They did know that I was a\nprisoner, they also did not know where I was. Of course, there was nothing to tell\nthem where I was because the Germans didn\u2019t give out any information\nwhatsoever.",
        "Q: So you would write a letter but clearly it was looked at, information was taken\nout?",
        "A: It was very much looked at. Yes, sometimes, I don\u2019t know. I never knew that.",
        "Q: They knew you were a POW though?",
        "A: Yes. They knew that after about 1943. I know that from 1943 on, they got more\nregular, every six months or so, they got a letter.",
        "Q: What do you remember hearing about the progress of the war when you were a\nprisoner?",
        "A: Oh, yes, we heard about it. We heard about it and we were very happy by the\nnewspapers. For instance, I was very happy when I was in camp in Trier. When I\ntranslated, I didn\u2019t translate at Trier. It was not Trier. It was another camp that\nwe were there first and I know that the Germans had a hard time in northern\nAfrica. That was 1942 and I also know that I was in four years in that Laufeld\nplace. It was first in a different place. It was in a different place, there were\nAmerican ---, they\u2019re less than an officer, what do you call them?",
        "Q: Enlisted men?",
        "A: Well, not enlisted men. What d you call that, higher than an enlisted man?\n16",
        "Q: Officers?",
        "A: No. In between. You\u2019re not very informed either.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know what would be in between unless they were sergeants or ---?",
        "A: Sergeants, right! That kind of thing. The Germans got the sergeants out of the\nenlisted men\u2019s quarters and at that time I got out of the enlisted men\u2019s quarters too\nbecause I spoke German.",
        "Q: So these were American?",
        "A: No, no. This is in the German camps, this is before I got to Trier.",
        "Q: Your first capture, before you go to Trier, they hold you someplace?",
        "A: They held me someplace, yes. That\u2019s where we got the barbed wire to the east\nfront.",
        "Q: They gave you this task of ---? This was barbed wire they already had, they were\nusing?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: This was barbed wire on the western front?",
        "A: On the western front and we tore it out from where it was and shipped it together\non rolls and shipped it together to the eastern front. That was definitely so.",
        "Q: That must have been horrible work?",
        "A: That was the worst time. The first time, that was the winter of 1940, \u201941. That\nwas the worst time, even I think part of it also \u00b042.",
        "Q: How much barbed wire did you collect? It must have been thousands of feet?",
        "A: Millions, millions. The Germans had everything and we just didn\u2019t have --very\nproblematic was to grab the barbed wire and tear it out. We had leather hand\nthings, leather gloves to tear it out and that was the hardest time I spent in a\nGerman camp.",
        "Q: What did you pull it out from? Was it nailed into ---?",
        "A: No, it was not nailed. It was staked in. We pulled out the stakes too. The stakes\nwere -- everything was well designed. The stakes were so well put in that you\n17\nhad to take them out with a shovel. With a shovel you could get in; it took a\nwhile to get these things out. Boy, that was the hardest time I ever had.",
        "Q: This was all in Germany?\nA; This was all before, before Laufeld, yes. Before I found Laufeld. When I finally\nfound Laufeld, I think that was the end of pretty good for me.",
        "Q: So you cleaned up, prepared this barbed wire to be shipped to the other front for\nseveral months? Then you went on to Trier?",
        "A: Then I went to Trier, yes.",
        "Q: Was it there they formally registered you as a prisoner?",
        "A: Yes, in Trier. That\u2019s right, I was not registered before. I was not registered\nbefore.",
        "Q: Where were they holding you in that first camp? Was there some kind of\nbarracks or were you sleeping outside, do you recall?",
        "A: No, there were barracks and just too many people in each barrack. You can\u2019t do\nthat to -- there were -- all those people were in barracks and we were in barracks\ntoo. After that, yes, I spoke German and then I got a bit better off. As a matter of\nfact, I told you that we first got the barbed wire off in Germany. Then later on\nthey found out I spoke German and I got freed from this task.",
        "Q: They felt they could use you in some other way, I guess?",
        "A: Right, to get the wires (?) around.",
        "Q: You translated for --?",
        "A: I translated for the Germans, yes. Even then we knew how bad it was in North\nAfrica and how bad it was in -- and how it happened. No it did not because North\nAfrica was later. North Africa was 1942, \u201943. I don\u2019t know really, I\u2019m sorry, I\njust don\u2019t have my reference now. But that was the worst time I had was the first\nyear I was in camp in Germany. It was the baddest time I ever had. The food was\nbad.",
        "Q: What was the food like?",
        "A: Whatever. I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know but there was some food just to keep\nus alive and working.",
        "Q: Do you remember anyone ever trying to escape?\n18",
        "A: There was very little escape. Why was there very little escape? Because at first\neverybody was under German power. The second one was there was a very great\nanti-Jewish community in France. I never forget them but I do know that the\nJewish community in France, they didn\u2019t like us very well. But people escaped,\nyes. I did escape twice. The first time I got as far as the end of the camp, really.",
        "Q: This was the first camp?",
        "A: That was when I was tearing up the barbed wire out of the ground. The second\ntime I escaped from Trier. From Trier we had two people, three people with me.\nWe tried to go through France to Switzerland. The Alsace people, the people\nfrom Alsace-Lorraine, we got as far as Alsace-Lorraine ---.",
        "Q: So you were able to cross the river?",
        "A: Yes, yes. No problem at all. We got over the bridge and into Alsace-Lorraine\nand we were caught by a person who didn\u2019t like the prisoners in Germany.\nBecause the Frenchmen didn\u2019t have much to eat and they thought that we were\ntoo fat. That was from Trier south to Alsace-Lorraine and we gave it to the\nGerman officials.",
        "Q: This was a Frenchman?",
        "A: A Frenchman, yes. He gave it to the German officials and they caught us and\nthat\u2019s when I was in prison. I was in prison one month for escaping.",
        "Q: They took you back to Trier?",
        "A: Oh, yes. They took me back to Trier.",
        "Q: Did they march you back or ---?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: So this man who turned you all in was a Frenchman who was -- sounds like he\nwas jealous that you weren\u2019t thinner, that you weren\u2019t treated worse?",
        "A: Yeah. They didn\u2019t like us and they gave us up to the Germans. The Germans\ncame and they picked us up. I mean it was so easy, too easy.",
        "Q: Where were you when they picked you up?",
        "A: In the barn, in the barn.",
        "Q: Just hiding there?\n19",
        "A: Just hiding there. We were asleep. There wasn\u2019t very much and they didn\u2019t do\nmuch about it. They knew exactly what we were doing, knew exactly where we\nwere going. They knew exactly everything about us, they knew exactly. They\nknew who we were also or did we give them our names? I think we did, give\nthem our prisoner names and that was it. I was one month in prison. In prison, it\nwas pretty bad because I was --. This was an underground prison and I know that\nthe people above ground, they were all Russians. They put me into this thing, into\nthe Russian camp because, not because, I don\u2019t know. They put me in a Russian\ncamp, I was in prison in a Russian camp. If the Russians had not given me\ncigarettes and food, I might not have survived, who knows.",
        "Q: Were you in a cell by yourself?",
        "A: In -- pretty small, yes. About the size of this.",
        "Q: These were Russian refugees or ---?",
        "A: No, no, Russian soldiers. This was 1943 or after.",
        "Q: Your buddies who you escaped with? They also were --?",
        "A: Yeah, and I don\u2019t know where they went. They were shipped to somebody else,\nsomeplace else.",
        "Q: They threw you in this little cubicle, they really weren\u2019t feeding you?",
        "A: Well, they gave me something, yes.",
        "Q: But the Russian soldiers --?",
        "A: They kept me and I speak no Russian or whatever. They were really very good\npals, these guys. They gave me cigarettes too.",
        "Q: They just passed them into you?",
        "A: Well it wasn\u2019t that way. The thing was underneath, underneath where the\nRussians were. I heard the Russians play to the tunes la-la- etc. And the guy\ncame to the -- between two of these floorboards and passed a couple of things\ndown.",
        "Q: Is that right? Extraordinary.",
        "A: Extraordinary. I really take my hat off to those guys. I really do, I really do.",
        "Q: So they kept that up on a regular basis, passing down?\n20",
        "A: Yes, every evening, not during the day. In the day they could not do anything.",
        "Q: Were they working during the day or they just ---?",
        "A: Apparently, yes. They were out. When they came back in the evening, I got all\nof this stuff.",
        "Q: What kind of food did they pass to you, do you recall? Anything especially\nmemorable about --? How were you released from the prison?",
        "A: I was shipped back to Trier.",
        "Q: Were they interrogating you during this time?",
        "A: Yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: Was this a daily routine?",
        "A: No, it was just one time. One time and he said I should stay for a month. I served\nfor three weeks.",
        "Q: This was a junior fuehrer or head of the camp or some --?",
        "A: Junior fuehrer, what you said, exactly, a junior fuehrer. Under those\ncircumstances I did not speak very well German. I did not speak very well\nbecause they would have cut me off. I was sure that this was very dangerous,\nvery dangerous.",
        "Q: Speaking German was --?",
        "A: In that place, in that place. Back in Laufeld, I spoke German to the camp. No, no\nI spoke German, I didn\u2019t speak very much German at all in Trier. In Trier I did\nnot but when I came back to Laufeld, I start speaking German to the German\nguard.",
        "Q: What was your fear about speaking German there? That they would find out\nwhere you were from? Assuming you\u2019re Jewish?",
        "A: Find out where I\u2019m from and assuming I\u2019m Jewish, sure, right away. The thing I\nwas scared of was drop your pants. That\u2019s what you were scared of, huh.\nBecause that\u2019s what they did at the time. Drop your pants, that\u2019s it. Right away\nyou\u2019re off. Eight prisoners and one German guard, yes.",
        "Q: At Laufeld?\n21",
        "A: At Laufeld. At other lager camps, then February 7, 1945 while it was -- I\nremember yes. My brother said I was so dirty when I came and my other brother,\nI met him in the stairway and I didn\u2019t recognize him, because he was then 19, I\nwas 25.",
        "Q: Years had passed, right?",
        "A: He was 18, almost 19, that\u2019s right . He was a youngster when I was taken, when I\nwent to Germany. He was what? He was 12.",
        "Q: You were just 20 when the war started?",
        "A: I was 19, yeah. My twentieth birthday I did in Bacarah. I was a prisoner in\nBacarah. There were so many prisoners, so many, the Germans had more\nprisoners than they could really handle, they had more prisoners. I don\u2019t know,\nthey managed to.",
        "Q: When you returned to Paris, where did you stay? Did you have to go back to\nwhere your home was?",
        "A: No. My parents were in Poland, they were some place in the P . Very\nsoon I was a prisoner of war and I was assigned from the government, an\napartment. The apartment that I was assigned to, we all moved to.",
        "Q: This was a privilege as a prisoner of war?",
        "A: We all moved to that apartment and I don\u2019t know what else happened there.\nAnyway from that apartment I went in the UNRRA and became a messing officer.\nAt that time, the UNRRA advertised all over. You\u2019d be good in the UNRRA and\nthey\u2019d take anybody with some military thing. I just went there and I enlisted in\nthe UNRRA and was enlisted as a messing officer, that was for the food, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Were you assigned that or did you ask to do something like that?",
        "A: No, I was assigned there. What can you do here? I said I can do whatever you\nwant me to. They said messing officer, fine with me. I first knew about food\nafter several years as a messing officer. I learned about food from my wife,\nreally.",
        "Q: Where were you an officer in this? Did you stay in France?",
        "A: In Stuttgart, Esslingen where I met my wife and then to Turkheim in Bavaria.",

In June \u201945, no that\u2019s not, it was much\nbefore. It was June 1938 or \u201939. In June \u201945 I was hired.",

        "Q: Did you have a sponsor here in the U.S., relatives?",
        "A: Oh, yes. My wife\u2019s uncles were here. They were sponsors. My father even had\nsome relatives with military personnel in Paris who he knew, who got us on the\nplane. As a matter of fact, my wife was pregnant at the time and that\u2019s how we\ngot on the plane, anyway. We flew from -- first we had to go to Frankfurt.

First my wife came, we were organized\nthere. My boss said you have to go to school. I have to first do my high school\nbecause I wasn\u2019t with high school yet. I went to high school and what is the\nteacher that taught me high school English? In New Jersey. Prepared me for high\nschool diploma. I didn\u2019t have much from Germany. Prepared me very well\nbecause I had no problems I didn\u2019t have money enough to -- so I dropped out.\nWe couldn\u2019t pay, we dropped out because we couldn\u2019t pay. The college suggest\nthat we move to New York State so that I could go to City College. That\u2019s right\nin 1948. So we were forced to move to New York.

        "A: He was the youngest, yes. We lived in Heidelberg. As you know we have, I\ndon\u2019t know if we have this, no we don\u2019t. We lived in Heidelberg. It was a very\nbeautiful town. I lived there for only 12 years.",
        "A: I was born in Heidelberg. It\u2019s a very beautiful town. We lived -- I remember the\naddress, Und no. 12 A. My father was a very successful physician.",
        "A: Yes, an internist, internist. With this, several other things. But he mainly is\ninternist. My mother was his assistant, that\u2019s right. My mother was his assistant,\nthat\u2019s how she got married.",
        "A: He had a private practice in Heidelberg. We lived in the same house as his office\nwas. It was all in one, the office and the people lived upstairs.",
        "A: No, it was a three-story building, four-story building.",
        "A: Practice on ground level. There\u2019s something below ground, ground level, first\nfloor, second floor, third floor and fourth floor too. Everything up to the attic.\nWas very fine. My mother was very active in the women\u2019s movement. She was\nvery active in the women\u2019s movement in Berlin already where she was born. She\n1\nwas active in women\u2019s political movement. Of course, they didn\u2019t get to the\npolitics at all in Germany but you saw here how it turned out.",
        "A: Yes, she was. Yes she was. She was working with my father in the practice until\nof course, he died, really. She was always working. She was always working in\nthe practice, even in France, all the time. Well, it says here --. I had a very happy\nchildhood that\u2019s right. We played piano, we were interested in the arts and music.\nThat was my main field, music.",
        "A: I took piano lessons at home, yes. There were two, to have piano. My brother\nand me, we took piano lessons and the girls did, I don\u2019t know what. They did\nfine.",

No, no, you can\u2019t see it from this side, from the other side you can see it. I\nhad this picture here. I was in high school up to the age 12.",
        "A: Public high school up to the age 12. That\u2019s when Hitler came and my father\ndecided that they destroyed his apparatus, his x-ray apparatus and they destroyed\nit. My father said that\u2019s the end and he quit.",

        "A: You bet, of course. Only Jews, only Jews.\n2",

        "A: \u00b033, January 1933.",
        "A: Yes, yes. I know the whole family left Heidelberg at that time. I myself went\nfirst to Switzerland, to Basel where we had some relatives and friends that took\nme up. Where the others went, I really don\u2019t know. But for about three months, I\ndidn\u2019t know where they were. My father found a place in Holland where he could\ngo to and he even opened a practice in Holland but it was undercover because he\ndid not have the doctor\u2019s license in Holland. So it was undercover in Holland.",
        "A: Well, yes. I don\u2019t know where my sisters went.",
        "A: I was in Switzerland and I don\u2019t know where the others went. We were reunited\nin Holland in about May of 1933. Was it three months? Maybe March.",
        "A: April, maybe. I don\u2019t really know for sure but I was prepared in Holland for my\nbar mitzvah. That\u2019s right, it was May and I had to prepare for the bar mitzvah in\ntwo and a half months. It was very difficult. I really didn\u2019t know much about the\nJews at all but I\u2019m circumsised and I didn\u2019t know any further. The people, the\nrabbi in Holland who taught me, I don\u2019t really remember him at all. He prepared\nme for the bar mitzvah. I was bar mitzvahed in August 1933.",
        "A: We were in The Hague. We were in The Hague, t-h-e h-a-g-u-e. The Hague in\nHolland. I even remember my address it\u2019s , 37. I remember that.\nWe lived there and more or less okay at that time. You don\u2019t really know when\nyou\u2019re so young like I was 12 years old and my brother who was then seven years\nold, six years old, he was very small. He didn\u2019t know either. I remember that I\nwas in this house, in the highest room there was in the house, I was there. That\nwas my room, the very highest.\n3",
        "A: We had one house and we even rented a room to a boarder.",
        "A: The boarder was not, no. He was very strongly not Jewish at all. Andrew von\nAmeron. I heard of him later. He was not a Jew at all but anyway, I was bar\nmitzvahed. A little bit later I went to Hachshara which prepared people for Israel\nwith a different instruction such as for instance, I did cabinet making. I was for\nHachshara, I was there four years.",
        "A: In The Hague, that was in -- well it was out in the . Not very far\nfrom Texel, T-e-x-e-l. Again the name is the Texel, t-h-e.",
        "A: At that time, yes, at that time. But then after a while my father became a\nFrenchman. His grandfather was a Frenchman in 1820 or 30. Also his name was\nAdolph and I remember that he is the one who gave us the French nationality\nbecause he was an Alsatian and my father was able to get his French nationality\nand we too got the French nationality. We moved to France.",
        "A: We moved to France a little bit between 1933 and 36. About 1936 and I came in\n\u00b037. Father was already in France and he was very well established.",
        "A: In Paris. After Father came to France, his practice was very, very well known and\nwell received by the people.",
        "A: A legitimate physician, yes. There were lots of people there even though he\ndidn\u2019t speak too well French. He did very well, he did very well after that. I\nspoke very well French, afterwards. It took me a while to get the French accent.",
        "A: Dutch. I was so good in Dutch that a Dutch person said I didn\u2019t know you were\nfrom Germany. Apparently I didn\u2019t and I also remember what car this man was\ndriving. Was a LaSalle at the time, was 1937.\n4",
        "A: That\u2019s when later on I left France. I saw the International Exposition in France\nwhich was starting in 1936 to 1937. I was much more impressed by the Germans\nat that time, cast a one-meter block of steel. That is a difficult thing to do. A one-\nmeter square, cube, a one-meter cube, block of steel. Now that\u2019s a difficult thing\nto do. They did this and I saw this. They had everything, the Germans had\neverything at that time. Well, when I came to France, I just didn\u2019t have very\nmuch to offer the people. I worked in a couple of shops. One was the piano\nfactory, Pleyel, and I worked in several places.",
        "A: Yes. I worked as a cabinetmaker in Pleyel and I made radio enclosures which at\nthe time were made of wood and very fancy.",
        "A: No, no it was the same factory Pleyel, yes. We also made the composites of\nupper deck of the pianos and all those things. I did those at Pleyel. After a while\nI got sick and tired of that, I enlisted in the French army. That was 1939 and I\nenlisted September and got called up in October, 1939.",
        "A: Oh, yes. The war had begun in France too in September 1. I enlisted in the\nFrench army in October or November. Anyway I got assigned to the artillery in\nOrleans and I remember my father came to Orleans and I had to ---. He took me\nout and gave me all of the things that they would like, the grown-up persons and I\ndidn\u2019t like at all. Like how do you call these mussels that you eat?",
        "A: No, the mussels, escargot are snails. I hate them.",
        "A: Oysters, oysters! He gave me oysters and champagne.",
        "A: My father invited me to eat oysters and champagne in Orleans and I couldn\u2019t eat\nthat. I could not eat that.\n5",
        "A: I never did try it before and this was the first time and I just couldn\u2019t eat it at that\ntime. I was a lot thinner at that time too.",
        "A: The basic training was, no the basic training was -- we were shipped from Orleans\nto some other place. We went into the Maginot Line, and were trained there.\nAfter I enlisted in Orleans and I guess we were educated in military manners in\nOrleans, then we were shipped to the Maginot Line. Then I drove a car that was\nabsolutely 1919, unbelievable with its handles, unbelievable. It was 1917 I think,\nit was unbelievable. I said I drove a car to the instructor, I said I drove a car. But\nthat car I could not drive.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. I tried and I tried and I could not so I was shipped to the\nMaginot Line anyway.",
        "A: No, no. I would have been in the Maginot Line to drive that thing. That was\nwhen I did that. Later on, it was a much better car, I had a transporter that get\nmunitions to the line. That I could drive, that I could drive.",
        "A: Was a newer model, correct. They also taught us 175 gun. Yes, 75 mm gun, yes.",
        "A: There was a physical war with Germany. You\u2019re mistaken. There was a physical\nwar declared by France in 1939.",
        "A: The invasion wasn\u2019t until 19490, that\u2019s correct. I think it was May \u00b040, May 10\".",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t see any battle until May, 1940. At that time, the Germans attacked\nus from Germany and at that time, I --.... Was a funny thing, there were no more\nofficers. I was not promoted at all. I was not promoted at all and I was in charge\nat the end of four guns.\n6",
        "A: Seventy-five mm guns. I was in charge of four of those. I don\u2019t know how but I\nshot until there was no more munitions and that was the end of it. There were no\nmore officers, there were no people around to instruct us this, to instruct us that.\nOnce we got rid of our guns after a while, the Germans were very close at that\ntime. I mean with a 75 mm you shot up to about those hills over there. That\u2019s\nhow we did it. We shot at them, I learned how to do that. Then we were out of\nmunitions, no more officers, nobody else.",
        "A: That was towards the end of May, yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. The officers apparently left. As my brother gave me an account of\nthat time, is that the officers had cars and they left in cars. We didn\u2019t know what\nto do. We were left alone. A few days before the Germans arrived really. I got\nout and put my identification which I had -- which was at that time, I was then\ncalled Kurt Braunschweig. That was the German name, Kurt Braunschweig.",
        "A: That\u2019s the born name I was born under, Kurt Braunschweig. When I saw that the\nGermans are going to come, I better get rid of my military identification and\nchanged the name to Brunswic. There comes the name Brunswic.",
        "A: Well of course not. These are our mortal enemies. It was very difficult to keep\nup the time anyway in captivity too.",
        "A: No, no. I buried it.",
        "A: No, I had nothing.",
        "A: I had nothing. I had absolutely nothing. I know that the Germans they drove the\npeople in front of them. They fired on the people from planes, just like in -- just\n7\nlike Mr. Picasso showed it in his famous picture. The famous picture from\nPicasso, -- my mind is not so --.",
        "A: In Vernacov. They drove us down the road and they shot at all of us, everybody.",
        "A: Well they drove us all together in one big place. The soldiers are on one side and\nthe civilians are on another side. They did separate us. I still had my soldier\u2019s\nuniform at that time. Well, I was a French soldier at that time and was taken\nprisoner as a soldier.",
        "A: That was about two days, 2 \u20192 days until we learned how to get the thing going.\nThere were four guys that got the ammunition. We had 80 rounds, how long does\nthat take for a 75 mm gun?",
        "A: Not long at all. I took maybe an hour. That was the actual resistance, an hour.\nThen we stayed around there and then we went there, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really\nknow.",
        "A: That\u2019s about the size of it. Run, the Germans were coming; run the Germans\nwere coming. Everybody ran and I did too. I remember that I got a bicycle on\nwhich there weren\u2019t any tires on it and it just -- it worked.",
        "A: I ride a little bit, not very long. Then I gave that up too and I was taken prisoner.\nThey were just coming, so many of them. So many Germans come through and\nthey were well organized, well organized. They were not on horses at all.\nEverything was motorized, everything.",
        "A: Infantry, always infantry and planes, yes. Always planes, always overhead. The\ninfantry came after the planes, the planes strafed us and then came the infantry.\n8\nThey were as if they were on a picnic, these guys. They said, well these are the\nFrench army. That\u2019s all there was at that time, there wasn\u2019t very much. I know\nthat I went to -- I was evacuated at that time. I don\u2019t know how I got there but I\ngot to Bacarah and that\u2019s about 30, 40 miles off there. From Bacarah I was\ntransported in the forty men, no, a hundred men, 50 men and 10 horses on these\ntrains. They had us on those trains and shipped us back to Germany.",
        "A: No, no, not me, not me, not with horses. The train is called either 50 men or ---..",
        "A: A boxcar, it is a boxcar. We were in there. We were moved to Bacarah, from\nBacarah to -- I don\u2019t know where. We ended up we ended up in Trier and that\u2019s\nwhere I was registered as a prisoner of war.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I can remember. I\u2019m sure it was longer than one day, I think two or\nthree days. From Bacarah to Trier, it\u2019s not very far really and that\u2019s where I was\nregistered, 10,088, my number. I remember my number.",
        "A: Oh, plenty, plenty.",
        "A: They were not from my company, they were all mixed up. There was nobody\nfrom my company. Really I don\u2019t understand how it was around there that I was\nnot together with permanent people but I always changed so quickly. Anyway it\nwas a hard time. This was definitely one of the worst times I passed in Germany\nwhen I was shipped out from that camp to get the barbed wire out of the west\ncoast of Germany to the east coast. We got the wire from the west coast and\nrolled it up and they transported it to the east in preparation for the Russians.\nThey took us right away. Finally they learned that I spoke German and from then\non, it was better time.",
        "A: Oh, I was all the way in Trier until late 1944. In the meantime I was shipped back\nand forth to a farm in Trier.\n9",
        "A: Forced labor and I was shipped back into Trier to cure me of an infection and then\nback to Laufeld that\u2019s where the camp was, Laufeld.",
        "A: L-a-u-f-e-l-d, Laufeld.",
        "A: Once we were back with the peasants, we were pretty well off. Once we were\nback with the peasants, we had much more liberty.",
        "A: On the farm, yes. Much more liberty and at that time, again I didn\u2019t speak\nGerman at all. Again after a while, they learned how I spoke it, what can I do\nhuh.",
        "A: It worked to my advantage, yes, it worked to my advantage.\nI can\u2019t say that it didn\u2019t because if I said that, it wouldn\u2019t be true, it worked to my\nadvantage. But the Germans are our enemies, they are, they were and they will\nbe. The Germans are our enemies, they do not like Jews. I remember one time\nwhen we were in 1943 when we were in that camp, there came a delegation of\nGerman soldiers and they asked us, which one is a Jew? Which of you is a Jew?\nI didn\u2019t speak German at all at that time? When they came, I didn\u2019t of course. I\ndon\u2019t know why the other guys didn\u2019t tell these guys, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Sure, they knew that I spoke German at that time. But they didn\u2019t tell the other\nguys and I don\u2019t know why. Anyway there was a delegation there looking for\nJews. They were looking for Jews, which one of you is a Jew. My friend Jacques\nde Fren, good John, came forward and said, there are no Jews here. We are all\nFrench soldiers. I thought he\u2019d shoot us right away but he didn\u2019t and they left. I\ndon\u2019t know who was what and where but I spoke German when I was in this\nfarm, in several forms. I worked in one, two, three, four different farms. At the\nend, I even got a tractor. This one I was able to operate, a tractor with the\nplowing and all of that. He gave this to me, the foreman gave this to me. The\nforeman couldn\u2019t work anymore so he gave this to me to operate, so I operated it.\n10",
        "A: General farm work, yes, general farm work. I think that the hardest work\nwas to pick up potatoes. When you cut the potatoes out of the ground, you have\nto pick them up into these baskets and I tell you it was very, very hard, very hard\nwork. When the foreman on the farm gave us something to carry around, he\nwanted this oats to be moved up -- from downstairs to upstairs. He gave me a\nlittle les. He gave me a little less.",
        "A: Sacks of oats. Gave me a little less. Transport the oats. This is the oats from I\ndon\u2019t know how many fields, I don\u2019t know. Five of us carried the stuff upstairs.\nThis was quite a bit of drudgery but we did it.",
        "A: No, we slept ina camp. We had to come back from these peasants, back to camp\nevery day and we slept ina camp. There were eight of us, Laufeld had 8\nprisoners.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s a small hamlet.",
        "A: They held me in one of these little barrack type of thing.",
        "A: Yeah, eight of us altogether. It was a small room, smaller than the outside of this,\nnot very large.",
        "A: Sure and the soldier, he was very proud to wake us up. He said rous .",
        "A: Yes, well except Sundays. Sundays we did not. As a matter of fact, most of the\ntime when I was in camp, I went to church on Sundays. But no longer when I was\nin Laufeld, I didn\u2019t go to church. Also we were not supposed to go to the\npeasants on Sundays because apparently Sunday was their rest day. Six days we\nworked, that\u2019s all right with me.\n11",
        "A: Yes, do that.\nEnd of Side A, Tape 1.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: The peasants gave us very good food. I mean it was probably Russian, whatever,\nbut to me it was plenty. Anyway I didn\u2019t eat too much at that time. It was just\nfine with me at those four places.",
        "A: They were all around Laufeld.",
        "A: That was the hub, yes, that was the hub. I stayed in Laufeld until late 1944 at\nwhich time the soldiers said, now you have to out and you have to repair the\nrailroad tracks in Trier. That\u2019s where we went first, in Trier. Of course the\nrailroad tracks was a mess. That lasted for a couple of months.",
        "A: Yeah, Allied attacks, sure.",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure. No problem at all. I mean we saw them come over every time.\nWe were even, we bucked this German guard a little bit but not too much.\nOtherwise, boy, he was so nasty, would have kicked us or something like that.\nBut we showed him the planes going through. We were in the right area between\nTrier and the Moselle River, on the uplands of the Moselle River. It\u2019s called the\nScnei, the snow . The planes came over there, not very far and we saw\nthem, yes. At the end, we were moved from there, from the railroad tracks to -- I\ndon\u2019t really know where. Anyway, I don\u2019t know what happened then and I don\u2019t\nremember very well because between September or October, 1944 and January,\nwe were moved on and certainly moved in several places that I don\u2019t remember at\nall.\n12",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: That was marched, we marched a lot at that time. The winter came, the winter of\n\"44,45 and how was it that I got into a hospital. I got into a hospital at\nsometime. We had enough to eat in that hospital for us to eat, several prisoners\nand several Soviet refugees and all that. There was such a mix of people, I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "A: It was a hospital in -- it was bombed -- a bombed out hospital. The lower floors\nwere still going, were still intact and the top was bombed out.",
        "A: We weren\u2019t held any more. That was between September, October, November\nand then the snow came. I know that one of those planes, from the British plane,\nshot up one of those trains going through the rail that we were guarding or\nwhatever and they were shot down terribly. They were saved for their lives so I\nfelt through with them, that this was going to be the end. Then I got into that\nhospital. The hospital finally in January or February, no January 1945 was\nliberated by American troops.",
        "A: Most of them, yes. There were some nurses there.",
        "A: They had supplies, I don\u2019t know, I just don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Oh, yes, oh yes. I was still within Germany. As a matter of fact, at the time I\nfinally left Germany it must have been the end of January, 1945. There were a lot\nof people, a lot of girls too on that train that finally left Germany. I think I was\nliberated according to -- I was demobilized on February 7 1945.",
        "A: The first guys that came to us, to me anyway, pointed the gun at me and said who\nare you? I said I\u2019m a French citizen and we are all prisoners here and we can\u2019t do\nanything and we are not against you at all.\n13",
        "A: An American soldier, yes. He accepted that. I guess I\u2019m a little bit forward so I\nspoke to them first. Then they came to us from a French -- not that time. anyway\nI know that I was demobilized in France. We had gone by cattle cars and\nwhatever to get to Paris. We were demobilized in France February 7 1945.",
        "A: Lots.",
        "A: Lots. They didn\u2019t ask us anybody who is what. They asked us what\u2019s your\nnationality? You say French so you get into this car. The other ones go in the\nother car.",
        "A: No, I got to my parents by way of the Red Cross. They find out where my parents\nwere and I went there about the 10\" of February.",
        "A: Oh, my parents were, first of all my father was hidden in pension in the south,\nway in the south near the Pyrenees. My father, mother and my sister they were in\n-- I\u2019m sorry I have this stuff over here. I can\u2019t get it because I gave it to my\ndaughter to read it. I didn\u2019t preclude that you would interrogate me on this. My\nsister was in the resistance, in the French resistance. She was in danger very\noften. Her husband was in danger very much so.",
        "A: Also in the resistance and my brother-in-law, which is my sister\u2019s husband was\ngoing to be deported from France too. It was a matter of minutes that he was\ngoing to be deported. He managed not to be deported and they married later on.\nYes. That was quite an interesting thing.",
        "A: When I came back to Paris, my brother said he saw me and I was full of filth\nwhen I came to Paris. I was just full of filth. It was from every place, it was not\nvery good. I was not very nice and clean.\n14",
        "A: Yes. They gave a form of despates. In France you have these colonial troops,\ndespates. This you don\u2019t want to see because these are very large trousers that are\nattached to the belt. This is very funny, this is ridiculous and I had the despates\nuniform on for at least three months, four months.",
        "A: What do you think, the same uniform. What do you think of?",
        "A: I think that -- I like to make sure we get it on the tape.",
        "A: I have no idea, I have no idea.",
        "A: Oh, yes. But he didn\u2019t touch me; why, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes. I spoke German with him and why they didn\u2019t say that I actually originated\nin Germany, I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t tell you.",
        "A: Well, we were prisoners of war. Mail was collected every several months. I do\nknow that I wrote to my parents. First of all, I didn\u2019t write at all because I didn\u2019t\nwant my name in the German files. In 1943, I did write and the parents answered.\nThey were already in Poland and they changed their name to Bactel.",
        "A: Huh?\n15",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what happened, I don\u2019t know. I always wrote to\nBrunswic and I don\u2019t know how this worked. It never was very regular but I did\nget a letter about like once a year, twice a year.",
        "A: From my parents, yes. My father signed P, papa.",
        "A: Nothing else, but that was just enough for me. I knew it was them. After we saw\nthe planes coming over in September 1944, we were out with -- there was\nabsolutely no correspondence at all. I don\u2019t know where they went. I just don\u2019t\nknow. You just told me the thing that I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know how to\naddress my father. My father\u2019s Bactel name. I never addressed anybody to the\nBactel name. No letter came to Bactel name. I was always Brunswic. I don\u2019t\nknow how they got it but they did get it though. They did know that I was a\nprisoner, they also did not know where I was. Of course, there was nothing to tell\nthem where I was because the Germans didn\u2019t give out any information\nwhatsoever.",
        "A: It was very much looked at. Yes, sometimes, I don\u2019t know. I never knew that.",
        "A: Yes. They knew that after about 1943. I know that from 1943 on, they got more\nregular, every six months or so, they got a letter.",
        "A: Oh, yes, we heard about it. We heard about it and we were very happy by the\nnewspapers. For instance, I was very happy when I was in camp in Trier. When I\ntranslated, I didn\u2019t translate at Trier. It was not Trier. It was another camp that\nwe were there first and I know that the Germans had a hard time in northern\nAfrica. That was 1942 and I also know that I was in four years in that Laufeld\nplace. It was first in a different place. It was in a different place, there were\nAmerican ---, they\u2019re less than an officer, what do you call them?",
        "A: Well, not enlisted men. What d you call that, higher than an enlisted man?\n16",
        "A: No. In between. You\u2019re not very informed either.",
        "A: Sergeants, right! That kind of thing. The Germans got the sergeants out of the\nenlisted men\u2019s quarters and at that time I got out of the enlisted men\u2019s quarters too\nbecause I spoke German.",
        "A: No, no. This is in the German camps, this is before I got to Trier.",
        "A: They held me someplace, yes. That\u2019s where we got the barbed wire to the east\nfront.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: On the western front and we tore it out from where it was and shipped it together\non rolls and shipped it together to the eastern front. That was definitely so.",
        "A: That was the worst time. The first time, that was the winter of 1940, \u201941. That\nwas the worst time, even I think part of it also \u00b042.",
        "A: Millions, millions. The Germans had everything and we just didn\u2019t have --very\nproblematic was to grab the barbed wire and tear it out. We had leather hand\nthings, leather gloves to tear it out and that was the hardest time I spent in a\nGerman camp.",
        "A: No, it was not nailed. It was staked in. We pulled out the stakes too. The stakes\nwere -- everything was well designed. The stakes were so well put in that you\n17\nhad to take them out with a shovel. With a shovel you could get in; it took a\nwhile to get these things out. Boy, that was the hardest time I ever had.\nA; This was all before, before Laufeld, yes. Before I found Laufeld. When I finally\nfound Laufeld, I think that was the end of pretty good for me.",
        "A: Then I went to Trier, yes.",
        "A: Yes, in Trier. That\u2019s right, I was not registered before. I was not registered\nbefore.",
        "A: No, there were barracks and just too many people in each barrack. You can\u2019t do\nthat to -- there were -- all those people were in barracks and we were in barracks\ntoo. After that, yes, I spoke German and then I got a bit better off. As a matter of\nfact, I told you that we first got the barbed wire off in Germany. Then later on\nthey found out I spoke German and I got freed from this task.",
        "A: Right, to get the wires (?) around.",
        "A: I translated for the Germans, yes. Even then we knew how bad it was in North\nAfrica and how bad it was in -- and how it happened. No it did not because North\nAfrica was later. North Africa was 1942, \u201943. I don\u2019t know really, I\u2019m sorry, I\njust don\u2019t have my reference now. But that was the worst time I had was the first\nyear I was in camp in Germany. It was the baddest time I ever had. The food was\nbad.",
        "A: Whatever. I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know but there was some food just to keep\nus alive and working.\n18",
        "A: There was very little escape. Why was there very little escape? Because at first\neverybody was under German power. The second one was there was a very great\nanti-Jewish community in France. I never forget them but I do know that the\nJewish community in France, they didn\u2019t like us very well. But people escaped,\nyes. I did escape twice. The first time I got as far as the end of the camp, really.",
        "A: That was when I was tearing up the barbed wire out of the ground. The second\ntime I escaped from Trier. From Trier we had two people, three people with me.\nWe tried to go through France to Switzerland. The Alsace people, the people\nfrom Alsace-Lorraine, we got as far as Alsace-Lorraine ---.",
        "A: Yes, yes. No problem at all. We got over the bridge and into Alsace-Lorraine\nand we were caught by a person who didn\u2019t like the prisoners in Germany.\nBecause the Frenchmen didn\u2019t have much to eat and they thought that we were\ntoo fat. That was from Trier south to Alsace-Lorraine and we gave it to the\nGerman officials.",
        "A: A Frenchman, yes. He gave it to the German officials and they caught us and\nthat\u2019s when I was in prison. I was in prison one month for escaping.",
        "A: Oh, yes. They took me back to Trier.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Yeah. They didn\u2019t like us and they gave us up to the Germans. The Germans\ncame and they picked us up. I mean it was so easy, too easy.",
        "A: In the barn, in the barn.\n19",
        "A: Just hiding there. We were asleep. There wasn\u2019t very much and they didn\u2019t do\nmuch about it. They knew exactly what we were doing, knew exactly where we\nwere going. They knew exactly everything about us, they knew exactly. They\nknew who we were also or did we give them our names? I think we did, give\nthem our prisoner names and that was it. I was one month in prison. In prison, it\nwas pretty bad because I was --. This was an underground prison and I know that\nthe people above ground, they were all Russians. They put me into this thing, into\nthe Russian camp because, not because, I don\u2019t know. They put me in a Russian\ncamp, I was in prison in a Russian camp. If the Russians had not given me\ncigarettes and food, I might not have survived, who knows.",
        "A: In -- pretty small, yes. About the size of this.",
        "A: No, no, Russian soldiers. This was 1943 or after.",
        "A: Yeah, and I don\u2019t know where they went. They were shipped to somebody else,\nsomeplace else.",
        "A: Well, they gave me something, yes.",
        "A: They kept me and I speak no Russian or whatever. They were really very good\npals, these guys. They gave me cigarettes too.",
        "A: Well it wasn\u2019t that way. The thing was underneath, underneath where the\nRussians were. I heard the Russians play to the tunes la-la- etc. And the guy\ncame to the -- between two of these floorboards and passed a couple of things\ndown.",
        "A: Extraordinary. I really take my hat off to those guys. I really do, I really do.\n20",
        "A: Yes, every evening, not during the day. In the day they could not do anything.",
        "A: Apparently, yes. They were out. When they came back in the evening, I got all\nof this stuff.",
        "A: I was shipped back to Trier.",
        "A: Yes, oh yes.",
        "A: No, it was just one time. One time and he said I should stay for a month. I served\nfor three weeks.",
        "A: Junior fuehrer, what you said, exactly, a junior fuehrer. Under those\ncircumstances I did not speak very well German. I did not speak very well\nbecause they would have cut me off. I was sure that this was very dangerous,\nvery dangerous.",
        "A: In that place, in that place. Back in Laufeld, I spoke German to the camp. No, no\nI spoke German, I didn\u2019t speak very much German at all in Trier. In Trier I did\nnot but when I came back to Laufeld, I start speaking German to the German\nguard.",
        "A: Find out where I\u2019m from and assuming I\u2019m Jewish, sure, right away. The thing I\nwas scared of was drop your pants. That\u2019s what you were scared of, huh.\nBecause that\u2019s what they did at the time. Drop your pants, that\u2019s it. Right away\nyou\u2019re off. Eight prisoners and one German guard, yes.\n21",
        "A: At Laufeld. At other lager camps, then February 7, 1945 while it was -- I\nremember yes. My brother said I was so dirty when I came and my other brother,\nI met him in the stairway and I didn\u2019t recognize him, because he was then 19, I\nwas 25.",
        "A: He was 18, almost 19, that\u2019s right . He was a youngster when I was taken, when I\nwent to Germany. He was what? He was 12.",
        "A: I was 19, yeah. My twentieth birthday I did in Bacarah. I was a prisoner in\nBacarah. There were so many prisoners, so many, the Germans had more\nprisoners than they could really handle, they had more prisoners. I don\u2019t know,\nthey managed to.",
        "A: No. My parents were in Poland, they were some place in the P . Very\nsoon I was a prisoner of war and I was assigned from the government, an\napartment. The apartment that I was assigned to, we all moved to.",
        "A: We all moved to that apartment and I don\u2019t know what else happened there.\nAnyway from that apartment I went in the UNRRA and became a messing officer.\nAt that time, the UNRRA advertised all over. You\u2019d be good in the UNRRA and\nthey\u2019d take anybody with some military thing. I just went there and I enlisted in\nthe UNRRA and was enlisted as a messing officer, that was for the food, you\nknow.",
        "A: No, I was assigned there. What can you do here? I said I can do whatever you\nwant me to. They said messing officer, fine with me. I first knew about food\nafter several years as a messing officer. I learned about food from my wife,\nreally.",
        "A: In Stuttgart, Esslingen where I met my wife and then to Turkheim in Bavaria.\n22",
        "A: Well, she was with me, yes.",
        "A: Two years, two full years, yes. From the summer of 1945 I started up in --. Well\nthe war was finished on May 8 in France and what am I going to do afterwards.\nAfterwards I intended to stay some place with ---. No, I wanted to go again into\nUNRRA and they said it would be in Germany. I spoke German and I said that\nwas a good opportunity. I did and --. In June \u201945, no that\u2019s not, it was much\nbefore. It was June 1938 or \u201939. In June \u201945 I was hired.",
        "A: Was hired by UNRRA, right. As an employee by the UNRRA, the United\nNations Relief and Rehabilitation Association as a messing officer. It says here\nand we emigrated to the USA in January 1946. We emigrated to the United States\nin January 1946.",
        "A: Oh, yes. My wife\u2019s uncles were here. They were sponsors. My father even had\nsome relatives with military personnel in Paris who he knew, who got us on the\nplane. As a matter of fact, my wife was pregnant at the time and that\u2019s how we\ngot on the plane, anyway. We flew from -- first we had to go to Frankfurt. Our\nfriend Levitan got us to Frankfurt and then we got to this registration officer. I\ntold him who my father was. He knew my father and everything was hunky-dory\nand I don\u2019t know how it happened but we arrived in the United States without any\npaper whatsoever. Without any paper, I think there was a receipt on a board, a\nreceipt...\nEnd of Tape 1.",
        "A: Before we went to Frankfurt, we did have a religious marriage. My father insisted\nthat I have one and we went to Paris. We returned to Paris and the religious\nservice took place in the house of my parents, which is not really the house of my\nparents, which we borrowed from somebody. The marriage took place there. My\nbrother-in-law, Dr. George Lu officiated. He\u2019s a rabbi and afterwards we\nemigrated to the USA, afterwards.",
        "A: We returned to Paris and went back to Stuttgart. From Stuttgart to Frankfurt and\nfrom Frankfurt we were put on a plane. The plane went to London, Shannon, well\na regular trip 1s two days; it took us five days. We got there, my wife was so sick.\nI was very happy to go there but my wife was very sick. The island in between\nShannon and -- Iceland, then Canada and down the coast.\n23",
        "A: Quite an airplane trip, took us quite a while, almost five days. How many days\ndid we take from Frankfurt to the United States? (Wife\u2019s voice from background).\nThree days. We were so sick. Stopped in Ireland, Shannon. Then Iceland too,\nthen Canada someplace, I forget where. I remember that plane I tell you. (More\ninfo from wife). I don\u2019t know what he did, he didn\u2019t do anything like that. I wrote\nthat thing down. He went to college, life experiences. This was the first flight.\nPeople took flights before that. At that time it was sweet territory and it still is,\nsweet territory. Went just say-so, not having a piece of paper, nothing. Here of\ncourse were my uncle and aunt in Queens. They came to La Guardia, that\u2019s\nwhere we landed, La Guardia. That\u2019s where I kissed the ground. I tell you it was\n. Not only that, was just wonderful being there, just the first few days.\nHector\u2019s New York! Saw this plate of ice cream and cake and stuff, all over,\nunbelievable. We just hadn\u2019t seen this kind of stuff never.",
        "A: No. Was not really Jewish neighborhood, but was mixed. I know that our doctor\nwas Dr. Hirsch and he lived across the street about two blocks away.",
        "A: No. My father, I know that he did my finger. I had a BB gun and shot my finger\nwith the BB gun. My father took the bullet out, it kind of hurt. No, the doctor\ndoesn\u2019t treat his own. My sister, my brother, they always went to somebody else\nbut I had a very happy childhood. But I did know my father liked dogs. The dogs\nthat my father liked were very large dogs. I was about 8 years old, maybe 7 years\nand I was given a dog to walk around. He didn\u2019t walk, he took off and had me on\nthe leash for the longest time and I finally got him to arrest. Somebody arrested\nthe dog, I don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t take it any more. Somebody who knew the dog\nstopped him.",
        "A: Our family\u2019s dog yes, our family\u2019s dog. It was very big.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Much too big.",

        "A: Caesar, that was his name. I don\u2019t think that he had such a big dog after that.\nDidn\u2019t have a dog at all after that incident. I was very sick and tired of dogs for\nthe rest of my life. I just don\u2019t like dogs, that\u2019s all. It was a very, very good\nliving in Heidelberg. My father was very respected. I was well liked too, I guess.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: It was just something I enjoyed. I also remember that later on when I was in\nHolland, my father and that German violinist, oh my head is very bad, my head 1s\nvery bad. Honey, maybe you remember the German violinist my father and I\nwent to see in Amsterdam from The Hague in Amsterdam. He is a very famous\nGerman violinist who also wrote a lot of tunes. Not , Kreistler.",
        "A: No, he was not. He played in Holland. He was visiting in Holland. My father\ntook me to that and I will never forget that. My father took me once to the opera\nin Germany. Isn\u2019t that something, everything I remember but not Mozart\u2019s opera.\nI know its opera. I mentioned it many times to you but I don\u2019t remember it. He\ntook me to that I just remember the \u2014 I know that I went to the opera just when I\nwas about 10 or 11 years old.",
        "A: Me and my father and my brother.",

        "A: Right in the city, yes. Mozart, no, no, M . The Abduction of ;\nThat\u2019s what I saw first. It was very impressionable. I was then 11 years old and\nwas very much impressed and I also was in a castle in Heidelberg. My sister was\n25\none of the -- Dorothy, she was Puck in -- no, that was something different. That\nwas the wedding of my sister. Anyway my sister was going to a castle in\nGermany at which I was not entitled to go and I was completely disappointed.\nShe played Puck at that time when she was 12 and I must have been 8 or 9 at that\ntime. I guess after 10, you can go, before 10, no.",
        "A: Not very much. Really that town was not very anti-Semitic. I know that some\npeople that I know then were very anti-Jewish but I avoided them. I was 12 years\nold. Heidelberg was a university town.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Was in Berlin. My father was in Berlin first, that\u2019s where he got his girlfriend,\nyou know.",
        "A: It was very nice, very nice. I can\u2019t complain to anybody that people didn\u2019t like\nus. I know that we went -- I was swimming in Heidelberg. As a matter of fact,\none thing I do remember 1s that I was excluded from the swimming club in\nHeidelberg, was excluded from swimming in November, October, 1932 because I\nwas Jewish, yes",
        "A: Yes, the city swimming pool. Maybe my father said to me, we shouldn\u2019t go there\nor something like that. I was very good at that. I was training for a lot more.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. That was a very good time for me. In the summer I went to\nand in the winter I went to the swimming pool. I was very good at that, very\ngood. I just had a wonderful life.",
        "A: Not much, no.\n26",
        "A: Pretty much went to school and I read everything under the sun. Anything I could\nget my hands on, everything. As a matter of fact, we had private watchmen,\nsecurity man, always came by and noticed that I was always . Lisien, he\ninherited it from my grandfather. Sure absolutely.",

        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s my grandmother, yes. The brooch she had, they all diamonds from\nthat one brooch, they all diamonds. Was a lot too in Toronto. Oh, yes, they were\nbut not me.",
        "A: Paper and paper products. They were extremely well off at that time. They had a\nfactory somewhere, I don\u2019t know where. My mother had a piece of land in East\nBerlin. Still trying to get money out of it but we can\u2019t. I think that they are not\ngoing to give it. I know that you were also well off. Oh, yes, they had land in\nBrazil, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: My mother, my mother\u2019s parents. They had land the size of New Jersey. Brazil\nand they never got it because the people wanted land. This is where you invested\nsomething in another country say from -- say Berlin. You invested something in\nanother country, you bought land, territory. They said the size of New Jersey.\nIt\u2019s too late, too late.",
        "A: Yes, I remember my father\u2019s.\n27",
        "A: No, my father\u2019s father was in . A town not very far from Heidelberg\nabout 110 kilometers, that\u2019s about 60, 65 miles, something like that. I remember\nhim and I also remember the calf\u2019s knuckles. Tried the calf\u2019s knuckles, my\ngrandfather gave me the calf\u2019s knuckles and made me-------. I tried to eat it; I\ncouldn\u2019t get the stuff down, no way. I went to bed, had no supper. I must have\nbeen 6 or 7. As a matter of fact, I didn\u2019t like oysters for that matter. That was\nwhen I was 19 2. I was in New Orleans. In France you start at age 20. You are\nin the army at age 20 to age 50. I was still -- in 1957. I was still in the reserves. I\nwas 37 years old. Absolutely, hey, I got a letter from the Consulate. I was\nsupposed to go --. As a matter of fact, you never get rid of the French nationality,\nyou have this for the rest of your life. But not when it comes to pay money which\nI saw the other day because when I applied for my pension, they didn\u2019t want to\ngive it to me. French Legion of Honor, very good, but that\u2019s my brother, not\nmyself.",
        "A: Not only did I not go but I was forbidden to go there. I was only 12 years old\nthen. My brother who then was already a student in medicine, that\u2019s Henry. He\nwas a brother in Germany, did his studies in Germany, in Hague and in Paris.\nNow he\u2019s something else. But you see this was a wonderful time at that time, it\nwas interrupted by this presence of war, was very bad, very bad. Just\nbarbed wire always. Barbed wire out of the ground shipped it to\nRussia.",
        "A: On the spools, yes. One guy who knew how to put exactly on there; I don\u2019t know\nwhat he was. He was not trained in the military, Iam sure. But he knew how to\nput the barbed wire on spools, knew how to train the men. One guy I was just the\nturner of -- pull the barbed wire out of the ground and after I was tying the next\none. That was the worst time, that was the worst time.",
        "A: Oh, yes.\nDo you think you know about how far inland the interior was?",
        "A: It probably was bombed because we were not in the outside of the hospital. The\nhospital could not be penetrated by the bombs. This I can\u2019t understand because\ntoday you can make bombs that can penetrate anything but at that time, the bombs\njust went up to about the ground floor. Everything on the ground stayed pretty\n28\nwell. There were approximately in that house probably a hundred prisoners of\nwar and about 20 nurses.",
        "A: It was at the time when American troops were very close and I was just being held\nthere.",
        "A: Always. Can\u2019t help that, Germany under guard, always. You have to be always,\nyou always have to watch. The German guards understand what you were talking\nabout even if you\u2019re talking in different languages. Even if you\u2019re talking English\nor French or whatever in the camp and in the hospital. G-d help us, that\u2019s what\nthe ladies said when the bombs were falling.",
        "A: One day and two days, took a few days for the Americans to arrive, took about\nfour days and then they came. I thought I was somebody and I went out and I\nopened my arms, here you are guys. They didn\u2019t think that, they put their rifles in\nmy stomach. They said who are you?",
        "A: English. French and English. I remember that in Germany already I had French,\nEnglish, Latin and Greek in high school. That was part of our curriculum. Greek,\nI wasn\u2019t very good at, Latin I was okay. In French I don\u2019t think so and English\nneither but in Latin I was pretty good. I remember I had my marks sent back to\nme, pretty poor. I did this in the United States, I finally went to college, City\nCollege and I graduated cum laude there. At that time you see, I didn\u2019t study for\nnothing. I was 26 when I got here, 27. First my wife came, we were organized\nthere. My boss said you have to go to school. I have to first do my high school\nbecause I wasn\u2019t with high school yet. I went to high school and what is the\nteacher that taught me high school English? In New Jersey. Prepared me for high\nschool diploma. I didn\u2019t have much from Germany. Prepared me very well\nbecause I had no problems I didn\u2019t have money enough to -- so I dropped out.\nWe couldn\u2019t pay, we dropped out because we couldn\u2019t pay. The college suggest\nthat we move to New York State so that I could go to City College. That\u2019s right\nin 1948. So we were forced to move to New York. Lived in Astoria,\nmatriculated right away in college.. Yes, not only that the professor of music in\ncollege, his name was Brunswic. Said you\u2019re joking, says I\u2019m not. Okay.\nEnd of Tape 2.\n29\n30\n"
