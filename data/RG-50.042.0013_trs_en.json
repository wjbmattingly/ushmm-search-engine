        "I want you to describe for me how you survived the inhuman treatment at Sachsenhausen and how\nyou resisted it. What were some of the things that happened and how you resisted it.",
        "Uh, I arrived at Sachsenhausen the beginning October 1939, and I have to go a little back in time\nbecause I was the only Jew who came with this transport from Vienna, and how do I get to Vienna?\nAfter 10 days serving in the Polish army and retreating, there was no other way we couldn\u2019t resist\nthe powerful German army. We woke up one day, and we're facing two fronts, enemies, in front of\nus in the East the Russians, and the back of us uh Germans. We did not know what to do and our\ncolonel said we should wait, he is going for new orders. He never returned, and actually I waiting\nup today for him to find him. And we had no other choice just to dissolve the formation, the\nbattalion, and we told the soldiers they can where they want to. I got in the little town, there was a\nlittle village. I bought a civilian suit, throw all my identifications away, and uh, I decided I'm going\nback towards the Germans. Not because I love the Germans, but I want to see what's happened to\nmy family, to my parents and to my sister and brother. All other officers, we went the other way,\nEast or give up to the Russians, and of all those peo--officers, there's not one alive because they all\nwere killed in --------- by the Russians. So, going actually the wrong way, the only one I am the\nsurvivor. I survived. I came home, the, my parents still lived in their apt, and uh naturally most of\nthe Jews were gone, they escaped. Most went to towards Russia, and uh, then all of the sudden, I\nhear from my former boss in the pharmacy where I worked in Taranovitz, Taranofsky Gorde. He\nin the meantime bought the phar-a pharmacy in Auschwitz, and when he heard that I'm alive, he\ncalled me I should come to see him, and I came there, he was very happy to see me, and he\nexplained to me, \"Sig, you have to help me because I don't speak German, and here the military, I\nhave to supply the hospital military sup--uh, uh, military hospital and I cannot talk to them.\" So I\nsaid, \"Fine okay, but you have to go to the Commandant of the city and ask for a pass, otherwise\nyou cannot come from Silesia, from Katuvitza, to Auschwitz.\" Auschwitz belonged to the state of\nKrakow, and Katuvitza belonged to the state of Silesia, so we needed a pass. I went there to the\nCommandant in the office and uh asked me what I want, I said, \"I want to see the commandant.\"\n\"For what reason?\" I explained to them, and after a while I was called in, an older, older man in\nuniform was sitting, but I reco-recognized right away, on his epaulets here he is a doctor, medical.\nAnd uh, he ask me my name, and he said, \"What is your name?\" And I repeat it. He said, \"You\nhave--Is your father still alive?\" I said, \"Yes.\" \"What is his name, first name?\" And I told him,\n\"Leopold.\" So he smiles, and says, \"You know, I know your father since 1914. He came to sub-\ncommission to Breslau. Is now Rosnau, Poland, in order to be uh taken to the Austrian army, and\nhe asked me where's my father, and, and what I want. Well, I explained to him that I'm being here\nin the pharmacy I work, that he gave a, a pass, but I travelled about maybe 10 days from Katuvitza\nto Auschwitz, but then I was in Katuvitza in the morning, I went for supply, medical supply and\ntook it to Auschwitz, and one night, I wanted to uh go home, I come to the station, I go in this, in\nthe train, and there coming 2 SS officers, and controlling, and asking if there are Jews. I said, \"Yes,\nI am a Jew.\" And, I show him the pass, and they tore apart pass and they throw me out. I stayed",
        "overnight in Auschwitz, and the next day I went again to the Commandant, he was very angry that\nthey tore his permi-permit, and he gave me one uh much clearer saying that I am a necessity there\nand I bring the medications. Next day, in the evening, same day the evening, they did the same.\nThey threw me out. So, I said, \"Doesn't make sense anymore.\" I didn't go back to Auschwitz. I\nwalked to the border station in the evening, and I caught on the border station the train back home\nto Katuvitza, and I didn't go anymore. About two weeks later, the Germans started to register all\nJews, Jewish men from 18 to uh 45. What's happened? Oh you will go to work for us. Didn't s-\nsay where or nothing, but on a certain day we're supposed to be at the train station and we will\nleave. And I had friends still there and we discussed it what to do and I decided, I am not going.\nI'm running away. And a friend of mines who wanted to go with me, we decided we're not going,\nand two days before the transport supposed to take place, we took a train to Boyton, this was, now\nit's Poland, and from there we took a train to Vienna, and from Vienna to the Yugoslavian border. I\nhad a map and I knew already where to go, where to get off. We came to the border, that were full\nof military, but nobody bothered us. Nobody, no police, no military, and right by the train, there\nwas a small road up into the mountains. We went up to the mountains, we walked all night, and we\nsaw already at night the border downstairs between German and the Austria and the Yugoslavia,\nand we knew already we are now in Yugoslavia. And all of the sudden, a, a soldier, Yugoslavian\nsoldier, halt, stop, \"Who are you, where are you going?\" Well, we explained to them in Polish, that\nwe are Polish officers, and we want to get the, get out of Germany. He took us down to the border\nstation, and uh officer took a testimony from us, and, and said, \"What do you want to do?\" \"Well,\nwe want to go to France to join the Polish legion.\" But we had in mind actually go to Palestine,\nand he said, \"Oh, sure, you can go but you need uh passports, a visa. Well, the Polish Council is\nstill in Zagrip, go there and you get your passports and then you can do what you want to. But in\norder to go there, he gave us a sergeant, a soldier to -----------. The Russian army, Yugoslavian\narmy, to take us to the station. This was just two minutes away because we were on the border, and\nthis soldier was a German spy, a Korwat?? And he instead to take us to the station, he handed us\nover to the Germans, and he said, \"Here are two from our people.\" They took us in, they treated us\nvery well, and uh after a couple days being in ------------1n jail, they took us to Grodz. It's a larger\ncity, and there we were about, I would say maybe two weeks in that, in jail. Again they treated us\nvery well, and naturally they found out right away, who we are, we are not only polish officers, but\nwe are Jews, and active Zionists, so they didn't ask any question when they transported first me to\nVienna. In Vienna stood overnight in uh jail, and in the morning, they picked us up, took us to the\ntrain station, and up to overnight to Berlin. In Berlin, there were, there were trucks waiting for us,\nand uh took us, took us to Sachsenhausen. So this was actually the beginning, and uh came to\nSachsenhausen with me about 25 to 30 civilians, elderly men, very well-dressed.\nOkay, let's stop, we have to reload.\nI can't do all the chronological details of your story, and I know all those details, so that if I need to\nlead into a story, I can do that-------------\nBeep.\nI want to know how you resisted the inhuman treatment at Sachsenhausen, what some of the things\nthat happened were and how you survived it, what you decided to do.",
        "Uh, when I came to Sachsenhausen, I was taken by an SS man to the barracks, to the Jewish\nbarracks, there were four, consisting of four barracks, a Jewish camp, which was in the main camp,\nbut separated. And, uh, then naturally, when I came in, people surrounded me, prisoners. Uh\nasked question from where, and uh what did I do, and I told them, I am a polish Jew, I was caught\non the border, and brought in. All other inmates who were there already, about I would say twelve,\ntwelve hundred, they were Polish Jews mostly, but living in Germany. So, I, when I came there\nwas the first, not only Jew from Poland, but the first Pole. There was no other Pole here in\nSachsenhausen. I was the first one. Uh, I got friendly with the, naturally with uh my inmates, and\nuh, they told me where I am and then what the conditions we lived, and how they treat us, and they\nslowly prepared me for all those misdeeds which were done to us, and uh, I remember at night, we\nspread out the straw sacks in the room in order to, to rest. There were two, sometimes three on one\nstraw sack, uh together, and we were so crowded, we didn't dare even at night say, to use uh, uh the\ntoilet. Because we were afraid when we came to come back, there were nowhere to, to lay down.\nOnce it's happened, you had to sit on the side somewhere in the corner, and to, to wait till the\nmorning comes and to get up, and uh, about treatments, in the beginning, they didn't treat us special\nhard, but since there was no work, they had to do something with us, so right in the morning after\nwe got the coffee. They called it coffee, it was a black hot water, we were taken in front of the\nbarracks, and we had to sit down in a crouching position, and you have to remember it was already\nwinter in November, it was very cold, and we couldn't move. They noticed that somebody wanted\nto change the position, one leg to another one or something, they went in and beat them up, but\nthey were sometimes killing too. Uh, we were sitting, some people for instance got a hold of a s-\nempty cement bag, and they put it under their shirt, uh in the back in order to get a little warmer, to\nprotect, be protected by the uh, from the cold. But when they noticed that they just killed this\nperson. And naturally???? by this condi--in this condition, lay--standing there or sitting there in\nthis position from the morning till about noon, our hands, fingers were frozen, the toes, and people\ndied even froze to death. And the next morning when the SS man came to take a report, he never\nasked how many people, he asked first how many dead? This was, he was, this was more\nimportant for him to know how many dead because the dead people, the bodies we had to lay next\nto us in order to be counted, and uh, give the report, and then we were interrupted, we got food.\nWe did not go in to consume the, the, the lunch, we called the ------------. In German, in Europe, it\nis dinner, at uh -----------noontime, and we got a fairly, in comparison to later on, we got a fairly\nwell nutrition food. We got the soup, uh sometimes we count a piece of meat. We got fish soups,\nwe got uh beans or pea soup, and uh, this was all, but it was sufficient. First of all, we didn't work.\nLater on, I would say it got even better with the food, because the way they occupied the countries\nfrom one country to another one, we recognized right away where they are. We didn't get\ninformation. We didn't have papers, nothing, we didn't know what's going on. But according to the\nfood, ----------all of the sudden, they served us butter. This is, we know, they're in Denmark,\nsomething. All of the sudden, we got the asparagus! That must be Belgium or Holland, and uh this\nwent on, and we did not know what's going on at all. Nobody told us that there are pictorials of\nthe, their being beaten. We didn't know from nothing. From nothing. And this way, by coming\nout every morning with the sitting there and the crouching position, this went on about January.\nNothing else to do. Nothing else. All of the sudden in January we were called out, we're going to\nwork. They gave us coats, naturally the striped coats, and we marched out. I would say about 25\nto 30 minutes of march, when we came to an empty huge field. And we found out we are going to\nbuild a factory. A red brick factory. Naturally we had to start with the ground moving. It was\nextremely hard because it was all frozen. And, it was very hard work, but it was not the worst. The",
        "worst were the treatments around us. They did not let us work. They beat us up, they chased us\naround. Uh, people were overrun by the little uh cars filled with, with uh earth, with sand or\nsomething. Were just overrun. And they did everything possible just to hurt us and naturally a lot\nof people passed away. Or they were shot or they killed when somebody couldn't work anymore,\ndropped, so they shot him. And on the evening when we had to the job, we had to carry the dead,\nthe dead ones , the bodies in to the camp back to be counted, and naturally to uh be buried. Uh one\nday, it was maybe uh, yes in February, we marched out, and the order was not to talk. We couldn't\ntalk, was not allowed to talk to each other, to the neighbors, when we marched and not to look\naround, because when you looked around they were allowed to shot us. They said, he wanted to\nescape. Well, they did it quite often, because for everyone that was shot under the pretext that he\nwanted to escape, the SS man got a week furlough, so they make a big business out of it, but it was\ntoo much already, and then they got the order not to do it anymore. For instance it, they took your\nhead ge--head wear, and threw it on the side. Go for it. When you went for it, they shot you. And\none day, we marching, and I feel I am observed. But I didn't dare to look on the side who it is, and\nhere the SS man comes closer to me, and say, said in Polish, \"Sig, what are you doing here? You\ncouldn't get away?\" And I turn around, it is a friend from high school. He was a German, and was\ninducted into the SS. From that time on, when he was on duty and marched with us, and guarded\nus, he always left me on a certain place a piece of bread, and this was part of my survival. All of\nthe sudden, he disappeared. And we walked, we walked, we marched every day, and less and less\npeople survived. They just couldn't take it. They were for instance very pious Jews, who refused\nto eat the sausage or the butter, so they lived only on the bread and on the coffee. How long can\nyou live? They, they, they just went very fast. And outside it got harder and harder, and one day, I\ngot to talk to a German prisoner, young fellow, he was a communist, for this reason he was taken to\nthe camp, given to the camp. And he was in charge of the uh group, uh the carp--carpentry group.\nIt's a carpenter group, and uh I talked to him, and he ask question, \"What's going on?\" I said, \"Oh,\nit's very bad. I don't know how long we can make it because it's, it's too bad.\"\nWe have to reload.\nBeep.\nBeep.\nSS\nAfter the sitting in the crouching position, and it got warmer, we had another method. They chased\nus around these 4 blocks. We had to run. About every corner, there was an SS man and hit the\npeople who passed. And we stronger ones, I would say younger ones, we tried to protect the older\nones. When they actually went, had a mind to get rid of the older ones. So, when they started to\nhit, we run under it, and protected the older, the older men, and we got hit. We did it on purpose to\nsave the people. And uh, but how long could we take. We, we, we became weaker and weaker\ntoo. So, and then in the meantime the older ones were mostly gone. The, the, there is the statistics\nsay that uh the prisoner in a concentration camp's life span is not longer about 3 to 6 months. But\nwhen you survive, and you're lucky, you can survive in general. So, this was one of the resistance.\nWhen we came in the evening back when the food was given out, the hard food, no, the evening in\nSachsenhausen we got a piece of bread, a quarter of one bread, and uh a piece of margarine or a, a",
        "piece of sausage, and this was exchanged again. The religious ones they didn't want to eat the\nsausage, So we exchanged it with a piece of bread, or sometimes uh, uh we got uh what was it, yeah\nwe exchanged it, so they can eat it. And later on, at night for instance, we laid down, and we were\nhappy we can rest, but they didn't let us rest at night either. They came through the windows,\nthrough the doors with water hoses, wetted us, jumped over us, stepped on us, want to, this way\nthey killed again. I don't know the reasons, sometimes we thought, oh, there 1s maybe a victory\nbecause they got drunk, and they came and did what they wanted with us. When they maybe uh,\nuh were beaten on the Russian front, so they lets their anger out on us ---------, but there were so\nmany methods. At random for instance SS man picks somebody out, hit him in his face. Just\nthrow me once, maybe took the first one or the second hit, the third hit, or but this, he got more\nfurious that you resisted. So he pushed you down, and all he did with his boots, with his leg,\nstepped on your throat, and killed you this way, so we knew already, when he hit you, the first\nsecond time, drop, so he was happy that you dropped. But it's again, this was part of the resistance.\nThis is saved us of our life.\nLet's just cut and wait for this plane.\nBeep.\n-----------specific experience that happened at--------------- where uh the politics inside the camp\nactually ended up being a threat, so just describe to me that incident, how it happened, what...\nAfter being about uh two years in Sachsenhausen, we were 400 selected Jews s-uh, being\ntransported to Gross Rosen. Naturally, we don't know what's happened, where we go or nothing till\nwe arrive. And when we came there, they didn't even let us into the camp. In front of the camp,\nthey right away made us work, digging the, uh, I mean, working at, at the ground and was\nextremely hard was, was all granite, and not only working again, there was uh not a commandant,\nthe leader of the SS with a very infamous man, rude man, young and even small man, not strong at\nall, but he had a dog. He never was without the dog. And he, the dog attacked the people, and we\nwere just flabbergasted, we didn't know what's happened. After two years in, in another camp, you\nalready get used to it, you know how to adjust yourself, but here you come brand new, and they\nstart all over again, but much worse. There was a new camp consisted only in the beginning of six\nblocks, barracks, and at night we were taken to our barrack, and this was our barrack for the whole\nyear, and the conditions were there much worse than in Sachsenhausen. During the day, we had to\nmarch to the stone quarry, I would say maybe twenty minutes away, and it was in a mountainous\nuh terrain, and uh, there they had to work, we had to work in this, this quarry carrying the heavy\nrocks, (cough cough), and uh people died like flies. On the way back, we had to everyone carry\none big rock on our shoulders to the camp because coming home, I mean to the barracks through\nthe camp after the report, counting how many people are left, or how many the, the same amount of\npeople is coming back who went out of the camp, they said, \"All go back to the camp, to the\nbarracks, but the Jews remain.\" And we had to continue to build the camp till 12 0 clock at night.\nSo, oh we got food. When we came to the barracks, we were so tired, that we just didn't have any\nappetite. We fall asleep. And in the morning, 5, 6 0 clock right away, up and again the same thing,\nand there were naturally first of all I want to mention the first half a year we didn't have no water at\nall. We couldn't wash ourselves, and uh, soap we had, so when we left in the morning a little\ncoffee so we just washed ourselves on the face and this was all. Our underwear we never changed",
        "in six months, and pretty soon a epidemic broke out, a typhoid epidemic because our uh undershirt\nwas jut infected of lice.\nWe have to get to the politics, we have to get that or we're going to run out of film.\nAnd uh one day, I'm in the part, in part A of the, the barrack and uh the assistant of my blockeldest\ncomes to my part of the barrack, and tells the blockeldest that he wants me -------------- of lice.\nYou have to get to the politics and the, we have to get to that or we're going to run out of film.\nOne day, I'm in the part, in Part A of the barrack, and the assistant of my blockeldest comes to my\npart of the barrack, and tells the blockeldest that he wants me in his part, in, in Part B to stay with\nhim, and uh, my Blockeldest had nothing against it, he said, \"Fine, okay,\" and I transferred. But I\nheard somebody saying, \"Sig, be careful because he wants to finish you off tonight.\" I said,\n\"Why?\" \"There are rumors that you accused him of smuggling uh drugs.\" I had no idea, so I said,\n\"Please go in the other part, and tell my friend what's happened, and he should go and to see the\ndoorman, the gate man,\" because he was a friend of my from Sachsenhausen, this was one who was\nin charge of the carpentry, and he was transferred before we were transferred , and he became there\nthe gate uh you call it a runner. And my friend went to him, he went to the uh camp oldest, he was\na German, a criminal, and he told him about what's happened. He came to the barrack, and told my\nblockeldest, you transfer just this man from your room, I want him to be transferred to you and you\nare responsible for him. And I was retransferred the same time, before the night started.\nTransferred there, and the following day, the, the assistant, the blockeldest, the, the blockeldest, he\nwas a Pole, a Pole from Silesia. He spoke very weak German, very weak Polish, a mixture, and\nthey took him to the hospital, they gave him a shot and they, they finished him up because he was a\ndenouncer too. He denounced to the SS to the Germans what's going on with the camp. This was\npolitics. I had no idea, it never came to my mind, accusing somebody of smuggling drugs, we\ndidn't have no idea what drugs mean because we couldn't go to hospital.\nOkay, we have to reload.\nYeah, I forget myself, you know I have ----------.\nChange film, Camera roll 4 1s up; Sync take 5 1s up.\nBeep.\nI want you to just tell me about specific incidents of resistance that you did or that you witnessed in\nAuschwitz.\nAfter a year being in Gross Rosen, again, we were sent on a transport. And I wanted to mention\nthat out of this 400 who had previously, here had previously came from Auschwitz ---------to Gross\nRosen, 17 of us were alive from this 400. And again, transports a day, in a train a few hours, and\nhere we arrived in Auschwitz. We did not know that in Auschwitz there is a camp, not at all. And\nwe arrived in the camp, in the main camp, we were quarantined in Block 11, and as you know,\nbetween Block 11 and 10 there was the Death uh place, and uh, it was, we couldn't see anything,",
        "we heard only shooting. We couldn't see because it the windows were covered with iron uh shades.\nThey lef-left us alone the first time they, they -----------us in Auschwitz because in other camps we\nhad numbers what we're going -----------------. And uh, we stayed about ten days there, then they\nformed a transport again, and about, I would say 1,200 of us who came to Auschwitz from all parts\nof Germany, from all camps, it was right after the Final Solution. And, as you know, final solution\nmeans all Jews should be killed. We were from all camps from Germany brought the Jews,\nremaining Jews to Auschwitz, and here all of the sudden, they made a change. The war went on,\nthey lost Stalingrad, they had to retreat, and they needed manpower. So, they came to the idea,\nwhy should we kill them all. We leave the people who are able to work alive, and let them work\nand then they're through when they cannot do it anymore, then we have time to kill them, so we\nwent marched about every 5, 5 miles, no 5 kilometers, maybe 2 to 3 miles, and we ended up in\nBuna, Auschwitz, this is Auschwitz 3. This was a labor camp, it is a concentration camp, but not a\ndeath camp. We had no crematoritums, we had no gas chambers. The sick people were sent,\ntransported to the main camp or to moved to uh Birkenau, this was Auschwitz too. This was a\nstrictly death uh camp of destruction, a death camp. When we came there, in the beginning, they\nasked us our profession. I gave my profession, I'm a pharmacist, and next day they decide to send\nme to go to work to the hospital. Came to the hospital, there were naturally people already working\nand since there was no pharmacy, they put me into the internal uh disease dept. as a male nurse.\nAnd, after a while, they made me in charge of the male nu--of the the this uh department of the\nInternal Disease, and there were doctors from all countries, famous doctors, professors from\nFrance, from uh Rumania, from uh Hungary, from Czechoslovakia, from all over, from Poland, and\nwe naturally took care the best we could of the sick people. And here again, what to do with those\nsick people of pneumonia, or pleuritis. Medications we didn't have. Once in a while the\nadministrator, a sergeant, came and left in a room, 12 sulfa, sulfa tablets, and 12 tablets it's enough\nfor one person a day, but when I have 30, 35 people laying in a room, whom do I give it first? So,\nwe consulted with the doctor. What do you think? Whom shall we give it? And we decided to\ngive it to the youngest who has the biggest chance to survive. Sometimes we had 3 and 4 and we\nwould like to save them, so I was on very good terms with the administrator. He was sergeant, he\ndidn't care much what's going on, he ate his apple, or smoke a cigarette, and walked around in the\nhospital, but never interfered for nothing, didn't beat anybody, nothing. And uh we got to know\neach other, and I went to him once said uh, \"Norbert, we need more tablets.\" He never said no or\nyes. For this question alone he could take the gun and shoot me. He didn't never say anything. He\nwalked out of the camp, and after an hour, he came back and I found another bunch of pills, on the\non the on the table, and this way we could s-save more people, or sometimes when he brought from\nthe main camp, from the hospital, material, medi-medications for the SS hospital, which was not\nus, was outside, he took me out in order to put everything away where it belongs, to put it in order,\nand at the gate naturally asking where do you go with it? Oh, I take him out because he's a\npharmacist, and he put everything in order for me. Naturally, I took advantage all of it. I put medi,\nmedications as much as I could, and brought it back, but when I knew in front it's a gate, there is a\nman who will pursue, an SS man who will search me, I left 1t there, and later on he brought it back.\nSo, it was a to our advantage, and naturally we were able to save more people. When it came to\nthe selections, we did not have a steady SS doctor in our camp. We were all in Auschwitz 1, and\nwhen the selection took place by us, I would say every 7 to 10 days, different doctors were\nassigned to come to different camps and make the selections. There came different doctors,\nbecause only that, only one at the selection, and naturally, Mengele was, I recall about 5 to 6 times,\nduring the time when the selections were made, and uh before the selections, I was already",
        "transferred from the, from the camp, from the hospital to the reeducation camp. As I told you\nbefore, I don't know why I was selected. I assume because of my lang--knowledge of languages.\nBecause the reeducation in camp was not uh occupied by regular sur-uh prisoners like we were\nsentenced forever, because we had no hope or how long uh, there was no timetable for us. You\nstay there, when you die it's fine. Who knows what will be later. But those were prisoners who\nworked in the Germ-in Germany as forced laborers from all occupied countries. And they worked\nin the ----------farm industry, in the factory which we built from scratch in Auschwitz, in Buna.\nAnd they came for different crimes they committed. They overlapped the time coming, returning\nfrom va-from vaction, from furlough or they uh didn't show up at work , or they run away from\nwork, and I have to take care of them. And, in charge of this camp was not the SS, but the political,\nthe Gestapo of this special camp. Well, this camp was in our camp, but separated, about 5\nbarracks, and I was in charge of it. And uh, the SS man from the Gestapo came every 2nd day,\nevery 3rd day to inspect it, and I gave him the report, he looked around. But I got to know him\nbetter. And older man, he came then every day to me, and we had lunch together, in my camp. So\nthe SS man from outside actually came to me just for chat. Every day. And I served him, I have to\nsay, in this camp in Auschwitz, I never ate from the kitchen, from the, from the from the prisoner\nkitchen----\nWe have to reload.\nI had to organize, I knew how to organize. I went to the uh kitchen, I told the, the cooks, listen uh,\nI have young people here. They need to eat.\nOkay wait.\nGive me more. Yeah. Oh, we're reloading.\nBeep.\n------------how the camp was governed. What a kapo was what a blockeldester was.\nYou know, I would like to finish up the resistance, will take a few minutes.\nOkay.\nThis man came to me daily, and we got to talk to naturally, we didn't, he was a very simple man,\nnot, no education, I don't know if he finished even uh, uh elementary school. And one day I ask\nhim, \"Mr. Vicolek, from where are you?\" He said, \"Oh I am from Silesia.\" I said, \"You don't have\nto tell me that you're from Silesia, according to your language, the way you speak, I know right\naway. But from what city?\" \"Oh, I'm from Tarnovitz.\" I said, \"What? I'm from Tarnovitz.\"\n\"What is your name?\" \"Halbreich.\" \"Where did you work?\" He said, \"Oh, I was a baker.\" \"In\nwhich bakery?\" He gave me the name, and I said, \"You know, when we were students, every\nmorning, my, my our mother sends us for the, the fresh baked goods,\" in his bakery, so we got\ncloser and closer and uh one day he comes he said, \"You know, I think tomorrow the doctor is\ncoming to make the selection because we never knew when he's coming. So that was enough for\nme. As soon as he left, I went to the hospital to my friends, well, I was there daily anyhow. I said,",
        "\"Listen, tonight release all the young people who are able to work for one night.\" So they released\nthem. Next morning they went to work. And when it came to the selection, the doctor came, he\nhad in front of him, all this 120, 130 people and he selected. So this way, we were able to save at\nleast a few young people. But between the 120, all of the sudden we see some young people there\ntoo, who could survive when they would stay maybe a day, couple days, three days longer in the\nhospital. So, I, I, the adm, the administrator, the sergeant, had to take the numbers of the people\nwhom the doctor designated to go to the gas chamber. So I went again to him, I said, \"Norbert,\nbetween those people, I have sent three young people, a cousin of mine, or a relative or a friend's\nson, cross him out.\" He crosses him out. So instead 120, there were only 119, 118, but he couldn't\ncross out everyone, you know. But at least we saved, this was our resistance. Now it comes to\ntransport them. The trucks came, and we were loaded those people on the trucks to go to\nBirkenau, to the gas chamber, and those people were not any more in their mind, they lost their\nminds, they were sick people who would died anyhow. But they had the strength to take off the\njacket, to take off the shoes and throw them over the truck, so other people who are still alive could\nwear it. Isn't this resistance? See, we couldn't resist uh physically. There was no way, we didn't\nhave arms. We were sick, we were uh, uh entirely without any means, but this was our resistance.\nAnd this went on and on to the end in Auschwitz. And then, Auschwitz, again was evacuated\nbecause uh the Germans were beaten, they came closer and closer. The other camps, the previous\ncamps in the east, they were in, in, where, where, they were possible, they had the chance to\ndestroy, kill the people who destroy the camps, so not to leave any trace of it to the Russians, but\nthe Russians were so close to Auschwitz, they didn't have no time anymore to kill us or to destroy\nthe camp. So, they put us on the death march. There were 65,000 people from all 39 branches in\nthe neighborhood of Auschwitz, what we had put in the march for ten days. Most of the people\nmarched partly people who had taken on trains, on open freight trains, and driven to Germany and\ntried to put them into place them in into different camps, and I ended up by train ten days by train,\nonly once we got food, and here again, I had my armband, that I'm the camp oldest of the see uh,\nwe had a good office of uh, uh reeducational camp, and I took one car and put sick people on there,\nmaybe 15 to 20, and I had uh blankets to cover them, where, on all other cars, there were people\nstanding because there were , they put in 100, 120 people, there was no place to uh, to lay down.\nBut slowly when the train went for the ten days, people just died. Simply throw the, the bodies\nover the board, in the woods or where, and they had more place later on. But only twice we s-no,\nwhenever we stopped the train to change the uh, uh the eng-engine, so people came, civilian people\ncame closer and wanted to give us food. The, the Ger-the Germans didn't let us. Especially when\nwe went through Czechoslovakia. The people ------------tried to help us. They didn't let us. But I\nwas the only one allowed get off the train. And I took water, and handed it out to the pe--so not the\ntrain was st-standing, hour, two hours sometimes, three hours, and I only handed off give, give\nwater to the prisoners. Then once during the time, they gave us food. Uh bread and sausage. What\nthey ask in every car, how many people? I said, \"I have forty.\" I had maybe 20 on there, so I got\ndouble, so I took this food, you know what was left from us, all distributed it again to friends in the\nother cars. This was resistance. And we can go on and on. Now you want, you ask me another\nquestion.",
        "Tell me about the hierarchy in the camp, what a Kapo was---",
        "You have to start from the beginning for the SS first, yeah? There was the Commandant. The\nCommandant was s-uh located at uh the main camp in Auschwitz, but since there were many",
        "branches, for instance, there were 3 main camps, Auschwitz 1, 2 and 3. There were camp leaders.\nThere were high-ranked officers too, but they were under the command of the commandant. Then\nnaturally were Sergeants and were lower-ranked SS men, who guarded want uh they have to care in\nthe, the office, and they all naturally were armed with the guns, and uh mostly they treated us very\nbad. They beat us up and they killed us and uh terrible. I have to say, there were exceptions too.\nThere were SS men, who were on duty but especially when they were by themselves, they didn't\nhurt us at all. They were there, and we could, we had a little breathing time, but when they are more\ntogether, these men had to treat us the way like the other ones. There couldn't be an exception\nbecause otherwise they would get suspicious or they would probably uh let them out of the SS,\nthese I mean, uh, he would end up in a camp. But they had to be very careful. But there were these\nkind of people. ----------------------and they take us. This was S, the SS man in the in my in\nAuschwitz in the in the hospital, this administrator, he was very good to us. Then, between the,\nthey couldn't do all these things to observe us and to guard us. Though they had in the camp, the\nCamp oldest. It was in prisoner, and mostly a German, a criminal. Sometimes there were even\npolitical, they were mostly because of communists, they were communists, who were naturally in\nGermany brought into the camps. After the, the ---------of the, after the blockeldest, there was his\nassistant, was the same thing a criminal, sometimes even a -----------------. It depends how the set-\nup in the camps was. Within different camps was a different set-up. And then were the Kapos,\nwho were responsible for the people at the uh, uh the workplaces. They marched out under his\ncommand, and the same thing, there were bad ones, mostly bad ones, and there were good ones too.\nAnd they had the assistants, but this actually was a part of the hierarchy, hierarchy, how you say--\nHierarchy.\nHierarchy.\nAll right, we're just running out. We just ran out.\nSo Kapo is below blockeldest?\nI wouldn't say below, it's entirely different.\nBeep.\nYou have talked about in the past a kind of a mental resistance, a reawakening you called it, being\nalert all the time. Can you talk to me about the importance of that in survival?\nYeah. Uh, the first three years, the two years in Sachsenhausen, one year in Gross Rosen, uh, we\nwere robots. We turned, u,h into animals. They purpose of the Germans was to not allow us to\nthink. To put up a resistance or something, and uh they just treated us really like animals, and we\nturned to animals. The sicknesses, the hunger, the starvation, you know. It leads you to uh\ndifferent thinking. You, you were just looking when uh next to you the, the person was, was laying\non half dead, so you were just looking you could get a piece of, piece of bread which he has hidden\nunder his head, you know. And uh, you were stealing from your other friend when you had the\noccasion. There were moments, you know, when we got in the piece of bread in the evening, so I\nate the whole thing at once. At least, at least I can sleep a few hours, and the other ones, they cut",
        "the bread in pieces and left two slices for the morning. They got up in the morning it was gone.\nThis was unbelievable. Unbelievable. Or, sometimes shoes. One stole from the other one the, the\nshoes because he had better shoes, you know, and uh, this really like animals acted, and the\nGermans were very happy with it because we didn't do, put up any resistance. We just did what\nthey told us to do, and then came all of the sudden the part in uh Auschwitz, when I went to\nAuschwitz, when we put into, I was put into the hospital. Here all of the sudden, you were\nprotected from the climate, from the harsh winters, from the hard summer. You're under roof, and\nyou're not controlled like outside. You do your job, you take care of sick, sick people, keep the\nroom in order, this is all. In the evening we were assigned to the ambulance because all the people\ncame during, from their, from work, returning from work, they came to the ambulance, we treated\nthem, they had different kind of wounds, were hurt or broken fingers or something, we treated them\ntoo. And uh I became a doctor sort of, I performed uh minor surgery, and the doctors who stood\nby, they said, they think you should be always a doctor, you shouldn't be just a pharmacist, and I\nhad no medical background, you know, and uh, all of the sudden, your mind opens up. You have\ntime to think. What are we doing? How long we'll be able to do it? There has to be a way to help\neach other. And I came to the idea to try to resist, to do help people to stay alive as long as\npossible. We had no other way to resist. Later on, we formed an organization, underground\norganization, the resistance, and here too, we just couldn't take anybody, just every, anybody who\ncame across. We had to be very careful. It took us months to find trustworthy people, so they\nwouldn't give it out to the to the Germans because this meant death. We helped people in escaping,\nprepared them to escape. For instance, when I became the in charge of the reeducational camp,\nthere was the man in charge. A, a, a Jew, and not, a half-Jew, his father was Jewish, his mother\nwas non-Jewish--a German Jew, but he was there, and one day in the beginning, right in the\nbeginning, he tells me, \"You know, Sig, would you like to escape?\" I said, \"No.\" \"Why?\" I said,\n\"You see, I have bigger chances to survive here, and I have a purpose to be here. I can help other\npeople. What good it is I would escape, I would be lucky, I would some in hiding, so I saved\nmyself, but what about the thousands and thousands of other ones who are suffering? And I am in\na position, I can help people, and this is the purpose I stay.\" He all of the sudden escaped. They\ncouldn't find him, and for sure, he could not stay alive because he didn't speak Polish and even\nwhen he got to the, to the forest, to the to the Polish resistance, to the AKA, he was killed because\nthey wouldn't trust him, they would thought he is a German spy. They killed him for sure. And uh,\nnext morning, I had to give out the report, how many people are alive, and who are ----------ready\nto work. The SS man comes and I noticed he was not, in the, in the barrack because he slept under\nme, I slept on top. He was gone. So, I give up the report, and he says, uh, yeah, and I said, \"One is\nmissing.\" \"Who 1s it?\" \"The blockeldest. He walked out.\" They knew already because they didn't\nknow where is the one missing. They saw the, the fence torn, and he broke through and went out.\nI was called to the Gestapo, the man in charge. Uh, ask me uh, \"How, how is this possible? The\nman escapes and you didn't know about it?\" I said, \"I noticed in the evening about ten, eleven o\nclock that he is missing, but it's really quite often he stayed in the main camp, like I for instance I\nwent to visit my, after the work I went to visit my friends, so I came late home...,\" this is all, we\nwere the only ones who were allowed to pass, because we had our bands and we were in charge of\nthe, but no other prisoner could get out, but we were allowed to go from one camp, from my camp\nto the other camp, to the main camp, and I said, \"I didn't know this, in the morning I see he, he is\ngone. And I reported it just now in the morning.\" He said, \"It's funny that you shouldn't know\nabout it.\" I said, \"Look at, I just took 4 or 5 days there. I didn't know this man at all. We hardly\nspoke, especially privately we had no time to, to talk, and at night we slept, I didn't know, I didn't",
        "know this guy.\" \"Okay.\" They sent me back, a few hours later he called me back, \"You know,\nHalbreich, I decided you will be the next uh man in charge.\" Okay, I needed help because I was in\ncharge of the ambulance in this special camp in the reeducational camp, but the other doctor friend\nof mines took my place and I was in charge of this camp. Now there are prisoners coming and\ngoing every week, other people coming, new people and other people going home back to work,\nand mostly young ones I tried to help. I got the kettle of the soup more, I got a few breads more, I\ncould help not only them but my friends in the main camp too. They came in the evening, they had\ndinner, and they gave them -------------, I organized clothes, and I helped them all over. And uh,\nthere were cases, for instance, one day uh I'm in the camp and I look around, a big Commandant\npasses, going into the main camp, and he stops me, calls me to the gate, he says uh, \"Campoldest,\nwhat's happened, how come those, those people are around here?\" I stood on attention, and I said,\n\"Commandant, I have an order from the doctor to keep the younger people in the camp and their\nperforming light work, putting the garden in the, in the order, cleaning, uh the bath, the, the toilets,\nand so forth.\" He says, \"Ha!\" and walks away. That's all. Oh, that's fine. I got away with it. Next\nday, just by coincident, the doctor passes, goes into the hospital, and he stopped me and asked me\nthe same question, and I told him, \"I got an order from the Commandant to keep the younger\npeople. See when they would get together with one word, I wouldn't be here. They would shot me\nimmediately. This is how I resistance. We dared to do things against the Germans. There is\nanother case. One day the man in charge, the Gestapo calls me to his office, he says, \"Out of the\ncamp.\" I had to get out of the camp, with the guard naturally, and he said to me, \"You know,\nHalbreich, tomorrow, we're expecting a transport, and between those people there is a man who\nkilled a prisoner. He didn't...\nWe've got to reload.\nBeep.\nCan you talk to me about how you feel or maybe don't feel that support systems, families and\nfriends, who were in the camp, helped you as a form of resistance? Among prisoners, keeping up\nfriendships or if you feel that they didn't keep up friendships.\nYou mean in the camps?\nIn the camps.\n--------in the camps. Certainly, we formed groups. There were very close knit groups. We helped\neach other. We protected each other. We cared each other, and just a little detail in Sax-in\nGrosrosen, I remember, uh my friend Jacob who was with me from the beginning, who run away\nfrom Katuvitza, was all the way with me. One day he comes and has in his fist, holds his fist, he\nsaid, \"Sig, guess what I have?\" How can you guess? So he opened his hand and he had a piece of\nuh a orange peel. Dried up a little piece of orange peel, and he broke it in half and we shared it.\nNow, and then in Gro, Sachsenhau-in Gross Rosen, in the first Christmastime, before Christmas,\nthe Germans told us we can receive packages. So, I wrote to my mother, we couldn't write yet that\ntime, in Sachsenhausen, naturally it was all censored and all the cards in German, and maybe every\n3, 4 months, we could exchange, we got mail. So I wrote to my mother that we can receive\npackages. I don't know the situation that time, you know, where they were, but uh all of the",
        "sudden, very soon, I got a package, and I was the first one who got a package. And opened it\nnaturally there was for Friday prepared like usually for Shabbat for the Saturday, you know, a\ntwist, and a cake and some chicken, fried chicken, some other things you know, and we were so\nhappy. We came from work, we opened that gave, some shared with the uh barrack oldest, the\nblockoldest, and we, we se, let down, and we sat down on our beds, and ne-next to me my friends\nand we shared it. And, next morning we were all sick, because we were not used to this kind of\nfood. We were always on this sickly diet, what we had in the camp, you know, no fat and no\nnothing, and here all of the sudden we get this, got all sick, we almost regret it. You know, and\nfrom that time on, nobody else received a package because the, the Germans confiscated\neverything. Was even the, nobody even heard that he got a package but it's confiscated, we never\nheard about that. The\nTell me about religious resistance. Was there ever religious resistance?\nYeah. Uh, I would say I come from a religious family. Not the kind orthodox family because our\npart where I lived in Silesia was belonged before to Germany. We were religious. We were\nstrictly conservative. Not orthodox. Naturally at home we had Kosher, and uh, holidays, we didn't\ngo to school. Saturday we went to school because in Poland, in Germany in Europe, Saturday was\nschool, but we didn't write on Saturday. And uh, coming to the camp, naturally, there we didn't\nhave our prayer books or other things you know to observe our religious belief, but in the morning\nwhen we got up in five o clock in the morning was dark, we put the straw sacks in the corner, we\nstacked them up high up to the ceiling, and we find maybe ten, twelve, maybe 15 people before we\nwere called out in the corner behind the straw sacks, and we prayed. Very hard, we didn't have\nanything to pray, but people were in a relig--into the religion very well-educated, and they knew it\nby heart, and we joined, but not naturally all--and there were people watching us we shouldn't get\ncaught you know because this would be death. This would meant death. And this we continued in\nuh Sachsenhausen. In Gross Rosen it was impossible to do it, but I remember very well ------------\nabout 5-1/2 years being in the camps on the holidays. We knew every holiday in spite, we didn't\nhave calendars. We knew it. But when it came to Yom Kippur, we passed it. Not all, but there\nwas a group of us, of friends. We fasted. We did not eat, in spite we get anyhow, almost nothing\nto eat, but we did not because we kept it for the evening, we went out to work, but we did not eat,\nbut in the evening when we came back, the camp, the, the blockeldest kept the food for us because\nyou know, we didn't eat, he gave us the food. The only one time I ate it was in Gross Rosen. In\nGross Rosen, it would have been death without eating even the small portions we got during, daily,\n------------portion. Then we ate there. In Auschwitz, naturally, it changed. In my barracks in the\nblock, in the, uh reeducational camp, we assembled Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, we lighted\nthe candles. There were about just 15 to 20 people, all we good friends, and we could trust each\nother, the Kapos uh, uh camp uh blockeldest uh assistants, and friends, well we assembled, and we\nprayed all day, and I, later on after the evening, I still ----------food, and I have witnesses, and\nNorbert Wollheim one of it, and there was Dr. Silver who uh is a French doctor, a wonderful\nhuman being who knew almost everything by heart, all the prayers. And there was Dr. Unikover, a\nGerman lawyer from, from Breslau, who knew by heart the whole 5 books of Moses from the\nTorah. We went, we assembled and we prayed all these days. The two years in Sachsenhausen we\ndid it. Naturally, I had again the young people, the non-Jews around the ----, and watching that the\nSS shouldn't surprise us, you know. And, this was all I arranged. So you dared you know. This\nwas only way we could survive.",
        "You talk about a secret of survival.\nThis is actually the secret of survival. There was no physical way to, to resist and to fight the\nGermans. But this was our way of??? survival. We were, we had, for instance, in Sachsenhausen,\nin Auschwitz, on Sunday when we didn't go out to work, Saturday, they had to go, I never worked\nin Auschwitz because I was always in the hospital the, the, the re-re-reeducational camp. But, it\ncame Sunday, I had gathered young Jewish people, Zionists, from Poland, from Germany all\ntogether, and we had meetings in the barracks, and I talked and I had had uh give them history\nlessons, and about the future. There were people down, they gave up, and sometimes the situation\nwas so bad that by myself I didn't believe it, but I never let the other ones feel it, know it, that I\ndon't believe. In fact, they called, this is a uh, uh a eternal uh optimist, they called me. I never\nshowed them that I am down already. I had the strength to make them believe they should hold on,\nthey should fight, that 1t will be soon over. I gave them the hope. I don't know from where. I feel\nthis is my education, my, my uh bringing up, up upbringing from home, and from school. I was\nalways, I was five years old, I was already organized in a young Zionist organization, singing uh\nHebrew songs, or going uh, uh Sunday on uh, we had trips uh on uh, uh bicycle trips, but we were\nin groups. We, I was always in a group, and it turned out from the beginning, I also became a\nleader of the groups, and this I continued in the camps. I learned it this was my upbringing from\nhome, that I had the strength to act this way, and let's face it, I do it after the war too. Iam engaged\nin organizations. I'm more away from home than at home.\nOkay, let's reload one more roll.\nBeep.\nUh, for instance, the Germans, the SS, the guards, they were trained how to treat us. I would say,\nin general, but they were never told what to do, how to do it, and naturally, they were, most of\nthem, they had, actually everyone had a special method to treat it. One uh arranged for instance uh,\nuh boxing matches. They picked out two young boys, and they had to fight, and they were later on\ngiven a piece of bread for it. They enjoyed it. Other ones like I said before, the one who hits so\nlong that you had to drop, so we found the way out, we dropped very soon, so he let us go. The\nother ones again beat us so long in his face, you know, till you had to die. And there were so many\nmethods. One day during the work in uh Sachsenhausen, they picked at random a man and said,\n\"Here, dig.\" He took the shovel, big hole, and when he was ready, they said, \"Jump in.\" Well, the\nman wanted to jump in with legs first, they said, \"Oh no, first with your head,\" and they buried him.",
        "And it was close to in the evening before we go home, so it was maybe a half an hour before, and\nthis SS man, he was satisfied with it he killed a man this way. He walked away, and we took the\nadvantage, we went and uncovered him and we took him, carried him on our shoulders into the\ncamp. We saved his life, see, there were so many other methods. They threw p-p-people in the\nopen uh, we had toilets, you know, what were the toilets consisting of a piece of wood, and they\nhad to sit, and they wat, watched you, you know, two minutes, and sometimes they went in and\npushed them into the, how you call it uh, in English, and naturally, that man was killed in this mess,\nand this is _ unbelievable, unbelievable, what's in it, you _ see. And uh--\nSo there were good people and bad people.",
        "There were good people, I mentioned before, there were good peoples who looked away, they gave\nyou the breathing time so long as they were there, but only when they were by themselves. And\nsometimes you can talk to them. See, when I was in Auschwitz, and we, our camp was specially\nguarded at night, so, I walk around and the SS man calls me, he said, \"You know Campoldest\nOlan? Soon it's all over. We are beaten, being beaten on all fronts, and uh, you, you will probably\nwill make it, you will survive. Next day, the man, you know, walks around at night, has nothing\nelse to do so he wants to start to talk. So next, uh next evening again with him, he said, \"You\nknow, I will give you a gun.\" I was surprised and stunned. I said, \"You know what? I don't need a\ngun. For what should I need a gun? It doesn't help me. One gun?\" I was afraid he wants to set me\nup, you know. No, he meant it, but I didn't accept. I didn't take the gun. So there were good ones\ntoo. But you can count them on the fingers. And the same was with the prisoners. You had good\nuh campoldests, who were reasonable, they looked a way, you know, they treated you well, and\nthere were Kapos, good ones, but the majority were bad, were bad. For instance, there was a camp\nuh like a, how you call him, who was under the campoldest, but he was in charge of the technical\npart, everything kept in order, you know, the streets cleaned and so forth. He was a German, a\ncommunist too, but he was terrible, he didn't let a prisoner pass, he had to hit him. And after the\nwar, right away after the liberation had started to work.\nLet's stop for this -----------.\nYeah.\nThat was 30 seconds of room tone with the lawnmower in background that started up a little while\nago.\nTake 11 is up.\n------------------bad ones, you were in a position, you could make a choice, okay?\nBeep.\nWell the same happens with uh, the prisoners who had responsible jobs. They uh, I would say the\nmajority, they were bad ones, and uh, I have to say, to admit even, there were some Jewish\nblockeldests who didn't behave to well. But when we found out, we called some attention to it, that\nuh, hopefully the war will be over, and uh, they will not be too well-received after the liberation,\nand uh sometimes they changed and sometimes not, and we had cases after the war where people\nwant to, to bring them to court, or they took uh care of themselves, and uh I was always against tt,\nnot to take revenge. Not only those special, but in general, I had, after the war when I was working\nwith the American War Crimes, I had occasions to take revenge on the SS, on the Germans\n(background noise), but uh, when I intended to hurt somebody, all of the sudden, my arm refused\neven to ------, and in this moment, came into my mind , \"My God, why should I hit him? When I\nhit him, I am not better than they, and I wanted to be a better human being.\" And I couldn't do it.\nAnd I have no feelings of hate, and then, especially now, it's already after 40, 50 years after the\nwar, those younger generations, they are not responsible for it, for the co-co, what the parents\ncommitted, what crimes the, the parents committed. And I tell them in German when I go to, to",
        "lecture in Germany, I tell them because they're afraid. One of the first questions, \"Do you hate the\nGermans?\" I said, \"No, I don't hate them. I have no reason to hate them.\" But you should see to it\nthat it should never happen. This is your, your responsibility. This is my way to...\nWere you under pressure when you were a blockeldest to behave differently when the SS were\naround than when they weren't around?\nUh, one time we ------------, it is very important to, I was called, I told you started by the uh uh\nman who was in charge of the Gestapo of our camp, and told me the next day uh there's a transport\ncoming, and one man killed a prisoner. He didn't say a Jewish prisoner, a prisoner. And I'm\nstanding and he said, \"Did you understand?\" \"Yes.\" See what he had in mind to take care of this\nperson. The SS they didn't like when somebody else killed somebody. They wanted to do the job\nby themselves. So this man was brought in, and when they marched in, we grouped I don't know\nmaybe 30, 40, and I ask everyone name, and why are you in, and they gave me different reasons,\nand I come to this man and I ask him, \"Why are you here?\" \"Uh, because I mishandled a prisoner.\"\nI said, \"Oh, and what did you do?\" \"I beat him up.\" \"Why?\" He didn't work. I said, \"Maybe the\nman was sick, was weak, he couldn't do it anymore.\" \"No, I don't know, but I beat him up.\" I said,\n\"That's all you did to him?\" I said, \"You know, I have different information that you killed the\nman.\" He said, \"I didn't know, I didn't know,\" in Polish. I uh, 1t came to uh, uh distributing the\nfood that afternoon, and I told the man who did give the food out, \"Give him a full,\" uh, how you\ncall it...\"A container. He give him full container. He finished, I said, \"Are you still hungry?\"\n\"Yes.\" \"Okay, I give you more.\" He took 3 times, and then I said, \"Lay down on the ground.\"\nWas outside, and start to rolled and naturally everything came out what he ate. This was my\nreaction, but the following day, I have to take all those prisoners who came in a day before to the\nhospital for checkups, and I let them know in the evening, there is this and this man who killed a\nprisoner, so the especially took care already the hospital. The following day, I sent him to work\ninside the camp, to a Kapo who was known as a killer, and I told him, \"Listen, this guy killed a, a\nprisoner.\" \"Fine.\" In the evening when they came back from work, they carried him in already, he\ncouldn't work. He couldn't walk anymore. I said, \"What's happened to you?\" \"OH, the work was\ntoo hard.\" He wouldn\u2019t admit that he got beaten. \"The work was to hard, and uh I don't feel good.\"\n\"Fine.\" Next day he went to work, he never showed up again because he took it right from the\nworking place to the hospital, where he died. The following morning, I\u2019m called to the SS. And he\nask me, \"Halbreich, what's going on in your camp? There comes a young man, a healthy man, and\nin two days he's dead. What shall I report to the authorizes in the city. And I already -----------, I\nsaid, \"You know, this man wo-worked in the coal mine. All his life underground. And here , he\nworks outside exposed to the hot sun, the hard work, he got a heart attack.\" So he breathed easier,\nhe said, \"Do you know I can report it, and report it to these authorities that he died of a heart\nattack,\" but actually he died in a different way. Another time it was the last transport coming to\nBuna before the end. A transport of 400 French Jews. It was maybe in October, 44. And we were\nwondering, how come now so late coming Jews here from, from France, so we asked them, \"Tell\nme, how did you get here?\" You know, we were in hiding, and this one gave us out.\" So he\nreported it to the French police that they are hiding so and so many, and this is the city or the uh or\nthe town, and they went and arrested them, handed them to off to the, oh, to the Germans, and the\nGermans put them on transport to Auschwitz. Now, we cannot have between us a man like this.\nSo, he went to a check-up, and he never came out of the hospital. They gave him, our doctors gave\nhim a shot and he died. We had, this was our resistance. What can you do?",
        "Thank you. Thank you very much. We need to once more record the sound of the room...\nAnother 30 seconds of room tone for previous interview.\nOkay, ready now.\nEnd room tone. End of sound roll.",
