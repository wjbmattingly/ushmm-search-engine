And eh whenever\nthe bombing was heavy at Marbrok, we had nothing to do there\nwas no steam coming over then we had to clean, constantly\nclean the factory. After a while there was nothing to clean\nthe factory SO they brought us out to\n[Bierstraut] which meant that we were just pushing\nlittle carriages. These went that way with stones, but\nthere was nothing to do really, inhale.... and there was\none older SS man who kept eh telling us news which we didn't\nwant to believe. He and we were really afraid even to\nlisten to him, we were a little afraid of him that he was\nprobably a [Jjarcoette] . But he was telling us\nstories like eh we were young and such at the\nend which sounded strange. One morning around elevenish,\nthey came after us to the factory and rushed us into the\ncamp. And they gave their last soup and rushed us out from\nthere and we were on the road. We were on the = road, and\nthat evening the [really fight fast dong] distance. I",
        "wouldn't know how big a distance it was because the whole\ngroup was quite big by then. But it was a sign that they\nare rushing from the West over to the East. We were way out\nof the West part of Germany. Inhale.... And on that way,\nthat night they made us stop on a opening in the forest and\nwe were over night in there and early morning, next morning,\nthey were pushing us further on. But by then strangely the\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int.

They had some\nCivilian clothes on underneath the big windbreakers and they\nstarted to walk into different directions and some had the\nbicycle nearby and was getting on that and they were just\nleaving us. And at that point, I said to my family and\nfriends that I'm leaving them too. I don't let myself\nsomewhere where they don't to go???? They said I'm crazy, I\nmust not do such a thing, but I just kept going along and eh\nran right into the forest. But they couldn't resist\nfollowing me and so about nine of us were together now away\nfrom the big group and went into nowhere; we had no-_ idea\nwhere we go. But when we got to the other edge of this\nlittle forest we saw a rout, and on that = road, army was",
        "moving, Slowly. Like sickish-ly horse-drawn eh\nhorse-drawn carriage and such. It was the German's, the\nback of the German's going back from the front. And of\ncourse, that's the reason we were on that other road not to\nbe able to see them or not to be in their way. And so we\ndidn't dare to go out there. We stayed in this road-side\nlittle forest and kept going into a little village and they\nstopped at the edge of this village and of course in the\nmeantime, before getting there we got through fields. There\nwe found some radishes and eh something was. still thrown\naround there not picked up which we made good use of. That\nwas something to eat, cause they forgot to give us anything\nto eat by then. Then we got to the edge of this village,\nthen we started at this left house and we dared to and the\nguy looked us over and he said you can go up to the barns\nand at the barn above there the hay, we can _ stay. SO we\nstayed. And for the day, for the for the night he came to\nthe evening, around evening and he said we should go further\nin. And we went further in. But we still wanted to know\nwhat's happening outside so we had our ears out. And we\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int.

        "didn't sleep much. We had no idea where we were all of a\nsudden we heard loud voices and eh it was evident that some\narmy men or SS men tried to come to the same place where we\nwere. He wanted to hide there. Coming up on the ladder and\nthen he saw heads around and he just jumped down and _ went\naway from it and was yelling with this peasant that this is\nnot the right place for me. The next morning, we had to get\nout from there, [Said it was all done] . And we\nstarted to go house to house, and asked for food. We didn't\neven realize it was Good Friday so they were all cooking for\nthis holiday. And there was potatoes and there was\u2019 bread,\nreal bread. And they were cutting a slice here and there\nand they said that we can not eat it here because our sister\n1S waiting outside and wanted to give her, too. Don't\nforget we were two of us who spoke German who dared to go\ninto the house and explain that we are hungry. We didn't\nneed to express too much, they could see it on us. And then\nwe went back to our present house and we were in the yard,\nand at two o'clock in the afternoon there were big noises.\nSigh......And eh a tank - kind of thing stopped in front of\nus. Evidently they were waiting for the whole line to come\nand they wanted to come into the village to get an enforce,\nnot knowing what to expect. But we looked out on the gate\nand we saw that our landlord had divided pair of paints\nhanging out. That was the the only thing that he could put\nout fora flag, evidently. Inhale. And _ then\nwe went out. We went to first GI's. The GI'S were very\nexcited seeing us. Now we started to speak English, the",
        "little English we knew and tell them who we are. So they\nlooked at what they had leftovers and they had some from the\nbreakfast ration and some cigarettes and we were asking for\nCigarettes we haven't seen for months and months and months.\nEight of us were smoking one Camel and all of us had _ seen\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. SUZANNE FOLDES\nPage 4\nthe in broad day light. Too strong for\nus, it was some inhale....unearthly feeling and of course,\nthey were yelling to each other and everybody was looking\nfor what they can find for us. And they went out and they\ncame out of the street and they felt liberated. Big big\nfeeling. But it wasn't a sure thing. We we were just not\nSure we were still with the German's and they they left and\nwe were here with the German's. Of course the German's,\nthey did not call us into the kitchenette. We had fresh\npotatoes to eat. She cooked a lot of potatoes and she was\nvery surprised and in no time there was no potatoes left.\nBy then we were fourteen of us.\ncut",
        "SWB:\nSUZANNE FOLDES: So there were all of us heard the big\nnoises. And they had to see what's happening. And they saw\nsome...\nSWB:\ncut\nSUZANNE FOLDES: All of a sudden we heard big noises and we\nSaw some big grey tank-like thing and the American star was\nand now we know that the American's here. Evidently they\nwere waiting until the groups gets up close to them, sigh,\nand we just got off from this court and went over to them\nand then we started now to speak in our little broken\nEnglish. And then we told them who we are, they started to\nlook out up there and tried to through all kinds of things\nwhat they had left over from their breakfast packages. The\nCigarettes were coming because that's what we were asking\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. SUZANNE FOLDES\nPage 5\nfor of course and I think the feeling of liberation came\nwhen we had the first Camel when we were eight of us smoking",
        "together and all of us saw the day light. During the day\nlight, the broad day light all the stars were strong. We\nwere hungry and weren't use to cigarettes anymore so months\nand months we hadn't seen one. See that was minute we\nrealized that we were liberated. Soon after that the\nAmerican group started to move on and we were left here and\nwe had no idea whats happening to us now that they left and\nwe stayed. So we tried to go after them and so we got\u2019 on\nmain street into the area where from other areas also some\nothers who were hidden around came forward. So ah Moroccan,\nblack guys, Russian girls, and it was an absolute holiday\nSpirit with all these people laughing at not understanding\nwhat's happening to them. Free to go out and they had _ to\nspeak to each other and the Moroccan come over and kiss our\nhands, our hands which were yellow from the {sow peta\nsword} . Yes it was human again, humanity\ncame. When we went back to the house, the peasants had on\nfresh potatoes cooked and invited us into the kitchen to\nhave potatoes with them. In no time there were no potatoes\nleft in this huge amount of potatoes just disappeared. All\nthis hungry people seeing the first real thing was\u2019 they\nprobably always wished for, Simple, good potatoes.\nInhale.....And the I think next day was when they came for\nus that we should go up to the mayor's house and there was a\nbig room, a huge table set-up for all of us and everybody in\nthis village had to bring a dish of food so that it was all\npoured together and that mixture we ate. It was wonderful.\nIt was really Easter kind of food. For us, probably for",
        "them tht was nothing, but eh something what they had to give\nand em they were not really giving with happy hearts. For\nthem it was over and for us it will start. Inhale.....The\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. SUZANNE FOLDES\nPage 6\nnext day, the mayor had given us fourteen of us a place to\nmove to. It was a kindergaden with tiney little chairs and\ntables. Of course no place to go to sleep, but on the side\nthere was hay put down and for us it was marvelous. But to\nhave to tell you something what probably you can not\u2019 even\nunderstand. Outside on the in that garden there was a\nlittle outhouse, the size of normal two small children size.\nAnd if you had ever seen these very.....sigh....how should I\nput it.....long pause.....people who had anymore no\u2019 desire\nto laugh, laughed at they had tears running that was\u2019 the\nplace where it first happened. It was just unbelievable\nthat this is where we will have to use. From there in a\nweek or so we were moved into a hotel. And that was already\nroom, bed. Even a place to put something down I which was\nvery sad I had nothing to put down yet but while living\nthere we were accumulating. We started to sew dresses\u2019 for\nourselves. Started to feed in order to go out for milk",
        "because there was nothing enough for us. And of course\nseeing guests. The GI's came to visit with us the evenings.\nThey were nearby, they got their rest place for, uh, two\nhundred people were there and they were allowed to _ the\nSwimming pool now. It was becoming spring and summer and\nthere was no one else allowed there but us. Cough... The\nRussian were not allowed to mix with the Americans or other\nAmericans were not to mix with them. Not with the Germans.\nSo we were the only ones they were allowed to mix. And boy\nwe were happy that they were human beings to talk to and who\ncould tell us what's happening around us. But of course,\nnot everything was so easy. There were times when all of a\nsudden the American's troops went westward and we were\nscared that were probably pushed back. We really didn't\nknow where the and we were in this village when the\nPresident died. And the American GI'S came crying like\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int.

        "SUZANNE FOLDES: yes\nSWB:\nSUZANNE FOLDES: There was practical no interactions. The\nAmerican who was in charge of the village gave orders to the\nmayor and the mayor gave orders . And it was\nordered and they were not happy to fulfill it. But here\nwere by then, they probably had 100 120 refugees, DP's, and\nthey had to do it so they they did it. But nothing more\nthan what they had to do. So like in this hotel where we\nlived. There was a family owning it they were to cook for\nus. They didn't. When we asked for something that we would\nlike to have something, they couldn't do it. The once we\nmentioned that to a GI who went to the officer who was in\ncharge and he asked us to what we need to what we wanted to\nmake. And we said eggs and sugar and flour and they claimed\nthat they have it only as much they are getting on their\ntickets. And they can not give us. So they deliver it for\nus. And then some of these people who where there in that\nresting place later, turned out to be able to get from the\nPX things what they needed,like handkerchiefs, like soup,\nand so we found one who came over to us on the poolside, all\ntheir stuff while the rest was frolicking in the water. And\nhe said to us that he was Jewish and that he was taken from\nhome when he son was probably three days old. He was\nallowed to go home to see him but right after then they\nshipped out. And since then he didn't have a Friday night.",

Would we a\nFriday night and yes he brought Candle's too, and yes we had\nour first Friday night. Him crying like we were crying.\npause....He later became my brother. He came home to\nAmerica where originally he suggested that I and a\nSister of mine should come because his mother never",
        "had daughters and would be very happy to have us, we should\ncome. But, we had to explain to him that we still hope that\nhe find somebody from our family who went back to Hungary.\nSo we just can not do that.

Which meant\nthat one of wanted to go to [Terrizia] and look for his\nfamily and that was the way he managed that. He was the\nleader, and we ment him later and we asked him, \"could we\ncome along?\" We would stop earlier then they go _ to\nYugoslavia but they have to go through Hungary so let us go\nwith them. And so we they allowed us to, so we went. In\nPrague the American embassy asked us forgiveness and that\nthey are ready to take back our citizenship which they are\nnow happy in giving back to us. And from there we traveled\ndown to Budapest, [long pause]...I went to try to visit my\nAunt and Uncle to see if they are alive or there and _ find\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int.

But they wanted me to tell them about my\nmother, and my husband, about whom they haven't heard. They\nknew that I was on my way home because my father was told by\nsomebody who heard the [Matclauss] radio that I was on the\nlist of the people alive. And when my father heard that he",
        "wanted to make some big festivity out of it, so he bought a\nhalf a pound of apricots for himself; that was his way of\ncelebration because his only daughter is alive and comes\nback. And then I arrived, late one night with my aunt and\nuncle and then I went back to my father, who was half his\nSize, and, awful happy to see me. And he wanted me to take\nover everything that was left there and start caring for it,\nwhich I was unable to. So --------(I have no idea) . I\njust could not ...expect, uh, accept anything, but I had to\ngo and try to find other things which we were putting away\nwith other people. I went back to Budapest, and from there\nto some of the suburbs of it, to try to find people and\nfind, find out what happened to the things they were putting\naway for us. Very few did; very few were honest, but there\nwere some. But to go to Budapest meant that we were on a\ntrain which either had coal to heat it and make steam, or\nnot. And we were [placed for standing] hours before we\ncould go further. And the Russian soldiers came into\u2019 the\ncar, looked around, and who didn't look too old, they pulled\nout from the train, pushed them right under the train, and\nraped them right there. And then they left them there.\nYelling, screaming...didn't [count].

And he was\u2019 the\nmilitary security forces officer- wonderful person, but ina\nvery frightening job. But when we had to put the yellow\nstar on, {Pruss} went out to the street. He was standing in\nfront of my father's store, and came over and kissed our\nhand - in uniform - to show that he's not afraid to do so,\nthat he still has the same respect for us that he had\nbefore. This man had taken some jewelry from me, and when I\narrived to him that September, he was still in England. His\nbrother knew about it; when I send them a card, his wife\nShow it to her brother-in-law and the brother-in-law said,\n\"Yes, I have things here for her.' The wife only found out\nthen. Yes, the bed linen what they had, what he also took\nfrom me, were put under the stairs in their house when the\nRussians came in, they were carrying it out, no big deal,\n[this] was at least honest and told what happened and _ the\nother things which the husband put away with his brother was\ngiven back with me the leather little bag what was holding\nit was [gone/torn] apart because [fatness was really] had\nput it into the water under faucet.

        "It happened very fast. Earlier when we looked out from the\n[regom] when we stopped at the station my mother said _ we\nwon't survive that and I said yes we will and she said no we\nwon't. And people were telling us that she should cover her\nhair because right up front there was a little gray in her\nhair, nothing bad, she was 46 altogether and that little one\nup front was her killer. And when they told us to cover her\nhair it was so hard. She says,\"Oh, I wouldn't do such a\nthing.\" And in no time she went with her friends which\nwere,...
