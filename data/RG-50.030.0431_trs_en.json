And I also, that period, I was corresponding with my sister who was still in Vilna\nthrough a friend of mine who was in Switzerland. My closest girlfriend came to visit me in Paris\nafter the Treaty of Munich in \u201938 and she became very ill in Paris. To such an extent that she was\nbedridden three months in my apartment and I was almost ready to take her back home. She had no\nparents, she had just an uncle who was a lawyer in Vilna. So she was all packed to go back to\nPoland and then she became very ill. So doctor operated on her and the operation wouldn\u2019t heal.\nShe was very, very sick. And I knew a lot about a professor in Switzerland who was a very famous\nspecialist of tuberculosis and my husband wrote a letter to him and he told us to bring her. That was\nChristmas Eve, \u201939. And I, and I, she was packed already to go to Vilna to her uncle but I took her\nto Switzerland and she was, that was, she was also, her name also was Raya and we were the same\nage. We graduate from the same high school in Vilna. And we were, had a lot in common. She\nhad no, no parents. Her mother was dead by that time and she lived with an uncle in Vilna who was\na lawyer. Anyhow, I took her to Switzerland and she was bedridden for three years and she\nrecovered and she went to, to Geneva I think she went. And she met a fellow, she married and she\nlived in Israel. And she, and she had a fairly decent life after that because . And I\nescaped from Paris June 2\u2122 I think, 1939. Just a few days before the Germans marched in. And we\nheaded with these friends, these two friends by car for eight days to Toulouse. We slept in schools,\nwe slept on the, in, on and it was not . And how did I, I my\nhusband? And then my sister-in-law joined me. My sister-in-law who was a graduate, she was very\nbright and she was a graduate from the College de France de Paris . But then my\nhusband, thank God, came, he was demobilized and we started, we lived first in the country. He\nwas tending cows and doing other things on a farm.

        "Q: And, as, by 1941, what was it like for you in Toulouse? What were you doing there?",
        "A: Well, well, my, my son was born and it was very hard. I got a couple times some money from\nAmerica from my cousins and my husband worked as I told you as an accountant and we made the\nends meet. It was not easy and simple, nevertheless we had an apartment where I even could give\nroom to a friend of mine, to a school, an old friend of mine, to a girlfriend. And we managed, I\neven had a little help too because I didn\u2019t have enough milk to feed my child. I had some help from\na next door neighbor who, I would pay her but she helped me with, because we had no running\nwater, you know how it was during the war. Life was very hard but still we survived better than",
        "Q: What was it like for you as Jew in Toulouse at that ttme? Being a Jew with papers as a Jew?",
        "A: Well I must confess that we didn\u2019t feel it too much because my husband was a veteran of the\nFrench Army and he had a job for a French firm so we personally didn\u2019t feel any, persecution. The,\nthe only time I started feeling it when I, we got American visa and we applied for the visa of exit.\nAnd my husband visa of exit was turned down three times. They refused it. And then I think,\npregnant with Daynya (ph), I went to Vishee (ph) France to plead my case because there was no\nreason for them to refuse my husband\u2019s visa of exit. He was a war veteran. He served ten months\non the Maryjinoline (ph) and it was just through anti-Semitism and persecution. So I was extremely\nlucky. It was like a miracle that I succeeded in getting the visa of exit.",
        "Q: How did you do that? Who did you talk to?",
        "A: It was, it was, it was providence. It was real providence. I came to, to Vishee (ph) with 1000\nfrancs which I don\u2019t, cannot evaluate the value and I had two packs of cigarettes were very valuable\nin those days. And I went to a little restaurant for lunch. I didn\u2019t, I am a talker so, so I spoke to\nsomebody in the restaurant and I told him what I came for and he directed me to whom to go to.\nThat was already a miracle, . And I came I, I saw the minister and I\nexplained to him and I just had learned of my mother\u2019s death, just a few months ago. And the night\nbefore I went to see the, no the next day, I had a dream which I have never forgotten. My mother\ncame to me and told me that and I woke up in cold sweat and it was that feeling, I went\nfor the second time to see the, and he . And it was like, it was just a\nmiracle. I would like to read this postcard. Was written by Nomer (ph) and Son who 1s a very\nfamous Jew 1s called . Lenin is in the museum, Lenin. And who was a prominent\ncitizen of Paris, who was my husband\u2019s relative. And he was trying to get us to come to, to\nAmerica but he said he can, he can bring us only to Santa Domingo. So it was really a miracle and\nthere were another incident after I had all my papers and everything, a woman whom I asked to\nwatch over my valise took her, took my valise instead of hers and boarded another train, in Vishee\n(ph). I was hysterical. I started screaming, somebody told, told, oh, she\u2019s on another train.\nAnyhow, I went through her, my experiences, but I, I got the visa and we sailed for,\nthrough Spain and Portugal and we sailed to America and we came to America in \u201942. November,\n42. I was pregnant with ;",
        "Q: Where did you live once you arrived?",
        "A: When, the first few weeks we lived at the cousin\u2019s house, the first maybe two or three weeks.\nAnd then they helped us rent an apartment, a one bedroom apartment, upper, upper West Side. Do\nyou know New York at all? We lived on the upper West Side, very close to . And my\nhusband started working about ten days after. It was not easy, . And before\nour family couldn\u2019t financially help us because one of my cousins who used to be very\nwealthy lost all his money and the cousin who paid for our trip to America . But my\nhusband started working very soon and it was a struggle and, but I was lucky that I used, was able to\nget at least from my sister who was in Vilna under the Germans.\n. And my, my later sister was very educated. She knew eight languages. That\u2019s\nthrough the, the eight language she learned already when she came to Cuba. But she knew German,\nFrench, Russian, Polish, Yiddish, Hebrew and. . .",

        "A: Yes. Ghetto.",
        "Q: Ghetto. She went to camps and then went to Cuba.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And then came to America. From America she couldn\u2019t remain because she\narrived in America with a girlfriend who helped her a great deal in camp. The other, the other\nfriend. My sister was as I said, a linguist and the other one, a graduate of a very good trade school.\nShe was a very good seamstress. That\u2019s what kept her alive and helped her to help my sister.\nThat\u2019s how they survived. They were very devoted to each other. So when they came to America,\nthey, my sister could have somebody marry her fictitiously so she could remain. But the other one\ncouldn\u2019t get it and they went to Cuba and they suffered Cuba, for three years they\nsuffered from the climate, atrocious. And finally, they came back.",
        "Q: Okay. Is there anything you would like to add?",
        "A: Well I, I really don\u2019t know what . This 1s a letter that I have from my sister in\nPolish where she says that she\u2019s more miserable there than she was in concentration camp. That\u2019s\nhow miserable she was in Cuba because of the climate. Yes. She was highly educated.",
        "Q: Thank you very much.",
        "A: And, and also this, here I have, in Paris, after I reached Lisbon, trying to tell her that I would try\nto do everything possible for them once I get to America. Unfortunately, they suffered a great deal\nunder the Germans in France. So there was nothing really, I don\u2019t see.\nConclusion of interview.\n"

        "A: Well, well we, it, first of all 1t was a mutual, my friend who was, a friend who was courting all\nmy girlfriends, he was a known bachelor and he was in business of radio parts. So he had a\n, with a broken spring on the front seat, and I never have forgotten because I had a, a\nheavy, from Algiers, a blanket so I went back home at the last moment because the\nsprings on the seat were so uncomfortable that we couldn\u2019t have possibly sat on this and I ran back\nand that was the only item that I saved from my apartment because . . . and we lived for eight days\nin, 1n in schools and I don\u2019t where on the road. And we headed for Toulouse, France\nwhere we settled and many months later, I don\u2019t remember exactly but my husband joined me. I, I\nescaped from Paris two days before the Germans walked into Paris. .",
        "A: And the, in Toulouse, I was lucky because .. .",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Well, it was panic because some people were lucky to take, who, who had the, how would I say\nthe foresight and they went by train south, they escaped, and it was, it was panic. I, oh yes, one\nnight I would like to mention to you I used to have a cleaning woman. Because I worked so I had\nsomebody come it twice a week I think, or maybe three times, I don\u2019t recall. And it turned out that\nshe was a German spy. My cleaning woman in Paris was, turned out to be a German spy.\nIt was really frightening.",
        "A: Oh, from some neighbor in the same building, . And the, you see, this\nfrom, and then we were, as I say, my husband was very lucky. He spent on the Marjinoline (ph)\nabout ten months but he had one leave. His first leave was in January which we were lucky to\nspend together and the second leave when he was on the train, he got an order to come back to the\nfront. And he had a, a written leave, he could have proceeded farther but he obeyed the order and\nthat saved his life. So after and I was lucky to go to Toulouse because there was an old friend of\nmine from the times of college days and I had at least a shelter where to be for a few days and then I\nwas refugee in the countryside. And when my husband who was demobilized in Germany 1n the\ncountryside and he worked on a farm tending cows, the, it was for a, for awhile in the, in that estate\nand later on he got himself a job in Toulouse and we went back to Toulouse and that\u2019s where my\nson is born.",
        "A: Well it was very hard because, but he, my husband, after he was demobilized it was lucky. He\ngot a job. He worked for a, for a factory that manufactures shoes as an accountant so that\u2019s how we\nlived through and I also got a very little help from a American cousin just a few times, they send us\nsome money. And I also, that period, I was corresponding with my sister who was still in Vilna\nthrough a friend of mine who was in Switzerland. My closest girlfriend came to visit me in Paris\nafter the Treaty of Munich in \u201938 and she became very ill in Paris. To such an extent that she was\nbedridden three months in my apartment and I was almost ready to take her back home. She had no\nparents, she had just an uncle who was a lawyer in Vilna. So she was all packed to go back to\nPoland and then she became very ill. So doctor operated on her and the operation wouldn\u2019t heal.\nShe was very, very sick. And I knew a lot about a professor in Switzerland who was a very famous\nspecialist of tuberculosis and my husband wrote a letter to him and he told us to bring her. That was\nChristmas Eve, \u201939. And I, and I, she was packed already to go to Vilna to her uncle but I took her\nto Switzerland and she was, that was, she was also, her name also was Raya and we were the same\nage. We graduate from the same high school in Vilna. And we were, had a lot in common. She\nhad no, no parents. Her mother was dead by that time and she lived with an uncle in Vilna who was\na lawyer. Anyhow, I took her to Switzerland and she was bedridden for three years and she\nrecovered and she went to, to Geneva I think she went. And she met a fellow, she married and she\nlived in Israel. And she, and she had a fairly decent life after that because . And I\nescaped from Paris June 2\u2122 I think, 1939. Just a few days before the Germans marched in. And we\nheaded with these friends, these two friends by car for eight days to Toulouse. We slept in schools,\nwe slept on the, in, on and it was not . And how did I, I my\nhusband? And then my sister-in-law joined me. My sister-in-law who was a graduate, she was very\nbright and she was a graduate from the College de France de Paris . But then my\nhusband, thank God, came, he was demobilized and we started, we lived first in the country. He\nwas tending cows and doing other things on a farm. And then we moved to Toulouse where he\nworked as a, in accounting, a factory, a shoe factory.",
        "A: In Toulouse we were, I will tell you. I escaped from Paris in \u201939, I was and we left for America\nin \u00b042.",
        "A: Yes, three years . My son was born in Toulouse.",
        "A: Well, well, my, my son was born and it was very hard. I got a couple times some money from\nAmerica from my cousins and my husband worked as I told you as an accountant and we made the\nends meet. It was not easy and simple, nevertheless we had an apartment where I even could give\nroom to a friend of mine, to a school, an old friend of mine, to a girlfriend. And we managed, I\neven had a little help too because I didn\u2019t have enough milk to feed my child. I had some help from\na next door neighbor who, I would pay her but she helped me with, because we had no running\nwater, you know how it was during the war. Life was very hard but still we survived better than",
        "A: Well I must confess that we didn\u2019t feel it too much because my husband was a veteran of the\nFrench Army and he had a job for a French firm so we personally didn\u2019t feel any, persecution. The,\nthe only time I started feeling it when I, we got American visa and we applied for the visa of exit.\nAnd my husband visa of exit was turned down three times. They refused it. And then I think,\npregnant with Daynya (ph), I went to Vishee (ph) France to plead my case because there was no\nreason for them to refuse my husband\u2019s visa of exit. He was a war veteran. He served ten months\non the Maryjinoline (ph) and it was just through anti-Semitism and persecution. So I was extremely\nlucky. It was like a miracle that I succeeded in getting the visa of exit.",
        "A: It was, it was, it was providence. It was real providence. I came to, to Vishee (ph) with 1000\nfrancs which I don\u2019t, cannot evaluate the value and I had two packs of cigarettes were very valuable\nin those days. And I went to a little restaurant for lunch. I didn\u2019t, I am a talker so, so I spoke to\nsomebody in the restaurant and I told him what I came for and he directed me to whom to go to.\nThat was already a miracle, . And I came I, I saw the minister and I\nexplained to him and I just had learned of my mother\u2019s death, just a few months ago. And the night\nbefore I went to see the, no the next day, I had a dream which I have never forgotten. My mother\ncame to me and told me that and I woke up in cold sweat and it was that feeling, I went\nfor the second time to see the, and he . And it was like, it was just a\nmiracle. I would like to read this postcard. Was written by Nomer (ph) and Son who 1s a very\nfamous Jew 1s called . Lenin is in the museum, Lenin. And who was a prominent\ncitizen of Paris, who was my husband\u2019s relative. And he was trying to get us to come to, to\nAmerica but he said he can, he can bring us only to Santa Domingo. So it was really a miracle and\nthere were another incident after I had all my papers and everything, a woman whom I asked to\nwatch over my valise took her, took my valise instead of hers and boarded another train, in Vishee\n(ph). I was hysterical. I started screaming, somebody told, told, oh, she\u2019s on another train.\nAnyhow, I went through her, my experiences, but I, I got the visa and we sailed for,\nthrough Spain and Portugal and we sailed to America and we came to America in \u201942. November,\n42. I was pregnant with ;",
        "A: When, the first few weeks we lived at the cousin\u2019s house, the first maybe two or three weeks.\nAnd then they helped us rent an apartment, a one bedroom apartment, upper, upper West Side. Do\nyou know New York at all? We lived on the upper West Side, very close to . And my\nhusband started working about ten days after. It was not easy, . And before\nour family couldn\u2019t financially help us because one of my cousins who used to be very\nwealthy lost all his money and the cousin who paid for our trip to America . But my\nhusband started working very soon and it was a struggle and, but I was lucky that I used, was able to\nget at least from my sister who was in Vilna under the Germans.\n. And my, my later sister was very educated. She knew eight languages. That\u2019s\nthrough the, the eight language she learned already when she came to Cuba. But she knew German,\nFrench, Russian, Polish, Yiddish, Hebrew and. . .",
        "A: One.",
        "A: Yes. Ghetto.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And then came to America. From America she couldn\u2019t remain because she\narrived in America with a girlfriend who helped her a great deal in camp. The other, the other\nfriend. My sister was as I said, a linguist and the other one, a graduate of a very good trade school.\nShe was a very good seamstress. That\u2019s what kept her alive and helped her to help my sister.\nThat\u2019s how they survived. They were very devoted to each other. So when they came to America,\nthey, my sister could have somebody marry her fictitiously so she could remain. But the other one\ncouldn\u2019t get it and they went to Cuba and they suffered Cuba, for three years they\nsuffered from the climate, atrocious. And finally, they came back.",
        "A: Well I, I really don\u2019t know what . This 1s a letter that I have from my sister in\nPolish where she says that she\u2019s more miserable there than she was in concentration camp. That\u2019s\nhow miserable she was in Cuba because of the climate. Yes. She was highly educated.",
        "A: And, and also this, here I have, in Paris, after I reached Lisbon, trying to tell her that I would try\nto do everything possible for them once I get to America. Unfortunately, they suffered a great deal\nunder the Germans in France. So there was nothing really, I don\u2019t see.\nConclusion of interview.\n"
