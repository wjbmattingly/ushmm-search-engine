        "Answer: Living in Florida, it\u2019s gorgeous. I me -- it\u2019s a God sent weather. Nothing better\nthan that.",
        "Q: Is it always this nice?",
        "A: It\u2019s always this nice, even when it rains, it\u2019s only liquid sunshine, so it\u2019s pretty good.\nShould have come here before we even was born, it\u2019s -- to be born here.",
        "Q: This is your idea of paradise?",
        "A: That\u2019s -- I think that\u2019s -- want me to hold it?",
        "Q: No, Ill hold it, it\u2019s all right.",

        "A: No. I think there\u2019s a idea of paradise. [indecipherable] wonderful friends, and it keeps\nme busy. Matter of fact, I have to get up every morning 6:30, seven o\u2019clock just to keep\nbusy, cause I go to school five times a week.",
        "Q: Oh, you do?",
        "A: I sure do, sure do. And I lecture on the -- on Holocaust and German history. I don\u2019t get\npaid for it, and plus I was a volunteer in an old age home, in an hospital, except I had to\nstop it because I had a triple bypass, and a pacemaker, so I cannot do heavy lifting -- or\nvery heavy lifting, so I stopped that.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s pause. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr\ncollection. This is an interview with Beno Helmer, conducted on March third, 2000, by\nArwin Donohue. This is a follow up interview to a videotaped interview that was\nconducted with Mr. Helmer, and this interview will focus on his post-Holocaust\nexperiences. The videotaped interview focused on his Holocaust era experiences. We\nmay go back and -- and discuss some of the Holocaust era experiences that weren\u2019t\nmentioned in the first interview. This is tape number one, side A. And, Mr. Helmer, I\nthought we would start with the moment of your liberation, and -- and move forward\nfrom there, and we\u2019ll see how -- how it goes, as far as going back before that. And you\ndescribed in your first interview how you were -- the circumstances of your liberation,\nand how the am -- U.S. army came into the -- to the POW camp where you were. And I\nwondered -- you mentioned something about this moment of freedom, and I wondered if\nyou would talk a little bit about what that -- what freedom meant to you.",
        "A: Let me regress a little bit. The day of -- when I was liberated, it wan -- matter of fact, I\nthink to -- let\u2019s say 24 hours before I was liber -- I was -- got the worst beating in my\nlifetime. [indecipherable] I still have scars on my head and my shoulders, because the\ncommander told us to march with him wherever he wanted to march, and I refused him.\nSo he had a big, huge stick, and he beat me mercilessly. And I gonna die, but I\u2019d rather\ndie instead of marching with him. Some hours later, down the road, we saw a tank with a\nbig, white, five star -- s -- five star -- star emblem. W-We didn\u2019t know what that\u2019s -- I\ndidn\u2019t know what that\u2019s -- this means the American army, I know the five star emblem\nwas the Russian army, so we thought that\u2019s the Russian army came. But it wasn\u2019t so,\nbecause hours later, one s-single soldier came in, a short, little fellow what had a -- a -- a\n-- a rucksack on his back, and he said he is an American. It was a little fellow from\nBrooklyn. And the first thing he said, \u201c\u201cWhere is there water?\u201d He was thirsty, so I said,\n\u201cWe have a water fo -- water pump, but you\u2019re not allowed to drink it,\u201d -- be -- matter of\nfact, the first time I went into the camp, the commander told us we are not allowed to\ndrink from this water, because this may give typhoid. And he said 1f anybody\u2019s drinking\nfrom this fountain, he going to be shot. And he said, \u201cTo prove to you,\u201d he took out his\npistol, took an innocent man, and shot him. A Russia-Russian worker. This camp\nconsisted of building prisoner of war camps for the American flyers, which was never\nfinished, and that\u2019s the reason we slept on sand. So now, let\u2019s go right -- back to the\nAmerican soldier. He said he was thirsty. So we said to him, \u201cYou cannot drink from this\nfountain, because you\u2019re going to die.\u201d He says, \u201cNo problem.\u201d Took the water, put it in\nhis canteen, and put a pill into his water, shook it, and he drank it, and I think this was the\nbiggest miracle I ever saw in my lifetime at that time, that he survived, he didn\u2019t die from\nhis -- because of this little pill. A few hours later he says he going to bring some food,\ngive it to it -- va -- ba -- bring us food because we were starving. I mean, when I was\nliberated, after aid already, I was weighing 92 or 94 pounds. So in that evening, or next\nday, the French came with a kitchen, a truck which had a big kettle of soup, in -- in the\nback, and the French men, they -- they said, \u201cThat\u2019s the fr -- thanks to the French\nliberation,\u201d which wasn\u2019t so, \u201cwe going to sing \u201cThe Marseilles.\u2019\u201d And I had a friend of\nmine which name Is ra -- Ravel Monya -- Monyek Ravel. And I said, \u201cI will not sing the\nFrench national anthem, because they did not liberate us.\u201d So I said, \u201cRavel, since we are\nfree, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d He says, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to go.\u201d I said, \u201cRavel, good-bye, I\nam leaving.\u201d He followed me. And this how I left the camp, but it -- the biggest miracle I\nsaw that time was the canteen with the pill in the water.",
        "Q: I should just say that in your first interview, you did talk about that period, and you\ntalked about your liberation, so I asked the question just to find out a little bit more about\nwhat was going on inside of you at that time, as far as what you -- you said, you know,\nthis was a moment of realizing that you were free, and -- and what -- and whether that\nmeant -- did you have any sense of allegiance to any country, or any people, or -- or what\n-- what were your thoughts inside, at that point?",
        "A: No, thi -- at that point, I felt I was an orphaned. This the first time I felt I was an\norphan, because it was bewildering being free. What does that mean being free? Do I go\nwherever I want to go? Or do I go where they going to tell me to go? And in -- [ -- I\ndidn\u2019t have anything, no clothing, I had no food. I left the French camp, and I -- I start\nmissing people. I missed my parents, I missed my sister. My sister, I thought she was\nperished anyways. She was a very, very skinny, little girl, so I said she cannot survive the\ncamp. But I had a brother of mine, which was six years younger than I was, I said, \u201cHe\nwas a strong lad, maybe he survived.\u201d But unfortunately, the fate wa -- dealt us a\ndifferent card. The only one who survived was my sister, nobody else. So when I walked\nout, I wanted to go back to Prague, to Czechoslovakia. And -- and we marched, Monyek\nand I, we marched, and I\u2019m sure I told it before, this -- I was -- first time I was\nencountered with baseball. I spoke about the baseball, so it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t have to spay about\nthat any more.",
        "Q: No, you don\u2019t. Yeah, you did mention that. And you also mentioned -- when you\nmentioned Monyek, did you -- yo-you told about how you took leave of him because he\nhad wanted to go to Paris, and you had --",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: -- you didn\u2019t want to stay in the detention camp.",
        "A: Correct, correct, yes.",
        "Q: \u2019'm wondering, did you ever have contact with Monyek again?",
        "A: No, I found out Monyek went to Sweden. I wrote it to the Jewish HIAS, or it was\nsome organization in Sweden, to get in touch with Monyek Ravel, but it never, never got\n-- never I got an answer, never heard from him since. That\u2019s correct, I completely forgot.\nHe want to go to Paris, and I want to go back home. And I\u2019m sure I told you I finally\nwound up in a DP camp. The American took me to DP camp in -- I told him I was Polish,\nand I decided it\u2019s going to Poland, it\u2019s closer to go to Poland, from Poland to -- to\nTeplice, to Czechoslovakia, than -- than staying where I was. So you know the story\nabout the rape of the women in the -- in the -- in the -- in the garage, and I don\u2019t know if\nyou know this, when I came home, finally came back to Prague, I got sick. I was sick,\nand I was in the hospital, and the clothing, I was changed because I was full of lice. Told\nyou this story, too.",
        "Q: No, the -- not about the clothing.",
        "A: No? I -- I went back to Prague, and I went back to Prague with fu -- for I could -- at\nthat time you had to get a permission to -- they put you where -- where they have to -- for\nhousing and food. So, before I went to the office, I saw that they was checking your\nclothing. So I was lice, I was very filthy and lice, because I still had that regular shirt,\nexcept I took somebody else\u2019s shoes. So I took my -- I saw somebody had a bag there\nwith clothing, so I took the clothing out of his bag, and put my clothing next to his bag.\nAnd so I went for -- and I went there, and since I was a citizen of Czech-Czechoslovakia,\nthat time they gave me, and I stayed in the Hotel Prague -- excuse me, Hotel Paris, except\nI got sick, and I got rheumatic fever. And they put me the hospital to -- hospital name of\nBoulav cabbage, I spent some time there, and I was in the wo -- in the room with some\nRussian soldiers, and they were feeding me vodka. So the medication did not help too\nmuch, because whatever medication they gave me, the vodka counteracted it. So finally\nthe doctor said, \u201cYou know, by now you should be having the results.\u201d So finally he\nfound out, he saw a glass of vodka there, so he put me another room, and -- and finally I\ngot better. It was quite bad, I couldn\u2019t even feed myself because I had no muscles in my\nhands. And after this I went to Teplice.",
        "Q: How long were you sick in the hospital?",
        "A: Approximately two to three weeks. Quite some time, was coots -- three weeks. But it\nwas terrib -- matter of fact, they fed me there, they -- after we got out of the ward where\nthe -- where the Russians soldiers were, so I started to gain weight, and I got back\nmobility of my hands.",
        "Q: When you went back to Teplice, you mentioned in the video interview that you had --\na little bit about what happened, that you had met your former --",
        "A: Maid.",
        "Q: -- maid.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And that people were -- were helpful to you, because you were the only survivor.",
        "A: Only [indecipherable] yes, yes.",
        "Q: Can you talk in more detail? Did -- did -- were people asking you about what had\nhappened, and were -- did you form friendships, or --",
        "A: Nobody asked me what had happened, because I didn\u2019t want to be the oddity of the\nwhole town. And I tell you something funny, thing 1s, by evt -- everybody spoke Czech at\nthat time, nobody want to speak German, but the first opera I saw in Teplica, was\n[indecipherable] Bride, in German. Nobody spoke German, [indecipherable]. I couldn\u2019t\ngo back to my father\u2019s -- my parents\u2019s house, because there was an engineer, a German\nengineer, who had the plans of the coal mines, we had the coal mines underneath Teplica,\nand so they didn\u2019t want to antagonize him that he should not destroy the maps, or should\nnot destroy the ba -- ma -- the -- the coal mine, yeah coal mine. So they gave me a lovely,\nlovely apartment, a big apartment that compensated for the house, which I didn\u2019t have at\nthat time, and they gave me a big store. It was a business, this was electrical business. I\ndon\u2019t know if I told you about -- did I speak about the electric business?",
        "Q: A little bit, a little bit.",
        "A: Yeah, they gave me the electric business, which was good, and they gave me liskies,\ns-Slips -- food slip for the privileged class of -- of -- of Czech Republic, a matter of fact,\nthis where I met Czech -- Czechoslovakia, this -- matter of fact, I met my father\u2019s old\nmaid. Except, ventually, when the Russians start taking it over, they ask me to join the\nRussian army, which I said, \u201cWhy should I join the Russian army?\u201d Actually they wanted\njoin the Russian Air Force. They said, \u201cBecause, let\u2019s me truthful, you have nobody here\nwho will miss you.\u201d And to prove, they -- that gave me four or five weeks to make up my\nmind, and the first thing what they do, they took the store away from me -- the business\naway from me, and I became the helper, because you have to be employed, I became the\nhelper to the -- the fellow who they gave the business to. Good Russians -- a good Czech\nCommunist. And it\u2019s be -- they made it quite in -- unpleasant for me. So I decided is --\nmore they took away my food stamps, also. So I -- this -- me -- just prove to them this\nthey meant business. So eventually I smuggled myself back to -- to Germany, to Hagana -\n- the Hagana smuggled me back, and I wound up in Munich.",
        "Q: Can you -- before all of that happened in Teplice, did you have any interest in staying\nthere, or were you hoping to leave?",
        "A: I never wanted to leave. I loved Teplica, I loved Czechoslovakia, I -- I never\nencountered ani -- any 1 -- da -- anti-Semitism. I really loved it, my father who loved it\nthere, all -- the whole family loved it. I felt a hundred percent a Czech citizen, I liked that\n-- by the way, let me go back a little bit. At same time it happened that Jan Maserik\nallegedly committed suicide, mer -- Jan Maserik was the son of Thomas Caric\n[indecipherable] of the president. And he committed suicide in Rachen. Rachen is in a\ncastle. I was in -- in Prague at the same time, at that time. The window he -- he -- he was\na corpulent man, he was a heavy set man. The window in the bathroom was\napproximately six or seven feet high, in -- in -- in the bathroom. Even if you stood on a\ncommode -- on the toilet, you couldn\u2019t squeeze through the window. Not only this, even\nif he could, he couldn\u2019t get through the window voluntarily, because the window was too\nnarrow for him to jump out the window. So when he landed, he f -- they found, on his\nclothing they found -- they see somebody\u2019s pushed him. So, you know, it\u2019s what -- the\nclothing was ripped on the side where he went through the mindow -- window. And --\nand th-that\u2019s also added to it, this -- I was scared that\u2019s -- whatever they said, they meant\nbusiness, there was not -- no bluffs. It\u2019s a be -- they -- they -- they meant that I was scared\nof them. I was scared of the Russians, because a -- what I went through with this -- with\nthe raping of those women and -- and the be -- they behavior, that I -- I was scared of\nthem, because I don\u2019t know if I said it, when I was freed finally, they drafted me in the\nRussian army for a few days, where I escaped, because we -- thanks to a -- a bag of sugar.\nSo -- so I didn\u2019t want to deal with them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I still was by myself, I didn\u2019t have anybody. Nobody came to me, nobody knows\nme. I came there, I was a newcomer of the block, so [inaudible]",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t have any strong friendships there, that --",
        "A: I di -- never made any. I wasn\u2019t long enough to make any strong friendship, plus my\nCzech wa -- wa-was not as good as it should have been, because I\u2019ve -- through all those\nyears, I always picked up all those different languages, so sometime my Czech was\nmixed in with Polish. So a lot of them were not -- I don\u2019t know, a lot of them, some of\nthem didn\u2019t even believe -- believe me that\u2019s -- I came from Teplice.",
        "Q: Another question about Teplice, you had mentioned just briefly in the first interview\nthat your -- that your father was a refugee, but your mother had been from the area.",
        "A: My mother is from Austria. My mother 1s -- my moth-mother -- my mother 1s from\nSalzburg. Her older sister was married to a colonel -- a -- a corporal in the -- in Austrian\narmy. He was stationed in Teplice. He was stationed in Teplice, so his wife, which now\nshe was his wife, came to stay with Teplice. Since -- since my mother was in Salzburg, sh\n-- and she was the youngest one, she took her to stay with her in Teplice, in this house\nshe -- they stayed in Teplice, but they actually come from Austria. My father\u2019s a Swede.\nHe came to -- to Teplice only because in 1920, he couldn\u2019t make a living in Prague, so he\ndecided to go to Teplice. And I don\u2019t know if I told you the story, he met my aunt -- no,\nhe went to Teplice, and when you go to Teplice by rail, from Prague to Teplice, you have\nto go to acity by the name of Owseek. Owseek you change your train, you go to Teplice.\nSitting in a rail from Owseek on the way to Teplice, he sees a lady sitting across in -- in\nthe railroad. So he says to the lady, \u201c\u201cYou think you can -- there is any jobs available in\nTeplice?\u201d So the lady thinks to herself, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s all what we need 1s another refugee.\u201d So\nshe tells, \u201cYoung man, I tell you what you should do, go back to Prague where you came\nfrom.\u201d He said, \u201cTell you truthfully, I don\u2019t have any money to go back.\u201d Long story\nshort, two year -- two years later, she was my mother\u2019s sister. And that\u2019s how my father\nwind -- wound up in Teplice and -- and when I was born they were quite, quite poor. A\nmatter of fact, my mother compensated, or my parents compensated. Their livelihood is\nthey were stuffing geese with -- s -- geese int -- ag -- stuffing the geese, so they -- the\nliver became big, and they was selling the liver to export to France, and so they had the\nmeat for nothing. Some years later, when my sister was born, we were quite well off, we\nalready had six people in help. So -- so it\u2019s changed quite dramatically.",
        "Q: So your father\u2019s training, his profession before he left --",
        "A: My f -- my father comes from a family of bookbinders. Po -- anything which bo -- er -\n- had to do with book. My father\u2019s youngest brother was doing lettering on the covers, in\nthe gold leaf ri -- my father learned bookbinding, leather book binding. My father\u2019s oldest\nbrother learned -- I don\u2019t know what -- it\u2019s something to do with th-th-the paper,\nwhatever you do with the paper. So all of them were involved in bookbinding. My\nfather\u2019s parents perished in the first World War, his mother and his older sister. They\nperished in -- in Berlin. And this where he comes -- came from -- eventually wind up in\nTeplice.",
        "Q: Did you ever return to Teplice after that?",
        "A: I was just there last March. I took my children back to Teplice, all my children, I\ntreated them a trip, we went to Teplice, we went to Munich, went to Dusseldorf, went to\nPrague, and went to a -- the Theresienstadt where approximately 21 members of my f --\nmy parent\u2019s family perished. So I took them to Teplice, and I took them to\nTheresienstadt. And coming back to Teplice wasn\u2019t anything I saw. I saw my high\nschool, I saw my elementary school. I s-saw where -- where -- the park where we left, I\ndidn\u2019t see the -- by the way, the house we owned was taken down, and they built big\nblocks of -- of apartment houses, Russian style drab, and -- and ugly, and square. So -- a\nmatter of fact, th-the market, which was called the Mozartsplatz became the Leninplatz,\nwhich now has now stopped being the Leninplatz, so they called it the Marsarekplatz.\nAnd the statue of Mozart they put in the other par -- in a different park. A matter of fact, I\nwas looking for the Mozart, finally I found him not far, which now it became spar --\n[indecipherable] spar, which called -- became the Beethovenspar. So I went to Teplice,\nbut the funny thing 1s, I almost went as a tourist, no -- very little emotional about it,\nbecause this was hundreds and hundreds years ago.",
        "Q: Did you see anyone you knew from there?",
        "A: Nobody\u2019s there, I am the only one. There 1s -- matter of fact, I just f -- read recently,\nJews in Teplice are -- s -- b -- lived there since 1414. During the war -- after the war, I\nwas one of the few. Now they had the little bit, they coming from S-Slovakia now, it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s a -- become a Czech Republic, they come in from Slovakia, they live in Teplice, but\nnow again, it\u2019s diminishing. The population of Teplice are diminishing. The temple,\nwhich was a huge, beautiful temple is only -- and now they have a -- a stone 1s set on this\nplace, in this platz, on this place stood a synagogue, that\u2019s all what it says. At this place\nstood a -- stood a synagogue, and that\u2019s was Teplice.",
        "Q: What about non-Jews?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know anybody non-Jew, because I was young. I was young when I left, I mean\n-- and my friend, my best friend, I mean -- I don\u2019t know if I told the interviewer, my best\nfriend was -- name was Horst, and -- by the way, let me emphasize, I never, never\nencountered anti-Semitism in -- in ch -- so long I lived in Czechosl-slovakia that time.\nAnd we had a big house, and a b -- in the backyard of the house we had -- I had -- part of\nthe garage, I had rabbits. And we\u2019re playing with -- this fellow Horst, we\u2019re playing in a -\n- and he says to me -- me, \u201cMy father said that you are Jewish, are you Jewish?\u201d And I\ntruthfully didn\u2019t know what he meant, because religion never came up as a subject in any\nconversation. Anyways, this was the last time I saw this fellow. From there I went to\nuniversity th -- Budapest, you know, because Hitler showed his ugly colors. So I left\nTeplice, and I finally came back in Teplice in 1999. By the way came back very sick, I ga\n-- | got pneumonia.",
        "Q: And it -- and you really didn\u2019t feel much emotion being back there, it was -- you were\n-- felt --",
        "A: At the ti -- th-the emotion wasn\u2019t there, because whatever I knew, wasn\u2019t there. The\nhouse which we lived in, wasn\u2019t there. The only -- the emotion was this, I can\u2019t believe it.\nThere\u2019s the high school -- there the la -- no, there\u2019s the elementary school in -- up the\nhill. Was the high school I went to. Spoke to a lot of people, none of them knew where --\nwhere I -- what [indecipherable] Mozartplatz, because it was a huge, gorgeous statue of\nMozart, and the city all was be-behind it. I said, \u201c\u201cWas -- where\u2019s the Mozartplatz?\u201d First\nthing, very few of them spoke Czech. It\u2019s amazing that\u2019s very few of them speak Czech.\nAnd most mas -- not all -- most -- all of them, nobody -- nobody knew where Mozartplatz\nwas, there -- this was there 50 years ago. So went to the city hall, and all of them are\nyoung people, they said, \u201cWe have no archives of it.\u201d No archives. I came the wrong day\nanyways. So, by coincidence, when I went to -- my mother was in charge of the theater,\nthe opera and the theater, cult -- cultural center. So we went -- at least I went to see where\nmy mother stayed the cultural center, and all of a sudden I see Mozart statue, oh it\u2019s very\ninteresting. We-Went to see that the spot where Moz -- where Beethov -- I don\u2019t know if\nI said it, Beethoven, and -- and Gerta walked. Gerta and Beethoven used to come that\nsummer. And Gerta says to Beethoven, \u201cMove aside, the Kaiser is behind you.\u201d And he\nsaid, ger -- ber -- Beethoven said to Gerta, he says, \u201cRemember one thing, in hundred\nyears, nobody knows who the Kaiser was.\u201d And this is -- it\u2019s all written up, all over. And\n-- so I went to this place, and matter of fact, as a child I remember my father took a\npicture of my sister and I, before my brother was born, right on the same spot where\nMozart -- which I happen to have the picture, my aunt gave it to me.",
        "Q: It sounds as if you had a very artistic family, is that right?",
        "A: No, I -- I don\u2019t think art -- artist -- artistic family doesn\u2019t come through genes. It\u2019s just\nif you have it, you have it. If you don\u2019t have it, don\u2019t have it.",
        "Q: Were you always -- always interested in art?",
        "A: I was always interested in art, even as a youngster, I went -- not as young, but when I\nwent to Budapest, when I lived in Budapest, I went to museums. I loved to go to\nmuseums. And so I always loved art, loved a lot of -- I loved architecture, I love bridges.\nI love bridges a lot. I found bridges just something -- something wonderful about it. So I\nlike that.",
        "Q: I should mention for anyone who would listen to this tape, that your house 1s filled\nwith beautiful art works, and paintings, some of which you\u2019ve created yourself.",
        "A: Thank you, thank you.",
        "Q: And when did you start painting and -- and making art yourself?",
        "A: As a hobby, as a hobby, started as a hobby, because I tried to fill my day. I\u2019m quite\nbusy now, so as I said, Ill get up 6:30 in the morning, but always try to squeeze in a few\nhours, if 1 can do it. I ben -- had -- have it easily, but 1 -- I started to paint some, but it\u2019s\njust -- I didn\u2019t feel a ba -- if it\u2019s not emotional, I don\u2019t do it. Has to -- has to be emotion --\nI judge -- as you notice it, I\u2019ve completely different -- different form of arts, but I do it\nemotion -- I buy a picture emotionally, not because it fits a d\u00e9cor, because blue doesn\u2019t fit\nwith yellow. So this how I do it. Matter of fact, I -- I did this sculpture, too, which is\ncalled \u201cThe Tower of Babel.\u201d",
        "Q: Does it have any more of a story to it that you want to say?",
        "A: Yes, it has a story. There 1s -- it\u2019s -- actually, it\u2019s happen under the Babylonian king,\nand they decided it\u2019s go -- they\u2019re going to build a tower to God. And this happened right\nafter Noah, and what happened is everybody spoke the single language. Everybody sti --\nstood each other. So they decided they\u2019re going to build a tower all the ways up to God.\nSo the angels came to God, he says, \u201cYou know somebody is building a tower, it\u2019s high\nup to You.\u201d So God said, \u201cNobody does it.\u201d And He destroyed the tower, and everybody\nspoke a different language. And the consequences was, there\u2019s nobody understood each\nother. And there\u2019s the reason you have all those crazy colors, nobody understands each\nother.",
        "Q: So this has -- this story --",
        "A: It\u2019s a Biblical thing, yes, yes, yeah --",
        "Q: -- has a special -- but it has a special, personal meaning?",
        "A: No, no, no, nothing personal meaning, I -- the -- the personal meaning is all those\nlanguages, and nobody talks the same one. We don\u2019t understand each other, we don\u2019t\nunderstand each other.",
        "Q: You -- your education was interrupted when you were a young man.",
        "A: Yes, was a young man, because I was at college in Hungary, and I was deported,\nbecause I was a Czech citizen at that time, it was a skirmish between Slovakia and\nHungary, and they arrested me, and I shall never forget it. | came home from the movie\nseeing \u201cModern Time,\u201d with Charlie Chaplin, and they arrested me, and they deported\nme. No, s -- I was in jail. Was jail for two or three days, and they w-wanted to deport me\nto ch -- back to Czechoslovakia. So I didn\u2019t want to go back to Czechoslovakia, because\nhe already occupied Sudatenland in Austria. So the only language I thought is similar to\nCzech, so I was deported to Poland. By the way, I want to -- I don\u2019t know if I said it,\nwhen I lived in Hungary, I played in the movies. I made two or three films with quite\nknown actors, which came finally to America, and became quite known actors here in\nAmerica.",
        "Q: You did mention it, but I wanted to ask if you -- were you always really interested in\nmovies, or did that just -- was just a matter of chance?",
        "A: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s came to be just by chance, and it suppl -- supplemented my income, because\nI -- I didn\u2019t have too much money. A matter of fact, the worst thing I could do, I was\npeddling vegetables, and this was -- I don\u2019t know why, it was extremely degrading for\nme, but not only this, I had to study at the same time. Usually you don\u2019t have a time to do\nthose things. B- But so the -- when I got the job in the summertime, playing in the movie,\nsupplemented my income quite well. And in Budapest I was quite a -- quite a bright man,\nbecause we had to do an essay, in the college we had to do an essay about -- I forgot what\nit was. And I and another fellow won the essay. And for my college, or all the colleges in\nmatter of fact, the compensation was this we allowed to -- we had a interview with the\nprelate of Hungary -- of my -- my so-called friend of mine, I went by ra-ra-railroad to a\ncity by the name of Estergum. Did I ever mention this story? I went to the city of\nEstergum, and we have int -- audience with the archbishop of Hungary, in the city of\nEstergum. So it wasn\u2019t only for my college, there was a lot of the college -- enormous,\nbig, big hall, gorgeous. And we staying in -- and we staying in a -- ina-- ina--ina\nsemi-circle, and the -- the archbishop comes out with a entourage of four or five people,\nand he go -- starts to face to the left, and he goes around, he goes around, everybody\nkisses his ring. And I said, \u201cI will not kiss this man\u2019s ring.\u201d So finally he comes to me --\nin th -- in -- in Hung-Hungary, you say, \u201cKasi chuclum,\u201d as a salutation. What this\nmeans, I kiss your hand. So I said, \u201cKasi chuclum,\u201d I shake his hand, no problem. Walks\naround, fine, a -- finishes, goes to the door, this one good looking, tall fellow, turns\naround, and to the t -- says something, and t-to the archbishop, see, and he turn -- the\narchbishop turns around, and the other fellow turns around, he looks at me, and does f --\npoints me. I said, \u201cI know, I\u2019m going to the execution. They going to kill me.\u201d I mean,\nwhy should he point to me? The -- the archbishop, and two more, three more men walk\nin, the tall, tall fellow. Those -- this -- me -- w-wave to me, and I should come to him. I\nsaid, \u201cDefinitely this is it, firing squad.\u201d Walk into the room, walk to his office, huge o --\nmarble, with a wonderful design on the floor. Takes me around the shoulder, and he says\nto me, \u201cI hear you\u2019re from a different per-persuasion.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d He says, \u201cWhat are\nyou?\u201d \u201cA-A-A Jew.\u201d So that\u2019s fine, says, talks to me -- matter of fact, everybody got\nsandwiches, or some kind of -- like a box lunch, it was something that I ate with him. I\nate with him. And during the conversation, he says to me, \u201cWould you like to see where I\ngoing to be buried?\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s very unusual to ask somebody [indecipherable] to be\nburied.\u201d He says, \u201cSure.\u201d He takes me down, he takes me down to the catacombs. So\nwhen you walk down to the basement, or so-called catacombs, th-there\u2019s a -- a double\nstaircase -- one -- both sides, there\u2019s a staircase going down. So on each one on the end,\nthere\u2019s a statue. So he says to me, \u201cI bet you you don\u2019t know what those statues mean.\u201d I\ndidn\u2019t know a Jew is allowed to bet. But it was very easy. One statue was a black statue,\nhad a f -- a torch facing up, and the other side the statues had a f -- torch facing down. I\nsaid, \u201cThis 1s life, and this is death.\u201d So he very s -- was very impressed with it. And I\nwalked down, he showed me the niche where he\u2019s going to be buried, and we walked\nback up. And was for quite a pleasant thing, and a matter of fact, I was extremely\nflattered, oh, I was so flattered. The fellow who I came on the railroad, wasn\u2019t too\nflattered with me. Matter of fact, he never spoke to me since. Not ev -- since, now I don\u2019t\nknow where he is, but h-he wasn\u2019t Jewish, he never spoke to me, he was so jeal --",
        "Q: Why do you think that he was jealous?",
        "A: He was jealous, just jealous.",
        "Q: And this was the actual archbishop who had taken you down, and showed you\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Yes, yes, the archbishop of Hungary, yes, yes, yes. Or this tall fellow, I was -- oh, he\nlooked like a movie actor. Yes, this was arch -- the archbishop, in the city of Estergum.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you a little more about your -- your education, what you were\nstudying, and --",
        "A: At college I was studying architecture. I was studying architecture, but we stopped\nwith it, so we didn\u2019t do it. So Hitler took care of this also.",
        "Q: Did you ever want to go back and study architecture again, or do that?",
        "A: I would love to go s -- I wanted to go [indecipherable] but except I have to make a\nliving. I came to America with six dollars in my pocket.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: -- again that --",
        "A: Which one was it? When -- when I came to America, I came with six dollars in my\npocket. Actually, they gave me 10 dollars before I left, except I spent 21 days on the -- on\nthe -- on -- at sea. I left in a ship by the name of Ernie Pyle, and landed with Merle\nMarlane, because we had to transfer inich -- in the English channel, from one ship to the\nnext, and the waves were tremendous, it was a tremendous storm there, and England\nwouldn\u2019t let us in, the 800 refugees, they wouldn\u2019t let us in. Even I came as a political\nescapee, but anyways, as it was part of the 800 s -- passengers. I came -- we landed April\nthe first, 1947, in the harbor of New York, and I decide I gonna s -- la --sta -- start my life\nall over. I had an old, old overcoat. I took the overcoat and dropped it in the Hudson\nriver. So I came with a thing, with a s -- only suit, a -- a suitcase of books, and six bucks,\nand this how m -- I started my life. So I had an aunt of mine, which I went to stay with\nmy aunt for a little while, except they was almost as poor as I was. So, I had to find a job.\n[ -- I -- since I sub -- mentioned before, I played in the movies, I got a contact to Eddie\nCantor. And Eddie Cantor was in contract at that time to RKO, and they offered me a job,\na job o -- to be an usher in Radio City Music Hall, or become a waiter in -- up in the\nCatskills, some hotel in the Catskills. I didn\u2019t want to do any of those two. I didn\u2019t want\nto be a server, be an usher showing seats, or being a server in a hotel, so I declined all\nthose offers. So I got myself a job -- actually, my cousin got me a job in S. Klein, there\nwas a department store, an S. Klein, I got a job for 28 dollars a week, 60 hours a day. Six\ndays, 10 hours a day. After tax and everything else, I came home with 24 dollars. Out of\nthe 24 dollars, I had to give 15 dollars to my aunt for room and board. Actually, it was\nonly room, and a Sunday dinner. Everything else had to be my own, so with the subway,\nwhich I think at that time was a nickel or dime, I didn\u2019t have too much money. So I lived\non one sandwich a day, and I lived on salami sandwiches for months. Simple reason is, I\ndidn\u2019t speak English -- I hardly spoke English, and I go into the cafeteria, I saw ona\nboard, salami. So I said salami in [indecipherable] language must be salami. So I walk\ndown the line and I said to the fellow, the server that was serving, \u201cSalami.\u201d He says\nsomething to me, I didn\u2019t understand it, but he had a long knife, and he pointed to a rye\nbread, so I wave my head, and so he made me a salami sandwich, and when you got the\nregister, there were kind of small containers of milk, so I took two containers of milk.\nAfter one week, or two weeks, he knew already. So I went to the -- came to the end of my\nline, my salami sandwich was waiting on -- for me. After this m -- I found -- my sister\ncame here, found my sister, so I had to save some money even to send it to her. So, I\nlived on salami sandwiches quite some time.",
        "Q: Tell me -- it was so -- you did mention in your video interview how you had thrown\nyour coat into the Hudson river, and that was so remarkable to me that you had done that,\nand I -- I wanted to hear a little bit more about what made you do that.",
        "A: I-It -- oh, it was -- actually, it was a rebirth. I was born again. That\u2019s what I felt. By\nthe way, I didn\u2019t see the Statue of Liberty that day, it was foggy. But I felt, I want to start\nwith zero. If I could ha -- cou -- dressed completely naked, I would have done it, because\nI found out this my new life. It\u2019s wa -- the past, and I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t want to dwell of my\npast. Plas is -- pa -- past is only history, so maybe it should teach you some -- but I cannot\ndwell on it. According my father -- my father said, \u201cHate takes a tremendous big effort.\u201d\nAnd I don\u2019t have this effort, I just can\u2019t take this effort to hate. I -- that\u2019s the reason --\nmaybe it\u2019s wrong, I don\u2019t hate. I just don\u2019t know how to hate. In coming to America, I\nfelt this was the only thing that you ca -- I could shed. If I would have clothing in my\nsuitcase, I would have thrown out too, but I only had books, and those I wouldn\u2019t part\nwith. So, this was a rebirth, this was definitely a rebirth, throwing the coat.",
        "Q: What books did you have in your suitcase?",
        "A: Concentration camp history. History of concentration -- some prints from Kaita\nKolbitz, a lot of prints, and matter of fact, I wrote a book. And I was introduced to Walter\nWinchell. Not a very pleasant man. Matter of fact, the first day I met him, it was quite a\nshock anyways. And I wrote a book, an outline of a book which -- with -- with -- with\ndiagrams, which I wanted to publish and -- through him, I think through him, I met Dotty\nSchift, which was owner -- owner of The Post. At that time it\u2019s called the Piama Post, and\n[ -- she was a very gracious lady, and I showed her the outline of the book, and she said,\n\u201cYoung man, if I am you, I would not do it, because we don\u2019t want to awake bad\nfeelings, or bad precedent. Let\u2019s stop hating.\u201d Or something in this context. So anyways,\nI was a little disappointed, and I took my diary, and I threw it away, which I always\nregret to this day. But thanks to her, I -- I didn\u2019t write it. So I came here, so I had to -- to -\n- to -- to make a living, so -- and, by the way, two years later, I was drafted in United\nStates army. And I\u2019ve been -- I\u2019m one of them who went to the Korean war.",
        "Q: You went to the Korean war?",
        "A: Yes. I was drafted -- I was -- never been overseas. I was -- became a surgic -- I went\nto Texas, and I became a surgical technician, and they send me to Fort Lewis,\nWashington, and I worked in the infirmary there. Let me tell you an incident in -- two\nincidents in the state of -- in -- in the fort. I-In -- in Texas, in San Antonio, Texas. This\nwas the first time the two integrated battalions, we were sleeping with blacks, and whites,\nand everything together, except when we went on a subway, or we went on the trolley\ncars, we were not allowed to be together. S-So, this was the bi -- the President Truman\u2019s\nidea, but anyways, didn\u2019t work out very well. After this, I went to Fort Lewis, and I\nworked in the infirmary til I was discharged.",
        "Q: Had you ever seen a black person before you came to the United States?",
        "A: Yes, I saw them twice. There was a circus by the name of Hargendorf -- Har-\nHargendas -- something Hargen something. And he was part of the circus performance.\nOtherwise, I never saw a cir -- eventually I saw a circ -- when I was f -- liberated, I saw\nthese black soldiers. I saw them in the camp, they were playing baseball, but not -- never\nsaw one before.",
        "Q: Did it surprise you that there was this prejudice in the United States against black\npeople, that there should be this segregation?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if it was surprise, because I went through quite a few years with that\nsame prejudice, and -- and I had no -- no -- no contact with them at that time. The first\ntime -- the contact that I had was when I worked for S. Klein department store, and I --\nI\u2019d never saw the prejudice. In the city of -- the subway of New York was not segregated,\nso I didn\u2019t see it til I wa-wind up in San Antonio, Texas, where the -- su -- where the fact\nof segregation is true. The fact of segregation.",
        "Q: Did you experience anu -- any of that prejudice personally?",
        "A: In the army. Sure there ba -- in an army, but a matter of fact, a incident, I took basic\ntraining 1n fort -- in Fort Dix, and there\u2019s -- I\u2019m sitting, we having lunch, all -- wa --\nsomething, sitting in the mess hall. And there\u2019s a fellow across from me, his name, I shall\nnever forget, his name is Deutsch. And he says to me, talking -- let me emphasize, we in\nAmerican uniforms. And he says to you -- me, \u201cAre you a German?\u201d And I knew\nsomething going to happen. And I say, \u201cYes.\u201d He says, \u201cYou know, Hitler did a good\njob?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d He said, \u201cHe killed all the Jews.\u201d So I had a big, big\npitcher of hot, hot -- they just poured the hot, hot coffee. So I held his collar, and I poured\nit over his head, and he got third degree burns. And he dropped in agony, so the captain\ncomes in, he says to Deutsch, he says, \u201cHereby ordering you to press charges against,\u201d --\nme. Fine. He walks out, and I bend down to b -- said, \u201cDeutsch, if you press charges, you\ngoing to die.\u201d I said, \u201cNot only this, as long as I\u2019m in this army, you going to be with\nme.\u201d He says, \u201cI going to get out of the army before you.\u201d I said, \u201cNever going to\nhappen.\u201d Sure enough, Deutsch, every morning after you -- with the band -- they took off\n[indecipherable] with the red -- red face. Every morning, before he got out -- after he got\nout of bed to urinate -- before he got out of bed, he urinate in the bed, and walked out.\nAnd after a month, they discharged him. Deutsch got out.

        "A: CIC, CIC.",
        "Q: And also that you were working -- were you working for the Joint Distribution\nCommittee?",
        "A: I was -- only as a job. This was only as a job. I worked for CIC. During the war, I\nworked in it -- for the CIC, through -- through my professor, I had the professor by the\nname of Zahn.",
        "Q: How do you spell that?",
        "A: Z-a-h-n. [indecipherable] think about this, this man was always -- was -- fascinated\nme. He had one eyebrow, went from one side of the head to the other side. It\u2019s str -- one,\nsingle eyebrow, which was very, very dynamic man. He was not my idol, I had a idol of\nprofessor of philosophy. But anyways, through him I -- I went to the -- became -- went to\nthe underground, til finally, I we -- we -- went to CIC, and I worked in the CIC, and I\nworked in a -- I worked in a place called the inflowsunkunstad. Inflowsunkunstad means\nthey were delousing uniform which came back, and not only this, they were fixing\nuniform. So my job was -- I had liaison only one woman, her name was Ren\u00e9es, I don\u2019t\nknow what the other name is. She was a French lady. I don\u2019t know if she was Jewish or\nnot. She with one daughter in -- in Paris, and a husband who was killed, he work --\nworked for the underground. So we -- so when we saw a uniform come with a patch, let\u2019s\nsay, from the third panzer division. So I told her, you know, we got 19 uniform which\ncame from the city of Pulsk. So she g -- I don\u2019t know what she did with it, but this how\nwe did that thing -- we did -- she found out where every division, or what division came\nfrom what -- where -- plus we had a lot of cape -- lot of concentration camp women\nsewing strof boots, for the Russian army to put over the shoes, because the winters were\nvery severe. And that\u2019s when I worked for the CIC, and til -- til finally -- til August the\nthird -- August the second, I went back to the concentration camp where my parents was,\nbecause I found out through a -- through the grapevine that -- I don\u2019t think it was through\nprof -- professor Zahn, that my father was dying. So I went to see him, and I brought --\nmatter of fact, that\u2019s m-my -- the only thing my sister remembers, I brought -- bought --\nbreak glucose sugar, something, because this -- he needed glucose for whatever he had.\nAnyways, unfortunately, the next day they rounded us up, and I was one of them, and\nthey send us to Auschwitz. So this was my job with the CIC -- with the CIC drop, there --\nbut I lived in the city of Transtahova as a German. My German was better than any of the\nGermans lived there, even the -- the bullov, the head of the thing, my German was better,\nso except -- wherever I was, my German was not the right dialect where I came from,\nbecause what I speak is holkdeutsch, which cames from one section only, which 1s\nHanover. But, I survived it, and the lady, let me tell you something about this lady.\nGorgeous lady, matter of fact, I show you a picture of her, I have a picture of her.",
        "Q: Oh, you\u2019re talking about Rainia?",
        "A: Rainia, yes. But any bigshot who wanted to sleep with her, she slept with. The\nconsequence was unpleasant for the man, who was [indecipherable] killed, but she -- she\nslept with anybody -- any big shot who would want to sleep with her. She was really\nwith the high echelon. And with CIC, let me tell you, it\u2019s not as exotic as it sounds. I\ndon\u2019t know anything. What they tell me to do, I did. I -- my specialty was railroad\nsabotaging. She was m -- only contact I had, and I don\u2019t know anybody who she had. I --\nthat\u2019s the reason that it was -- only I know her by the first name is, because in case the\n[indecipherable] me, Rainia is -- s -- anybody could be Rainia. So there always was a\nsure. I lived in a -- in a Polish home, which was -- he was a watchmaker. They gave me a\nroom there, which I went home.

        "Q: So you -- they had no idea that you were Jewish?",
        "A: No. No, no. The only difficulty I had was -- was urination. We ate there with the\nGermans, th-the -- the Jews, I didn\u2019t know who it was. I wore -- I was what\u2019s called an\nausdeutscher, a -- a German who came from the -- in Russia, they used to have a big\nGerman colony, so I came one of the [indecipherable] office -- one of the ausdeutschers.\nAnd Zahn gave me the papers. Before I went to the city, he told me I -- I took a lesson --\na course, what movie played three weeks ago, what -- what gossip happened four weeks\nago. So -- so when I came in there, I knew whatever was going on. But, while the -- while\nthe ch -- head of the -- was the head of the f -- bullov, he happened to like me, and so I\nused to eat lunch with him. I don\u2019t know if I told you an incident. I was sitting with him,\nhaving lunch one day, and during the conversation, he says to -- I -- he -- whatever he\nsaid, he says da -- I said, \u201cDa ista huntbigram,\u201d which means, actually tr-translation\nmeans, here where the dog is buried. But this doesn\u2019t mean a thing. Actually this means\nyou hit it right on the head. That\u2019s all what it means. Da ista huntbigram. So he said,\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that funny? The first time I heard -- the only time I heard it before was from a\nJew.\u201d",
        "Q: How did you respond to that?",
        "A: Scary. Scary, scary, but this was extreme a -- a matter of fact, I tell the --",
        "Q: Did you just laugh, or something?",
        "A: No, no, no, nothing, because he just said it doesn\u2019t mean da -- Jews, he said it. Matter\nof fact, I went back, and I told it to Rainia, I said, \u201cYou know [indecipherable] you stay\nthere til we let you know.\u201d They never let me know, but finally she -- she\u2019s the one who\ntold me that we know that your father\u2019s dying.",
        "Q: I wondered if you became involved in working with the -- the underground, the\ncounter-intelligence during the war, because you were seeking it out, or did they come\ncru -- you become somebody new --",
        "A: I did not seek it out, I was too young to seek it out, and -- and -- and I w -- I did not\nseek it out, they say -- s -- s -- I -- they looked for me, because I\u2019m bilingual. I spoke\nGerman, I spoke Czech, I speak Polish, I speak Hungarian, I sp -- so -- so -- so I\u2019ve --\nwherever they wanted me, I fit in quite well. And I spoke Polish better than a -- a native. I\nspoke Polish, and the one thing they didn\u2019t let me get in touch with -- with -- with the\nunderground, with the -- the partisans, because they would not trust them, because the\npartisans at that time, had the double -- dual -- dual loyalty. One is to the Russian party,\nto the Russian facture, and one is -- was to the English facture. So they\u2019d never touch me.\nThey never trusted them, so they -- I tried to stay away from them as much as I can. Plus,\nwe found out if -- if a Jew joined them, they killed him. They killed him. So that\u2019s what it\nwas.",
        "Q: How did you come to know all of those languages?",
        "A: Too necessary. I mean, I\u2019m a -- I\u2019m a Czech, I went to college to Hungary, my parents\nspoke German. So later I went to Poland, and I -- I -- they give me four months, I speak a\nlanguage well. Three months, I can -- can converse any language. In three months I can\nspeak it, in four months I\u2019m perfect.",
        "Q: It\u2019s just a -- a gift.",
        "A: It\u2019s not a gift. You notice that after 50 years my ger -- my English didn\u2019t improve. My\n-- maybe my vocabulary, but not my accent.",
        "Q: It sounds good to me.",
        "A: [inaudible]",
        "Q: Your -- we don\u2019t know anything about your religious -- whether you had a religious\neducation as a child, or your background in that way?",
        "A: No. Ica -- I -- I -- I -- I did not come from a religious background. I know I was\nJewish. I had a grandparents -- my mother\u2019s parents finally -- matter of fact, my father\ndid well, he brought over my grandmother and my grandfather, and step -- two\nstepbrothers, and a stepsister. No, no, not true. He brought over my grandparents, the two\nboys, and three girls. The two boys worked for my father, and I don\u2019t know what the\nthree girls did. All of them were spinsters, none of them got married. I tell you a story\nabout one of them. One of them finally got married, the younger one, and she married a\nfellow in Prague who became -- worked for insurance company. My father, by the way,\nworked for the underground. Did I ever say this?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: He worked for tuppa in -- in Prague [indecipherable] Polacks, well, you know the\nstory, yes. So a b -- I da -- Judaism was -- I mean, we observed profacto Judaism to s -- to\nappease my grandparents. So it was only the fact that my father went to the high holidays,\nand I had to stay next to him, which was boring. But I had no -- no Jewish background,\nand with me, I became an agnostic, a quite comfortable one. And Judaism with me is a\nreligion, but it\u2019s a philosophy, and I think it\u2019s a very ethical philosophy. And I\u2019m saying\nthat [indecipherable] I was -- feel Jewish only by -- because I was born into it, and I\nfound -- I studied philosophy, and I found that it\u2019s extremely ethical. And most of the\ncultures are based on Juda-Christian ethics.",
        "Q: You mentioned in your last interview that you had an interest in the Lubovitcher\nmovement.",
        "A: Yes, yes. I -- I -- I -- I -- I was -- I -- I took a psychology course, by the way, here, and\nI studied under Anna Freud, the daughter Anna Freud, very unhappy young lady. And\nthey -- she told me to -- a part of the thing to tell me to start -- she interview -- to try to\nhelp some ladies, and they were the Lubovitcher ladies. So I tried to help her, we had\nsome course, with Lubovitcher ladies, but abused ladies. So one lady came back black\nand blue, I said, \u201cHow often are you going to tell me you walked through a glass door? I\nmean, underneath your armpit, you don\u2019t walk through a glass door. And under your\nchin, you don\u2019t walk glass door.\u201d So anyways, I went to the Lubovitcher, I met the\nLubovitcher rabbi there, which was very unsuccessful, because eventually he let me\nunderstand it was -- you know, they\u2019re working very hard, and they have a lot of\npressure, and they -- whatever they have to do. I -- maybe they did -- I don\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t\nsay they deserve it, but it\u2019s -- maybe they -- they -- they falled, or something like this. So\nit was weer unpleasant, very unpleasant. So I didn\u2019t do too much with them. I found\nAnna Freud a very unpleasant la -- not unpleasant, unhappy lady. Lived with a woman\nwith the -- with a lady by the name of Birmingham, who was a heiress of Tiffany. She\nhad a husband and two children, she left them, and they had -- she was a homose -- both\nof them were lesbians. So they lived together. After she left here, she went to England,\nand started a ki -- like a girl\u2019s school, a kindergarten.",
        "Q: Did you have -- so it was more your -- your interest, and your involvement with the\nLubovitcher movement wasn\u2019t so much as you were interested in Hassidism --",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no Hassidism, only because of those ladies. Th-Th-\nThose ladies. Those ladies. I finally -- matter of fact, we have here, I just found out by the\nLubovotch -- Lubovitch temple, or something, and they tell me this Donald O\u2019Connor,\nthe movie actor who plays \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d whose son died because of the overdose,\nsomething\u2019? He gave the money to build this temple. Because, seems like when he was\ndown, her -- they -- has -- his son, they -- that\u2019s the only movement which took him in. I\ndon\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not, but that\u2019s what they told me. Excuse me.",
        "Q: So, at this point, you don\u2019t have a -- a strong sense of -- of faith, or --",
        "A: Religion?",
        "Q: -- religion of some sort?",
        "A: No. I have no -- no faith of religion not -- never had one, answer truthfully. And the\nonly thing 1s -- is I\u2019m an agnostic, which I\u2019d be -- be -- being in -- not being an atheist, 1s\nbut a sim -- simple statement in the Bible. The first statement in the Bible, which is in\nHebrew called Baraiship, means the beginning. I have a question with the beginning,\nbecause void creates void. There\u2019s nothing in void, can nothing be created but void. And\nsince something happened, there has to be a creation, a process of creation. If nobody can\ndispute it, that\u2019s -- excuse me, whatever did it, so I find the creation was something there.\nFor whoever it was, there is a creation. I don\u2019t dispute this creation. Matter of fact, I -- I\njust went yesterday, I took a course in the Bible, which I took every Thursday, but it\u2019s no\n-- no -- I\u2019m not only studying the Jewish Bible, I\u2019m studying -- I\u2019m studying the Koran\nalso. Funny thing is, I was talking to a physicist, he\u2019s a quite pronon -- and renowned\nphysicist. I said, \u201cIf you believe in the Big Bang theory, and the universe in expanding in\nextremely rapid space, is this still the consequence of -- of Big Bang theory, or this is\nonly in our solar system, and everything else 1s expanding of his own?\u201d He doesn\u2019t know\nit either. So, I\u2019m not the only one.",
        "Q: Okay. Going back to Munich -- we got a little bit out of that time frame, but you\nmentioned briefly that you were living with a German woman at the time.",
        "A: I was not -- let me -- I lived with a German family, Tossan. B-Before the war, bay --\nbefore the war, May the fifth -- the war ended May the fifth in Germany. In April,\nHossan, and two more boys, I think two boys and a girl, made a push, or made a -- a\nstatement 1n the u -- in -- in the high school. The boy was arrested, and the other ones,\ntoo, and they were executed on meat hooks in the butcher shop,. That\u2019s the lady I stayed\nwith.",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?",
        "A: No. If I said at that time, may be it, but I don\u2019t remember that now. And that\u2019s why I\nstayed in the city of Borsty. It is outside of Munich.",
        "Q: Do you want to say some more about your work with the CIC after the war?",
        "A: CIC, yes, after the war, I finally w-wind up in -- in Munich again, and I lived with a\nlady in Borsty, and I got a job to -- to Jewish -- Jewish -- some Jewish organization. And\nI\u2019m working that Jewish organization, and Rainia, the woman which I left in Poland\nsomeplace, which I never knew if she 1s there. I don\u2019t know how she found me, it\u2019s still a\nm-mystery to me. And she says, \u201cWe need you.\u201d I says, \u201cYou don\u2019t need me, because\nI\u2019m finished with it.\u201d She says, \u201cNo, now we have to look for Nazis.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to do\nit, but anyways, I -- I -- I felt I shou -- I owe her something, because I survived it. My\nsister -- I didn\u2019t know about my sister, I was the only one who was left. So, I start to\nworking for the CIC again. Actually it was under the MI five. This is the military\nintelligence five, but later I found out that\u2019s was -- be -- to transferred to MI six, but still\nto me it was the CIC.",
        "Q: Is this a part of the British army?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. I worked for the British. And I was starting to look for Nazis. So I look\nfor Nazis, and it was ba -- I went. That\u2019s the reason I wound up back in Poland, I --\nbecause I looked for some Nazis there, wound up in Germany all over, and this how I\nfound up in -- in the city of Lodz, where they transferred me there, August the -- 1944,\nand this where I found my food stamps for my mother, my sister, and myself. Anyways, I\nwas unsuccessful of finding the Nazis they wanted to -- me to find. I was looking for a\nparticular Nazi. Seems like he was a important person the Nazi apparatus in -- in the\nBritish zone. So they send me to a city of Oofa, and the na -- allegedly the woman knew\nwhere he was. So I went to see the lady, and she says she wants 10,000 dollars. Not\npounds, she wanted 10,000 dollars. I go right to my colonel, he says, you know she wants\n-- he said, \u201cGive it to her.\u201d I said, \u201cHa ha, what are you talk about?\u201d He says, \u201cNext time\nyou go, you going to bring her the money.\u201d Not knowing -- this what I -- I\u2019m not -- I\ndon\u2019t say it\u2019s a fact, maybe it\u2019s not, they had false, counterfeit dollars, and that\u2019s what he\nwanted to give me. Anyways, I w -- I didn\u2019t know it at that time. I\u2019m going with the\n10,000 dollar, and I went to the lady, says, \u201cOkay, where is he?\u201d She says, \u201cI\u2019m not going\nto tell you.\u201d Said, \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t got to tell me? I came all the way from\n[indecipherable] came all the way to Oofa, and you say you don\u2019t want to tell me?\u201d She\nsays, \u201cYou people going to leave shortly, and I going to have to stay with them.\u201d And she\ndidn\u2019t tell me. I traveled all over. I looked for other ones too, but he was the main Nazi.\nNever found him. Finally I\u2019m coming to America, two re -- two years later. The sergeant,\nwho was a sergeant in the CIC, and a British boy, his parents, during the -- before the\nwar, during the war, they moved to California. So he came to -- to see his parents, so he\nstopped over there, so -- so -- by them already a bigshot. I lived in New York, I went to a\nnightclub with him, took him out, everything is fine. The last day I see him, I said to him,\n\u201cBy the way, what happened to this fellow?\u201d He said, \u201cWe got him,\u201d he said, \u201cisn\u2019t that\nwonderful?\u201d \u201cWhere was he?\u201d Said, \u201cHe was your cook.\u201d He was a cook in a CIC\nheadquarters. We never knew it. How we found him was his girlfriend reported him.\nOtherwise, we wouldn\u2019t ever find him, so you see --",
        "Q: He was right under your noses.",
        "A: He was right there, and we never knew he was the cook in a CIC headquarters. So,\nafter a ba -- well, I [indecipherable] funny thing let -- sorry. When I lived in Munich, I\ndidn\u2019t -- na -- before I worked for the CIC actually, I used to change butter for -- for\nopera tickets. So I -- yeah, I remember I gave a big slab of butter to get a opera ticket,\nthat\u2019s the only way I saw the operas in -- in Munich.",
        "Q: You also mentioned, just briefly, that you had -- you were supposed to go to Poland,\nto see whether the AK, the Armia Kryova --",
        "A: Yeah, Armia Kryova, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- was -- whether they were -- were --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that\u2019s the reason I went to Poland, I -- I didn\u2019t remember why\nI went to Poland. He tells me this day is -- the Jews who came back to the city, ma --\nespecially the city of Nemuveradim, they were killed. The legend is supposed to be an\norganization which kills the Jews. He never heard of it, I never heard of it, see what\u2019s --\nwhat happen. I couldn\u2019t think why I went back to -- to -- to -- to Lodz, I went back to -- to\n-- to Prague, to -- to -- to -- to Poland. And I found out, sure enough, there\u2019s a\norganization called Arma Kryova, the army of the land. So what happened, if a Jew came\nback to his little town, or wherever town he came, and he wanted his property back, so\nsome Polack took it over. A-After the Germans left, the Polack took it over, and now the\nPolack has it, so they want the army, so instead of giving it to them, they killed them.\nThey killed those thing. Matter of fact, I sent some pictures to the holo -- gave some\npictures to the Holocaust Museum with those people who perished, after the war, finally\ncoming back after the concentration camp, and they killed them. This why I went to\nPoland, I couldn\u2019t think why I was in Poland, the Arma Kryova.",
        "Q: Did you have any direct dealing with anyone from the Armia Kryova?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t have any but -- dealing thas he was an Army Kryova, because nobody\u2019s\nadmit that he killed somebody. But I dealing with Polish people that took \u2019'm a -- \u2019ma\nPolack, too. So they\u2019ll -- dealt with him. A matter of fact, Pll tell you a little incident\nwhat happened to me. I\u2019m in the city of Cherzohova, I walk -- I have the open shirt, what\nI had a big, ebony cross, I used to wear a big, ebony cross. I\u2019m walking up the hill, and\nthere\u2019s another fellow, a drunken, walks down the hill, and he points at me, and he says,\n\u201cPar shiva zhiya,\u201d smelly Jew. I said, \u201cOh my God, I must smell even with the cross on\nmy chest.\u201d This was my encounter with par shiva zhia. And that\u2019s the reason I wound up\n-- I couldn\u2019t think why I was in Poland, that\u2019s the reason. Looking for Arma Kryova.",
        "Q: Did you look -- did you have -- did you look Jewish?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t look -- never looked Jewish.",

        "A: I look Aryan, I look Aryan.",
        "Q: You were able to get --",
        "A: It\u2019s a -- matter of fact, when I went in -- when I work 1n [indecipherable] think the\nGermans were more scared of me than I was of them, because I spoke a better German\nthan those -- those volkdeutscher who came to him. No, no, never -- never had problem\nlooking Jewish. Matter of fact, there was one incident. I don\u2019t like to talk about this one\nwith somebody. I stood next to a Nazi, and he showed me what he did with a child. I\ndon\u2019t want to talk about it.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t have to talk about it. You did mention it, first interview. Let\u2019s see. \u2019m\ngoing to flip the tape.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side A, of an interview with Beno Helmer. Do you remember\nwhat you were doing -- y-you mentioned you were working for a Jewish organization,\nmaybe JDC. Do you remember what you were doing with that organization?",
        "A: O-Only registering people, nothing more. N-No capacity at all, just registering people,\nm-manual -- you know, bookkeeping -- not even bookkeeping, just r-registering the\nnames. And f -- f -- and one more thing, I went to look for my sister, wherever I went to |\n-- | went to -- months later, I went to look -- wherever I went, I went to look for my sister.\nAnd I don\u2019t know if I mentioned how I met my sister, or that I -- if I met somebody at\nthe crossing of -- a street crossing, where somebody was coming out of Landsberg. So\nyou know that story, how I met my sister.",
        "Q: But I wasn\u2019t sure how -- did -- did that person know you?",
        "A: No, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. We stop at the light. I stop -- I was on the flat\ntruck. We stop at the light, and we just have to cross light. The traffic goes one direction,\ntraffic goes all direction, because the t -- the little traffic light became green. During the\ncrossing, somebody says, \u201cHow is Sonya?\u201d Sonya is a very popular name. I don\u2019t know\nwho said it, I never saw it, it\u2019s just a mob of people going one way, mob of people going\nthe other way. And I say, \u201cShe is dead.\u201d And the boy said, \u201cI just saw her.\u201d Doesn\u2019t mean\nit was towards me, maybe he d-does know me, maybe is -- he meant his cousin Sonya,\nwhatever it is. And on this assumption, I kept on looking for my sister again. I never\nthought that she going to be -- survive, I always look for my brother. My parents, I don\u2019t\nknow, maybe yes, maybe not. My father was very, very sick. So, the only one I was\nlooking for my brother, because he was a -- hunky -- a ch-chunky guy. No, so this what\nwas.",
        "Q: Yeah, and you told about how you -- how you found your sister, but did you ever find\nout anything certain about your brother and your parents?",
        "A: Iam -- I was, not any more -- I was involved in the national Red Cross. Matter of fact,\nthey just called me maybe two months ago, in Switzerland, but they -- the -- the -- the --\nthe Red Cross in Boca, here, the Red Cross in -- they got in touch with Polish Red Cross,\nthere\u2019s no traces. I put traces on -- on the computer, all the Irving Helmer in United\nStates. By coincident, there\u2019s six of them, but none of them are my brother, yeah.",
        "Q: So you never found out for certain?",
        "A: Never, no, no. He\u2019s an old man now, the same as I am. I never found him. Never\nfound about Ronyek -- Monyek Ravel, and all you ha -- funny thing is, some years ago, I\nwas thinking I would like to meet Rainia again, I don\u2019t even know where she 1s. She was,\nI think eight years older than I was.",
        "Q: At that time, did you have any -- did you have any interest in -- you mentioned just a\nlittle bit that you were thinking, well, while you were in Teplice, and you had the\nproblem with -- with possibly being drafted into the Russian army, that you were\nconsidering Israel, but you had an aunt in the United States. Did you have any sense,\nwhile you\u2019re there in Munich, of where you really wanted to be, where you wanted to\nsettle?",
        "A: I want -- I wanted to go to Israel. And I had an uncle, my father\u2019s oldest brother, who -\n- I got -- h-he got in touch with me, or I -- I don\u2019t remember. No, I got in touch through --\nthrough the organization, I was working for them. And he wrote me a letter, he says, if I\nshould try, by all means, come to America, because your aunt, Marcia Kramer lives there,\ntry to get in touch with her. And he gave me the address of her. And because poverty, we\nhave poverty in -- in Israel, it\u2019s 1947, or 1946, right after the war, it\u2019s right before the\nindependence. That\u2019s the reason I didn\u2019t go to Israel.",
        "Q: Did you have strong Zionist feelings at that point, or --",
        "A: No, no. I did not have -- my father had strong Zionist feeling. I wa -- I was -- you have\nto realize I -- I was school, and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and self survi-survival\nfor all those years. So -- so, emotionally, I was surviving -- s-surviving. I\u2019m extremely for\nIsrael now, but at that time, I just want to go somewheres getting out of Europe, which I -\n- | -- if not the circumstance, I would stay in Teplice, because I love Teplice. But at that\ntime, the Russians took over it, they dealt me an ugly, ugly hand.",
        "Q: Why did you feel more strongly about Israel than the United States, for example?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know anything about the United States. And -- and -- and -- and be-being\nthrough -- going to all that last few years, with all the hate against Jews, and everything\nelse, I thought something -- Israel\u2019s going to be the place, at least I don\u2019t gotta feel this\nhate. So I don\u2019t -- so -- so that\u2019s what it was. But I would like -- I want to go out of\nEurope, and finally through -- my uncle gave me the address, I was sponsored to go to\nAmerica. I needed only a sponsor because I was a political escapee, I wasn\u2019t as a refugee.\nSo that\u2019s the reason I came here.",
        "Q: How did it feel to be in Germany, and -- and presumably dealing with Germans, after\nwhat you had been through?",
        "A: As I said before, I don\u2019t hate. No problem.",
        "Q: You got along well with the woman who you were staying with?",
        "A: Oh, she was -- listen, she -- she hated Nazis more than I do. She lost her son on -- on\nthe meathook. And she just lost him maybe for -- the week before the end of the war -- a\nmonth before end of the war. I mean, she is a bitter, old lady. I mean, I -- I -- I beca -- you\nknow, I became that [indecipherable], I became an orphaned. But it was bewildering. I\nnever cried for my mother, I never cried for my parents. First time I think I cried was\nwhen I was free. I mean, because I knew -- I knew, definitely I knew that my fate going\nto be exactly the same as theirs. So it was only timing. If I don\u2019t do it today, going to be\nthe day after tomorrow. I had never -- and when I was in the concentration camp, I never\nfought fate. Fate became my big thing. If they tell me stay, I stay, sit, sit. Whatever they\ndo, because I said, I never knew what I gonna do. If I go left, and that\u2019s supposed to go\nright, I said, you know, should have, could have, would have. It is one thing I never say,\nis should have, could have, would have. It doesn\u2019t exist. So, how do I know what I\u2019m\ndoing right, if I -- seems like what I did was right. But one time, I -- I tested fate. I\nsupposed to b -- go to a coal mine, and [indecipherable] me to go to a coal mine, so I\nroped it off, because I said, coal mine is -- is definitel that. So I tried [indecipherable]\nbecame a cook to one of the Nazis in Auschwitz. And that\u2019s how I survived.",
        "Q: Did you talk with the -- the German woman that you stayed with about your\nexperiences, or did she ask you about what had happened to you during the war?",
        "A: No, I did not. Simple reason is, because I worked for the CIC. So I did not talk about\nit. She thought I was a -- joined the ausdeutscher as a German.",
        "Q: So you were still working for the CIC as --",
        "A: [indecipherable] after I get that apartment over there, yes. It\u2019s in back of -- yes, yes.",
        "Q: Was that difficult, to not be -- after what you had been through, and having to take on\nan -- an identity.",
        "A: It\u2019s becoming acting. It became acting, I mea -- you became an actor. You acted, and\nyou became a big shot, because I\u2019m looking for those bastards. You know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a bi\n-- became a more -- little bit more important than anything else, and I was looking for\nthem. So that\u2019s what it was, so -- so she didn\u2019t know it. Banya knew I was Jewish, and th-\nth-the HIAS -- it wasn\u2019t HIAS, it was J -- J-Jewish something. I worked for them. So they\nknew it, and finally the -- Rainia gave me the apartment with this lady, and she moved --\ntwo houses further down, she lived. She ga -- she got it to me, yes. I mean, the story is I\ncame to Teplice -- to Munich smuggling myself out through -- from t -- from Teplice,\nthrough -- through marinepart, and Haganah smuggled me over, and at the border, he\nsays, \u201cAnybody who has the papers, has to s-surrender his papers, all the papers.\u201d So I\nwas smart enough not to give him my papers, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t even come to\nAmerica, because I would have no history where I come from. And that\u2019s one -- all of a\nsudden, I\u2019m be -- coming to -- I\u2019m going to the country which hated me, which killed\neverybody of my family.

        "Q: And then -- then you had gotten in touch with your aunt? Is that how -- how you made\nthe decision to come to the United States?",
        "A: That\u2019s was only one -- no -- it was only the decish -- decision to come -- the decision\nwas made for me, cause that\u2019s was the only papers I got. So I got the papers. By then, I\nfound my sister. When I found my sister, she had papers to go to Canada, as a domestic.\nSo I found her just by coincidence, a domestic, this was -- so by then, I want to be near\nher. So definitely Israel was out, Palestine was out at that time. America became the more\nlogical thing, and not only this, I know my uncle lived in New York, so she got herself a\njob in Hamilton, which is right on the Canadian border, as a domestic, working for the\ndoctor. Very attractive young lady. First night, he did sexual advances to her. So she quit,\nwent back to the camp there, and after that she got a job as a domestic for a Dr. Cohen,\nwhich now they adopted as a child, and matter of fact, two boys, which are also fi --\nphysicians. They like sisters and brothers. And that\u2019s the reason I stayed in New York,\nand she should be -- now she lives in Toronto.",
        "Q: You mentioned just a little bit about your journey to the United States, and the -- and\nthe trouble that you went through. Do you want to talk more about that journey?",
        "A: Yes. I left Hamburg, and 21 days later -- I left on a ship by the name of Merle Marlane\n-- no, no, I left on a ship of Ernie Pyle, and came on a ship of Merle Marlane. We broke\ndown in English Channel, we lost some motor, something like this. They fixed it -- but\nthey couldn\u2019t fix it, so we had to be transferred, as I said, from Ernie Pyle, to the Merle\nMarlane. It was -- the waves were unbelievable high, we had to do it on those rope\nladders. Before we were transferred, they locked us -- they -- they locked the women on\ntop, and the men down in the hole. The only thing they had, because after all those days\nwe ran out of food. So the only th -- that they fed us, was Coca-Cola, in bottles. At that\ntime, Coca-Cola came in bottles. So we were drinking Coca-Cola. So when the whole --\nwhen the ship was going from one side to the other, the b -- Coca b-bottles, the glass\nbroke, so we were stepping on glass, so we couldn\u2019t -- we were scared to walk, so we\nwere sitting, and -- and -- and we stayed there for quite a few days, til finally we were\ntransferred on -- to the Merle Marlane. The -- the -- usually, a trip takes six days, we did\nit in 21 days. So the crossing was not very pleasant one. Came here, was a foggy day, as I\nsaid, I throw my coat into the river -- Hudson river. And I met my uncle, the fellow who\nsponsored me. But I couldn\u2019t stay with him, I stayed with my -- my aunt, on a fi-five\nfloor walk-up, in the Bronx. Think she was as poor as I was. Seems like she subsidized\nher living -- or income, my mother gave her some arts before she came to America, she\ngave her some paintings. She was selling those painting, and carpeting, and this what she\nlived on. So -- and by that time, after the war, she was as poor as I was. She had two\ngirls, unhappy. S --",
        "Q: When you were on the ship, did you -- were you thinking much about what kind of\nlife you were heading towards, and what you wanted it to be? And what was the mood\namong the passengers?",
        "A: The mood of them, the passenger, was quite optimistic, because they\u2019re finally going\nto anew country, they\u2019re going to a new country. So, was optimistic in itself this -- be\ntrying something new, and -- and I happen to like challenges. I love challenges. I like to\ntry something new. I try anything which I didn\u2019t try before. And -- and scary. What\u2019s\ngoing to be with me? What going to be with? I don\u2019t speak English, I have no job, I have\nno profession, I have no money. What\u2019s going to be? I have a sister in Canada, how do I\ngoing to help her? And this was ma -- always predominantly in my mind, is how do I\ngoing to help my sister. And that\u2019s the reason I took a job -- a we -- we -- job for 60\nhours, with eating one salami sandwich.",
        "Q: Do you remember other first impressions of -- of New York?",
        "A: Yes. The huge, huge building, and I said, \u201cThey never have sun here.\u201d I was f -- I felt\nalways sorry for the people who live -- he -- down on bottom. He took me to Wall Street,\nor something, the second or third day. And I said, \u201cLook at this. This wonderful country,\nand they have never see sunshine.\u201d Always felt so badly this is dark, they\u2019re never going\nto see sunshine. I never knew they go to work from -- from somewheres else, to the Wall\nStreet, but I thought they lived there, and everything is happen there. And okay, the --\nthat second day, we bought me a new suit in Ripley\u2019s, was the thing, and this is my first\nsuit. And three or four days later, I got the j -- I too -- she took me to the ot -- as I said to\nRKO, and it offered me the job, which I didn\u2019t want. So I got a job for S. Klein\ndepartment stores, 60 hours, and after two weeks, I became a supervisor, not even\nspeaking English, but I had an interpreter with me as a -- as a supervisor. Became\nsupervisor of receiving and shipping, in departments store of Kleins.",
        "Q: How was your relationship with your family here? Did they ask you about what had\nhappened during the war? Did you f -- want to talk about it?",
        "A: They did not want to know too much, and I was not ready to ev -- reveal myself. I -- I\ndidn\u2019t feel like exposing myself. You know, the -- the -- the -- the -- that was tredding me\n-- they were treating me with -- wi-with very -- kindness, they treating me with kindness,\nthas I, only one survivor, except -- except for my sister there. So they were very kind to\nme, very kind. B-But you know, they never achieved anything tremendous in their live.\nOne [indecipherable] was a -- was a mailman. The other one was a -- the other brother,\nwhich worked for my father, those two boys, was a ped -- a -- a -- a peddler something.\nAnd the oldest brother, which was -- by the way, they are not true brothers, they\u2019re not --\nth-they\u2019re step-brothers, all step-brothers, except the aunt which I lived there, and the\nuncle which sponsored me. She only had one true sister, and one true brother. All the\nother ones were step-sisters, because my mother\u2019s mother died in -- during childbirth\nwith my mother. So, he married couple da -- years later, sister. And since the babies was -\n- the two girls and a boy was so small, so they never knew this -- they were not telling\nthem about that, they found out after they got married, after my mother got married, she\nfound out. So he -- he only was a dental mechanic. So, none of them was -- Is -- is -- they\nlived in a middle class milieu. Aspirations, so-so. No big aspirations.",
        "Q: What about other friendships, relationships, encounters with people?",
        "A: I -- I -- I -- let me tell you something. I lived there for awhile, and after this, I -- I felt\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s only -- the 15 dollars I had to pay, or something, I said I try to get myself,\nit\u2019s a little better. I befriended a lady who was the cousin of Heddy Lamar. And she says -\n- also helped me, and she says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get out, because you\u2019re going to be\nstifled there. You\u2019re staying there stifled. Fifth floor walk-up, bad, bad.\u201d The -- that\nneighborhood was getting bad. So I got a job -- I -- I got a -- myself a apartment in a\nbrownstone ons -- on River Ave, between Broadway, and West End Avenue, next to the\nAnsonia Hotel. So I did quite well, I mean that it\u2019s -- the money which I st -- fer -- to --\n15 had to pay out, that paid for my rent, and I did quite well. I liked it, and I made friends\nthere, I made friends. And after this I was drafted in the army, after draft in the army, so I\nhad to give up everything else, so I didn\u2019t have anything else. And, matter of fact, she\nwas the only one who wrote -- used to write me almost -- every two, three days, and her\nfam -- her family did not. Didn\u2019t do it.",

        "A: Very little friends, very few friends. I had a problem at that time, which was because\nof my accent. I had a fellow which I came here together on a ship, which is called\nsomething Zimmerman, so I was friendly with him. But he moved down to Coney Island,\nin New York, Coney Island. I lived on Broadway, so we drifted apart. He had a\nprofession right away, he was a carpenter, so he did quite, quite well, and I didn\u2019t have\nany profession, I was a perpetual student. So, I made friends afterwards, we made friends.\nBut not too many friends. Let\u2019s put it this -- we had acquaintances -- I made\nacquaintances. I had -- didn\u2019t make any friends, I made acquaintances. I had\nacquaintances, but no friends.",

        "A: I had a tentia -- I -- in -- I -- I applied, because I came as a -- as political escapee,\nintention to become a citizen. I was drafted. And I was one of the older ones, already,\nthey usually draft 18 -- 19 year old, I was in the 20\u2019s already. So the f -- go -- the army\nwas a revelation to me, it was a revelation to th -- but I -- I survived it. I made it. I made\nit. Especially in my basic training, I had this incident with Dr. Do -- with Dr. Deutsch --\nwith Deutsch, so it left a -- a bi -- I became more cautious -- I became more cautious, so\nthe only thing to -- to -- to be in my own milieu, I became active in the Jewish temple in -\n- in the army base, with Judaism, so at least I felt a certain amount of kinsmen, who going\nto feel this -- what I have been through 1s -- and not to make fun of my language,\nwhatever it was.",

        "Q: Did you become more politically inclined later on?",
        "A: Since then? Yes, I became more politically inclined. I go for Democratic causes, even\nI registered independent, because I still have an independent mind, and usually, most of\nthe time, who I vote for doesn\u2019t get in. So -- so my -- my re -- election -- my voting\nrecord is not one of the best ones. Usually I take the cause which is not too popular, yes.",
        "Q: Was there any particular event that -- that drew you into politics, or was that just a\ngradual thing, I -- do you remember earlier -- early --",
        "A: You know, I think the politi -- politics 1-1-1-1-1s the spine of the nation. I mean, the\nspine of nation. Look what is going on the -- let\u2019s take 1999 and 2000. With all the killing\nwhat\u2019s going on by people with guns, we can\u2019t even pass a gun control law. I mean, it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s terrible. So sometime I feel a small, autocratic nation, a small autocratic philosophy,\nis not the worst thing in the whole world. Democracy is terrific, what it stands for now, to\n-- quoting Mr. Churchill, he said, \u201cDemocracy is only good right now, because we don\u2019t\nknow of anything better.\u201d But if you take Hellenistic culture, the destroying of Hellenistic\nculture was democracy, because everybody was right. And now we have atoks the Fifth\nAmendment. Fifth Amendment is your right to arm, it\u2019s not true, doesn\u2019t say that, Fifth\nAmendment doesn\u2019t say that. You\u2019re allowed to bear arms for the militia. We have a\nmilitia, it\u2019s called the National Guard. You know the militia thas I going to shoot at him,\nhe\u2019s coming through my door today, and I\u2019m allowed to have a gun. We have to be\neducated. There\u2019s nobody more armed in the whole world than it is in Israel. Almost\neverybody had a rifle every -- but the killing is not there. So it seems like we have to\neducate not only what the gun stands for, but what the gun can do. But here we just -- yo\n-- the last two days we got a six year old child -- killed a six year old boy. A six year old\nboy killed some s-six year old child. This fellow killed yesterday, because he doesn\u2019t like\nthe white people, killed three people. And we can\u2019t pass a gun control law. We can\u2019t even\npass a law to put a -- a governor on a gun. So this reason -- we have to be involved. Being\ngun control, being equal right, being pregnancy, being whatever it is. I mean, where does\nit -- where does it -- my philosophy, where does the Senate, the House, or the -- the -- the\nstate has a right to go into my wife\u2019s bedroom? Or anybody\u2019s bedroom? What you want\nto do with your body? I going to tell you you can\u2019t have an abortion -- you cannot have\nabortion. The people who have money, they going to get abortion regardless. If they\ndon\u2019t get it here, they get it in Canada, they get it in Timbuktu, they get it someplace.\nOnly that -- poor people have to get an abortion through a hanger.

Absolutely 100 percent\nAmerican, and that\u2019s the reason -- I tell you why I feel 100 percent am -- because I have\nthe right, and I have the privilege of criticizing. And is a privilege you never have, no --\nanyplace else. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m an American for, because I can say here what I don\u2019t\nlike. And this is a difference where I came from. Not through an -- in Czechoslovakia,\nnow Czech Republic, I could do almost -- almost the same thing. But here I can say it\nwithout worrying about it. Can go in a corner and shout what I don\u2019t like.",
        "Q: Do you ever do that?",

Now, it\u2019s a much, much better, but wa -- biv -- ah -- my history,\nwhere I come from, no, no, you be careful -- even if you voted, you have to be careful\nwho you voted for. This -- this is -- this is a wonderful, wonderful place, wonderful. And\nit\u2019s only makes it wonderful because we can criticize it.

Actually, nobody going to kill me, nobody\ngoing to deprive me of food. Nobody going to t-take me to shoot, or t-to gas me. But it\nwas on the regiment, and I am a little rough to be regimented again, and that\u2019s was the\ndifference.

So, actually, I -- less I followed --\nI f-found I came here for a new life. I mean, the past doesn\u2019t going to do nothing for me.\nMatter of fact, people are getting money from Germany. I didn\u2019t get -- I didn\u2019t have\nanything to do with them. I didn\u2019t get any money for 50 years. I just started receiving it\nthe last one year. My sister\u2019s getting it for 50 years, I never, ever few -- I did nothing to\ndo with it. I just didn\u2019t want to live through my past. Matter of fact, I was more interested\nin the ass-assassination of President Kennedy. And I read the Warren Report, and I was\nmore interested things which happen now, which I am so -- here, where I have something\nto do about it, where I have something to say about it. In-In-In-In-In the German war, I\nwas a pawn, I was just a pawn, and I\u2019m glad what I did, that sabotage work, which I did,\nblowing up trains. It gave me a certain satisfaction, but in retrospect, I just made a speech\nfor some newspaper editors, and newspaper artists, and I said to them -- was last year, or\ntwo years ago. And I said to them, \u201cYou know something? Sometimes I slee -- during the\nnight I get up, and I says, you know, you killed somebody\u2019s child.\u201d And then one of the\nfellows said, \u201cYou know, I felt the same way.\u201d I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s compassio -- what\nabout a chi -- ki [indecipherable] was -- I killed somebody\u2019s child. Now let me tell you an\nincident what happened to me two years ago. I go around -- I used to go around -- used to\ngo around, make speeches about the Holocaust, and it\u2019s either the -- the -- how it\u2019s Hitler\ncame to power, the German push on Munich, push. Landsberg, and -- and vay -- Hitler\nwith \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d and ha -- Rudolf Hess, everything else. So before -- this was in\nLakewood Community College in Lakewood, which is part of the Fl-Florida University.\nSo before I start the speech, I usually say, \u201cDoes anybody know what the Holocaust\nmeans?\u201d There are three girls -- three girls, one black, and two white girls raise their\nhand. I picked one of them who looks -- who looks Jewish, something like this. She looks\nJewish. No problem is she going to know what the Holocaust means. I says, \u201cYes, young\nlady, what is the Holocaust?\u201d She says, \u201cEthnic food.\u201d You\u2019re making a face? That\u2019s\nwhat she said.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: So she said it\u2019s ethnic food, and it\u2019s extremely disappointed since then. I feel when we\ntake the children to the Holocaust museum, and I -- and I think it\u2019s -- since you are\nworking there, I wonder if you ever observed, when they walk out, they make, tch, tch,\ntch, tch. It\u2019s leaves an effect, and after is always feels better, we going to eat now. I mean,\nI don\u2019t know how long emotion stays with them. They should made a study, how long\nemotion stays with you, if it doesn\u2019t touches you extremely personally, you know, father,\nmother, cousin, something. When you see a strange mass of people, eight million, s-six\nmillion, 25 million. It\u2019s only a number. History teaches us it\u2019s not the first Holocaust we\nwent through, not in this scope, but we know tha -- wer -- were that -- to sin -- crusifi --\nto Crusades, because French Huguenots, there\u2019s a Christian killing Christians, almost\neverybody. The Turks went all the way up to Vienna, they killed mercilessly. We went\ndown to the -- two Crusades, we killed everybody who came in our way. So you see, so --\nso this Holocaust is repeated itself, only in bigger scope. And I always wonder, is if you\ntalk about it, it\u2019s only eventually going to be a sentence in a new -- in the history books.\nYou know, there was a Holocaust, 35 million people died, 25 million people died, six\nmillion Jews is gonna die, and that\u2019s all what it is. \u2019m a very much involved now with\nthe Holocaust survivors here, right here where I live, but you know, now, as a matter of\nfact, just recently went to a meeting, and somebody said something about the Holocau --\nhe says, \u201cOh, we here to have good times.\u201d See, even the Holocaust survivors don\u2019t want\nto dwell of what happened. He says, \u201cWe ve -- have a life, now let\u2019s have -- let\u2019s think of\ngood times.\u201d So I don\u2019t know where to we -- history going to tea -- what history going to\nthink of us. Maybe the museum going to stay for some time, like same thing Museum of\nNational History, says, you know we -- how the Indians lived, and how the Neanderthal\nman lived, and how the Elsie lived, and the -- maybe we going to be just a little\n[indecipherable]. I went to Prague, there\u2019s a gorgeous, gorgeous synagogue, which called\nthe Portuguese synagogue, which is gorgeous. Hitler left it intact, because he said, \u201cAfter\nall the Jews are destroyed, this going to be a show, the museum how the Jew -- there was\na race, by the name of Jews.\u201d And he left it. And that\u2019s all. And we were eventually going\nto be the Holocaust, I feel going to be, you know, there was a -- a Holocaust, there was a\n-- a-- a darkness over Europe, which -- caused by one man, and his organization. It\u2019s sad.",
        "Q: Do you feel that -- that it\u2019s possible that such a thing could happen again?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. We have a little bit now, if you can taste it in Vienna, in Austria. I\nmean, get rid of the refugees. So today we get rid of the refugees. Just five years ago, we\n-- Germany invited, in 1948, they invited the Turks as laborer. Now, we putting a wall\naround them where they live. Now, by -- after 50 years, 50 years is two generations, now\nwe want to get rid of them. And if they\u2019re not the Turks, tomorrow going to be the blue\neyed people nec -- day after the blondes, or the day after, the Jews. No, I mean the -- the\nfinest -- the finest example, north Vienna. And this whole opero going to die down. Even\nIsrael [indecipherable] ambassador, he eventually going to come back. Cause it\u2019s an\ninternal struggle. Same thing we don\u2019t make [indecipherable] what\u2019s go -- going in\nKosovo. We killing Serbians, we -- we killing the Russians, we [indecipherable] the\nMuslim, we killing wa -- and the sa -- Russian said, \u201cOh, this an internal struggle.\u201d So\ntoo Vienna going to say, Austria going to say, \u201cThis is internal struggle, don\u2019t meddle\nin.\u201d So we have it all over the world. We have approximately 10 to 15 wars going on\nconstantly, wherever in the whole world. Being Pakistan, being Nigeria, being Zambia,\nbe wherever it 1s. People are dying. And what do we say? Tch, tch, tch, tch. That\u2019s all that\nwe do.",
        "Q: Can you talk about your involvement with survivor organizations? You just mentioned\nsomething.",
        "A: Yeah, survivor organizations 1s -- we -- matter of fact, we just erected a monument\nhere. We -- oh -- we had a monument here to -- to the Ho-Holocaust survivors, they\nvandalized it. In here, where 99.9 people are Jewish, it\u2019s a closed community, you have to\nhave a gate to come in, somebody vandalized it.",
        "Q: Right here in Boca Raton?",
        "A: Right boc -- in Century Village. They broke it apart. I think they were young kids who\ncome here on the Christmas vacation, they have nothing else to do, so they did it. So we\njust got it -- we -- we just -- matter of fact, the dedication going to be the 26\", of a new\nmemorial. Yes.

        "Q: Is there a large community of survivors here in this area where you live?",
        "A: As big a -- bigger than I thought, bigger tha-than I thought.

I have other friends too, which are Americans, but they\u2019re\nsurvivors. And they\u2019re wonderful people, they\u2019re such optimists, such won -- full of life. I\nmean, they live each day fo-for life\u2019s sake, you know? And they don\u2019t dwell whatever\nhappened yesterday. That\u2019s yesterday, it\u2019s -- forget it.

I have three wonderful\nchildren. It was a little bit rough with my children, the -- vis a vis my divorce, but it\u2019s\nworked out quite, quite well.

        "Q: Did you m-make a point of speaking with your children at all about your -- your\nhistory?",
        "A: I spoke to my children as little as possible. Matter of fact, I gave the tape, which I\nmade for the Holocaust last time, and I made for Spielberg. My youngest -- my youngest\ndaughter, and my middle son, they saw it. My oldest daughter has it, never saw it.\nDoesn\u2019t want to -- she said she cannot live through it, which I can understand quite\nreadily. Same thing my sister. She never would look at it.

Funny thing, our history starts from birth\nto concentration camp, never at -- in concentra -- never talk about concentration camp,\nwith -- and after, where we found each other. But we never talk th-this life in between.\nWe always talk the good stuff, like -- li -- like the concentration camp never happened to\nus. Like, we\u2019ll be stopped at -- at -- at 19 f -- \u201939, to -- our history stopped. So, we try -- I\ntry to be, and she 1s, or try to be as positive as possible, but she always brings up, you\nknow, what happened. So, she carries the guilt, a lot [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So, did you ever feel the need to find some way to -- to mourn for your parents? Or in\n-- for your brother, too? You mentioned that you didn\u2019t cry during the war, did you cry\nafterwards?",
        "A: I cried afterwards. I cried afterwards. Es-Especially with my mother. Funny thing is,\nshe was a wonderful, wonderful woman. And my father was -- it\u2019s was -- he was always\na business, so -- so relation was a limited time r-relation thing, except when I went skiing\nwith him in the wintertime. But I found him, he was a very, very -- more I think of him,\nmore I admire him. More I admire him as a man, as a father, as a -- oh, as a--a\nbreadwinner, as everything else, which, as a youngster, at that time, did not appreciate it.\nWhat -- this what I missed him. But during the camp, I -- I didn\u2019t have to, because I knew\nthat -- I saw the chimneys. They said, \u201cYou see you -- this where you gonna wind up.\u201d It\nwas the best propaganda, gonna wind up. The only thing you wa -- didn\u2019t want to wind\nup suffering til you get there.

I want to hate him as much as I could. I wanted to take -- and that\u2019s what\nI wanted to do. So, it -- the reason is, when I was for the underground, the CIC, I mean, I\nbecame a specialist at railroad thing. So I thought I was a hero, killing those boys. I was\nkilling ruvaba -- blowing up those railroad, and being a -- playing spy. Oh, this was quite\nchallenging, you know. Giving a -- the reports. So -- so -- so that one was -- I got even.\nThat\u2019s what I wanted to -- that\u2019s what I wa -- sorry. This what I want to say, I wanted to\nget even with them. Couldn\u2019t think of it.",

And the rabbi says, since you don\u2019t have\ndefinite date of their demise, you cannot do it, you cannot do it. So -- so -- they got to --\nthey [indecipherable] in my life, this -- they were cremated, in my wish I going to be\ndoing the same thing. My sister\u2019s very much against it, my family\u2019s against it. But I feel I\nowe them so much, is I want to go the same way. So my mind is made up, though, for\nnow, for quite some time.

You\nknow, I\u2019d -- I leave out the horror stories, I -- I just in general -- general suffering, I\nmean, cause my worst experience was when I stood next to the Nazi, and he threw this\nchild against the wall. I mean, I don\u2019t -- leave those out, I leave out that I was hit on my\nbehind 25 times. All those things I try to -- to leave out, because the children don\u2019t have\nto be exposed to this graphic thing -- they see enough graphic killing in a movie. So -- so\nI try to [indecipherable] and later I have questionnaires, and they are amazing thing, they\nvery, very intelligent questions. Somebody -- those questions are baffling me, but they\u2019re\nvery, very bright children.",

How does it feel you lost your\nparents? How -- how do you describe how you lose your parents? I mean, there\u2019s no\nwords to say, that\u2019s strictly emotional. Practically, they\u2019re not here, boom, they\u2019re gone.\nBut the -- how can you describe emotion, what you feel all of a sudden? You -- you have\na fa -- a nuclear of a family, and all of a sudden, you\u2019re by yourself. Lost a sister, lost a\nbrother. I never knew my sister was alive. So I -- and all of a sudden they say, \u201cYou see\nthe chimney, that\u2019s where you going to wind up.\u201d So that\u2019s not very pleasant. And, plus I\nblame myself, because if I wouldn\u2019t be there -- if I wouldn\u2019t be there August the third --\nsecond, in -- in -- in the Lo-L\u00e9dz ghetto, I would be here -- I would be fighting them. So\nnow you\u2019re angry, we could have fought those bastards, I must -- not allowed to say it\n[indecipherable] fought them, and here I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I became a prisoner. So it was\ns -- I lived betwe -- I lived between two worlds. Here -- here, I sabotaged trains, which I\ncan\u2019t tell that to nobody. I got even with them -- them a little bit, and here I became a\nprisoner like anybody else, but I became a cook to the Nazi -- to a Nazi, then -- then --\nthen -- in a camp, and so I survived better, and I met -- did I tell you I met a -- a-- a\nhusband of my aunt? I\u2019m sitting in Auschwitz, and there\u2019s a transfer coming out from\nTheresienstadt. And every time it came from Theresienstadt, I wanted to know if\nanybody know the Sternberg. My mother\u2019s name is Sternberg, Dora Sternberg. So the\nman sits next to me, and he\u2019s bewildered, completely bewildered. Needs a shave,\nextremely skinny. So I said, \u201cDo you know anybody by name of Sternberg?\u201d He says,\n\u201cYes, I just married one.\u201d I said, \u201cYou married a Sternberg?\u201d Long story short, he\nmarried my mother old spinster, he married her. I met him, I gave him some potatoes, he\ndisappeared. I met a uncle of mine in -- for two hours. He married my aunt in\nTheresienstadt.",
        "Q: Did he survive? And your aunt as well?",
        "A: None of them. None of the -- 19 or 20 of them all perished in Theresienstadt. My gr --\nmy grandfather died before the war. My grandmother -- that\u2019s the reason I went back to\nTeplice, I went back to Theresienstadt, to show my children what happened.",

I didn\u2019t\nwalk with all -- I didn\u2019t walk with my children, I stood behind them, walked ahead of\nthem, because this was part of the history.

So it was s -- very [indecipherable] unpleasant, very unpleasant,\nvery emotional, very emotional, very emotional.",
        "Q: How did you -- what prompted you to start talking about your experiences in front of\nschoolchildren, and -- and so forth.",
        "A: No, first I never knew I ma -- I -- I could speak in front of people. First I thought\nmaybe I\u2019m shy, which I -- by nature I\u2019m not shy. And it started actually, with my son.\nHe\u2019s -- he got in touch with the Holocaust Museum, and this how the whole thing started,\nthe ball started running. And I always felt this -- you have to -- you have to tell them.\nHistory should not wipe it away, that\u2019s never happened. Except that this incident, which\nhappened to me in -- in -- in -- in Lakewood put a damp on me, I think. This girl, I mean,\nquite intelligent, college graduate, or college student, I mean, don\u2019t know what the\nHolocaust is. Th-That\u2019s a -- and this funny thing is tha -- a -- a -- a -- it reminds me of a\nline for Jackie Mason, that he does in one of his monologue. He says they walk out of the\ntheater, the first they said, \u201c\u201cWant to eat? What do you want to eat? What do you want to\neat?\u201d And I felt the same thing, you know, people come out from the Holocaust Museum,\nthey said, \u201cTch, tch, tch, tch, where we going to eat?\u201d Because, you know, you -- nobody\nwants to be surrounded with so much misery, with so much negativism. You know,\n[indecipherable] nobody wants to be in a cave in the dark all the time, you want to go out\nthe sunshine. And I don\u2019t blame it. And the -- the people who 1n the -- in the Holocaust\norganization, they said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hear problems, we want to have good times.\u201d\nBecause we cannot dwell on it, because more you dwell on it, more miserable you going\nto get.",

Now they over a hundred. So, it\u2019s all of a sudden I let go of them. Even if they would\nbe alive, they wouldn\u2019t be alive now. So I let go of them, finally I let go of them. For all\nthose years, I couldn\u2019t let go of them. [inaudible] Now they gone. [indecipherable] alive.",
        "Q: Going back to your early -- early years in the United States -- do you want to take a\nbreak?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m fine [indecipherable] Would you like some soda?",
        "Q: When you first came to the United States, and then, in those first years, we talked a\nlittle bit about your growing -- how you slowly became interested in political things. I\u2019m\nwondering about your awareness of -- of some of the major political event -- and social\nevents that were happening, say in the 1950\u2019s, and 1960\u2019s. Were you aware o-of, or did\nyou take a particular interest in -- in anything such as McCarthyism, or the Civil Rights\nMovement, or anything?",
        "A: I -- I -- I found that McCarthyism was a bad -- a dark st -- dark page of American\nhistory. A matter of fact, I was a lover of -- still is a lover of Harry Truman. Now\neverybody\u2019s fashionable to think him as a great president. But I thought of Harry Truman\na great president before h-he became fashionable to be -- be-became popular. I think the\nMcCarthy area, if they wouldn\u2019t have television, if this wouldn\u2019t be exposed, it wouldn\u2019t\nbe so prominent in the public eye. I think we gave him an exposure which he did not\ndeserve. And matter of fact, the one whom I\u2019m mostly angry against, was President\nEisenhower, because they ask him to r-raise an opinion about John McCarthy, he says he\nwouldn\u2019t honor him to mention his name, which I think was terrible, til we have a -- an\nattorney by the name of Welch -- think his name was Welch, where he finally said on\ntelevision, \u201cSenator, don\u2019t you have any shame?\u201d And there was finally, after this\nstatement, there was a senator, I think McGovern, but Mc-something, he finally opened\nhis mouth. Til then, he was quiet. Rory Cohn was the s -- the -- the king of the century at\nthat time. Him and Mr. Shy, who were the underling of mister -- Mr. McCarthy. And\nmatter of fact, I was -- I just finished his biography just -- not -- just finished it.\n[indecipherable] He says in thas he had a int -- homosexual encounter with general --\nwith -- with Edgar Hoover, and Cardinal Spellman. So if you\u2019re [indecipherable] you\nthink of Hoover, him being in a girdle, and long stockings, it\u2019s [indecipherable] looks\nquite [indecipherable]. So, and th-they were the one who was -- governed our country.\nAnd I feel if not television exposure, McCarthyism would not get these ugly colors in\nAmerican history.",
        "Q: What did you like about Truman?",
        "A: A no nonsense Truman. He was a no nonsense Truman. Through the [indecipherable |\nhe took out the -- the rail -- was it -- I think it was a railroad strike, he took out the\nunions. I think it was a railroad strike. He was a no nonsense ru -- he shot from the hip.\nHe was protective of his daughter, who allegedly had the bi -- she was a singer, which\nsomebody criticized -- criticized her for bad voice, and he has a pres -- not as a president,\nhe said -- he said it as a father, I -- I -- I think 1t was -- wa -- an honest man. He was\nhonest man. Through this, his wife was anti-Semitic. Because he had a partner, a Jew by\nthe name of Jacobs, who was in the haberdashery store, they went Chapter 11, or they\nwent bankrupt, which they paid back aw -- everything. And Bess Truman never allowed a\nJew to walk into her house. But this how it was, so everybody knew where Bess Truman\nstood, but he was still a wonderful president, I think one of the honest one. Unfortunately,\nhe was pushed into the job overnight, and I think if he would have a little bit more\nexperience, the Pottsdam treaty would not be so advantageous to the Russians, as it was\ndisadvantageous to the -- to the Americans, because when they came to Prague -- before\nPrague, and even my city of Teplice, they wouldn\u2019t move further til the Russians\noccupied even Berlin. Otherwise we would have been in Berlin before them.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Beno Helmer. What happened\nafter your -- your job with S. Klein department stores? How long did you stay with them?",
        "A: S. Klein department store, I -- I started in the receiving department, after this I became\nmanager of the concession -- of the shoe department. And, I thought, well, good job, I\nhad a good job, I finally made almost a hundred dollars a week, which was almost a\nhundred dollars a week. Moved to New Jersey, and was married at that time, and by then\nI had the opportunity to buy a liquor store. A uncle of my wife passed on, and I bought\nthe liquor store, through complications with the families. Anyways, I bought the liquor\nstore, and I had the liquor store for quite number of years, til I was stabbed, and I was\nheld up, and that was after 20 some odd years in the liquor store. So I finally sold it, and\nretired at age 53.",
        "Q: Say more about that incident. What happened?",
        "A: Somebody came into the store, and just by coincident, was a lunch time. I had two\npeople, clerks. One of them went to -- getting our sandwiches, other one was a delivery.\nA young man walks in, and he wants -- which I knew, you -- a yo -- a young man which I\nknew from the neighborhood. Matter of fact, his father was a deacon in the church, and\nhe was a choirboy in the church. And he wanted to buy a -- something for his girlfriend.\nAnd he asked me to giftwrap the bottle for his girlfriend. He was 20 -- 22 years old. So\nafter I wrapped it, he pulled out the long knife, and he says, \u201cIt\u2019s hold-up.\u201d I said to him,\n\u201cIf I go, you go with me.\u201d And I wrestled him. No, first he stabbed me, and then I\nwrestled him. And I grabbed the knife by the blade, and I cut my tendon in this finger,\nthis rees -- my pinkie. From the middle joint up 1s stiff, because they had to sew it\ntogether. And we caught him. He was out of the jail before I got out of the hospital. And\nthe judge calls me, and tells me, \u201cYou know the father is a deacon in the church, and he\u2019s\nin -- a choirboy, what do you think is a,\u201d -- secretary of the -- of the judge, \u201cwhat do you\nthink is a fair sentence?\u201d I was perplexed, absolutely perplexed. So I said the most\nstupidest thing, I said, \u201cWhat the good judge feels in his heart should be a fair sentence.\u201d\nSo anyways, he got out.",
        "Q: What -- did that make you bitter at all?",
        "A: No. Scared. After this I became scared. Not long after this, 1t was a Friday night, and\nthe -- the -- that -- and this was before closing time. I [indecipherable] two clerks, one of\nthem goes on delivery, other one stays there, and I was held up. Pushed in the back door -\n- back cabinet, and a woman and two men held me up with a gun. And he -- m-my co-\nworker I-I-] Larfim, had a ring, and he said, \u201cGive me the ring.\u201d And he says no, so she\nslapped him. I says, \u201cGoddammit, give them the ring, I mean life is more important.\u201d\nAnyways, we caught her. She spoke a pretty good English. After this, we took her to the\ncourt, she didn\u2019t speak English, she only spoke Spanish. I don\u2019t know what happened\nwith the case. Happened with the case, nothing.",
        "Q: You have clearly had more than -- than one could even imagine, of negative\nexperience.",
        "A: My share -- my share of excitement. No, it\u2019s not negative, a share of excitement. I had\nenough in this lifetime, share of excitement, for no -- for 10 lifetimes. Yeah, nothing went\nplacid, nothing went easy. Now it finally -- it\u2019s finally -- you know, it\u2019s pretty good now,\nnow it\u2019s placid, now it\u2019s wonderful.",
        "Q: But you still have -- so you have an opti --",
        "A: I\u2019m laughing about it. Yes, yes, be positive about it. I mean, if you dwell on it, you --\nif -- if -- if I start [indecipherable] amount of negativism, I don\u2019t get out of bed in the\nmorning. Going to cover myself over the head, because the world is black. But the world\nisn\u2019t black. Look at this, it\u2019s gorgeous, it\u2019s terrific, I have something to live for. I have\nwonderful children, I have a wonderful friend, wonderful grandchildren, to -- what else\ncan you ask for? Life is gorgeous. That\u2019s the reason I think my interview is a positive\ninterview, nothing negative about it. Nothing negative.",
        "Q: What happened after -- after that incident, and you -- you got out of the business?",
        "A: Finally -- finally, Is -- I -- I went to the -- went out of business, because my son said,\n\u201cDad, you don\u2019t want they should carry you out feet first.\u201d So I went out of business, and\nyou know, it\u2019s -- hanging around wasn\u2019t too good an idea, playing golf, whatever it was.\nSo -- so I got myself a job, and became a salesman for a -- for a wholesaler of champagne\nand liquor out of -- matter of fact, he asked me if I want to get the salary, I said, \u201cNo,\ngive me a commission.\u201d So I did very, very well. Matter of fact, if I got the big, big\naccount, he took it away from me. I got the first m -- they -- the company first million\ndollar account, I got it, he took it away. He says, \u201cYou don\u2019t like it, you can quit.\u201d\nAnyways, after two years, we decided we coming down to Florida. We already had the\nplace in Florida, but used to rent it. So, I was 62 years old, so I said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough, let\u2019s\npack it in.\u201d So we came down here, and after this I got divorce.",
        "Q: I was curious, if you would say a little bit more about your -- the class that you took\nwith Anna Freud, and what you were doing?",
        "A: Anna Freud? We di -- ch -- Anna Freud was a negative personality I\u2019ve heard. She had\nthe homosexual tendencies, was madly in love with her father, had re-occurring dreams\nabout being spanked by him. And I\u20191l tell you, I don\u2019t know if this [indecipherable]\nbecause his-historic-wise, we don\u2019t know homosexual [indecipherable] lesbianism,\nwhere it\u2019s come from. We have no proof. This manifests itself somehow, because we --\nwe take a test of twins, identical twins, growing up in a family, the same milieu, one of\nthem become homosexual, and the other one doesn\u2019t. So we don\u2019t know if that has\nanything to do with jeans, with nothing. Anyway, she was. And I took classes with it, and\nI tried to do a little bit for the -- as I said, with the abused women, in the ho -- in the\nLubovitcher. And -- but I had to make a living, and the liquor store was the best\nopportunity to make a living, which I did quite well, bought a house. First house was, I\nthink 130 dollars was the insurance, and -- and mortgage, and everything else, and I\ndidn\u2019t g -- sleep nights, didn\u2019t know if I gonna make it.",
        "Q: So she was -- was she teaching the class that you took?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: What -- what was the course?",
        "A: Psychology. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So you -- it sou -- I mean, you -- you were mentioning a little earlier, and maybe we\nshould get this on -- oh, w-we did get this on tape, all the different classes that you\u2019re\ntaking now.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And it sounds as if you have a really broad range of interests.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know anything, but I know a little bit of everything, somehow, seem like.\nBecause it -- I -- I go -- I\u2019m interested 1n a class in which I take, I\u2019m interested 1n it, and I\ndon\u2019t go just as an observer. I -- I -- I make a point to know what they are talking about.\nAnd if they talk some which I don\u2019t know, I make a point of looking it up. So I don\u2019t just\ngo in and they said, you know this talk x, y, z, and I go out, the next week going be there\nis something else. I make a point to know what they are talking about. So that\u2019s the\nreason I enjoyed it, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- at least it\u2019s a little research I do at the same time. And\nI\u2019m an ardent reader. I don\u2019t read novels, I think the last novel I read was I don\u2019t know\nwhat. I read history and biographies. So, a matter of fact, now I\u2019m reading -- I read two\nbooks at the same time, by the way, because I\u2019ve ga -- because it\u2019s -- most of them are\ndry books, so I -- I read-- one of them has to do -- I\u2019m reading now th-the Leaman\nfamily. No, no, I read the Warburg family, and the other one is \u201cThe Atomic Secret of\nIsrael.\u201d Interesting books.",
        "Q: Do you ever read about the Holocaust?",
        "A: Ihave books on \u2018em, but I don\u2019t read them. Because my Holocaust was my Holocaust\nalone. It was my Holocaust, and other people\u2019s Holocaust is their Holocaust. It was not\nan universal Holocaust, it was universal plus individual Holocaust. What I went through,\nnobody went through. What they went through, I didn\u2019t go through. So my Holocaust\nwas being -- seeing this child destroyed, throwing -- ripping up a train, or -- or sighing --\nsaying to this German there 1s a huntbigram, or this fellow says, Par shiva zhija, and\ngoing finally after -- after the war, when millions are destroyed, going to Poland, and see\nthey destroying those poor remnants 0-0-0-of a -- miniscule remnants of Judaism, and\nthey killing us. Matter of fact, I am against that, too, the March for the Living. I\u2019m all for\nit. March for the living. But I\u2019m against it to go to Poland. Matter of fact, I give to holoca\n-- I belong here, and I quite an active member, in a -- in the Holocaust thing, and I give\ncharity, but I always excluding -- excluding, repeat it, excluding to giving for the March\nof the Living, if 1t goes to Poland. I don\u2019t go there, cause I found out that they beha --\nbehaved during the war, and after the war, worse than the Germans, worse than the\nGermans. They did it for sheer -- sheer hate, without reason what it was. And they didn\u2019t\ndo it because they followed orders, that was emotionally on their own part.",

        "A: Iu--Iu-- yes, I did geriatrics with elder people, except, since I had my triple bypass,\nsome of the wheelchair people there, they were stubborn, they used to drag their feet. So\nit was a very hard thing for me to do, so the doctor advised me not to do so. I did -- I -- I\nvolunteered in a canc -- cancer ward 1n hospital, which -- it\u2019s quite, quite depressing. And\nafter I went through all this operations, I don\u2019t want to -- I stay away from it. So I don\u2019t\ndo any volunteer for this. Nei -- nei -- nor the hospital, nor the geriatrics.",
        "Q: Tell me more about your work with -- now you work with mentally disturbed --",
        "A: No, no, no, the mentally challenged, it\u2019s a difference, mentally challenged. It --\norganization which is called Habilitation, which is a charitable organization, make a\ncard parties, trips, cruises, what -- everything else. So we give money to the -- to there.\nSo my -- my involvement\u2019s only as becau -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s strictly financially.\nStrictly financially, that\u2019s all that I am doing. Because they -- the organization, the\nsupervision of state, or whatever it 1s, so they have supervision there, so it\u2019s very little\nyou can do for them, the only thing you can do it collect money, or try to raise money. So\nI became a lifetime member.",
        "Q: Was charity work -- was giving to charity always important?",
        "A: Char -- was -- oh yes, was -- let me tell you something about my father, about charity.\nI don\u2019t remember eating with -- in Europe, the main meal is lunchtime. Maybe have it a\nlittle reversed, the main meal is lunchtime, our lunchtime is our suppertime. So the main\nmeal is -- is lunchtime. I don\u2019t remember thas I had dinner with my parents alone. This\nmean, my brother, my sister and I, and my parents. We always had two people -- two\nstudents, who couldn\u2019t afford it, eat dinner with us -- or lunch which -- with us. Never\nremember them eat -- we ate by ourself. Yes, the evening meal, but not lunchtime meal.\nAlways have people. My father always emphasized charity. I don\u2019t know if I told you in\nthe tape this -- my mother gave hundred thousand, or 10 thousand, lot of money to the\nHungarian government when she tried to free my father, and Minister Beck. I told the\nstory, so you know it, yeah.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s because of that background, you think, that you became -- you became --",
        "A: You have to give, you have to give, you have to give. My father said, \u201cComes a time\nyou have to pay back,\u201d and I\u2019m paying back. I\u2019m paying back, I drive the people -- I\ndrive -- we have here people are -- just supplementing income, whatever it is, so they\ndrive people to the airports, or drive them to doctors.

        "Q: But in a way, what\u2019s striking to me is that it seems like you could have just said what -\n- well, my father was talking about paying back, and those were different times, and I\u2019ve\nseen how -- I don\u2019t -- I\u2019ve suffered so much, what do I have to pay back for?

        "Q: And -- and I just wondered, you know, whether you found American culture in\ngeneral to be a little bit similar to that, to just a lot of things that seem silly, or trivial, or -",
        "A: Oh well, since then I understand bels -- baseball, and I still found it extremely -- no\nlogic to me. First time I saw them is I walked out from eating, the -- I refused to eat the\nki-kitchen -- the French kitchen thing. So I went to a camp, I -- a-at that time I -- I told\nyou, I took somebody\u2019s shoes. So there was a cook cooking -- did Is -- about throwing\nthe food to the dog? Anyway, the first time I see people playing gloves with a ball, with a\nstick, and I found it extremely funny. I mean, look at these adults, if you -- I grew up in a\nculture of soccer. You play it for 90 minutes of play, at least there\u2019s a sportsman. Coming\nto America, I found the same thing. The fellow gets millions of dollars paid, he has a -- a\npinch hitter. He\u2019s allowed three balls, or four balls, three mistakes, and they getting\nmillions of dollars. And after millions of dollars, they going on strike for -- for trillions.\nAnd we calling it sports. I mean, when do we gonna wake up and say, you know it\u2019s not a\nsport at all, it\u2019s a business. And we are paying for this big -- and big business getting\nmillions of dollars. And some of them behave off the field deplorably. So I -- I don\u2019t\nwatch baseball. Maybe sometime I just take a sneak if it\u2019s the playoffs, but otherwise I\ndon\u2019t watch it [indecipherable]. So, I don\u2019t want to be part of this big business\nconglomerate. And I still find it silly. The fellow is the sport -- he\u2019s a pinch hitter, he\u2019s a\npinch thrower. He gets four balls, I mean, not even the first one he throws, he is allowed\nto make three mistakes. And hockey, I used to watch hockey, but 1t makes me violent. So\nthe only one that sometime I sneak 1s at least 1t\u2019s one on one Is -- 1s -- doesn\u2019t appr --\ndoesn\u2019t approve my philosophy, 1-is boxing, once in awhile. And this is not much kinder\nsports than it is. But all rough, rough. I\u2019ve never been s-sports. I\u2019ve n-never been a sports\nfollower. I belong to the Maccabi, to the Zionist organization in Teplice, and I was a --\nquite a good athlete there. Matter of fact, I was a good runner, and -- and -- and a climber,\ntoo. By the way, I was a mountain climber in college. Did I ever tell the story about that?\nI was a mountain climber, and I choose it. I was quite, quite good mountain climbing. On\na Sunday we going mountain climbing, the three of us, we go climbing, we did quite\nsteep a cliff. I don\u2019t know what happened, I panicked. I absolutely panicked, and I was\npass -- plat -- placed against the wall, and I hollered, \u201cMama, Mama.\u201d You laughing?\nThey were laughing. They all thought this was a big joke. Who do you call, you call your\nmother. So I called, couldn\u2019t call anything else. I called mama. They thought it was a\njoke, and they let me staying there, til, to this day, if I is -- my sister is on the 28\" floor. I\ncannot go on the balcony. My feet shake.

        "Q: I was wondering if you have any sense of an -- around when it was that you were\ndeported from L\u00e9dz to Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yes. August -- August the third, 1944. I went b-back to ausch -- to -- to the Lodz\nghetto in August the first or the second, because Rainia told me thas my father was very\nsick. She knew wi -- she had the contact. I\u2019m sure that I was not the only one who left\nfrom the Lodz ghetto. So I went back to see my father, and he looked lousy, he looked\nvery, very bad, and -- and matter of fact, my mother said, \u201cHe looks better than you\nthink,\u201d because she put rouge on his cheek. And I brought back vials of glucose, because\nI [indecipherable] and I brought some bread, or two breads with me. Because, as a\nGerman, at least I had breads. And I think it was the day before, and after this they\nrounded up the s -- the whole street there. It was Fronchy skunsky ooleetsa, 28, and I was\none of them shi-shipped to -- to Auschwitz. And we got to see -- had the honor to see Mr.\nMengele.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve told us --",
        "A: After two days -- not -- on a train, whatever it was.",
        "Q: Another question, from the time that you were in -- in Auschwitz, you told us -- told\nus about the German commander -- commandant, who was a-at your barrack in\nAuschwitz, and how he made you his cook.",
        "A: Yes, knocked my tooth out. Did I tell you?",
        "Q: And he knocked your tooth out, yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah, di-did you know -- remember his name?",
        "A: No. He had a Polish sounding -- funny thing, he had a Polish sounding name, and the\nfellow I was looked in as a Nazi in -- in the British zone, he had a Polish sounding name.\nNo, but his -- I don\u2019t know if I said it, his biggest accomplishment in his life was thas he\nraped a 80 somewhat year old woman against the tree. He was in love with the Gypsies. I\ngot there August the fourth, or the fifth. In July of the same year, they -- they deported\nand killed all the Gypsies. He was in love with a Gypsy lady, so he used to sleep with her\ndress on -- on, or next to him, he slept with her. The fellow who was helping me cook, I d\n-- | don\u2019t know anything about cooking, and I don\u2019t know -- less about it now. But he\nliked it sour, so when I made him soup, that\u2019s the only thing we had, potatoes and water,\nwhatever, vegetable soup, I used to put a spoonful of vinegar in it. And this vinegar, he\nthought this was the best soup I ever made, and the only thing is, because I put vinegar in\nit. Funny thing, I Just spoke about it to somebody. The assistant was an -- a Jewish doctor\nfrom America, American doctor -- dermatologist. He [indecipherable] was he left\nGermany, whatever it was, and went to America, came to visit somebody, boom, they\ncaught him, he went to Theresienstadt, from Theresienstadt he was in Auschwitz. His\nspecialitz was warts. People he cured war -- people with warts, so -- I don\u2019t know how\ntrue it is, but what he told me is, when people used to come with it\u2019s warts, he felt 1t was\neradicated psychologically. So he used to give them a pill. He says, \u201cIf you take this pill,\nand if you urinate blue, the wart is helping.\u201d So he gave them a placebo which didn\u2019t do -\n- no, the urine never turned to blue. So after one time, after second time, he came, no.\nThird time he gave them some kind of pill where the -- the urine turns blue. He says,\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s helping.\u201d After few treatments, the warts went away. So he was my assistant,\nthat wasn\u2019t much older than I was. And, as I said -- so this why -- I went to look, I had a\ngirlfriend that time, and I was looking for anybody. I knew it wasn\u2019t my brother, because\nhe was a man. So I was looking for my sister. So I volunteered between my cooking, and\ngetting bi -- hit on my he -- on my behind, I joined -- people used to take out the feces\nfrom -- from the -- from the toilets. You know, barracks they [indecipherable] but they\nhad no sewer system, just went to the big pit, and later you had to take it out with spoons,\nand put it in a big thing, and later dump it, and they used it for fertilizing the vegetables.\nSo I joined one of those things, so I went into the women\u2019s camp, to look for my sister,\nand my -- which I didn\u2019t -- never expected, excuse me -- never expected to see, and the --\nand the same thing my ex-girlfriend. Never found anybody.",
        "Q: Were you ever given a number at Auschwitz?",
        "A: No, it -- by that time this was overwhelmingly a lot of people came in. I know my\nnumber, 64641, but that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all what I knew.",
        "Q: 64641?",
        "A: Yeah. And that\u2019s all what I knew. And finally this semd -- I went to Ravensbrick, I\nwent to -- to Buchenwald. Buchenwald I met Mrs. Rothchild. Did I tell you this story?",

        "Q: Do you have a strong feeling about the importance of there being a Jewish state?",
        "A: Yes. Except that being destroyed within self. They\u2019re destroyed within self. I think the\nproblem is this, the parliamentary system doesn\u2019t work as well as a Republican system\nwhat we have here. Because coming of -- with getting a coalition, and -- and you don\u2019t\nvote for a man, you vote for a party. The party puts out candidate x,y,z, and if this party\nwins, x,y,z gets into the office. So the party is the one who picks the office, regardless\nwhat qualicatio -- what qualification you think he has, is inconsequential, because the\nparty feels, so long it\u2019s -- does a good for the party. Where we here, we have a\nparliamentary s -- a -- a Republican system, we p -- we pick the man. S -- Ben-Gurion\nwas actually -- the Ben-Gurion wanted this system, except Chaim Weissman was a\nAnglophile, he love angla -- England. So we have this system.

It\u2019s the only thing, in my philosophy it\u2019s because they did\nnot let them assimilate. Now -- now is the destruction of Judaism. Why? Because they let\nus assimilate. They going [indecipherable] let -- we can approach any culture we want to,\nand we have the finest example, 51 percent of our Jewish marriages are intermarriages.\n51 percent. And a big percentage 1s, if the boy marries a Christian girl, the family stays\nChristian. If the j-jew -- the girl is Jewish, there\u2019s a par -- bigger possibility that the\nfamily stays Jewish. So it\u2019s only because through assimilation. Years ago, the -- we had\nto stay Jewish, because they put us in ghettos, they put us in towns, and they didn\u2019t let us\nassimilate.

        "Q: And -- and why is the painting crooked?",
        "A: It crooked because I feel psychologically the preciseness of Germany was not always\nprecise. Sometime it has been crooked. And this one time, they were crooked. Next\npainting is a Holocaust scene of twent -- with a big 28 in it, which is 28 members which I\nlost. On --on the bottom you can see the shower, with the gas. You can see the fence, you\ncan see the chimney, which is spewing ashes, and blood. The 28 ne -- members, 28 faces,\n27 mouths, because my mother and father spoke with one mouth, and the picture of my\nbrother, the b -- eyes are blank, because he didn\u2019t see the world yet. Underneath him is a\nsculpture which I call, \u201cThe last Kaddish,\u201d the last prayer for the death, which consists of\nstone sculpture, and two tears, with a -- with a Star of David, a gold star of David inside,\nwith six different candles, which each represent a different denomination. One is blue,\nit\u2019s a Jewess, one is pink for the homosexual, one 1s red for the Communist, one 1s for the\nGypsies, and so on. And in the middle of it there 1s a -- a -- a candle d -- a candle glass,\nwhich is broken, which the wick 1s lit out -- is -- 1s -- is runned down to the end. And the\nstones are full of smoke. Next to him have a painting, it\u2019s still the 28, which 1s cr --\ncrossed out, which has 28 different colors. Each member of my family had one color.\nAbove it, there is finally a little more optimistic painting, which is called, \u201cSunrise.\u201d It\u2019s\nan abstract, with a yellow sun, and black lines over it. I think this finishes my paintings.",

Finally they escaped.\nSo that\u2019s what it was, so -- so when I was in the CIC, we did not trust the Polish\nunderground, because it seems like they knew what was going on there.",
        "Q: And -- and right below all of these -- all of these pictures, there are pictures of your\ngrandchildren.",

And, Mr. Helmer, I\nthought we would start with the moment of your liberation, and -- and move forward\nfrom there, and we\u2019ll see how -- how it goes, as far as going back before that. And you\ndescribed in your first interview how you were -- the circumstances of your liberation,\nand how the am -- U.S. army came into the -- to the POW camp where you were.

        "A: Let me regress a little bit. The day of -- when I was liberated, it wan -- matter of fact, I\nthink to -- let\u2019s say 24 hours before I was liber -- I was -- got the worst beating in my\nlifetime. [indecipherable] I still have scars on my head and my shoulders, because the\ncommander told us to march with him wherever he wanted to march, and I refused him.\nSo he had a big, huge stick, and he beat me mercilessly. And I gonna die, but I\u2019d rather\ndie instead of marching with him. Some hours later, down the road, we saw a tank with a\nbig, white, five star -- s -- five star -- star emblem. W-We didn\u2019t know what that\u2019s -- I\ndidn\u2019t know what that\u2019s -- this means the American army, I know the five star emblem\nwas the Russian army, so we thought that\u2019s the Russian army came. But it wasn\u2019t so,\nbecause hours later, one s-single soldier came in, a short, little fellow what had a -- a -- a\n-- a rucksack on his back, and he said he is an American. It was a little fellow from\nBrooklyn. And the first thing he said, \u201c\u201cWhere is there water?\u201d He was thirsty, so I said,\n\u201cWe have a water fo -- water pump, but you\u2019re not allowed to drink it,\u201d -- be -- matter of\nfact, the first time I went into the camp, the commander told us we are not allowed to\ndrink from this water, because this may give typhoid. And he said 1f anybody\u2019s drinking\nfrom this fountain, he going to be shot. And he said, \u201cTo prove to you,\u201d he took out his\npistol, took an innocent man, and shot him. A Russia-Russian worker. This camp\nconsisted of building prisoner of war camps for the American flyers, which was never\nfinished, and that\u2019s the reason we slept on sand. So now, let\u2019s go right -- back to the\nAmerican soldier. He said he was thirsty. So we said to him, \u201cYou cannot drink from this\nfountain, because you\u2019re going to die.\u201d He says, \u201cNo problem.\u201d Took the water, put it in\nhis canteen, and put a pill into his water, shook it, and he drank it, and I think this was the\nbiggest miracle I ever saw in my lifetime at that time, that he survived, he didn\u2019t die from\nhis -- because of this little pill. A few hours later he says he going to bring some food,\ngive it to it -- va -- ba -- bring us food because we were starving. I mean, when I was\nliberated, after aid already, I was weighing 92 or 94 pounds. So in that evening, or next\nday, the French came with a kitchen, a truck which had a big kettle of soup, in -- in the\nback, and the French men, they -- they said, \u201cThat\u2019s the fr -- thanks to the French\nliberation,\u201d which wasn\u2019t so, \u201cwe going to sing \u201cThe Marseilles.\u2019\u201d And I had a friend of\nmine which name Is ra -- Ravel Monya -- Monyek Ravel. And I said, \u201cI will not sing the\nFrench national anthem, because they did not liberate us.\u201d So I said, \u201cRavel, since we are\nfree, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d He says, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to go.\u201d I said, \u201cRavel, good-bye, I\nam leaving.\u201d He followed me. And this how I left the camp, but it -- the biggest miracle I\nsaw that time was the canteen with the pill in the water.",

I left the French camp, and I -- I start\nmissing people. I missed my parents, I missed my sister. My sister, I thought she was\nperished anyways. She was a very, very skinny, little girl, so I said she cannot survive the\ncamp. But I had a brother of mine, which was six years younger than I was, I said, \u201cHe\nwas a strong lad, maybe he survived.\u201d But unfortunately, the fate wa -- dealt us a\ndifferent card. The only one who survived was my sister, nobody else. So when I walked\nout, I wanted to go back to Prague, to Czechoslovakia. And -- and we marched, Monyek\nand I, we marched, and I\u2019m sure I told it before, this -- I was -- first time I was\nencountered with baseball.

That\u2019s correct, I completely forgot.\nHe want to go to Paris, and I want to go back home. And I\u2019m sure I told you I finally\nwound up in a DP camp.

So I took my -- I saw somebody had a bag there\nwith clothing, so I took the clothing out of his bag, and put my clothing next to his bag.\nAnd so I went for -- and I went there, and since I was a citizen of Czech-Czechoslovakia,\nthat time they gave me, and I stayed in the Hotel Prague -- excuse me, Hotel Paris, except\nI got sick, and I got rheumatic fever. And they put me the hospital to -- hospital name of\nBoulav cabbage, I spent some time there, and I was in the wo -- in the room with some\nRussian soldiers, and they were feeding me vodka. So the medication did not help too\nmuch, because whatever medication they gave me, the vodka counteracted it.

Nobody spoke German, [indecipherable]. I couldn\u2019t\ngo back to my father\u2019s -- my parents\u2019s house, because there was an engineer, a German\nengineer, who had the plans of the coal mines, we had the coal mines underneath Teplica,\nand so they didn\u2019t want to antagonize him that he should not destroy the maps, or should\nnot destroy the ba -- ma -- the -- the coal mine, yeah coal mine. So they gave me a lovely,\nlovely apartment, a big apartment that compensated for the house, which I didn\u2019t have at\nthat time, and they gave me a big store. It was a business, this was electrical business. I\ndon\u2019t know if I told you about -- did I speak about the electric business?",

They said, \u201cBecause, let\u2019s me truthful, you have nobody here\nwho will miss you.\u201d And to prove, they -- that gave me four or five weeks to make up my\nmind, and the first thing what they do, they took the store away from me -- the business\naway from me, and I became the helper, because you have to be employed, I became the\nhelper to the -- the fellow who they gave the business to. Good Russians -- a good Czech\nCommunist. And it\u2019s be -- they made it quite in -- unpleasant for me. So I decided is --\nmore they took away my food stamps, also.

        "A: Yes, it has a story. There 1s -- it\u2019s -- actually, it\u2019s happen under the Babylonian king,\nand they decided it\u2019s go -- they\u2019re going to build a tower to God. And this happened right\nafter Noah, and what happened is everybody spoke the single language. Everybody sti --\nstood each other. So they decided they\u2019re going to build a tower all the ways up to God.\nSo the angels came to God, he says, \u201cYou know somebody is building a tower, it\u2019s high\nup to You.\u201d So God said, \u201cNobody does it.\u201d And He destroyed the tower, and everybody\nspoke a different language. And the consequences was, there\u2019s nobody understood each\nother. And there\u2019s the reason you have all those crazy colors, nobody understands each\nother.",

        "A: Yes, was a young man, because I was at college in Hungary, and I was deported,\nbecause I was a Czech citizen at that time, it was a skirmish between Slovakia and\nHungary, and they arrested me, and I shall never forget it. | came home from the movie\nseeing \u201cModern Time,\u201d with Charlie Chaplin, and they arrested me, and they deported\nme. No, s -- I was in jail. Was jail for two or three days, and they w-wanted to deport me\nto ch -- back to Czechoslovakia. So I didn\u2019t want to go back to Czechoslovakia, because\nhe already occupied Sudatenland in Austria. So the only language I thought is similar to\nCzech, so I was deported to Poland. By the way, I want to -- I don\u2019t know if I said it,\nwhen I lived in Hungary, I played in the movies. I made two or three films with quite\nknown actors, which came finally to America, and became quite known actors here in\nAmerica.",
        "A: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s came to be just by chance, and it suppl -- supplemented my income, because\nI -- I didn\u2019t have too much money. A matter of fact, the worst thing I could do, I was\npeddling vegetables, and this was -- I don\u2019t know why, it was extremely degrading for\nme, but not only this, I had to study at the same time. Usually you don\u2019t have a time to do\nthose things. B- But so the -- when I got the job in the summertime, playing in the movie,\nsupplemented my income quite well. And in Budapest I was quite a -- quite a bright man,\nbecause we had to do an essay, in the college we had to do an essay about -- I forgot what\nit was. And I and another fellow won the essay. And for my college, or all the colleges in\nmatter of fact, the compensation was this we allowed to -- we had a interview with the\nprelate of Hungary -- of my -- my so-called friend of mine, I went by ra-ra-railroad to a\ncity by the name of Estergum. Did I ever mention this story? I went to the city of\nEstergum, and we have int -- audience with the archbishop of Hungary, in the city of\nEstergum. So it wasn\u2019t only for my college, there was a lot of the college -- enormous,\nbig, big hall, gorgeous. And we staying in -- and we staying in a -- ina-- ina--ina\nsemi-circle, and the -- the archbishop comes out with a entourage of four or five people,\nand he go -- starts to face to the left, and he goes around, he goes around, everybody\nkisses his ring. And I said, \u201cI will not kiss this man\u2019s ring.\u201d So finally he comes to me --\nin th -- in -- in Hung-Hungary, you say, \u201cKasi chuclum,\u201d as a salutation. What this\nmeans, I kiss your hand. So I said, \u201cKasi chuclum,\u201d I shake his hand, no problem. Walks\naround, fine, a -- finishes, goes to the door, this one good looking, tall fellow, turns\naround, and to the t -- says something, and t-to the archbishop, see, and he turn -- the\narchbishop turns around, and the other fellow turns around, he looks at me, and does f --\npoints me. I said, \u201cI know, I\u2019m going to the execution. They going to kill me.\u201d I mean,\nwhy should he point to me? The -- the archbishop, and two more, three more men walk\nin, the tall, tall fellow. Those -- this -- me -- w-wave to me, and I should come to him. I\nsaid, \u201cDefinitely this is it, firing squad.\u201d Walk into the room, walk to his office, huge o --\nmarble, with a wonderful design on the floor. Takes me around the shoulder, and he says\nto me, \u201cI hear you\u2019re from a different per-persuasion.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d He says, \u201cWhat are\nyou?\u201d \u201cA-A-A Jew.\u201d So that\u2019s fine, says, talks to me -- matter of fact, everybody got\nsandwiches, or some kind of -- like a box lunch, it was something that I ate with him. I\nate with him. And during the conversation, he says to me, \u201cWould you like to see where I\ngoing to be buried?\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s very unusual to ask somebody [indecipherable] to be\nburied.\u201d He says, \u201cSure.\u201d He takes me down, he takes me down to the catacombs. So\nwhen you walk down to the basement, or so-called catacombs, th-there\u2019s a -- a double\nstaircase -- one -- both sides, there\u2019s a staircase going down. So on each one on the end,\nthere\u2019s a statue. So he says to me, \u201cI bet you you don\u2019t know what those statues mean.\u201d I\ndidn\u2019t know a Jew is allowed to bet. But it was very easy. One statue was a black statue,\nhad a f -- a torch facing up, and the other side the statues had a f -- torch facing down. I\nsaid, \u201cThis 1s life, and this is death.\u201d So he very s -- was very impressed with it. And I\nwalked down, he showed me the niche where he\u2019s going to be buried, and we walked\nback up. And was for quite a pleasant thing, and a matter of fact, I was extremely\nflattered, oh, I was so flattered. The fellow who I came on the railroad, wasn\u2019t too\nflattered with me. Matter of fact, he never spoke to me since. Not ev -- since, now I don\u2019t\nknow where he is, but h-he wasn\u2019t Jewish, he never spoke to me, he was so jeal --",

Actually, they gave me 10 dollars before I left, except I spent 21 days on the -- on\nthe -- on -- at sea. I left in a ship by the name of Ernie Pyle, and landed with Merle\nMarlane, because we had to transfer inich -- in the English channel, from one ship to the\nnext, and the waves were tremendous, it was a tremendous storm there, and England\nwouldn\u2019t let us in, the 800 refugees, they wouldn\u2019t let us in. Even I came as a political\nescapee, but anyways, as it was part of the 800 s -- passengers. I came -- we landed April\nthe first, 1947, in the harbor of New York, and I decide I gonna s -- la --sta -- start my life\nall over. I had an old, old overcoat. I took the overcoat and dropped it in the Hudson\nriver. So I came with a thing, with a s -- only suit, a -- a suitcase of books, and six bucks,\nand this how m -- I started my life. So I had an aunt of mine, which I went to stay with\nmy aunt for a little while, except they was almost as poor as I was. So, I had to find a job.\n[ -- I -- since I sub -- mentioned before, I played in the movies, I got a contact to Eddie\nCantor. And Eddie Cantor was in contract at that time to RKO, and they offered me a job,\na job o -- to be an usher in Radio City Music Hall, or become a waiter in -- up in the\nCatskills, some hotel in the Catskills. I didn\u2019t want to do any of those two. I didn\u2019t want\nto be a server, be an usher showing seats, or being a server in a hotel, so I declined all\nthose offers. So I got myself a job -- actually, my cousin got me a job in S. Klein, there\nwas a department store, an S. Klein, I got a job for 28 dollars a week, 60 hours a day. Six\ndays, 10 hours a day. After tax and everything else, I came home with 24 dollars. Out of\nthe 24 dollars, I had to give 15 dollars to my aunt for room and board. Actually, it was\nonly room, and a Sunday dinner. Everything else had to be my own, so with the subway,\nwhich I think at that time was a nickel or dime, I didn\u2019t have too much money. So I lived\non one sandwich a day, and I lived on salami sandwiches for months. Simple reason is, I\ndidn\u2019t speak English -- I hardly spoke English, and I go into the cafeteria, I saw ona\nboard, salami. So I said salami in [indecipherable] language must be salami. So I walk\ndown the line and I said to the fellow, the server that was serving, \u201cSalami.\u201d He says\nsomething to me, I didn\u2019t understand it, but he had a long knife, and he pointed to a rye\nbread, so I wave my head, and so he made me a salami sandwich, and when you got the\nregister, there were kind of small containers of milk, so I took two containers of milk.\nAfter one week, or two weeks, he knew already. So I went to the -- came to the end of my\nline, my salami sandwich was waiting on -- for me. After this m -- I found -- my sister\ncame here, found my sister, so I had to save some money even to send it to her. So, I\nlived on salami sandwiches quite some time.",
        "A: I-It -- oh, it was -- actually, it was a rebirth. I was born again. That\u2019s what I felt. By\nthe way, I didn\u2019t see the Statue of Liberty that day, it was foggy.

But anyways, through him I -- I went to the -- became -- went to\nthe underground, til finally, I we -- we -- went to CIC, and I worked in the CIC, and I\nworked in a -- I worked in a place called the inflowsunkunstad.

So my job was -- I had liaison only one woman, her name was Ren\u00e9es, I don\u2019t\nknow what the other name is. She was a French lady. I don\u2019t know if she was Jewish or\nnot.

Lived with a woman\nwith the -- with a lady by the name of Birmingham, who was a heiress of Tiffany. She\nhad a husband and two children, she left them, and they had -- she was a homose -- both\nof them were lesbians. So they lived together.

So I got a job -- I -- I got a -- myself a apartment in a\nbrownstone ons -- on River Ave, between Broadway, and West End Avenue, next to the\nAnsonia Hotel. So I did quite well, I mean that it\u2019s -- the money which I st -- fer -- to --\n15 had to pay out, that paid for my rent, and I did quite well. I liked it, and I made friends\nthere, I made friends. And after this I was drafted in the army, after draft in the army, so I\nhad to give up everything else, so I didn\u2019t have anything else. And, matter of fact, she\nwas the only one who wrote -- used to write me almost -- every two, three days, and her\nfam -- her family did not. Didn\u2019t do it.",
        "A: Very little friends, very few friends. I had a problem at that time, which was because\nof my accent. I had a fellow which I came here together on a ship, which is called\nsomething Zimmerman, so I was friendly with him. But he moved down to Coney Island,\nin New York, Coney Island. I lived on Broadway, so we drifted apart. He had a\nprofession right away, he was a carpenter, so he did quite, quite well, and I didn\u2019t have\nany profession, I was a perpetual student. So, I made friends afterwards, we made friends.\nBut not too many friends. Let\u2019s put it this -- we had acquaintances -- I made\nacquaintances. I had -- didn\u2019t make any friends, I made acquaintances. I had\nacquaintances, but no friends.",

        "A: I had a tentia -- I -- in -- I -- I applied, because I came as a -- as political escapee,\nintention to become a citizen. I was drafted.

So the f -- go -- the army\nwas a revelation to me, it was a revelation to th -- but I -- I survived it. I made it. I made\nit. Especially in my basic training, I had this incident with Dr. Do -- with Dr. Deutsch --\nwith Deutsch, so it left a -- a bi -- I became more cautious -- I became more cautious, so\nthe only thing to -- to -- to be in my own milieu, I became active in the Jewish temple in -\n- in the army base, with Judaism, so at least I felt a certain amount of kinsmen, who going\nto feel this -- what I have been through 1s -- and not to make fun of my language,\nwhatever it was.",

        "A: You know, I think the politi -- politics 1-1-1-1-1s the spine of the nation. I mean, the\nspine of nation. Look what is going on the -- let\u2019s take 1999 and 2000. With all the killing\nwhat\u2019s going on by people with guns, we can\u2019t even pass a gun control law. I mean, it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s terrible. So sometime I feel a small, autocratic nation, a small autocratic philosophy,\nis not the worst thing in the whole world. Democracy is terrific, what it stands for now, to\n-- quoting Mr. Churchill, he said, \u201cDemocracy is only good right now, because we don\u2019t\nknow of anything better.\u201d But if you take Hellenistic culture, the destroying of Hellenistic\nculture was democracy, because everybody was right. And now we have atoks the Fifth\nAmendment. Fifth Amendment is your right to arm, it\u2019s not true, doesn\u2019t say that, Fifth\nAmendment doesn\u2019t say that. You\u2019re allowed to bear arms for the militia. We have a\nmilitia, it\u2019s called the National Guard. You know the militia thas I going to shoot at him,\nhe\u2019s coming through my door today, and I\u2019m allowed to have a gun. We have to be\neducated. There\u2019s nobody more armed in the whole world than it is in Israel. Almost\neverybody had a rifle every -- but the killing is not there. So it seems like we have to\neducate not only what the gun stands for, but what the gun can do. But here we just -- yo\n-- the last two days we got a six year old child -- killed a six year old boy. A six year old\nboy killed some s-six year old child. This fellow killed yesterday, because he doesn\u2019t like\nthe white people, killed three people. And we can\u2019t pass a gun control law. We can\u2019t even\npass a law to put a -- a governor on a gun. So this reason -- we have to be involved. Being\ngun control, being equal right, being pregnancy, being whatever it is. I mean, where does\nit -- where does it -- my philosophy, where does the Senate, the House, or the -- the -- the\nstate has a right to go into my wife\u2019s bedroom? Or anybody\u2019s bedroom? What you want\nto do with your body? I going to tell you you can\u2019t have an abortion -- you cannot have\nabortion. The people who have money, they going to get abortion regardless. If they\ndon\u2019t get it here, they get it in Canada, they get it in Timbuktu, they get it someplace.\nOnly that -- poor people have to get an abortion through a hanger.

I didn\u2019t get -- I didn\u2019t have\nanything to do with them. I didn\u2019t get any money for 50 years. I just started receiving it\nthe last one year.

It gave me a certain satisfaction, but in retrospect, I just made a speech\nfor some newspaper editors, and newspaper artists, and I said to them -- was last year, or\ntwo years ago. And I said to them, \u201cYou know something?

Now let me tell you an\nincident what happened to me two years ago. I go around -- I used to go around -- used to\ngo around, make speeches about the Holocaust, and it\u2019s either the -- the -- how it\u2019s Hitler\ncame to power, the German push on Munich, push. Landsberg, and -- and vay -- Hitler\nwith \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d and ha -- Rudolf Hess, everything else. So before -- this was in\nLakewood Community College in Lakewood, which is part of the Fl-Florida University.\nSo before I start the speech, I usually say, \u201cDoes anybody know what the Holocaust\nmeans?\u201d There are three girls -- three girls, one black, and two white girls raise their\nhand. I picked one of them who looks -- who looks Jewish, something like this. She looks\nJewish. No problem is she going to know what the Holocaust means. I says, \u201cYes, young\nlady, what is the Holocaust?\u201d She says, \u201cEthnic food.\u201d You\u2019re making a face? That\u2019s\nwhat she said.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: So she said it\u2019s ethnic food, and it\u2019s extremely disappointed since then. I feel when we\ntake the children to the Holocaust museum, and I -- and I think it\u2019s -- since you are\nworking there, I wonder if you ever observed, when they walk out, they make, tch, tch,\ntch, tch. It\u2019s leaves an effect, and after is always feels better, we going to eat now. I mean,\nI don\u2019t know how long emotion stays with them. They should made a study, how long\nemotion stays with you, if it doesn\u2019t touches you extremely personally, you know, father,\nmother, cousin, something. When you see a strange mass of people, eight million, s-six\nmillion, 25 million. It\u2019s only a number. History teaches us it\u2019s not the first Holocaust we\nwent through, not in this scope, but we know tha -- wer -- were that -- to sin -- crusifi --\nto Crusades, because French Huguenots, there\u2019s a Christian killing Christians, almost\neverybody. The Turks went all the way up to Vienna, they killed mercilessly. We went\ndown to the -- two Crusades, we killed everybody who came in our way. So you see, so --\nso this Holocaust is repeated itself, only in bigger scope. And I always wonder, is if you\ntalk about it, it\u2019s only eventually going to be a sentence in a new -- in the history books.\nYou know, there was a Holocaust, 35 million people died, 25 million people died, six\nmillion Jews is gonna die, and that\u2019s all what it is. \u2019m a very much involved now with\nthe Holocaust survivors here, right here where I live, but you know, now, as a matter of\nfact, just recently went to a meeting, and somebody said something about the Holocau --\nhe says, \u201cOh, we here to have good times.\u201d See, even the Holocaust survivors don\u2019t want\nto dwell of what happened. He says, \u201cWe ve -- have a life, now let\u2019s have -- let\u2019s think of\ngood times.\u201d So I don\u2019t know where to we -- history going to tea -- what history going to\nthink of us. Maybe the museum going to stay for some time, like same thing Museum of\nNational History, says, you know we -- how the Indians lived, and how the Neanderthal\nman lived, and how the Elsie lived, and the -- maybe we going to be just a little\n[indecipherable]. I went to Prague, there\u2019s a gorgeous, gorgeous synagogue, which called\nthe Portuguese synagogue, which is gorgeous. Hitler left it intact, because he said, \u201cAfter\nall the Jews are destroyed, this going to be a show, the museum how the Jew -- there was\na race, by the name of Jews.\u201d And he left it. And that\u2019s all. And we were eventually going\nto be the Holocaust, I feel going to be, you know, there was a -- a Holocaust, there was a\n-- a-- a darkness over Europe, which -- caused by one man, and his organization. It\u2019s sad.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. We have a little bit now, if you can taste it in Vienna, in Austria. I\nmean, get rid of the refugees. So today we get rid of the refugees.

Now, by -- after 50 years, 50 years is two generations, now\nwe want to get rid of them. And if they\u2019re not the Turks, tomorrow going to be the blue\neyed people nec -- day after the blondes, or the day after, the Jews.
