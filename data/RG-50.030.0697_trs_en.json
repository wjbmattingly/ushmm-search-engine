And whoever they saw\nthey could have beat up or something, and it was scary to go out. So this I\nremember very well when I got older a little bit, not when I was very young. When\nI was very young, I was like very free to roam around, not the city, but near the\nhouse. We had the little park, you know, we had swings.

It was like \u2014 it was like a bomb, you know, like an \u2014 where they were\nbombing us first, like I said, we had \u2014 my mother took us, we escaped to a village,\nmaybe there would be less bombing. But they were so low in the planes, that\u2019s \u2014 I\nremember like vividly I seeing them now. They could have killed everybody, but\nsomehow \u2014",
        "Q: Were you on the road?",

        "A: Not to our house, like I said, to my grandfather\u2019s house, and we stayed there\nuntil the Germans moved in. Nobody talked about Hitler, nobody talked about the\nGermans. We only heard \u2014 nobody had the radio in those years \u2014 we heard that\nFrance was occupied, Belgium was occupied, all these countries, and Poland was\nlike the next on the road. They came in, it was just before the Jewish holidays, and\nthey settled themselves to the best houses, which they occupy half of my zayde\u2019s\nhouse, my grandfather\u2019s. Course, he had like a double house. And they were very \u2014\nthose were young, very young Austrian soldiers. They were quiet, pleasant. They\nsaid don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not going to do nothing to you. That\u2019s how I remember tt.\nAnd it was settled, you know, everything is going to be okay. Few weeks later\nwhen they took my older brother to work, he was that time already 14 years old.",
        "Q: Pinchus(ph).",
        "A: Outside the town, I don\u2019t know what to do, I have no idea. Oh, maybe I had an\nidea, but I don\u2019t remember. Then he came home at night a few days later, we heard\nthe loudspeakers in the market, you know, it the city hall, that all the Jewish people\nshould gather at this and this time in the marketplace, and there will be an\nannouncement made. So the announcement was that every Jew has to leave\nRozwadow immediately. You could go home, take whatever you can, and leave\nthe town.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "Q: What a shock.",
        "A: It was \u2014 for my mother it wasn\u2019t a shock, because she wanted to go and find my\nfather. She didn\u2019t know where he 1s, she never \u2014 we never heard from him. She had\na feeling that he is someplace alive. So she gathered us, we put on like \u2014 I\nremember like \u2014 I put on like three dresses, or whatever and two coats, and hats. It\nwas already September, October, something like this. And my brothers, whatever\nthey had in a little bundle on the back. And my zayde went, my grandfather, my\nfather\u2019s father. My cante(ph) with her three kids and her husband. We went to the\nSan. The San is the river which divided our city in half.",
        "Q: Ah, so Rozwadow was on the San river.",
        "A: Rozwadow was on the San, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And that\u2019s what \u2014 the city where my husband comes, also on the San, but they\nwere on the Ukrainian side, we were on the Galician side, on the Polish side. So \u2014",
        "Q: Were the cities far from each other?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] far?",
        "A: Yes, because they were like, near the Ukraine.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It still \u2014 it still is called Irlitsia(ph).",
        "Q: Irlitsia(ph)",
        "A: \u2014 I think, I \u2014 I\u2019m not sure. So everybody who was able to work, the kids, the old\npeople, the young people, and some people didn\u2019t leave. Some people were hiding\nin their homes. We left. We got on the San, hurry across the San. The bridge was\nalready bombard to pieces. So, of course if you have a little money, my grandfather\ngot a Polish guy who had a little, like a fishing boat or something. So the family got\ninto that boat, and many people drowned, because they were walking in the water.\nThey didn\u2019t think it\u2019s that deep, but it was deep. Many, many people drowned. And\nwe got to the other side. On the other side we had a small village, but it was\nprosperous village, where my father\u2019s brother lived, his wife and his father-in-law\nand his child.",
        "Q: Wait, what was the name of the village?",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 because we were family, for a few days. And my mother saw Polish soldiers\ncoming home from the war, every \u2014 and she knew a lot of the \u2014 a lot of the old\ncustomers of my father. So she used to ask them if they ever saw my u \u2014 my father.\nThey said yes, he\u2019s alive, but he\u2019s in the German side, in Premisz(ph).",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Premisz(ph) was also, one side was the Russian, and one side also was the zerc\n\u2014 I mean, the water in the middle \u2014 one side was the Russians occupied, one side\nwas the Germans. My father fell in into the German side, as a Polish soldier.",
        "Q: When \u2014 can \u2014 before I go there, just to establish, when you were in the village\nwith your father\u2019s brother, was that occupied by the Russians at that point?",

        "A: The Russians were starting to come in.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: They were starting to come in, but they didn\u2019t get that fast to that area.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The Germans got much faster to the other side where we lived. So my mother\nsaid no, she\u2019s gonna take her children, and she\u2019s gonna go and walk to meet the\nRussians. And we were constant, constant, we saw Polish \u2014 Polish soldiers coming\nback from the army, which were already, you know, army that time was already \u2014",
        "Q: What did they look like, these soldiers, as they were coming back?",
        "A: Tired, exhausted. And they were glad that they still were alive and coming\nhome.",
        "Q: Did they say anything of what happened?",
        "A: N-No, didn\u2019t say nothing. We stayed in Pishnison(ph), which was the je \u2014\nwhich were the border of the Germans, and the border of the Russians.",

        "Q: Oh my gosh.",
        "A: Yeah. One very dark room, but at least, after walking for miles and miles and\nmiles with the bundle and all dressed up, we finally got to Pishnison(ph), and we\nstayed there. The Russians were already occupied that town. We stayed there for\nawhile, maybe a week or something, til we got our strength back. My mother\npicked herself up, she left us with my aunt and uncle, and she took the\n[indecipherable] to Lwow, because she had a feeling that maybe she\u2019ll find my\nfather.",
        "Q: Was Lwow under the Germans at that point?",
        "A: No, Lwow was under the Russians.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Under the Russians.",
        "Q: Even though she had been told he was in a prison in a town \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, but we don\u2019t know what happened after.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: After the war, or \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 how he got out or \u2014",
        "Q: Right.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 where he was. So she went to Lwo\u00e9w, she was never in Lwow. I don\u2019t know\nhow she had the courage to go there, and she was walking around the whole city,\nasking people if they ever saw my father, if they know where he 1s, and if this \u2014 if\nhe survived. Somehow, my father survived. He was kept in a camp, in a German\ncamp for a while, and I don\u2019t know how he escaped, and he crossed the border to\nLwow.",
        "Q: So even though she didn\u2019t know, and he didn\u2019t know, they ended up in the same\ncity.",
        "A: In the same city, and somehow all the refugees at tho \u2014 at that time they all\nstuck together, they \u2014 everybody was trying to find somebody they know.",
        "Q: Sounds like huge chaos.",
        "A: In Lwow, yes, little \u2014 in 1939, yes, 1940. And she found him. And she came\nback, she said to my \u2014 to his father, my zayde and \u2014 and to his sister, she said, I\u2019m\ntaking my kids, I\u2019m going to Lwow, I found my husband. So we were so happy,\nand took the train, we went to Lw\u00e9w and they gave us the \u2014 like a committee, a\nJewish committee. There still was a lot of \u2014 lot of Jews before the war there. They\narranged something for us to sleep in a Polish cathedral, you know, we slept \u2014",
        "Q: Was it the first time you were in a Polish church \u2014 in a Catholic church?\nMay 5, 2013",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, in a Catholic church. I remember even the street was\nMatskavich(ph), the street was Matskavich(ph), I can \u2014 how I remember this, I\ndon\u2019t know.",

        "Q: So it\u2019s a huge place.",
        "A: Very huge. So the \u2014 and the Polacks there, and the priests gave us the\ndownstairs. Not only us, where \u2014 there was a lot of refugees. We slept there on the\nfloor for a good while. But at least we were together.",
        "Q: Did you have any food? Did anybody give you any food?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We probably got food from the people \u2014 from the Jewish people who lived\nbefore the war in Lwow.",

        "Q: Just Jewish?",
        "A: Just Jews, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The Polish people didn\u2019t have to leave the city or go by themselves or anything.\nMy parents went to look for a place where they could live with Jews together and\nnot in a cathedral. So they found not far from the marketplace, a big house, which\nperl \u2014 probably belonged to Jews, and they gave out floors for those people.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Now it was empty, we slept on the floors. So there was I don\u2019t know how many\nfamilies. We had a little space, all five slept together and had the little\n[indecipherable] or whatever they gave us to cook something. And we lived there\nand I started Russian schools.",
        "Q: You started to go to school in r \u2014 had you s \u2014 ah, one question I had, did you see\nRussian soldiers in Lwow?",

        "A: You know.",
        "Q: They look different, huh?",
        "A: I\u2014I saw \u2014I saw the German soldiers. They were much cleaner looking than the\nRussian soldiers. Different outfits, different everything. But they didn\u2019t bother us,\nthey let us roam around free. If you can buy something on the black market, if you\nhad some money for food or something, you bought whatever you could. And\nthat\u2019s how we survived for 1940 \u2014 1939 - 1940. And I started Russian school. I was\nthat time going in the \u2014 in the fifth grade, maybe sixth grade.",
        "Q: So how old were you?",

        "Q: But it\u2019s import \u2014",
        "A: But didn\u2019t \u2014 I \u2014 those years I didn\u2019t realize. I was only nine years old. What do I\nknow about the war?",
        "Q: Of course, of course.",
        "A: What do I think about the war.",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: Af\u2014I want to ask a question, though.",

        "Q: Russian and Jew \u2014 so you were able to study in Yiddish, or in \u2014",
        "A: In Yiddish and Russian, yeah, they were Jewish teachers.",
        "Q: And it was a public school? Or was a religious school?",
        "A: It was a \u2014 supposedly \u2014 no, no, a public.",
        "Q: A public school.",
        "A: Public school. And just wanted the children to do something with themselves,\notherwise they would get crazy.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: They were \u2014",
        "Q: And do you have any impressions of this school?",
        "A: Excuse me?",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of the school?",
        "A: Not much.",
        "Q: What would you remember from it?",
        "A: I remember to learn Russian that time. You know, beginning. They didn\u2019t last\nlong, maybe a few months. After my father went to register that\u2019s he want to go\nback to Poland, not only him, they were standing in the line for days. And then he\ncame home happy that\u2019s \u2014 who knew the war 1s going to be for six years, nobody\nMay 5, 2013\nknew. That\u2019s eventually they will let us go back to Poland, you know, to the home.\nSo instead of keeping the promise that they\u2019re gonna let us go home, the Russians\ntook over. All the people who registered to go home, they got them together from\nall over, no matter where you were, and that was on a Friday night, I remember like\nnow. My mother had cooked something for Shabbas. The Russians came 1n,\nbecause they knew where all the refugees were living, the Russians came in and\nthey said, get yourself together immediately. We didn\u2019t know what happened, we\nwere sleeping. My parents woke us up, we got dressed. Then my mother took\nwhatever she cooked, you know, for Shabbas, and they took us to the trains. Not\nknowing where we going, not knowing nothing. Hungry and naked and everybody\nget up like they know how to do it, very rough.",
        "Q: So the manner was different from what you had ac \u2014 been experiencing up til\nthen\u2019? The way the soldiers behaved was different than what you had experienced in\nLwow until that time.",
        "Q: Well, this was \u2014 this was like a \u2014 they \u2014 they had a \u2014 they were told they have to\ndo that, but first, in one night they got together, the whole refugee or whoever \u2014\nwherever they were, if they knew who they were. And when we came those trains,\nwe met already my aunt, with her kids, and my uncle, and my grandfather and a lot\nof other families from other people my parents knew. And they put us in cattle\nMay 5, 2013\ntrains, hundreds of people in one train. You only have standing place. We stood\nlike \u2014 worse than cattles. And then the Ukrainian, the goyim, they were the\nhappiest in the world. They were clapping and they were dancing, and they were\nwhatnot.",
        "Q: You saw that?",
        "A: Yes, we saw that before we even went to the trains. So they \u2014 they knew they\u2019 Il\nhave plenty of what to \u2014 you know, take away whate \u2014 whatever the Jews left. But\nthey didn\u2019t take the people who did not register. They only took the people who\nregistered they want go back. Which means you wanted to go back to \u2014 to\nGermany, to be in that \u2014 on the Hitler side, but Hitler wasn\u2019t, you know, on the\nother side of Poland.",
        "Q: But here\u2019s a question. If \u2014 knowing that, knowing that \u2014 that it\u2019s on the German\nside, why did your father want to go home?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna take \u2014 the war was \u2014 God knows they \u2014 they\nthought after the pact, you know, when the \u2014 Hitler did the pact with Russia, it\u2019s\ngonna be one, two, three and they\u2019re gonna divide, and you can go home and be\nyourself like you were before. That\u2019s what you thought.",
        "Q: So they knew about the pact. They knew \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, we knew about the pact, you know.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "Q: You knew the pact.",
        "A: There never gonna be a war with Russia and Germany. They\u2019re gonna divide\nwhatever they took, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s gonna be finished. So who didn\u2019t want to\ngo home to their places where they were born, raised and \u2014 and worked and\neverything\u2019? So \u2014 and they took us to the cattle trains, and then they were filled up\nwith different families, we didn\u2019t know who they were. We didn\u2019t know none of\nthem.",
        "Q: Were any refugees not Jewish? Are you saying all of the refugees were Jewish?",
        "A: All Jewish.",
        "Q: All Jewish.",
        "A: All Jewish, only Jews.",
        "Q: Only Jews, okay.",
        "A: So \u2014 and we traveled, we traveled for a whole month. They stopped in certain\nplaces, which they let us go out in case you had to go out. Otherwise there was\nnothing inside that you could relieve yourself. That was crying and crying and\ngetting sick and it was \u2014 I'll never forget that. We were only kids. My oldest\nbrother was 15, my middle brother was 13 and I was 10.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know where you were going?",
        "A: No.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "Q: You knew it wasn\u2019t home, however.",
        "A: No, no, we knew right away, yeah, we knew it. Because it didn\u2019t go the side like\nto Poland, it was now the way we going my \u2014 they used to stop like maybe after\nfew weeks of traveling, or a week, so that people came to the \u2014 to the trains, and\nthey gave us like [indecipherable] like hot water to bring something. There was no\nfood, there was nothing.",
        "Q: So you got no food in the trains, nobody fed you.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: Well, how could someone survive no water and no food?",
        "A: Nothing, nothing, just -\u2014 we remember stopping, and this was already Russia.\nWe \u2014 we didn\u2019t know where we were. They came to the trains with buckets of hot\nwater and it was like a Godsend, you know. Food? There was nothing. They didn\u2019t\nfeed us at all, from \u2014",

        "A: No, we \u2014 when we came to the Urals, it was already winter, because they took\nus off the train with sleds, and they brought us to \u2014 1n the Urals, which was camps\nand barracks, and \u2014 and the steppes, you know, steppes? I don\u2019t know if you know\nwhat the steppes are in Russia.",
        "Q: Tell me, what does it \u2014 what does it look like, a steppe?",
        "A: It\u2019s fields, empty, empty fields, around, around on the Ural mountains. It\u2019s like\non the border with Europe and \u2014 and Europe and Asia, divided. This was the ur \u2014\nthe \u2014",

        "A: Because I wasn\u2019t there. So I wouldn\u2019t say I \u2014 I abandoned my mother or\nanything, I was seeing my mother very often, as often as my \u2014 as the minute came I\nwas able to bring her here, and I had some money saved, I brought her here to this\ncountry, but she didn\u2019t like it here, because my brothers were there, they had\nalready families.",

        "A: And \u2014 and she was used to it already.",
        "Q: Yeah.",

They \u2014 all the women used to go out and talk to each other from\nhome, from the kids, from the grandkids. And here she didn\u2019t have no one to talk.\nSo after one year, she left \u2014 I mean, she went home.",

        "Q: I have a couple of questions still.",
        "A: All right. No problem.",
        "Q: When it all started, when all of this started, so unexpectedly for you, you were\nnine years old.",
        "A: Close to 10.",
        "Q: Close to 10. And when the war ended, you were already 15 - 16 years?",
        "A: 16, yeah.",
        "Q: How did you change, what happened? Were you the same person?",
        "A: I grew up too fast. I didn\u2019t have teenage years, so I didn\u2019t know what it means to\nbe young, because between 39 and \u201945, it was like a period you didn\u2019t know where\nit went. Was very hard times, especially the winter times. When you were healthy,\nthen it was like you appreciated that because you were healthy. In the teenage\nyears, when you were the teenage years, you always had to do something to help\nthe family, you know. So I learned in France how to sew, when I got married. We\ndidn\u2019t have anything, I just went to work right away. I was sewing clothes. We had\nthe little factory in the camp. And then, because I knew a little Hebrew, and I was a\nlittle bit educated, I was working in the kindergarten with kids, and for a while,\nuntil we emigrated to America.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "Q: I have another question. Your experience, what you went through 1s different\nfrom that of most Holocaust survivors because you were in Russia.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Do you think \u2014 it\u2019s a bit of a provocative question \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 do you think people understand that experience enough \u2014",
        "A: You mean the experience we went through?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Not so much.",
        "Q: Why would that be?",
        "A: Not \u2014 not so much because they consider us being the lucky ones, the Holocaust\nsurvivors, which were \u2014 which officially, no matter how much we went through,\nwe were the lucky ones, we weren\u2019t shot to death.",
        "Q: That\u2019s true, yeah.",
        "A: You know, if we didn\u2019t accomplish anything over there, but many people,\nmany, many people that died from hunger.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And this was like \u2014 just like in the concentrations, not being shot, but dying\nfrom hunger.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I know my mother\u2019s brother and his wife, they died in [indecipherable] on the\nstreet from hunger. And they were rich people at home, rich. I wouldn\u2019t say like\nhere somebody rich, but in our standards, in my home, this was a rich family. And\nthey died from hunger. There was nothing they could buy, even they had some\nmoney.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: So, I saw a lot of dead people in the camps.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Not being shot, but being able to work and not having what to eat.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So they just gave up and died. But we were the lucky ones \u2014",
        "Q: Do you \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because we didn\u2019t \u2014 my \u2014 my mother didn\u2019t go to work with the big s \u2014 you\nknow, with the [indecipherable] on her back. The commanders there made them\nwork very hard.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And that was \u2014 and it was 60 below zero, you know what that is?",
        "Q: I have no idea.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "A: The snow was that high, and you walked just \u2014 you made like a \u2014 how do you\ncall a shareskai(ph) like?",
        "Q: A li\u2014 small path?",
        "A: Like a little bit walk through, and both sides the snow was higher than you. And\nthat\u2019s how we lived. No transportation, no nothing. You walked to school like this.\nThere were no days off because there was a snow, there was no such a thing. You\nhad to be in school.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: This was already where you were freed from the steppes \u2014 from the steppes,\nfrom Ural.",
        "Q: And is there a reason \u2014",
        "A: And the worst thing was, when you became older, after 13, you had to join the\nKomsomol. You know what the Komsomol is?",
        "Q: Tell me.",
        "A: Komsomol is the youth communist party.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And whenever \u2014 me and my cousin were in the same class, and they were after\nus to join, and my father said no, no, no. And I couldn\u2019t say my father said no,\nbecause they would put him to jail. So, we were trying to avoid it, not to be forced\nMay 5, 2013\ninto it. So they \u2014 in the summer they send us to a camp where we could help, you\nknow, with the harvest or whatever, to work there, or do something. That\u2019s how the\nfew years went back, and by the time they made me already join, we were free to\ngo home.",
        "Q: So it was just on the edge.",
        "A: Just on the edge, for a whole year and a half, and I wasn\u2019t able to open my\nmouth, that\u2019s my hu \u2014 father 1s not allowing me to join the Komsomol. They didn\u2019t",
        "Q: It must have been a lot of stress, a lot of stress.",
        "A: No wonder you get sick, you know. Yeah, but somehow you don\u2019t realize, when\nyou are so young, you know, you don\u2019t realize that s \u2014 that stress, you don\u2019t know\nwhat it is. Later on you find out that\u2019s stress, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s punishment, it\u2019s this and\nthat, but when you young, you don\u2019t think about those things.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You think that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be, and that\u2019s how it was.",
        "Q: Wh-Why \u2014 huh? You said \u2014",
        "A: And that\u2019s how we lived through.",
        "Q: You said earlier that you never really talked about your experiences.",
        "A: No, never.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: With children, never. We didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t want them to burden with what I went\nthrough. I figure less they know, better it\u2019s for them. So \u2014",
        "Q: Did they want to know?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: Did they get \u2014 did you ha \u2014 did they ask you questions?",
        "A: Not much, because they saw we don\u2019t want to talk, so they didn\u2019t. We always\nused to, when we used to come for Shabbas [indecipherable] their house, she\nalways used to go on zayde\u2019s lap, she said, zayde, tell me [indecipherable] story.\nHe meant this is a story. So he used to tell them how we were up in the woods, how\n\u2014 and he was looking for his mother, she got lost in the woods, she didn\u2019t have a\ngood organization how to get out of the woods. He went at night with all the\nwolves and everything, and \u2014 and he found her and he put her on a sled and he\nbrought her home. She hardly was alive, you know. She was so frightened and\nafraid. And you know, stories like this, but not like what happened after, or before,\nyou know? And they were like \u2014 especially [indecipherable] was like every time\nuntil they grew up, zayde, tell me a massen(ph), tell me a massen(ph). He was\nfascinated with those stories. And that\u2019s why he went after me two years ago,\nBubbe, why don\u2019t you want to \u2014 it\u2019s good for us, we\u2019ll know what happened, you\nMay 5, 2013\nknow? My other grandson called me up, Bubbe, it\u2019s going to be for \u2014 not only for\nthe first generation, it\u2019s going to be for the second generation, for our kids. At least\nthey\u2019ll know where you\u2019re coming from. I said okay. I never talked so much in my\nlife.",
        "Q: I\u2019m grateful that you did. I\u2019m very grateful that you did. I know it\u2019s costing, I\nknow there\u2019s a price to pay for it, but we\u2019re very, very grateful.",
        "A: I never, never \u2014 I never had \u2014 let\u2019s put it this way, I never had the time, I worked\nvery hard, I used to come late, and I had to cook for the kids, and I had to go to the\nmeetings, I have to go to parents\u2019 meetings, and I have to \u2014 and then my husband\nwas sick. I mean, they \u2014 and I dealt with a lot of people during the day in the bank,\na lot. And I heard so much horrific stories how children are treating them, you\nknow. And they were all rich people having business and jewelry and the children\nwant them already to take a day of it, and I \u2014 and I had to listen to it, you know,\ncause I was a banker. So like I came home, I was like stim(ph), you know what\nstim(ph) is? Quiet.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I did my work what I had to do home, I cooked, I [indecipherable] made sure\nthey have what to eat and make sandwiches for the next day to go to school, and I\nwent to work. My children worked very hard because they went to school from\nMay 5, 2013\nseven to seven. They came home very late. They never had time to flounce around\noutside and play with the [indecipherable] with the other boys. They were \u2014 on the\nShabbas they went to shul, and Sunday they had school too, a half a day.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a lot of school.",
        "A: So they were like more restricted than other kids, you know. But thank God, I\ncan\u2019t complain. I made sure I would never need for my kids anything. I saved\nwhatever I could, we bought the house. Which I don\u2019t need it now because it\u2019s a \u2014\nnow I have three tenants in the house.\nEnd of File One\nMay 5, 2013\nBeginning File Two",

        "Q: I think this is a real \u2014",
        "A: I was able \u2014 I saved and I saved and I saved and sometimes now, why did I do\nit?",
        "Q: You ask yourself that?",
        "A: It took away too much strength to do it. So, you know, parents from Europe,\nthey always \u2014 even when my parents were not rich, middle class working people,\nthey wanted their children to have the best they could give them. And of course, us,\neven we didn\u2019t have anything. Of course, and the war took away so much. We\nwanted our children to be something. So you worked. If you didn\u2019t work, you\ndidn\u2019t have money to pay the schools, because they always went to private schools,\nyeshivas. So we worked and we saved and you worked and you paid, and whatever\nyou could, you put away for a birthday, or whatever \u2014 whatever\u2019s gonna come. But\nthank God.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "Q: Well, is there something that you would want people outside your family,\noutside your grandchildren, other American children, or young Polish people, or\nyoung Russian people, what would you want them to understand about what you\nwent through?",
        "A: Well, mostly people who I knew and know, they went through the same thing\nwhat I did. Most of my friends, younger, older, they passed away. I have two more\nfriends, which one is still very, very sharp. She went through a concentration camp\nand everything. But she doesn\u2019t want to do an interview because she says she\u2019s\ngonna sit and cry a whole day.

        "A: I would like to add that I was lucky with jobs. Wherever I worked, especially in\nthe bank for so many years, and 10 years in the bakery, I was well liked because I\nworked, I produced.

I mean, they were not so large, like there were six, and in\nmy mother\u2019s family there were six. And they all had children there \u2014 not married,\nthey were still all young before the war.",

        "A: Which grandparents?",

        "A: And everybody was very stunned because already he \u2014 that time he was in the\n40s, and he was like the only Jew who was drafted to the Polish army, and nobody\ncould understand why. So of course it was very hard for my mother with the three\nof us to make a living, or support us. We went to my grandfather, to my father\u2019s\nfather. He had a big house, he had room for us, and he told us to come there. So we\nlived together until the war.",
        "A: And we didn\u2019t hear from my father if he\u2019s alive or not, where he is. He was\nfighting. When the war started, he had to fight with the Polish army, the Germans.",

And my mother stayed with us, with my grandfather, my grandmother\nhad died just before, a few years. We stayed, and also my aunt and uncle. And their\nMay 5, 2013\nchildren all stayed at the same house until the Germans march into Poland, to our\ncity.",

And whoever they saw\nthey could have beat up or something, and it was scary to go out. So this I\nremember very well when I got older a little bit, not when I was very young. When\nI was very young, I was like very free to roam around, not the city, but near the\nhouse. We had the little park, you know, we had swings. So it wasn\u2019t like I had to\nMay 5, 2013\ngo far away that\u2019s my mother couldn\u2019t call me in when she felt it\u2019s time to get into\nthe house. So \u2014",

I remember I had a\nfriend, she was rich, and they had the telephone in the house, and also a doll \u2014a\ndoll and a carriage. We all got together and play with her dolls and with the\ncarriage. It was like, even for a person who didn\u2019t make a living for the family, but\nyou couldn\u2019t afforded those things. So if somebody was able to afford it, well, they\nhad the beer factory, that friend of mine. She didn\u2019t survive the war.",

And on Shabbas we\nused to go for \u2014 they had for the kids, they had like little lectures, you know,\nsinging. And this was also gathering everything on religious basis, nothing out of\nthe ordinary, which didn\u2019t belong to us. But there were also kids who were like in\ndifferent organizations.

They came in, it was just before the Jewish holidays, and\nthey settled themselves to the best houses, which they occupy half of my zayde\u2019s\nhouse, my grandfather\u2019s. Course, he had like a double house. And they were very \u2014\nthose were young, very young Austrian soldiers. They were quiet, pleasant.

She had\na feeling that he is someplace alive. So she gathered us, we put on like \u2014 I\nremember like \u2014 I put on like three dresses, or whatever and two coats, and hats. It\nwas already September, October, something like this. And my brothers, whatever\nthey had in a little bundle on the back. And my zayde went, my grandfather, my\nfather\u2019s father.

Some people were hiding\nin their homes. We left. We got on the San, hurry across the San. The bridge was\nalready bombard to pieces. So, of course if you have a little money, my grandfather\ngot a Polish guy who had a little, like a fishing boat or something. So the family got\ninto that boat, and many people drowned, because they were walking in the water.\nThey didn\u2019t think it\u2019s that deep, but it was deep. Many, many people drowned.

        "A: The Germans got much faster to the other side where we lived. So my mother\nsaid no, she\u2019s gonna take her children, and she\u2019s gonna go and walk to meet the\nRussians. And we were constant, constant, we saw Polish \u2014 Polish soldiers coming\nback from the army, which were already, you know, army that time was already \u2014",
        "A: Tired, exhausted. And they were glad that they still were alive and coming\nhome.",

        "A: Yeah. One very dark room, but at least, after walking for miles and miles and\nmiles with the bundle and all dressed up, we finally got to Pishnison(ph), and we\nstayed there. The Russians were already occupied that town. We stayed there for\nawhile, maybe a week or something, til we got our strength back. My mother\npicked herself up, she left us with my aunt and uncle, and she took the\n[indecipherable] to Lwow, because she had a feeling that maybe she\u2019ll find my\nfather.",

        "A: \u2014 where he was. So she went to Lwo\u00e9w, she was never in Lwow. I don\u2019t know\nhow she had the courage to go there, and she was walking around the whole city,\nasking people if they ever saw my father, if they know where he 1s, and if this \u2014 if\nhe survived. Somehow, my father survived. He was kept in a camp, in a German\ncamp for a while, and I don\u2019t know how he escaped, and he crossed the border to\nLwow.",
        "A: In the same city, and somehow all the refugees at tho \u2014 at that time they all\nstuck together, they \u2014 everybody was trying to find somebody they know.",
        "A: In Lwow, yes, little \u2014 in 1939, yes, 1940. And she found him. And she came\nback, she said to my \u2014 to his father, my zayde and \u2014 and to his sister, she said, I\u2019m\ntaking my kids, I\u2019m going to Lwow, I found my husband. So we were so happy,\nand took the train, we went to Lw\u00e9w and they gave us the \u2014 like a committee, a\nJewish committee. There still was a lot of \u2014 lot of Jews before the war there. They\narranged something for us to sleep in a Polish cathedral, you know, we slept \u2014",

        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "A: Just Jews, no.",
        "A: The Polish people didn\u2019t have to leave the city or go by themselves or anything.\nMy parents went to look for a place where they could live with Jews together and\nnot in a cathedral. So they found not far from the marketplace, a big house, which\nperl \u2014 probably belonged to Jews, and they gave out floors for those people.",
        "A: Now it was empty, we slept on the floors. So there was I don\u2019t know how many\nfamilies. We had a little space, all five slept together and had the little\n[indecipherable] or whatever they gave us to cook something. And we lived there\nand I started Russian schools.",

        "A: You know.",
        "A: I\u2014I saw \u2014I saw the German soldiers. They were much cleaner looking than the\nRussian soldiers. Different outfits, different everything. But they didn\u2019t bother us,\nthey let us roam around free. If you can buy something on the black market, if you\nhad some money for food or something, you bought whatever you could. And\nthat\u2019s how we survived for 1940 \u2014 1939 - 1940. And I started Russian school. I was\nthat time going in the \u2014 in the fifth grade, maybe sixth grade.",
        "A: I was that time by 11.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "A: When the war broke out, I was nine years old.",
        "A: That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t understand all this politics. I remember now \u2014",

        "A: But didn\u2019t \u2014 I \u2014 those years I didn\u2019t realize. I was only nine years old. What do I\nknow about the war?",
        "A: What do I think about the war.",
        "A: So after my father decided in 1940, a lot of people decided that\u2019s they going.\nThere was a committee to register who wants to go back to Poland, to the \u2014 to\nhome.",
        "A: Yeah.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "A: Russian and Jewish.",
        "A: In Yiddish and Russian, yeah, they were Jewish teachers.",
        "A: It was a \u2014 supposedly \u2014 no, no, a public.",
        "A: Public school. And just wanted the children to do something with themselves,\notherwise they would get crazy.",
        "A: They were \u2014",
        "A: Excuse me?",
        "A: Not much.",
        "A: I remember to learn Russian that time. You know, beginning. They didn\u2019t last\nlong, maybe a few months. After my father went to register that\u2019s he want to go\nback to Poland, not only him, they were standing in the line for days. And then he\ncame home happy that\u2019s \u2014 who knew the war 1s going to be for six years, nobody\nMay 5, 2013\nknew. That\u2019s eventually they will let us go back to Poland, you know, to the home.\nSo instead of keeping the promise that they\u2019re gonna let us go home, the Russians\ntook over. All the people who registered to go home, they got them together from\nall over, no matter where you were, and that was on a Friday night, I remember like\nnow. My mother had cooked something for Shabbas. The Russians came 1n,\nbecause they knew where all the refugees were living, the Russians came in and\nthey said, get yourself together immediately. We didn\u2019t know what happened, we\nwere sleeping. My parents woke us up, we got dressed. Then my mother took\nwhatever she cooked, you know, for Shabbas, and they took us to the trains. Not\nknowing where we going, not knowing nothing. Hungry and naked and everybody\nget up like they know how to do it, very rough.\nMay 5, 2013\ntrains, hundreds of people in one train. You only have standing place. We stood\nlike \u2014 worse than cattles. And then the Ukrainian, the goyim, they were the\nhappiest in the world. They were clapping and they were dancing, and they were\nwhatnot.",
        "A: Yes, we saw that before we even went to the trains. So they \u2014 they knew they\u2019 Il\nhave plenty of what to \u2014 you know, take away whate \u2014 whatever the Jews left. But\nthey didn\u2019t take the people who did not register. They only took the people who\nregistered they want go back. Which means you wanted to go back to \u2014 to\nGermany, to be in that \u2014 on the Hitler side, but Hitler wasn\u2019t, you know, on the\nother side of Poland.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna take \u2014 the war was \u2014 God knows they \u2014 they\nthought after the pact, you know, when the \u2014 Hitler did the pact with Russia, it\u2019s\ngonna be one, two, three and they\u2019re gonna divide, and you can go home and be\nyourself like you were before.

So my father\nbroke a window, and we got in through the window. It was [indecipherable] I\nmean, this was the height of the zimlanka(ph), and the zimlanka(ph) \u2014 and the\nwindow was from here, up to here, like the little window, we climbed in. And he\ndoesn\u2019t know why he couldn\u2019t wake up, he \u2014 he \u2014 we \u2014 we woke him up, we\nthought he\u2019s \u2014 something happened to him. And the next day my brother was freed,\nhe came home. And he\u2019s \u2014 and he continued working in the factory, but he never\nbrought home a \u2014 a shell of coconut any more.",
        "A: Excuse me?",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t \u2014 they \u2014 they just kept him overnight, they didn\u2019t \u2014 why did he\nsteal, or maybe they ask him, he said it\u2019s for my family, they don\u2019t have what to\nMay 5, 2013\neat, you know, maybe he said that. But my brother never talked. He was a very\nquiet man.",
        "A: He was too good. He didn\u2019t want to hurt anybody.",
        "A: So, and then he got this job with my father.",
        "A: So he worked until we were liberated in 1945. We were told that we could go\nhome, back to Poland. This was after the war. And of course after the war it was \u2014\nI was finishing up my seventh grade, which was a big deal at that time. And in\nMarch of \u201946, we were already in Poland, the whole family, also [indecipherable]\nhot, it was more comfortable.",
        "A: To what?",
        "A: My grandfather passed away in Troitsk.",
        "A: Yeah, in the middle of the war. We buried him there.",
        "A: There was a Jewish cemetery. My father\u2019s father.",
        "A: He lived with \u2014 with my aunt, uncle and her three kids.",
        "A: He lived, and they had one room. With \u2014 he didn\u2019t live in the zimlanka(ph), no,\nwe did. But later my mother found a room, one room, so we lived in one room.\nThis was already a palace, one room with three beds, my brother slept with another\n[indecipherable] she was also from the \u2014 you know, from us, from our Jewish\npeople. And we slept six people in one room, we had three beds.",
        "A: So I slept with my mother, and my older brother slept with the [indecipherable]\nand my middle brother slept with my father [indecipherable] bed maybe this \u2014 this\nwidth.",
        "A: But that was already a palace, you know. We had \u2014 we were able to get a\npackage from Poland with rice, which the rabbi said you could eat rice on Pesach.\nMy mother was making matzos at somebody\u2019s house, under \u2014 under the watchful\neye of the NK VD because the judges were upstairs and the oven was downstairs in\nthe same house. But somehow we survived with potatoes, you know, and laid\nMay 5, 2013\naround, and we were happy to get back to Poland. We never went back to our\nhome. We never back to Rozwadow.",
        "A: We \u2014 our train stopped in Brandenburg, which is called [indecipherable] in\nPolish now. And right away the organization started to try to get, you know, the\npeople being organized, like my parents joined the Mizrachi again, with Betas, we\nwere all the \u2014 and didn\u2019t stay long. At least I didn\u2019t stay long. I was the youngest of\nthe family. At that time Ralph Herzog was the chief rabbi of Palestine. He came\nto Poland and gathered 600 young children, and the English promised them 600\ncertificates to be able to bring to Israel. So he came, and his son. He was the chief\nrabbi, later on, of Israel. And he \u2014 his son was the president of Israel later \u2014 later\non, when Israel was established. And he took 600 children from the Mizrachi and\nfrom the Aguda.",
        "A: And they still \u2014 another religious organization.",
        "A: And he gathered them on the \u2014 in Katowice in Poland. I went, my cousin, my\nyounger cousin, all three of us were chosen from the Mizrachi, because we were\nthe youngest. And much, much younger children, up to 16 - 17 years. And they\nMay 5, 2013\ntook us to Katowice and [indecipherable] and we were traveling to\nCzechoslovakia. Supposedly in Czechoslovakia, he is supposed to get the\ncertificates for the kids to go into Palestine, that time Palestine. This was 1946.\nBut certificates never came. We came to [indecipherable] which is now part of \u2014\nnot part of Czechoslovakia, and we stayed there over Shabbas because he didn\u2019t\ntravel Shabbas. The people there brought us food. They divided us in different\nhotels. We stayed over Shabbas, Shabbas night we went to Prague. In Prague\nthere was a camp for the children, you know, not far from Prague, which was\ncalled Jablitz(ph).",
        "A: [indecipherable] Jablitz(ph). And he left us there, and Rabbi Ralph Herzog\nand his son went back to Israel, to Palestine that time, to request why he didn\u2019t get\nthe promised cer \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know, affidavits or certificate. And we never were able to go to Palestine.\nThey left us in Jablitz(ph) and the Aliyah [indecipherable] took over, another\nJewish organization, and then divided us into two groups, which were the Mizrachi\nand Aguda. They took us, after six weeks being in Czechoslovakia, they took us to\nStrasbourg in France, and Aguda they took to Cassada(ph), which is on the\nMay 5, 2013\nSpanish border in France. And in France already, we had Madrafeme(ph), which\nwere organizing the kids; the younger kids, the older kids, the middle kids. And we\nstayed in France from 1946 to 1948.",
        "A: We were in France. Strasbourg, and I was in Paris, and I was in Roazhon,\ndifferent places.",
        "A: Excuse me?",
        "A: Yes, in \u2014 in Strasbourg, yes, we went to learn French and also we learn \u2014 they\nte \u2014 they taught us to sew. You know, it\u2019s [indecipherable] this school. Mostly \u2014\nnot the regular school, but the French school, just to learn French.",
        "A: Which we learned, of course, and then you forget it, if you don\u2019t use it. So after\nI found out my father passed away in 1948, in Salzburg, they also emigrated from\nPoland to \u2014 to Austria, to the camps in Austria. I \u2014 my father was working with\nthe po \u2014 with the Polish council for me to come back to be with them together.\nBecause we couldn\u2019t go to Israel, there was no Israel that time, and the kids who\nwent to [indecipherable] were turned back \u2014\nMay 5, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 and they couldn\u2019t make it. So my father worked I should legally be able to\nleave France and come to Austria and be with them. But by the time the papers\nwere ready, he had passed away in March of 1948. By the time [indecipherable]\nwas, and my brother had joined th-the illegal geose(ph), this is the Israeli army,\nwhich was illegal one. My oldest brother, he joined with his oldest cousin. After he\njoined, of course, he went to fight. They went to Italy, first in France, Italy. From\nItaly they went by boat, by little boat, and they got into Palestine. And he was\nfighting in 1948 for Israel. I have a picture with his rifle [indecipherable]. They\ntook them off the boat, they gave them rifles [indecipherable]. No exercise, no\nnothing. He didn\u2019t know how to use a rifle, but that\u2019s what it was. And then I met\nmy husband in 1948, he was from the ma \u2014 through a friend.",
        "A: No, no, in [indecipherable] Salzburg.",
        "A: In Austria.",
        "A: I was gone back finally.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "A: In June I was gone back.",
        "A: Yes, and in June I was gone back and I had all the papers ready and everything.\nI already \u2014 my oldest brother, like I said, had really gone to geose(ph).",
        "A: And only my mother and my little brother were still in Salzburg.",
        "A: I stayed with them until I got married.",
        "A: Husband through a friend of mine, Joseph Jonas.",
        "A: We were going out for years and then we got married. In 1950, we got \u2014 we\nwere on the American zone. They did \u2014 when they were closing the camps, because\nour camp was in the city \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Bradenburg(ph) was in Salzburg but in the city.",
        "A: It was a camp fo-for soldiers, you know? So they were liquidated and they had\nto put the people someplace. So some people went to Israel, some people went to\nMay 5, 2013\nAmerica, some people went to Canada. And my husband\u2019s family, they wanted to\ngo to America because they had family here. My father-in-law had family here, so\nhe registered for America. He didn\u2019t have any papers. Because we were on the\nAmerican zone, they had to let you go where you wanted, because supposedly you\nare an American already. So when we came here, we got the green card right away,\nand the minute we got off the bus \u2014 the ship \u2014 the ship was coming here was like\nhalf dead. We came here on military ships. I remember the name of the ship was\nGeneral Blatchford. And we almost drowned, it was in December. We came in\n1950, in December \u2014 1950, just a day before Christmas.",
        "A: Because it was that \u2014 it was \u2014 don\u2019t forget, it wasn\u2019t Atlantic, it was the Pacific,\nand it\u2019s very rough. The ship was rolling. It was a military ship, you know. It\nwasn\u2019t a big boat. It was a boat.",
        "A: On a military ship.",
        "A: We were on the Atlantic Ocean coming to here.",
        "A: Yeah.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "A: But in that time was December. It was like, you know, the storms, the winds, the\n\u2014 it was very scary. So we came here and of course they s \u2014 HIAS took over, they\nsettled us in \u2014 in a hotel, some of them in HIAS, wherever they had place.",
        "A: Mm\u2019?",
        "A: Why I went back what?",
        "A: To the city where we came from?",
        "A: There was nobody left. There were no Jews, only Polacks, and my father never\nwanted to see the place he was born.",
        "A: There was nothing there. All the Jews were brought in to that area, which was\noccupied by Germany before the war, but after the war they gave it back to\nPoland, which was Brandenburg [indecipherable] a few cities. And that\u2019s where\nMay 5, 2013\nthey brought all \u2014 1f somebody wanted to go back, nobody did go back. And then\nwhen the riots started, in Brandenburg and in other cities, there were a lot of riots,\na lot of Jews killed, then everybody decided to leave Poland. Nobody went back to\ntheir own city any more.",
        "A: We even had killings early in 1946, after the war.",
        "A: The \u2014 the riots from the Polish anti-Semitin.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Excuse me?\nPoland? Did you know about that when you already returned?",
        "A: Yes. My father had a friend who joined the Polish army.",
        "A: And he wrote to us where \u2014 while we were still in Russia, before we left, he\nwrote to us what happened to the city, to the Jews, to everything. And he wrote us \u2014\nthat\u2019s my father\u2019s brother\u2019s son, who was alive, he was that time [indecipherable]\nMay 5, 2013\nwhen the war s \u2014 excuse me \u2014 when the war started. And he heard from the goyim\nhe knew, that my uncle\u2019s, my Benny\u2019s son Joseph is alive and he\u2019s now five years\nold or six, and he\u2019s in Lublin. The gathered all the kids they knew who are Jewish\nand they could find them, they brought them to Lublin \u2014",
        "A: \u20141n Poland. And that\u2019s \u2014 and that\u2019s how we knew this, what happened. And\nwhen you came home, you found out more.",
        "A: But we knew in the last \u2014 in the beginning not so much \u2014 in the last few years\nwe knew what was going on. We knew that my uncle was killed, my aunt was\nkilled, her father was killed. All the family from my father\u2019s, the sisters, the\nchildren, the husbands. All my family from my mother\u2019s side, whoever was left in\nPoland. Nobody survived. Only the only cousin survived. He was a baby and the\nparents gave him to Polacks, of course for a lot of money, and they \u2014 after the war\nthey just said go, go, and some of the Jews picked him up and they brought him to\nLublin. And then he came here to this country with his sisters, his mother\u2019s sister,\nhis mother\u2019s father. I mean, they came, he was \u2014 I don\u2019t know how \u2014 how old he\nwas, maybe five, six years old. He grew up in this country already.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "A: And he was very, very [indecipherable] the only cousin I have from the family\nwho survived from Germany. Nobody survived from my father\u2019s side, or my\nmother\u2019s side. They were all killed [indecipherable] killed in the same town where\nwe were crossing the San.",
        "A: They were in Justkowicz(ph), they made \u2014 I have a cousin who \u2014 it\u2019s not a\ncousin actually, she\u2019s part of the family like from grandmother\u2019s side. And she \u2014\nshe knew everything what was going on because she was with them, but she\nsurvived. She saw how my uncles were shot, everybody in one grave, the sons and\neverything, the children, everybody put to one grave.

        "A: \u2014 graves.",
        "A: After so many years. So this was my story til I came to Austria.",
        "A: After we came to \u2014 when I married, then after we came to this country, it wasn\u2019t\neasy. We came without the language, without a penny. After two weeks I found a\njob. I found a job working in a factory. That time was \u2014 we were in Korea, I think,\nor \u2014 yeah, in Korea. I was working for the Eisenhower jackets, you know, in a\nfactory for many, many months until my Moshe was born. We lived in a furnished\nby somebody in \u2014 in a one room apartment.

And slowly,\nslowly, he \u2014 we lived \u2014 I lived with my in-laws for five years when my both\nchildren were born. And my father-in-law had a brother here, only one brother,\nwhich was alive at that time. He made sure he helped me find an apartment on top\nof a bakery, on [indecipherable] Parkway in Brooklyn. And that\u2019s how I lived my\nlife til Moshe was Bar Mitzvahed. I worked in the bakery from four o\u2019clock in the\nmorning til 10 every single day except Shabbas.",
        "A: My [indecipherable] was two years old, he was left alone in the house \u2014 well, I\nworked downstairs in the same house every time I was able, if \u2014 and the boss was\nnot here, I opened the door and I made sure that he\u2019s all right. He was sitting on the\nbed and watching \u2014 somebody gave me a very old television that you didn\u2019t see\nwhat it is, but that time it was good. He was two years old. And until he was five\nMay 5, 2013\nwhere he started kindergarten. And then, of course yeshivas. They finished, both of\nthem in grade school yeshiva, high school yeshiva. And then they went to\nBrooklyn College, and then my oldest son decided to be a doctor, after he finished\ncollege.",
        "A: He went to Downstate Medical School \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 for many years, and then became a doctor. Of course, I worked. I started in\n1965 in the bank, and I worked til I was 73 years old, like for 38 years.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: A very hard life.",
        "A: Finally I retired. Husband passed away, he was [indecipherable]. He was sick\nfor five years. And my youngest son also wanted to go to medical school, so I\nworked, worked, worked, and this was it; now I\u2019m retired.",
        "A: Now [have time to go to doctors. Yeah, every time to another doctor. But thank\nGod, I still could walk around a little bit [indecipherable]. I had \u2014 I have some\nhelp from the Holocaust twice a week.",

And the children grew up,\nthey\u2019re no more small. I mean, the grandchildren. And one lives here, not far, and\none lives on Staten Island. I don\u2019t see them much. On the [indecipherable] we get\ntogether and go to one or to the second one. But the life was hard in America.",
        "A: It was very hard.",
        "A: Without \u2014",
        "A: Without the language and without money and without where to live, without\nhelp, and not \u2014 not having any money with you.\nMay 5, 2013",

        "A: As a matter of fact, when he was in Austria after the war, he was in a\nsanitorium all the time.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "A: Which was full those type of people, but I \u2014 I never saw them.",
        "A: Because I wasn\u2019t there. So I wouldn\u2019t say I \u2014 I abandoned my mother or\nanything, I was seeing my mother very often, as often as my \u2014 as the minute came I\nwas able to bring her here, and I had some money saved, I brought her here to this\ncountry, but she didn\u2019t like it here, because my brothers were there, they had\nalready families.",
        "A: And \u2014 and she was used to it already.",
        "A: So, and we were never home; I went to work, my husband went to work, the\nkids were in school. She was left alone in the house. So she was very lonely.",

They \u2014 all the women used to go out and talk to each other from\nhome, from the kids, from the grandkids. And here she didn\u2019t have no one to talk.\nSo after one year, she left \u2014 I mean, she went home.",
        "A: Hm?\nMay 5, 2013",
        "A: All right. No problem.",
        "A: Close to 10.",
        "A: 16, yeah.",
        "A: I grew up too fast. I didn\u2019t have teenage years, so I didn\u2019t know what it means to\nbe young, because between 39 and \u201945, it was like a period you didn\u2019t know where\nit went. Was very hard times, especially the winter times. When you were healthy,\nthen it was like you appreciated that because you were healthy. In the teenage\nyears, when you were the teenage years, you always had to do something to help\nthe family, you know. So I learned in France how to sew, when I got married. We\ndidn\u2019t have anything, I just went to work right away. I was sewing clothes. We had\nthe little factory in the camp. And then, because I knew a little Hebrew, and I was a\nlittle bit educated, I was working in the kindergarten with kids, and for a while,\nuntil we emigrated to America.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: You mean the experience we went through?",
        "A: Not so much.",
        "A: Not \u2014 not so much because they consider us being the lucky ones, the Holocaust\nsurvivors, which were \u2014 which officially, no matter how much we went through,\nwe were the lucky ones, we weren\u2019t shot to death.",
        "A: You know, if we didn\u2019t accomplish anything over there, but many people,\nmany, many people that died from hunger.",
        "A: And this was like \u2014 just like in the concentrations, not being shot, but dying\nfrom hunger.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "A: I know my mother\u2019s brother and his wife, they died in [indecipherable] on the\nstreet from hunger. And they were rich people at home, rich. I wouldn\u2019t say like\nhere somebody rich, but in our standards, in my home, this was a rich family. And\nthey died from hunger. There was nothing they could buy, even they had some\nmoney.",
        "A: So, I saw a lot of dead people in the camps.",
        "A: Not being shot, but being able to work and not having what to eat.",
        "A: So they just gave up and died. But we were the lucky ones \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because we didn\u2019t \u2014 my \u2014 my mother didn\u2019t go to work with the big s \u2014 you\nknow, with the [indecipherable] on her back. The commanders there made them\nwork very hard.",
        "A: And that was \u2014 and it was 60 below zero, you know what that is?\nMay 5, 2013",
        "A: The snow was that high, and you walked just \u2014 you made like a \u2014 how do you\ncall a shareskai(ph) like?",
        "A: Like a little bit walk through, and both sides the snow was higher than you. And\nthat\u2019s how we lived. No transportation, no nothing. You walked to school like this.\nThere were no days off because there was a snow, there was no such a thing. You\nhad to be in school.",
        "A: This was already where you were freed from the steppes \u2014 from the steppes,\nfrom Ural.",
        "A: And the worst thing was, when you became older, after 13, you had to join the\nKomsomol. You know what the Komsomol is?",
        "A: Komsomol is the youth communist party.",
        "A: And whenever \u2014 me and my cousin were in the same class, and they were after\nus to join, and my father said no, no, no. And I couldn\u2019t say my father said no,\nbecause they would put him to jail. So, we were trying to avoid it, not to be forced\nMay 5, 2013\ninto it. So they \u2014 in the summer they send us to a camp where we could help, you\nknow, with the harvest or whatever, to work there, or do something. That\u2019s how the\nfew years went back, and by the time they made me already join, we were free to\ngo home.",

        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Not much, because they saw we don\u2019t want to talk, so they didn\u2019t.

He went at night with all the\nwolves and everything, and \u2014 and he found her and he put her on a sled and he\nbrought her home. She hardly was alive, you know. She was so frightened and\nafraid. And you know, stories like this, but not like what happened after, or before,\nyou know? And they were like \u2014 especially [indecipherable] was like every time\nuntil they grew up, zayde, tell me a massen(ph), tell me a massen(ph). He was\nfascinated with those stories. And that\u2019s why he went after me two years ago,\nBubbe, why don\u2019t you want to \u2014 it\u2019s good for us, we\u2019ll know what happened, you\nMay 5, 2013\nknow? My other grandson called me up, Bubbe, it\u2019s going to be for \u2014 not only for\nthe first generation, it\u2019s going to be for the second generation, for our kids. At least\nthey\u2019ll know where you\u2019re coming from. I said okay. I never talked so much in my\nlife.",

I mean, they \u2014 and I dealt with a lot of people during the day in the bank,\na lot. And I heard so much horrific stories how children are treating them, you\nknow. And they were all rich people having business and jewelry and the children\nwant them already to take a day of it, and I \u2014 and I had to listen to it, you know,\ncause I was a banker. So like I came home, I was like stim(ph), you know what\nstim(ph) is? Quiet.",
        "A: I did my work what I had to do home, I cooked, I [indecipherable] made sure\nthey have what to eat and make sandwiches for the next day to go to school, and I\nwent to work. My children worked very hard because they went to school from\nMay 5, 2013\nseven to seven. They came home very late. They never had time to flounce around\noutside and play with the [indecipherable] with the other boys. They were \u2014 on the\nShabbas they went to shul, and Sunday they had school too, a half a day.",
        "A: So they were like more restricted than other kids, you know. But thank God, I\ncan\u2019t complain. I made sure I would never need for my kids anything. I saved\nwhatever I could, we bought the house. Which I don\u2019t need it now because it\u2019s a \u2014\nnow I have three tenants in the house.\nEnd of File One\nMay 5, 2013\nBeginning File Two",

        "A: I was able \u2014 I saved and I saved and I saved and sometimes now, why did I do\nit?",
        "A: It took away too much strength to do it. So, you know, parents from Europe,\nthey always \u2014 even when my parents were not rich, middle class working people,\nthey wanted their children to have the best they could give them. And of course, us,\neven we didn\u2019t have anything. Of course, and the war took away so much. We\nwanted our children to be something. So you worked. If you didn\u2019t work, you\ndidn\u2019t have money to pay the schools, because they always went to private schools,\nyeshivas. So we worked and we saved and you worked and you paid, and whatever\nyou could, you put away for a birthday, or whatever \u2014 whatever\u2019s gonna come. But\nthank God.\nMay 5, 2013",
        "A: Well, mostly people who I knew and know, they went through the same thing\nwhat I did. Most of my friends, younger, older, they passed away. I have two more\nfriends, which one is still very, very sharp. She went through a concentration camp\nand everything. But she doesn\u2019t want to do an interview because she says she\u2019s\ngonna sit and cry a whole day. I spoke to her another day, and another friend is\ngetting a little bit of Al-Alzheimer\u2019s, so \u2014 and that\u2019s what\u2019s left, you know.",

        "A: I would like to add that I was lucky with jobs. Wherever I worked, especially in\nthe bank for so many years, and 10 years in the bakery, I was well liked because I\nworked, I produced. And I wanted to better myself, so I went for courses, I took all\nkinds of courses, you know; in the bank, they send you. And \u2014 and I retired, they\ngave me a beautiful bonus.
