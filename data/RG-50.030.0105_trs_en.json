        "Q: Would you tell me your name please?",
        "A: My name is Gerda Klein.",
        "Q: And what was your maiden name?",
        "A: My maiden name was Weissmann so I still carry it as Gerda Weissmann Klein.",
        "Q: Where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born on May 8th, 1924 in the most southern western part of Poland in a town called\nBeilitz in German and Bielsko in Polish. It went by both names and it was in the\nprovince of Salasia (ph) at the foothill of the mountain range.",
        "Q: Would you tell me about your parents and about your family as a young girl, as a child?",
        "A: Well, in in retrospect, my parents seem absolutely saintly and everything seems just\nmarvelous. I know it couldn't possibly be that way. I know it must have rained at times\nbut my my memory 1s uh is very vivid and I I cherish it very much and I don't see why I\nshould change this perfection which I remember. Uh, I had one older brother. He was\nfive years older than I. His name was Arthur. My parents name were Julius, Julius and\nHelena Weissman. Uh we lived in in in an old large home on outside of town with a hugh\ngarden with many fruit trees and flowers, a wonderful thing for children to roam in. I had\nten cats, all black. I knew all their names and uh now, you know, my children know, my\ngrandchildren are used to me to recite the names of my cats. My brother had two dogs.\nUh I used to love swimming in summer and skiing in winter and uh by and large I I had a\nmarvelous childhood.",
        "Q: What about school?",
        "A: Uh I went to public school first and then but only until the war broke out to Catholic\nschool called Notre Dame. It was a private girls school. However we had the rabbi\ncoming giving us Jewish instructions, so it was about uh I would say a quarter of of the\ngirls in school, in my class, were Jewish. And that was the natural thing to do. I uh I\nreally liked school very much even though I pretended I didn't. Uh and of course, you\nknow, when the war came that was the end of my formal education.",
        "Q: Tell us what happened when the war broke out?",
        "A: Well, I guess the danger signals were flying very high in uh in the summer of 1939. Uh\nby and large I must say it was ignored by my family. Uh I was away with my mother in a\nplace called Krinitza (ph). Uh I even remember my my very first uh incident which\ninspired a great deal of fear. My mother and I went to a concert and I remember the\nsetting quite vividly. Uh there were flowers around. I'm not very musical but uh that\nsummer something caught on that day and I remember uh the crowd of people sitting\nthere and and flowers and it was very warm, uh a day of...you know, one of the golden\ndays of of summer, as I see it now, and suddenly a young man came running up to the\npodium and he pushed the conductor aside and he said, how can you all sit here listening\nto music when danger is coming from there, and he pointed to to the \u2014_ which separated\nus from Czechoslovakia which already had been occupied by the Nazis and and he said\nmonsters are coming from there. Why don't you go home and take up arms and join...I\nremember moving closer to my mother and and saying shouldn't we go home and uh but\npretty soon police came and uh arrested the man because he was an agitator for\ndisturbing the peace. I I I still remember that that sudden fear. That that really was my my\nfirst memory of uh of something impending but we stayed perhaps another week. I don't\nremember exactly how long. However, on our way home we saw at stations an awful lot\nof baggage which was labeled Warsaw. Apparently people were going to Warsaw and\nwhen we came home uh my father had his arm in a sling and my mother naturally was\nterribly concerned and uh apparently he had suffered a slight heart attack and uh\nunfortunately and since things were moving very fast, uh that must have been perhaps the\nthird week in August...that we received a telegram from my uncle in Turkey. My mother\nhad a brother...my mother only had one brother and he lived in Turkey and uh he sent us\na telegram saying that we should get out, that we had visas which were in the Embassy in\nWarsaw, but my mother said uh we're not going to tell Poppa about the telegram. Poppa\nis ill (ph) and he should not be disturbed. And I guess that __ my family, and I only\nhope and pray that my mother really didn't fully realize that.",
        "Q: Tell us just what happened next. What did you do once you realized...",
        "A: Well, uh it was Friday morning. I I I remember it very well. I was fifteen you see. It was\nFriday morning when we heard a lot of planes and people ran into the streets and uh and\nthere were German planes and we ran out and saw planes with the swastika flying over. It\nwas terribly exciting and and a lot of activities started then. They were building trenches\nand uh and you know, uh my mother tried to keep sort of the windows down, were closed\nso from my father's bedroom...my father was in bed. My father was quite ill and that\nnight uh there were lots of of refugees on the streets. You know, people running away\nand and there was was shooting. I remember one one man was carrying a goat on his\nback. Apparently it was his only possession, a small goat and people with wheelbarrows\nand carts and everything and my brother had a girlfriend and apparently her uh family\ncalled and said that they are going to flee into the interior of Poland and suggested that\nthey would take my brother and me along and my father insisted that should be my\nbrother's decision. I was, you know, considered too young to make a decision. My\nbrother was nineteen at the time and my brother said no, we we're not going to go. We\nwill stay together. You you'll need us. My father was ill, and and that was a terrible shock\nbecause, you know, my father to me was sort of the center of my universe. I mean, you\nknow, when Poppa decreed something, he would do anything and that he should\nsuddenly ask us, particularly my brother, to make a decision...such a momentous\ndecision. I remember it was a terrible shock and uh it was very turbulent night and when\nit ceased in the morning and my father said to me that I I should go and apparently he\nwanted to talk to my mother and my brother that I should not be around and he said that I\nshould call the family to see what everyone is doing, my father's brothers and there were\nuncles and aunts and so on, and I went downstairs and uh the ring of the telephone...there\nwas no answer. No one answered anywhere and uh you know, I remember suddenly it\nwas like like you were left in a world of the dead, you know, all those homes that I\nremembered and the phones were ringing and ringing and there was no answer\nwhatsoever and uh when I came up my father said no one answers today, and I said no.\nAnd it was a wonderful Saturday. Everything was cut off. There was...we had no\nelectricity, no light and it was a beautiful, calm September day, flowers outside and my\nparents were sort of joking. My father got dressed and came downstairs and we were all\nsitting together and it was really the the last beautiful day. And then in the evening they\nstart with some shelling and my brother went out to let his dog in and when he came back\nhe he had a hole in his trousers and he said they were shooting from the rooftops. The\nGermans were coming but we went to the basement with some other people, you know,\nand it was morning. Then I I don't remember those hours too well, but what I remember\nmost vividly is uh that my mother called, said we should come. She had prepared some\nbreakfast and we came upstairs and we sat down. Suddenly, this tremendous roar, the\nroar of motorcycles and it was the motorcycle with Nazis in it, two...one in the side car\nand on sitting up there, and my brother had just, he had a wristwatch, but he had just\ntaken it out of his pocket because he carried it in his pocket, and I saw his, you know, his\nhand was down and it was 9:10 in the morning. And I remember everybody just sat there\ntotally stunned and then we heard people uh running. There were more more cars and\nmore motorcycles were coming and and people were shouting, heil Hitler, and we saw\nfrom from the house across the street the black swastika flag and I think that was the\nmost enormous shock, that people were prepared, was our neighbors, you know, our\nfriends, and they knew it in the very first hour and uh to me, and of course, you know,\nyou can only see it in in retrospect and of course I lived it many times, but one of the\nthings uh it sort of changed suddenly. I remember uh the coal fell out from the cradle of\nthe fireplace and uh it went on the carpet and the carpet was sort of smoldering and and\nno one paid any attention to it and I remember it had once happened before...how upset\nmy mother was and no one paid any attention. These were just tiny little vignettes which\nsuddenly sort of you know changed everything. And uh shortly thereafter perhaps...you\nknow, then more and more trucks of soldiers were coming and and the voices grew more\nhoarse, people shouting heil Hitler and II saw a childhood friend of mine carrying white\nroses to to the soldiers and somebody was giving the soldiers schnapps and flowers for\nand the whole sort of thing and I I remember starting to cry and my brother\ndragged me on the carpet and he said, keep quiet, you know, you you can't do that, and he\ntook me up to bed and he said, you know, don't make a sound and it was in the after...it\nwas in the morning...I mean, you know, uh the whole day was sort of uh melange (ph) of\nmany many feelings which I try to remember over the years, but one of of the worst\nthings happened that afternoon. Uh the mother of the childhood friend of mine...she\nblessedly is alive and she lives in Israel...her name is Esther Bergman (ph). Her mother\ncame and she asked where my father was and she said uh...but she knew that he was ill\nbut she said,also to my brother that no man should go on the streets because they had\nrounded up all the men that they could find and they locked them in the temple and they\nset the temple aflame and then she sort of went out by the back door. And I think that was\ntruly the first impact what happened.",
        "Q: What happened over the next few days? How did uh things ?",
        "A: I couldn't you tell you day by day, you know. Uh people came. Our our neighbors came,\nour non-Jewish neighbors came...oh, one thing, yes...uh a neighbor who, you\nknow...she...the home in which we lived in not only was I and my brother born there but\nmy mother had been born there. It was a family home, you know, and our grandmother\nhad lived with us. Fortunately, blessedly for her, she died the year before the war broke\nout. She, you know, never faced that. Uh a woman came and she asked where our flag\nwas, the Polish flag, you know, which used to be red and white, and uh my mother said\nwhy, and she said we have to make a German flag out of 1t and my mother pretended to\nlook for it in all places where she knew she wouldn't find it, you know, and then uh the\nwoman left and she said she would be back later. Maybe my father can help look for it,\nand I think that became very clear that we better produce it because she really wanted it\nfor our protection and she said all you have to do is, you know, keep the the red flag and\ncut a round circle from the white, put a black swastika on it and she came to collect it.\nShe did it and then she said she wanted to look where Arthur was because he is very\nstrong. He should hang it up and he apparently could not be found to do it, so the woman\nstruggled to hang the flag up and she sort of said to my mother, you know, if uh if the\nflag is not displayed from here, it would be pretty obvious who you are. And uh I\nremember we couldn't look out of the window to see to see that flying. We had some\nother people you know living in in our home as well who uh who were not Jewish and\nsome were sympathizers and of course they wanted that, because you know, this was the\npart which was German speaking. Bielitz before the war was Austria and later on it was\nalso one of the first things that became uh it was they called it , you know,\n, uh where so we were unfortunately not too far from from Auschwitz, which was\n_____, and that became the perfect which was allegedly self-ruled. Of course it\nwasn't, you know, but we immediately became uh under the symbols as as Germany. So\nuh the people who...I suppose most people were German-speaking people, you see, and\npeople were shouting uh heil Hitler. Thank you for the liberation, and things like that\nbecause they thought that you're not an Austrian Empire was coming back with, you\nknow, Franz Joseph and the beautiful Empress Elizabeth and so on, you know, was the\npart had been under Poland for only twenty years, so uh uh I think there was a lot of\nmis...perhaps misguided feeling on behalf of the people, maybe not so much pro-Nazi at\nthat particular point, but of course all that changed.",
        "Q: Over the next few months, what happened to you and your family and how did things\nchange?",
        "A: What I can unfortunately tell you...uh fairly soon an order came that all young men\nbetween I think sixteen and fifty had to register. My father at that point was about fifty\nand since he was ill he did not have to register for a transport. My brother was nineteen\nand, of course, everyday you know, that we knew that England and France declared war,\nyou know, that we knew right away. That happened Sunday. You know, we were\noccupied Sunday morning. Sunday afternoon uh England and and France declared war on\nGermany. Uh then you know, most of the family had fled, our family; however, my\nfather's sister who had uh been separated from her husband and daughter in one of the\ntrains which which were bombed, came back with her son David and she found her\napartment occupied by uh by other people, and she came to stay with us. David was\nabout my brother's age, and David and also my brother went to register to whatever they\nwere going to do and they said that they they would be in uh in some sort of labor\nbattalion to uh build up what was uh destroyed by the war. The date was the 19th of\nOctober on which my brother left. Anyway...I tell you one thing...my my mother refused\nto make his bed for for months. She wanted to keep the imprint of his head on the pillow.\n(Pause) All things got worse from day to day, you know. We didn't hear from my brother\nfor a long, long long time and when we finally did, which I believe was months later, he\nwas uh blessedly in the Russian occupied zone. He was in . And what apparently\nhappened was that uh they were brought into the interior of Poland uh nearthe __.....]\ndon't know exactly what location...pursued by bullets. Those who were good swimmers\nswam across. He was a very good swimmer and he was in in , which was uh\noccupied by the Russians and he worked there. Uh my brother was was trained in\nchemistry uh and he worked in some sort of a factory making germ (ph) or whatever. Uh\nthat was one of the greatest, marvelous moments in the bleakness of our existence to to\nhear that Arthur was alive. Uh I cannot...I really...1 mean I was sort of refreshing my\nmemory and looking at some of the things which I had written after the war which I have\nthe most clear knowledge as far as dates are concerned but I know that uh it probably was\na few months later that we were to move into the basement of our home. It was very wet\nthere and there was no electricity there and uh my father's uh condition deteriorated quite\na bit. He suddenly looked very old. Uh my mother uh who up to that point you see,\nbecause my grand...we had lived with my grandmother and so I was rather pampered and\nyou know, uh given to be very easily discouraged and upset about uh little things like uh\nyou know, table clothes didn't iron properly, or the lace was wrong or something...uh\nshowed incredible strength and fortitude. As a matter of fact she was the one who did not\ncry when my brother left. And my father wept. The first time I saw my father crying. It\nwas sort of reversal of of roles you see and I think to to me a very devastating thing to see\nmy father helpless and and I never saw my father helpless before and uh so we lived in\nthe basement. Uh I learned new skills. I saw my mother uh bringing an old...it was called\npetroleum lampiere (ph), you know...uh lamp....I learned to clean the chimney of the\nlamp and if we got some guests to to make illumination like that, because we had no\nlight. Uh pretty soon of course, you know, uh we exhausted our funds because we we had\nno no money. You know, everything was frozen. My father didn't earn anything and all\nthose things were very hard to come by but where we lived, you know, there there were\nvegetables and things were obtainable and our our neighbors... hada _\u2014_\u2014_\u2014\u00ab, you know, a\nnanny, who was wonderful to us and she lived diagonally across the street and she would\ngo and get vegetables and bring things to us but uh my mother was always a wonderful\nneedlewoman. She could do wonderful things with her hands, so we sort of through\nthat we would be knitting and I learned to...I learned to knit before the war but I wasn't\nparticularly interested in that, you know. I was more of a tomboy running around with\ncats and climbing trees and and I settled down and we would start knitting sweaters for\npeople. My mother really had a wonderful reputation. You know, she would embroider\nthings on sweaters. She did some marvelous things and uh we would be able to get\ncandles. We had quite a store of candles because uh we couldn't use the lamp too often\nbecause petroleum was available, you know, on only limited things and our ration\ncard...we got ration card, you know, with the name Jew and and there was very little to\neat and uh so uh my mother and I would would knit for as long as daylight would allow\nand my father would sit and read to us. And really this is how uh my father was\nwonderful..you see, I went to Polish schools. Even so, my first language was\nGerman...spoke German at home and when I would come home from school I would\nswitch to German, but I couldn't read or write German, you know. I spoke it naturally. It\nwas my first language. So my father unearthed my mother's books and he started teaching\nme to read and write German, and then my father would read to us, you know, and and\nwe would let the candle go down. Then we would take take some wax and my mother\nmade uh little wicks and we would put the candle on again and we would uh we would\nknit. We got...I remember it very clearly...for knitting a sweater, uh intricate sweater.\nYou know, at first I would just knit the sleeves and things and my mother would do the\nintricate work. We would get uh thirty . Well, it was thirty if you could\nbuy food on ration it was fine, but we had to start buying food on the black market, so I\nwould say uh roughly a loaf of bread would cost thirty marks so for knitting a sweater we\nwould able to buy roughly a loaf of bread. And this is how things went. And then started\nthe things of the , you know. It was uh to be sent away and every so often a\nlittle cart would come announcing that...as a matter of fact the first one came uh when we\nhad not heard from Arthur, and I remember at that point my my mother sort of must have\nsuffered a nervous breakdown, at least a momentary lapse because I remember she was\nshe was totally out of things. She was calling for Arthur. She was in bed. And my father\nwas up with her and my father told me to go and to pack. We we were supposed to leave\nwith twenty pounds of our belongings. And uh my father bought for us sort of _ little\nsuitcases and he told me to to pack some things and and word got around to uh in the\ncommunity that we were selling things. Everybody...I mean all the Jews..that was the\nway to do it, and people started to come. My father said whatever anybody gives you,\ntake it, and he stayed with my mother, and then uh word got around that if...I don't\nremember the exact amount...let's say uh kilo gold...something like that...1t might have\nbeen less, it might been more. I don't remember. If that would be given and then that\nwould stay , So you know, everybody scurried to get whatever jewelry people had\nto bring it...of course that was another...was what the Germans did in order to to get the\nvaluables which people were holding and . And apparently they got what uh\nwhatever was needed for for that purpose because uh then a note came to say we could\nstay. You know, , and that would happen roughly every six, seven months, and\nagain I I don't know exactly that, but uh but is after we got, you know, my mother\nseemed to bounce back and became her her strong self and and from that time on I would\nsay until the very end, my mother was absolutely a tower of strength. You know, looking\nback now, my mother was a very young woman at that time. She was she was forty-one\nwhen the war broke out. Of course to me she was an old woman, you know, to a fifteen\nyear old girl, you know. My father was ten years older than my mother. So the existence,\nyou know, and worse and thisis show we survived. This was three years...1939\nthrough the spring of 1942. The very very spring...it could have been March perhaps\nwhen the order came that we had to move to the Jewish ghetto which was the shabby,\nremote part of our town, quite far away from where we had lived, because it was actually\nin you see. Uh Bielitz- it's called now, two , twin cities and that\nwe lived in Bielitz and that was and way out. ___, near a very old cemetery\nwhere we had to to move. And uh as I told you, my my garden hold held most of my\nwonderful childhood memories and uh fairly soon...I would say probably in early 1940,\nuh there was a sign on it that no Jews or dogs were permitted in the garden, so we\nnaturally did not go but on the morning on which we were forced to leave our home, I\njumped over the fence and went to the garden and I ran around. Uh I remember there\nwere the first violets where we had a little brook... , the first violets were there,\nwhich I had picked and I remember sort of planting a branch of a tree where I used to sit\nand pretending what it would be like if if nothing had happened you know and I would go\nin and my parents would be at breakfast and my brother would be going to school, and so\non, and uh you know, even so uh I always firmly believed that I'll go back home. That\nbecame the crutch through all the years. Looking back now I realize that I must have had\na premonition because I remember in that I sort of really started imagining what\nmy garden would look in all seasons, and I knew that I would not see it. But I don't know\nany longer if I thought that I'll never see it for a period of time or if there would be\nfinality in it. I I really don't know. But, you know, you sort of take memories out like uh\nlike cameos and hold them and look at them. And that was it.",
        "Q: Tell us about going into the ghetto.",
        "A: Well, strange as it may seem, I guess I really was happier in the ghetto than at home\nbecause I had friends there, you know. At home I was uh...well, that isn't quite true. My\nmy father, you know, there were several girls, particularly the one who became\ntremendously close to me, my friend Elsa (ph). There was Esther Bergman who lived not\ntoo far away and she used to come, but my father would teach us and that was still at\nhome. You know, he would take books out and teach us a bit of history and all those\nthings that he knew. He was very knowledgeable so, you know, in a very fragmented\nway, but I think uh in those first three years, almost three years at home, it was my\nfather...I I think I I acquired quite a bit of knowledge. He taught me all...my father my\nfather was supposed to be a rabbi and because you know he came from...you see my\nmother was born in Beilitz which was uh very Austrian and they prided themselves, you\nknow. My...as a matter of fact my my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, uh still\ncelebrated Kaiser Franz Joseph, that's the Austrian Kaiser, uh birthday which is on the\n18th of August which I still remember, you know and because uh and I think they all\ntalked about the good old days, you know, the wars and you know, everybody has to\nthink the good old days, but my father's family uh came from a place called and\n_____ was the seat of the which was he was very well know. As a matter of\nfact even now I read quite a bit...his name was Freidman (ph) and my father's family was\nrelated to him and I have some wonderful childhood memories as a child going to .\nUh should I have continued with with what I talked before...do you wish me to...",
        "Q: Let's let's...yeah...let's do this. Break it and then come...you're going into the ghetto. You\nstarted talking about...",
        "A: Alright. But uh I don't remember why I wanted to to tell this particular story. In any\nevent, uh my friends, you know, there was a number of girls and they...we all lived in\nproximity, you know. In the ghetto there was one large building and a number of my\nfriends lived there, so it uh it really was in a way a bit nicer for me where, you know,\nbecause there was a very uh sharp cur...curfew that I could never see my friends like in\nthe evenings or after five o'clock or what have you. Living in the same building was sort\nof...1t was nice to see my friends, you know. And there was also some babies there, and I\nliked babies and I could go and play with the two babies, so for me in a way it was a bit\neasier. It wasn't for very long. As a matter of fact, looking back I realize how little time\nthere was because uh very soon an order came that we had to go and work in uh ina\nshop, sort of factory thing sewing garments in a place called . Uh so my mother\nand I had to go . We went under guard to to a train. The train station was not\ntoo far away and uh we worked sewing garments there and and then my father had to go\nto fortify the river in Suka (ph) and that was very hard because my father could really not\nbend his his arm very well but he said...but he started looking a little better. You see that\nhe was very pale because being home uh for so long so actively being out in the fresh\nair...1t was deceiving but seemed to me that Poppa looked better. It was a very short time,\nreally. Uh come to think of it, it probably was not more than than two months. And then I\nremember my uh in May eighteenth birthday. I was fifteen when the war broke out and I\nwas three years...my eighteenth birthday. My mother decided that I'm going to have a\nparty and uh I just had a wonderful thing. I just had a big birthday, my sixty-fifth, and a\nfriend of mine who now lives in Detroit met my uh____ children give me a party. She\ncame to the party and she was in in Arizona now, and she was at that birthday party. The\nbirthday party was rather grand because my mother had some oatmeal and she had made\nsome wonderful cookies which we all swarmed. They were absolutely like uh tasted like\nuh nuts and I had a birthday party, which was crowned by an incredible thing. I got an\norange. I always loved oranges. Only later did I find out that my mother had gone out of\nthe ghetto, sold a diamond and pearl ring to get me an orange. That was the last birthday\ngift from my parents. (Pause) Uh a couple of my friends were there. One lives in New\nYork and uh she reminded me of something not too terribly long ago because uh the\norders came on the 28th of June...all the men had had to leave on a Sunday...my father\namongst them. (Pause) We went to the station. My father stood in the...it was just\ndreadful. He wore the yellow star. (Pause)\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: OK. You had just finished. We're back on camera, and you had just finished telling me\nabout the orange your mother gave you for your eighteenth...",
        "A: Right. And then the order that my father's leaving. There is however one thing that I\nwould like to mention as a tribute to my parents. Uh the last night before my father\nleft...of course we all lived in one large room at that point...I heard my parents talking. I\ndon't know if it was for them or for my benefit. They did not mention at all the parting in\nthe morning, but they spoke about their years together. They were, you know, about\nabout the happiness they had shared, about uh my brother's birth and mine, about the\nhopes they had for us, and I think in in death they have instilled something in me which\nwhich has been my legacy all this...uh the value of of the love, of the commitment, of the\nof the family, and uh you know, when the going goes rough as it was in in\nsubsequent times, it uh it was a very comforting thing and I shall always be grateful for\nthat. I mentioned seeing my father for the last time and after that, my friend who\nlives in New York now, uh and I went...we knew...see, they were taking all the men on\nSunday and uh took place on Monday morning. Uh we decided, uh and I,\nthat we should, we we knew what's going to happen to to all the books, probably prayer\nbooks and most of the books which were in Jewish families that were treasured and uh\nafter my father was taken away, we went and collected all the books. I was afraid that the\nGermans are going to use it for unspeakable purposes and we dragged it to the Jewish\ncemetery which was really the ghetto, and uh we buried them there. And I'm\nsorry for not understanding my mother's grief completely at that time. You know, I was\nreally terribly close to my father and that I didn't comfort my mother. Today I think I sort\nof needed to be alone, to lick my own wounds, so to speak. Uh there's just one more thing\nthat I want to mention. Before my father left, he asked me (pause)...",
        "Q: It's OK. TECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: And my father said that uh...I'll always remember that one does not carry one's calling\ncard in one's pocket, engraved upon one's ___...(Pause) (Crying)\n(Pause)...anyway I'm sure that many people have given you descriptions of of the leaving\none uh of leaving and I guess our's was not too much different. Except that my mother\ndecided to fast on that day. It was a Monday, and my mother fasted every Monday since\nmy brother had left, and uh she had a bit of precious cocoa she had hoarded throughout\nthe entire war for a special celebration and she made some cocoa for me that morning. I\nmust say it did not taste very sweet. We were marched through the town under the whips\nof the SS uh to a certain collection...I had it happen to me many times during the war.\nLater on that one sees sort of in rapid succession the things which you see as a thing\nwhich 1s a hoax (ph), like uh they were putting a new name of a movie on the marquee,\nuh watching by a shop which sold fabrics and uh remembering the type of fabric that my\nmother bought for a summer dress, but it wasn't colorfast. You know, it was such a...and\nyet it's very funny. I remember it in . [remember them now you know. Uh seeing\nsome neighbor peering from behind the curtain, because you see we went in from from\nthe ghetto, through through the town again to the other side of the town to which was\ncalled the where we went. Uh I marched with my mother. I saw a man with a\ncane. He asked me how old I was. I said eighteen. He told me to go to the left. We were\nloaded on trucks sometime later and I would like to get this over with as fast as I can,\nOK? And I heard my mother's voice...I did. And she was calling be strong, . And I\nheard that. I was in the truck. I jumped off and I said I want to go to my mother. The little\nman in a raincoat came by. Hisname was ___. He was from . I don't know how\nhe had this enormous strength. He was quite short. it was raining. He was wearing a\nraincoat and a hat. And he took me bodily and he threw me back on the truck and he said\nyou are too young to die. So it was the man who probably sent my mother to her death\ndecided I should not run back to her. We went to a place called . There was a\n_____ lager. It was transient camp and there was the 29th of June, 1942, a Monday. A long\nstory _. I'll just confine it to my own....I had the opportunity of leaving there, cause of\n____, you know, a boy who liked me. His parents tried to get me out of the .",
        "Q: Tell me, tell us a little bit about that...",
        "A: . (Sigh) Anyway, in my naivete (ph) I made a decision that I did not want to go\noutofthe _ to go back to Bielitz. There was...there were two camps in Beilitz and uh\nI mean again there's a story about a young man there who apparently liked me very much.\nHis name was . He was a very fine artist and uh his family suggested he __\nwith his family that you see you could get out of the \u2014 if you uh had a place of work,\nif you had some working permit and uh that you can put, get out to...and uh he had two\nsisters and they had two sewing machines and they were willing to put one in a shop to\nsecure a place for me, which was an incredible sacrifice. Uh however I knew that if I did\nthat I would probably have to marry __. I made the decision not to go. Uh maybe this\nis a good story to tell because I that I uh I wanted to stay with my friends even\nthough I knew I was going to camp. By strange, almost incredible coincidence, the man\ninthe ||| whocame and told me that I was able to go out...his name 1s Jacob Chancer\n(ph). He now lives in Buffalo, New York, where of course I lived for many years. That\ndecision proved to be a decision which saved my life because unfortunately the Briggs\n(ph) family, all of them, were deported and killed about two months later. And you see uh\nBeilitz, my home town, was renown for its textiles. Uh it was called of central\nEurope. And uh in the they registered your name, your age, and the place you hail\nfrom (ph), and industrialists from all over Germany would come to buy slaves. A man by\nthe name of Keller (ph)...I think it's good to use the names...his name was Director Keller\nfrom a firm called . had several uh spinning uh weaving and uh\ntextile-oriented and associated firms and they needed people to work in the factories.\nWhen he came and he saw that x number of girls from Beilitz were there, for some reason\nhe thought we might have more ex in weaving or whatever and anyway they were\nalways looking because you see that still fairly early. That was '42. They needed German\nspeaking people to be trained, so he bought all of us for a place called Bolkenhein (ph)\nwhich was a new weaving camp in . And in fact this is where we went. In all\nfairness I must say that uh that camp was probably better than than most of certainly what\nfollowed because it was new. You see, we were only fifty girls there. And the person who\nbecame our lager fuhrer, at first sight she looked like a bulldog and I thought she's going\nto tear us limb from limb, and she was a very kind person. She was probably chosen for\nher looks but we all who were in captivity under her owe her a debt of gratitude. And I\nthink by her very decency she pinned a lie to the lips of all who said they had no choices.\nI won't say she particularly loved us. She saved my life once for which I'll be eternally\ngrateful and there was uh as far as I know and I do know, that as long as we were there\nand later in a place called Landeshutz (ph) where she also was, nobody was sent to\nAuschwitz from our camp, from those two camps. And uh she showed that people could\nhelp individually and she did. I only met during my entire years under the Nazis, for six\nyears, I only met two who were really kind and I think that they should be singled out for\nthat. Frau...her name was Frau Keegler (ph), with an umlaut, so uh and we first saw her\nand she barked and everything...I thought this is the end of it all. Well we...I was with my\nfriend Yelda (ph) whom I really would like to mention and in the camp there we became\nas close as sisters. Yelda was a childhood friend only in the sense that her mother and my\nmother were friends, you know, but Yelda played the piano beautifully. She was\nexquisitely mannered. My mother always told me how how I should try to be more like\nYelda, you know, and of course I hated to play with her. She seemed to be the paragon of\nall virtue, and uh we became quite close already in the ghetto when we used to go to the\ncemetery...1t was the only place you could go, but uh in the camps, you see she had a\nlittle sister by the name of Kitty and of course Kitty was sent to Auschwitz. My other\nfriend Gretle (ph) had a sister, so the two sisters...you know, everybody sort of had a\nbuddy and Yelda and I became that to each other. She she showed great promises as a\npianist. She was sent to Vienna uh two years before the war to study at the conservatory\nthere and uh a great future was predicted for her. And Yelda sort of became my sister. As\na matter of fact, we looked quite a bit alike and uh so it was and there was something else\nthat uh perhaps would give you sort of an inkling what it was like. On the train to the\ncamp, to Bolkhain, I met a wonderful girl, a vivid redhead, a wonderful, you know, called\nbeautiful people, tall, wonderful girl. Her name was Suzie Kunz (ph). She was born in\nVienna but her mother had died. Uh she was quite young and since she was sent to\nCzechoslovakia to live with her grandparents because you see uh in that particular\ntransport were mostly girls from Beilitz and from Czechoslovakia and you know we were\nall German speaking and this is why we went to that camp. And I was standing next to\nSuzie on on the train. You know, the it's a train sort of uh...there was a certain freedom\nthere you know. We were in...not confined at the \u2014_. We were out of the and\ngoing someplace and uh Suzie said we'll never ever get out of where we are going and I\nsaid yes we will. And I said I'm sure the war will be over in less than a year, and Suzie\nsaid no, we're not going to make it. And I said I'll bet you and she said OK. She said let's\nbet a quart of strawberries and a quart of whipped cream and we shook hands on that.\nAnd Suzie died on liberation morning. I found her dead. I don't know if she knew or if\nshe didn't...she won that bet. Anyway we came to Bolkenheim. Bolkenheim...you know\nuh it's a terrible thing to say but but I think because we are recording that sort of thing\nshould be said...actually for me it it was easier then. Easier in terms that I didn't see my\nparents suffer. You know, I could sort of put things over there but I uh I was convinced\nthat my parents will survive, that they are someplace which they are probably working. I\npushed all thoughts aside and I was in a way liberated in fact but you know I wasn't\nworried that each of my action might spell danger to my parents. And you know, I know\nif somebody's going to beat me, they aren't going to see it. All the indignities that one has\nsuffered and you know and vice versa, you know. But of course when you're eighteen\nyears old you know, you have the ___ that you don't...anyway uh Bolkenheim was\nrough in terms until we mastered what was expected of us. There was somebody there by\nthe name of Meister Zimmer (ph). He was dreadful. And uh I used to amuse myself when\nhe told us all things, you know, that uh that we are going to be taught decency and all the\nthings, you know, uh that I think that that we knew so well which obviously were were\ndesigned to break our resistance, you know, and said if we behave ourselves and do these\nthings we can live there all our lives you know, and I used to sort of speculate what he\nwould look like when he was dead and things like that, you know. Uh now I...I...you\nknow, fortunately uh you know I I always wrote when I was a little girl and things like\nthat and I I could lift myself from some of the things and do other things in my mind to\nremove that, and I think I did that in the very first weeks when we were there. But you\nknow, he used to sit with, stand with a watch, with a stop watch, and you had to do\nwhich are uh was very intricate uh...what do you call it...1t's funny...I lapse into\nGerman now...uh to tie something, a knot, you know, a weaver's knot to be exact, and\nyou had to do x number a minute and of course you can imagine when you have\nsomebody standing with a stopwatch above you to do that uh your life __ on that. But\nfor some reason most of us were able to do it and those who were not were put in the\nspinner _ or in other things, so nobody was sent to Auschwitz from the original fifty\nthere. And it was by comparison of what came later, relatively easy in as much...I mean\nwe were not that hungry. We we got some food because Mrs. Keegler was decent. Uh we\nuh we worked in the factory long hours and I think that was really the very best thing.\nWe were so exhausted at the end of the day that you had to concentrate so much and to\nwork, you know, that your mind couldn't absorb what...",
        "Q: I think at this point we need to pause. We will change tapes and that will give you a\nchance to.....\nEnd of tape #1\nTape #2\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: OK. We are back on tape.",
        "A: OK.",
        "Q: OK. You were telling me about uh the camp and the weaving...",
        "A: The weaving...(pause)...we were able to write letters and again in that uh Mrs. Keegler\nwas quite generous because I don't remember exactly, you know, what the ratio was, how\noften you were permitted to, but of course you know there were...who could you write to,\nbut I was fortunate that I had my father's address in s+ which way my father was\nallegedly working on the fortification of that river and uh I wrote to my father. Uh I did\nnot hear. Of course I heard from and I wrote to him and he started sending me\nletters as well as packages which again through the type of person that Mrs. Keegler was,\nthose packages did arrive. Uh I wrote to my father and I waited to hear from my father\nand one day a most incredible thing happened. Mrs. Keegler was handing out mail and\nshe called my name and I saw a letter and I jumped to get it, and then I realized it was the\nletter which I had wrote written to my father and on it it said, without forwarding address.\nUh I think that we needn't go into that. No one think that I I lost my my speech for a day\nand a night. I I could not utter a sound. Anyway uh we worked there and uh the thing was\nuh, you see, the type of thing that I I don't know if it really comes across 1s the\ntremendous support system which existed in the camps. The love and the friendship and\nthe sharing and caring and loyalties that people had for each other, the girls had for each\nother. Uh you know that was sort of the balance against the cruelty which we experienced\nand to me I feel that was probably one of the most important things that existed and I\nsomehow wish that would filter down. I usually attempt to tell my children and now my\ngrandchildren because in the very odd spiritual airs of those who did not survive to know\nthat the legacy of the camps is not the legacy of the horror but of the greatness of our\npeople, the very humanity which existed there in the face of such incredible inhumanity.\nUh I particularly want to talk about my friend Yelda (ph) for a moment but that actually\nhappened in in another camp. I I'll give you the quick progression from camp to camp.\nWe were in Waldenheim, if I remember correctly when you know we were working on\nlooms and pretty soon uh the raw materials started to disappear. We we had to uh work\non uh uh paper. There was paper that they were spinning and of course you know in the\nwarm weather it became brittle and it would break and uh in cold weather it would\ndisintegrate because it got soft, and uh was, you know, those things tore the\nthings which what happened to me. Uh for that you could you could be sent to Auschwitz\nbut somehow Mrs. Keegler intervened that people were not, and I remember at one time\nwhich was what I wanted to talk about Frau Keegler. Uh it was shortly after I received\nthe news about my father uh that I became very ill. I don't know exactly what I had but I\nknow that all my fingernails started to have pus in it and I couldn't touch my hands and\nand I was running a very high fever and we had sort of a little...1t was called in\nwhich people were sick for a day or two could stay, and I was there and all of a sudden\nLindsay (ph), you know, I think he has quite a name in the SS, he came on a sudden\ninspection and Frau Keegler charged into the room. I omitted to say my father made me\nwear my skiing boots. When I left home...I last saw my father on the 28th of June and I\nleft home the 29th and I was separated from my mother the following day. Before my\nfather left, he said to me wear you skiing boots. We were all avid skiers, you know. We\nlived in the the ski mountains. A lot of skiing there. And I said why and my father said I\nwant you to wear them and I said Poppa, skiing shoes in June...you know, I ought to wear\na pair of sandals and my father said you have to wear them. You know, you didn't argue\nwith your father in those days. I wore them and I blessed them every single day because I\nwore them for the entire three years that I was in camp and in the in the lining I had\nhidden the pictures which are now in my book. This is where the pictures were. At first I\nwas able to keep them, at the first camp, but later on and on the death march I had\nconcealed them there. So Mrs. Keegler charged in and she dragged me out of of the bunk\nand she said Lindsay is here. It's a matter of life and death. I'll take you to the factory.\nAnd she stooped down and she started to lace my boots and she dragged me to the\nfactory. She used to work in the factory before and I worked on four looms and she set\nthe looms in motion and she said to me, pull yourself together and I remember I still\nheard the beating of the loom, you know, and everything was sort of at different angles\nbecause I was running a very high temperature and he came for inspection. He went\nthrough and if he would have found me there, she could not have saved me and there was\nno question about it, so that was how Keegler...but pretty soon it became obvious that the\nuh that they needed us in another camp and uh our camp was disbanded and we went to\nuh I think three different ones, Matzdorf (ph), . LT really don't remember the third\none. I was sent to Matzdorf. Matzdorf was a horrible, horrible camp. Uh we were locked\non the fifth or sixth floor and uh every morning they would wake us with whips. I worked\nin the flax detail which was a dreadful place. Uh they were doing linens there, and flax\nuh submerged in a swamp. You had to pull it out of the swamp, you know, and uh when\nyou opened the things and retracted the flax. It was terribly hot. It was in summer and the\nmosquitos were all over us when we were working there and then I I was singled out to\ndo something else, namely to unload coal at night. Allegedly I give fresh answer to uh to\none of the supervisors. They are men, and for that I was banished to work the flax during\nthe day and at the coal detail at night. Uh it was an incredible time. Then we...I also to\nload the flax uh into sort of silos which were I mean I think now that they were ten\nstories high. They probably were not. They probably were three or four, but you know\nyou there was no balance because __ those things. I I remember that it was nothing but\ntorture you know. As soon as we went back to camp, I was called to to go and went and\nunload coal and that was ___ the only time. You know my father had asked me earlier...I\nforgot to mention it...during the first when my mother was so ill...J remember\nstanding at the window and we heard that a family had committed suicide together. And I\nremember standing at that window looking out at the garden, my mother being so sick,\nmy father with his hand in in the sling. I hadn't...we hadn't heard from Arthur, you know,\nand I wished that my parents would suggest that. My father and I were both very close\nand he always knew what I was thinking, and I remember he came behind me and he\nsaid, without looking at me, he said, what you are thinking now is cowardly. He said\npromise that you are never going to do that. I didn't answer him and he took his hand and\nhe turned my head towards him and he said I want your promise now. And I promised\nhim. And I remembered it during the working in the coal trucks. There were trains going\nby. I didn't know if they were going to Auschwitz or whatever, and I remember sort of\nthe tracks beckoning in the moonlight and I thought, you know, it would be over very\nquick. One jump and one pain and that's going to be it because it was so dreadful there.\nAnd at one moment I think I really came fairly close. I felt a very strange pain in my\nneck. Anyway, obviously I didn't do it. So...when things were really very very hard in\nMatzdorf we worked in the swamp one days and I think that was really one of my lowest\nhours, when...we had a lager fuhrer in there who was the exact opposite of Mrs. Keegler.\nShe was maybe eighteen years old, sort of an over-blown thing and she was wearing\nrings on every finger and uh and her great joy was to have a little wagon, like a child's\nwagon, and she had us pull her around in that wagon. She was having a whip about it...I\nmean, you can't imagine the calibre of or the intelligence of that person. And all of a\nsudden she came with somebody else, with a man, and they said...they were calling\nnumbers. You see we all had numbers, of course. And they were calling numbers and I\nwas working next to Yelda and heard them call her number, and I sort of looked up. I\nmust have been dazed, and she pointed and the lager fuhrer and said you idiots. Don't you\neven know your own numbers, and Yelda pointed to me and she said that is her number. I\ndidn't understand what she was doing. She obviously wanted to get me out from whatever\nit was, so the lager came and naturally slapped me and she said don't you even know your\nown number, you idiot and so I...and since they called my real number and we didn't\nknow what was happening or maybe Yelda...I'm I'm really not quite sure on that, but\nwhat happened was as we came to the camp, there was Director Keller from\nWaldenheim. Also I have an interesting thing to tell you about him. And Yelda fell to her\nknees and she said my sister, you don't have her number, something like that, and he\nlooked at me and he says I know you. You worked on four looms. You're coming along.\nThey needed more people for uh working on looms in another camp called Landeshutz\n(ph) and this is how I got out of Matzdorf and Yelda was on it too and we got loaded on a\ntruck and we went to Landeshutz which was the other, the sister camp. Yousee _if\nthey had crossbars behind the open Landeshutz to Matzdorf and one more \u2014__ and when\nwe got there, who would be there but Frau Keegler was in charge of that camp, so that\nwas like a homecoming. So this is how...I had one incident with Keller. He called me into\nhis office once and I just remember this most incredible thing. There was that hugh hugh\nroom or at least to me it seemed hugh with a single carpet and a desk on it and he sat\nalone at the desk and what struck me is that probably in a room of that size, fifty of us\nslept. You know, I think that...and he had a letter in his hand and he said to me you have\nsmuggled out a letter fromthe camp __. I said I never smuggled a letter. I said I have\nwritten some letters and and when I glanced over it I saw...I had an uncle in Turkey who\nwas in the textile business because, you know, most people from Beilitz were in the\ntextile, and my unc...and I gathered that he knew my uncle because it was a letter later on\nmy uncle told me he had written to him.",
        "Q: Who had written to who?",
        "A: My uncle had...when he found out in what camp I was, had written to my, to Keller about\nme because he had that thing in his...Keller looked at me and he asked me a number of\nquestions. Interesting thing was that apparently my uncle had sent a package and they\nencouraged me to write for more packages. The packages apparently contained chocolate\nand things which were not obtainable, which I never saw. They said the package must\nhave been ripped up but it looked in a very sturdy wooden box but I was only too happy\nto write to my uncle that I received the packages I was told in very good order because\napparently they wanted those things but this way I knew that my uncle was...I mean I\nknew my uncle was safe. He was in Turkey but that he knew where I was. Anyway\ngetting back to the thing...of course we came to Landeshutz which like heaven by\ncomparison with Matzdorf. Uh only in Landeshutz we then faced an...another difficulty.\nAnd that difficulty was that we worked the night shift only. So you know, we didn't see\nany light of day except, you know, uh if you got up during the day you you could and we\nworked there from probably a year or maybe even longer, on the night shift, but you\nknow Frau Keegler was there. Things got worse there because there was very little food\nbut uh she she went on in the same vein that she was before, you know.",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit more about Landeshutz and Frau Keegler...",
        "A: Uh for instance, you know, if somebody was ill, if somebody got ill, you know, there\nwere not the things which happened in other camps, sent to Auschwitz or beatings or\nthings like that. Uh you got some sort of care or understanding or it was...things were\ncovered for you a bit, you know, as far as work was concerned. Uh she tried to to get\nvegetables. I don't know what rations there were, you know, but it it whatever was so-\ncalled coming to us and believe me things were uh laughable but we got it. Uh I\nremember when this one thing that I always tell young people. Uh you know they knew\nof the Jewish holidays and there was one Yom Kippur when they marched us out and told\nus about the holidays and told uh that if anybody would be foolish enough to fast that that\nwould be construed as sabotage and sabotage was punishable by death, and everybody\nfasted and uh we were given noodles and sugar and nobody touched it and I think you\nknow those are the things that I think future generations should know and to me this\nwas...and I remember then that night when we got our miserable smelling vegetables or\nwhatever it was, there was such a feeling of sanctity, I think almost holiness, you know,\nand they really jumped. She tried to to see that we you know if if we didn't...everybody\nworked with uh uh you know al...almost with with such fervor and things that we couldn't\nfalter. And I think that without such a oneness, such a...I saw so much nobility of spirit in\nthe camps which somehow I wish would be better recorded, you know, when people\nreached out, you know...somebody had a birthday so uh we would uh save...on Sunday\nwe had margarine, a little margarine on the bread, so you know you would cut off some\nof the bread and scrape the margarine and and give it to the person on the bread that she\nwould have a lot of margarine on on her piece of bread. On Hanukkah, we knew it was\nHanukkah and that was still under Mrs. Keegler, and she was busy\ncelebrating... Hanukkah and Christmas are together...you know, and she closed an eye to\nthat sort of thing. We uh made a menorah (ph) out of potatoes and uh of course we knew\nthat you know we couldn't light | but we made a menorah out of potatoes and I I still\nhave the things which I wrote about the story about Hanukkah which we sang. I would\nlike to translate it and give it to you. I had a wondet...if I may skip for one minute just to\nmake a happier thing...when I went to Israel for the first time in 1961 I my friends\nsurprised me. I knew of three that were in Israel but actually ten showed up and I was the\neleventh, and they got out of the elevator in Tel Aviv, singing a song which we had\nwritten for the first Hanukkah in camp, and we carried the menorah which I naturally\nhave now, a beautiful old silver menorah that they give me in memory of the menorah\nwhich we made out of the potatoes, and you know when you made it out of potatoes it\nmeant you didn't eat that night because, you know, you didn't have potatoes. You can\nimagine what that menorah means when my husband kindles the lights and we see our\ngrandchild reflected in that...it's truly . Uh so you know, that was possible under\nFrau Keegler and one of the things that we did was Yelda and I dressed as grandmothers\nand you know, under the looms which we worked there was sort of a white powdery\nsubstance. We put it on our hair to grey and uh and we had a performance between the\nbunks under one naked electric light and see the faces in the bunks, you know. What we\ndid is we started out with uh you know there were two grandmothers and everything, and\ncomes tothe \u2014\u2014 and_\u2014_\u2014_ says oh . That's how how it started out and then\nwe of course predicted a brilliant future for everyone and then our two granddaughters\ncame to listen to us. Strangely enough the person who played my granddaughter...her\nname is Hilda Steinhart Goldschmidt (ph). She lives in Israel. Her son was one of the\nheros of the Six Day War. Hilda never lived to have a grandchild and so the one who\nplayed her granddaughter did not survive and our granddaughters listened to our tale of\nthe past and uh I'll say it in German. The exit line on that was uh . Do\nyou understand German?",
        "Q: Translate it.",
        "A: Uh come and look. I'll show you my newest , you know, what the granddaughter\nSays... , OK. Then the , because old people uh exaggerate so much and\nthen we see them exiting. Now mind you we were eighteen years old at the time and we\nsay to each other, . Dear children, let us just say that uh humans\nendure more than they think they could. And I think somehow uh considering how how\nyoung we were, we must have touched the core of our existence, the hope that someday\nto live in a world where our children and grandchildren would live, but best of all to live\nin such a climate where they will not believe our tales of the past. And that was possible\nunder Frau Keegler. I mean she didn't exactly hear the performance, you know, and and\nwe would sing songs in which we would say, you know, would make probably sound like\na summer camp there you know for her ears and and then we would throw in a few things\nin Polish, you know, which were exactly not meant for her ears, but but by and large uh\nthat part in contrast of uh...of course you know we were fortunate, quote, unquote, that\nwe were taken early yet, you know, before Auschwitz was inits full \u2014_\u2014_\u2014s aspect of\nthe...because after that people didn't go to working camps anymore. OK. Briefly uh and\nfinally Landeshutz was liquidated and we went to the most miserable and bitter camp\ncalled Gruenberg (ph) in . Uh Gruenberg was an enormous camp. Uh its factory\nwas one of the most beautiful in Germany in as much that it boasted the most beautiful\ncollection of roses surrounding the factory. It was direct contradiction of the beauty the\n____ was in. Uh I don't remember his name now...we called him LaLouche (ph). I will\nhave to remember his name. That was the most brutal, sadistic uh...I don't know if he was\ndirector but he was one of the people there. He wore a signet ring on his hand and and he\nwould jump like a cat and beat his victim until blood showed, mostly beat the faces. He\nwould have sort of a glazed look on his face. I don't know if...I tried to suppress the\nfeeling...we called him Lalouche. He was a beast. Uh things changed very drastically\nthen. I still worked in uh for a very little time in the weaving factories, but pretty soon\nthey had very little raw material for that and I was moved into what was considered\nsentence of death...spin__...spinning. Uh we were spinning fabrics or rather threads\nwhich came from raw materials which...the raw material consisted of clothing which\ncame from Auschwitz. It came to a place called ._____ are hugh machines which\nsort of shred that. Uh it was not difficult to imagine that some of the clothes belonged to\nour parents. Uh I worked most of the time on the night shift there and I remember when\nwhenever the the horror of some of that became overwhelming, one or at least I played a\ngame. I perfected it. And that was to imagine my homecoming, with all the details being\nthere including the sort of things that we had long sold but it was the miracle of freedom\nwould always be there. In any event, the most dreaded thing on in Gruenberg was\nthat...I'm not quite sure now if it was every four or every six weeks...we would go to a\ndoctor's office to be x-rayed because tuberculous was rampant and whoever displayed\nanything was immediately sent to Auschwitz, so you had to leave some life, usually\nbetween four and six weeks...I don't remember now if it was four or six weeks. Uh there\nwas something there with those x-rays. I uh did a thing which I will always regret. Uh the\nlast day that I was with my brother, we had to go to the which was something that\nlike the Jewish Federation, you know, when he did his registering, and we uh next to it\nwas the ruins of the temple and we climbed over the debris and we sat there for a moment\nand one column of the eastern wall stood un...undisturbed and everything else was in ruin\nand Arthur picked up a little stone and he handed it to me and he said just look at that\ncolumn and always remember that our people will survive. And he give me the stone, and\nI made a little sack of it and I carried it on my neck, and when we went to to x-rays I took\nit off and I had it in my pocket and I don't know...it was later probably...I think it was on\nthe death march that I lost it. And that was the one thing that I would...you know, pictures\nsurvived because I had them in my boot, but I lost that piece of stone. Anyway, this was\nabout Gruenberg. Gruenberg was a miserable camp. There was a lot of people being sent\nto Auschwitz. And and then see we knew that things were going bad with the war\nbecause there were uh not bombings but we had uh sirens were blowing every so often\nand uh we had to stop working. There was no electricity, and they were going crazy\nbeing vicious. Everybody there was incredibly bad. They made us stand outside for for\nhours on appell, you know. And uh if a piece of bread flew over the fence, which it once\ndid, everybody was beaten and to say who who got it. I'm proud to say about our people\nthat nobody gave away the culprit. We all knew who it was, and I think that this is\nthat...you know, uh what has troubled me so much that I have read some of the accounts\nthat people say how cruel people were, how they stepped on each other, or they make it\nsound like it was like a snake pit that people __ for survival. Look, I don't know what\nhappened in other camps, and this is why, you know, I have always used my maiden\nname on everything that I have written . |! would say that people behaved in the\nmost incredible manner imaginable by and large. And I think that this would be\nsomething that cannot be emphasized enough. It was in Gruenberg that Yelda once found\na raspberry in the gutter on the way to the factory. She carried it in her pocket all day\nlong and presented it to me that night on a leaf which she plucked through the barbed\nwire, had washed it, and gave it to me as a present. I asked her to take a little bit of a bite\nand she wouldn't. One single raspberry. A total possession. She gave it to a friend. There\nwere other acts like that, many. They unfortunately are not recorded. And I think this is\nprobably the greatest tragedy of them all. The nobility and the love that was felt. Anyway\nwhen things got really bad, you know, you sort of knew when things are going bad for\nthe Germans, they're probably going to finish us. When things are going good for for\nthem or well for them I should say, uh they aren't going to let us go. I know we will\nforever be slave, you know. It sort of varies what is going to happen, and that became our\nobvious in January of 1945 where one day uh we knew...we were told we were not going\nto go to the factory any longer, to gather our meager belongings of whatever that was. Uh\nthe night between the 28th and 29th of January, with great commotion and suddenly the\ndoors opened. The camp, you know...we we were then about two thousand girls. An\nadditional transport of two thousand came from Auschwitz. They told us they had walked\nfor I don't know how long from Auschwitz and we were going to to go on a march the\nfollowing morning. Destination later on we heard Orianienberg. Orianienberg was a\nmurder camp also, small enough known near Berlin which fell into the hands of the\nAllies when General Eisenhower made his swift move on Berlin and we started to march\nnow to to...the death march, 29th of January. I remember I had a terrible cold. I was\ncoughing terribly. Uh we were told to assemble in four abreast. Was Yelda, Suzie and\nLeisle (ph). Leisle was probably the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. She sort of...she\nmoved like a deer, had hugh brown eyes, _. She and Suzie were were sort of like\nsisters as Yelda was and I, you know, but the four of us together. Lei...Leisle was from\nfrom Czechoslovakia and Suzie was from Czechoslovakia and Yelda and I from\nBeilitz and the four of us sort of formed friendships, you know. Leisle was the sort who\nlooked after me. I would say oh, it's raining today. Do you think I should wear my green\nraincoat? And she would say no, wear the navy blue one and have you been to the garden\nto pick up apples yet. I mean she would fall into any imaginary game and I remember\nthat morning very vividly. You know there's such scenes in Dr. Zhavigo (ph) when you\nsee this incredible uh almost like a wasteland of white...it was freshly covered snow. The\nsnow, it had snowed during the night and the whole thing in front of the camp in\neffect...1t was all all covered with snow and uh we were assembled and and they lifted\ntheir whips and forward, march. And I remember Yelda said to me, she said I don't know\nhow you're going to make it. We'll all make it. And I was coughing so hard and we\nstarted the first step and I remember taking that step and I remember saying to myself this\nis the last chapter. But you know, I never had any doubt that we'll make it. And Yelda\nwas to my left, Leisle next to me and Suzie on the extreme right. And I'm the only one\nleft. I think the march is documented in I'm sure many other stories. (Pause) It was\nunspeakable. I had my skiing boots. I was the best equipped because I had my boots.\nIt...(pause)...at first we still had a little bit to eat that we took along and hoarded. We\nmarched I don't know how many miles a day. We came to rest sometimes in in a barn. A\nlot of...we stopped ina camp called _ where blessedly a few of our girls escaped. I\ndidn't. Uh people were shot continuously. If somebody stepped out of line, then you\nwould see snow being red and there through the forest, beautifully covered with snow\nand birds chirped sometimes and uh we were marching. Everyday the number got smaller\nand then we came (sniffling) to a place called Flossenberg and in Flossenberg, Yelda was\nalready very sick. Leisle, Suzie and I were still going pretty strong. One time we had\nnothing to eat so we started eating snow which was a terrible thing to do because the\nmore you eat, the more thirsty you are. And of course then diarhhrea and all was rampant.\nUh when we left one morning, one time they uh put us outside. They would spray us with\nwater and then they would herd us, literally hundreds into a small ___ and everybody\nstarted to perspire, put us out again and pneumonia was just like that (snapping\nfingers)...people died like flies. Then one morning we were told, for example, we were\ngoing to leave there. I remember Yelda was frantic. She said that's going to be the end. I\ndon't want to leave. And I said if we are so much better off out in you know in the open.\nMaybe we'll have a better chance. And all of a sudden came in an incredible\nannouncement, that President Roosevelt died. Then I knew it was too late to run because\nyou know we reconstructed at the time was and jubilation broke out, that all the enemies\nof the Fuhrer will perish in such a manner. It was a horrible blow, horrible. But we found\nsomething that day which sort of compensated us a little for that. We found a wrapper of\nmargarine and there was still some little vestiges of margarine stuck to it, so we licked it\ndry. We thought we'll certainly get very strong. And things got very bad from then on.\nYelda was really very, very bad. And one night we slept in...we all used to sleep outside\nand uh it started to snow and sort of reminded me of the story, you know, there's little\nand went around that everybody don't sleep, get up, because if you fall\nasleep and it started snowing, you know, you'll never wake up. Some people said it's the\nbest thing we can do 1s fall asleep like that, and uh then one...we came to an orchard and\nbefore we came to that orchard sort of something incredible happened. Oh yes...one time\nbefore that, because I thought Yelda was so sick, I said to her well we heard, you\nknow...we saw a lot of people on the road already...1t was an evacuation and people were\non wagons sort of similar to when the war started, you know. And those people were\nrunning away from the front, and we heard somebody talking in a similar dialect, German\ndialect, that we had, so we concocted a whole sort of story, that we will run away in the\nnext thing, and we will say that we, you know, will take our and we would say\nthat we were with our mother on the on the wagon and we got lost, you know, and that\nwe are from Beilitz because we had a similar dialect and of course with names like Yelda\nand Gerda you know, it was...and we we really had a whole thing how we are going to do\nit and Leisle and and Suzie were doing something similar, and we said our father was in\nthe Wermarcht and in order to get the numbers if we felt you know , we used our\nhouse numbers and 1939 when the war...had to make it a long number that, you know, if\nthey asked, so they will see that we tell the truth. And we came into that little forest\nwhere we rested, and uh sort of took a signal to each other that we are going to stay there\nwhen they say everybody assembled. And suddenly Yelda looked up at me and she said\nI'm afraid. And I was going to say come on, you know...and I didn't. And when we got\nout of the forest, they rounded up fourteen girls, some of our best friends were in the\nforest and we saw them all being shot. Right then and there I decided no matter what\nhappens I'm never going to run away. I'll go to the end whatever the end is, but I'm not\ngoing to attempt to run away, you know, because we've had people already running and,\nyou know, and uh the Gestapo, the SS was not too much in charge and, you know, it\nwould be it would be OK, but we made a pact until then I said we're never going to run\naway. We were just saved by by her not, by her saying, you know, don't run. And we...it\nwas either that day or the next day...I don't remember, an incredible thing happened.\nPeople were running in the streets and threw bread at us. And so we had bread and that\nnight we rested in an orchard. It was again it was snow...it started to...it was spring\nalready. It was April and this was after President Roosevelt's uh death...1t was something\nlike maybe the third week in April. And uh I told Yelda to watch the bread, to hold on to\nit. She was really very funny, already at this point. And my very dear friend uh ___ ran\naway and she survived. She's in in Detroit. That's quite a story to tell you about her...how\nI found, how we found each other after the war. And uh what we didn't realize was that\nwe had crossed over to Czechoslovakia. And those were the Czech people who were\nthrowing bread and you see, if I would have known that I would have stayed because\nthey would have hidden us. We would not be, you know, because if you could make it\nand went to a barn or something, very possibly so the German farmers turned the girls\nover to be killed. But never in Czechoslovakia...the Czech people threw us things and\nthen there was a wagon and they threw something. It landed and it was an egg, and I was\nsure that that egg is going to make Yelda get well. Hadn't seen an egg in years and years.\nAnd Yelda didn't even feel like having it. And then one night we were again out in a\nmeadow...snowing or raining...and a very dear friend of mine...her name is |\nKeller...she lives in Israel...came by and she brought two potatoes. I don't know where\nshe found it. And I remember I devoured mine. I was so hungry and Yelda had the other\none and Yelda said I'm not hungry. I just couldn't believe it that she wasn't hungry. And\nshe said to me you eat it. And I said maybe she'll feel better later, so I kept it and said I'll\nhold it for you. (Pause) She said she was thirsty, and I went to try to get water for her,\nand an SS man came and kicked her and she said why. (Pause) And then I tried to catch\nsome water in my hand for her. (Pause) Then she said something incredible. She said I'm\nnot angry at anyone. I hope no one is angry at me. And then she said to me, you are going\nto survive. And she said if my parents survived, don't tell them how I died. (Pause)\n(Crying) And then she said something else. She said to me you have to promise me that\nyou are going to go on for one more week. A week was a very long time. And she said\npromise. And I said I'll try. When daylight broke, and I had...there were some, there were\nsome blossoms on the trees and I had gone earlier and I had gotten a blossom for her to\nsmell, and I showed her the blossom...it was all dead, probably from her fever, and when\nthe sun got up, it was over for her. And we were told to bury the dead of that night. I\ncouldn't do it. It's strange...I know she was buried because my friend told me under a tree.\nI remember the most minute details and places, names of cities and towns where we went\nthrough...I still and I cannot remember the name of the place where she died. I can't. And\nsometimes I wonder perhaps it is so that that every tree sort of reminds me of her. You\nknow, she's become over the years my my alterego, my \u2014_ with my childhood. And\nevery year on the 29th of April I sort of step back and did for me some incredible\nthings that happened on the 29th. In the past how many years, forty-eight years...no,\nforty-five, forty-five years. Forty-nine...from 1945. I didn't see Suzie and Leisle. I didn't\nknow where they were because by that point I couldn't walk very well myself and I don't\nknow now if it was a few days later, whatever, they really descended on us, and with\ntremendous vengeance, screaming it was all our fault because the Fuhrer is told...you\nknow, Hitler is dead. We felt if 1t was true then either they're going to kill us now or\nmaybe we will survive. It was uh we came to a place in Czechoslovakia...things were\nreally quite crazy, you know. A lot of people were on on the roads again and uh soldiers\nrunning away and but we were still with the group. We had one woman SS with us and a\ncouple of men. I don't know to to how few our group had uh...it diminished enormously\nfrom thousands to a handful, maybe a little over a hundred and I I think I was quite ill\nalready, you know, because...I know, I mean I was ill anyway and and terrible upset\nabout, you know, Yelda's death and uh one evening we came to rest...was a place...oh, a\nplace in Czechoslovakia. We were in Czechoslovakia at that point, of course. And and\nthat place was called which I only realized that later. Uh we were sort of\noutside. It was quite quiet suddenly and uh a truck came. We were going to go some\nplace and my friend...oh yeah, and one SS woman came and told Keller...the one\nwho's in Israel...to take off my boots. Apparently she wanted...she saw I had good boots.\nShe liked my skiing boots. And said to me, I'll come, I'll hide you, and she hid me\ninsome___, pretended, you know, there wasn't...she never took them off. And then\n_____ said to me, uh and a truck came and the truck was going to take us someplace. I\nhave no idea where. And she said you better get on that truck, so that she shouldn't see\nyou. And I suddenly said to her, you know, I really want to stay here. I don't know what\nbut I'm in no hurry, you know, whatever. And it sort of was a feeling that it is probably\ngoing to happen now. They're going to kill us and I uh it was sort of at that point quite\nwarm. After all the snow, you know, it was a balmy night and I thought to myself it's all\nover. I'm going to start thinking what it would be like for a night like that being home,\nbeing in the garden with my parents, so if they kill me that's the memory I want. And the\npeople, trucks came and some of our girls went on it. I didn't. We waited and waited and\nwaited but the truck did not come back and fortunately I heard that on that truck uh there\nwas one of the SS women who was pregnant apparently. I didn't know that. And uh I\ndon't know if they were shooting, and she was hurt and one of the SS men then turned\nand killed fourteen girls on that truck. Fourteen. No, I think it was fourteen before. You\nknow, it's funny how how you play with numbers...fourteen or was it twenty-five. I really\ndon't know but a goodly number of girls. And we stayed there and uh and they came back\nfor us and took us into sort of a barrack or a hole or something like that and they locked\nus up there. We heard a lot of commotion. There was uh shooting and there were planes\noverhead and everything, and then the story had it uh that they uh attached a time bomb.\nIt was strange...we just went my husband and I to a reunion of the 5th Division Medical\nCorps who were our liberators and they spoke about that bomb and how the __s was\nthere. I mean, you know, for a while we thought you know maybe they just threatened it\nwas a bomb or something but apparently that was so, and they barricaded the doors with\nchains and things and we, you know, we sort to moved. They told that we are going to be\nkilled and I think before that there was some shooting. I remember some shooting was\ngoing on like it was here and there. Nothing nothing happened...just a little skin, and uh\nyou know, at that point I must confess that I'm not absolutely clear. Must have been quite\nill already or or whatever but I remember sort of that night it was quite turbulent and I\nremember them curling up and sort of uh the SS left and they left their coats and things\nbehind and I sort of went and and tried to sleep there. A lot of people were very ill. We\nknew the Americans were coming. I saw two the night before, and then there was the\ncrazy night and in the morning I asked where...I asked Leisle...she was...this was the\nbiggest irony of them all. They were shooting from planes and Suzie was hit in the foot.\nNot Suzie, Leisle. And she was lying there on the straw and I asked her where Suzie was.\nIt was morning and she told me that Suzie went to find some water at the pump and I\nwent to look for her and there she was, lying in the mud and she was dead. And I didn't\nwant to go back to tell Leisle that. So I I went out. You see, I had seen...there were two\nAmericans the night before. I spoke to them sort of. But that that is very vague to me. But\nI remember all the things of that morning and that was after I had found Suzie and I\ncouldn't tell Leisle so I went outside and I stood sort of in the doorway. It was a brilliant\nmorning. Oh yes. I have to tell you that I saw that morning on a steeple of the church a\nhomemade white flag of peace. And I remember that was the first time I cried in many\nmany months. It was a strange thing that I remember that my tears...you know, it's funny\nbecause now I cry at the slightest provocation. I cry when I see a dog or cat or something\nlike that but didn't cry for many years. And uh and I was standing there and saw and all\nof a sudden I saw (pause) a strange car coming down the hill, no longer green, not\nbearing the swastika, but a white star. It was sort of a mud-splattered vehicle but I've\nnever seen a star brighter in my life and two men sort of jumped out, came running\ntowards us and one came toward where I stood. He was wearing battle gear. I have to\nthink...you know, his helmet was this mesh over that and he was wearing dark glasses\nand he spoke to me in German and he said, does anybody here speak German or English,\nand I said I speak German. And I felt that I could tell him we are Jewish and didn't know\nif you would know what the star means or anything, but you know and I uh I was a little\nafraid to tell him that but I said to him, we are Jewish, you know. And he didn't answer\nme for quite a while. And then his own voice sort of betrayed his own emotions and he\nsaid, so am I. I was...1t was the greatest hour of my life. And then he asked an incredible\nquestion. He said, may I see the other ladies? You know, was _____ we have been\naddressed for six years and then to hear this man. He looked to me like a young guard. I\nhave to tell you I weighted sixty-eight pounds. My hair was white. As you can imagine, I\nhadn't had a bath in years. And this creature asked for the other ladies. And I told him\nthat most of the girls were inside, you know. They were too ill to walk and he said won't\nyou come with me. And I said sure. I didn't know what he meant. He held the door open\nfor me and let me precede him and in that gesture he start me to feel ___\u2014_\u2014sand that young\nAmerican today is my husband. (Pause) And that's my story. (Pause) I was very ill after\nthat. They established a hospital. I was in the hospital for quite a while. I was told I was\ngoing to die. Leisle unfortunately died a few days later of the wounds that she sustained. I\nwas in the hospital for quite a long time. He told me...he asked me if he could do\nsomething for me, and I said if you could write to my uncle in Turkey and tell him I was\nalive and see if he had any news about my parents and my brother, and I didn't see him\nfor quite a long time. You see, the following day the war was over too, and how I found\nout about it when we went to the...they was making a hospital out of a school house and\nuh I remember the incredible things. As a matter of fact, as I just told you, we had a\nreunion with the Medical Corps of the Division...",

        "A: Well, uh it was Friday morning. I I I remember it very well. I was fifteen you see. It was\nFriday morning when we heard a lot of planes and people ran into the streets and uh and\nthere were German planes and we ran out and saw planes with the swastika flying over. It\nwas terribly exciting and and a lot of activities started then. They were building trenches\nand uh and you know, uh my mother tried to keep sort of the windows down, were closed\nso from my father's bedroom...my father was in bed. My father was quite ill and that\nnight uh there were lots of of refugees on the streets. You know, people running away\nand and there was was shooting. I remember one one man was carrying a goat on his\nback. Apparently it was his only possession, a small goat and people with wheelbarrows\nand carts and everything and my brother had a girlfriend and apparently her uh family\ncalled and said that they are going to flee into the interior of Poland and suggested that\nthey would take my brother and me along and my father insisted that should be my\nbrother's decision. I was, you know, considered too young to make a decision. My\nbrother was nineteen at the time and my brother said no, we we're not going to go. We\nwill stay together. You you'll need us. My father was ill, and and that was a terrible shock\nbecause, you know, my father to me was sort of the center of my universe. I mean, you\nknow, when Poppa decreed something, he would do anything and that he should\nsuddenly ask us, particularly my brother, to make a decision...such a momentous\ndecision. I remember it was a terrible shock and uh it was very turbulent night and when\nit ceased in the morning and my father said to me that I I should go and apparently he\nwanted to talk to my mother and my brother that I should not be around and he said that I\nshould call the family to see what everyone is doing, my father's brothers and there were\nuncles and aunts and so on, and I went downstairs and uh the ring of the telephone...there\nwas no answer. No one answered anywhere and uh you know, I remember suddenly it\nwas like like you were left in a world of the dead, you know, all those homes that I\nremembered and the phones were ringing and ringing and there was no answer\nwhatsoever and uh when I came up my father said no one answers today, and I said no.\nAnd it was a wonderful Saturday. Everything was cut off. There was...we had no\nelectricity, no light and it was a beautiful, calm September day, flowers outside and my\nparents were sort of joking. My father got dressed and came downstairs and we were all\nsitting together and it was really the the last beautiful day. And then in the evening they\nstart with some shelling and my brother went out to let his dog in and when he came back\nhe he had a hole in his trousers and he said they were shooting from the rooftops. The\nGermans were coming but we went to the basement with some other people, you know,\nand it was morning. Then I I don't remember those hours too well, but what I remember\nmost vividly is uh that my mother called, said we should come. She had prepared some\nbreakfast and we came upstairs and we sat down. Suddenly, this tremendous roar, the\nroar of motorcycles and it was the motorcycle with Nazis in it, two...one in the side car\nand on sitting up there, and my brother had just, he had a wristwatch, but he had just\ntaken it out of his pocket because he carried it in his pocket, and I saw his, you know, his\nhand was down and it was 9:10 in the morning. And I remember everybody just sat there\ntotally stunned and then we heard people uh running. There were more more cars and\nmore motorcycles were coming and and people were shouting, heil Hitler, and we saw\nfrom from the house across the street the black swastika flag and I think that was the\nmost enormous shock, that people were prepared, was our neighbors, you know, our\nfriends, and they knew it in the very first hour and uh to me, and of course, you know,\nyou can only see it in in retrospect and of course I lived it many times, but one of the\nthings uh it sort of changed suddenly. I remember uh the coal fell out from the cradle of\nthe fireplace and uh it went on the carpet and the carpet was sort of smoldering and and\nno one paid any attention to it and I remember it had once happened before...how upset\nmy mother was and no one paid any attention. These were just tiny little vignettes which\nsuddenly sort of you know changed everything. And uh shortly thereafter perhaps...you\nknow, then more and more trucks of soldiers were coming and and the voices grew more\nhoarse, people shouting heil Hitler and II saw a childhood friend of mine carrying white\nroses to to the soldiers and somebody was giving the soldiers schnapps and flowers for\nand the whole sort of thing and I I remember starting to cry and my brother\ndragged me on the carpet and he said, keep quiet, you know, you you can't do that, and he\ntook me up to bed and he said, you know, don't make a sound and it was in the after...it\nwas in the morning...I mean, you know, uh the whole day was sort of uh melange (ph) of\nmany many feelings which I try to remember over the years, but one of of the worst\nthings happened that afternoon. Uh the mother of the childhood friend of mine...she\nblessedly is alive and she lives in Israel...her name is Esther Bergman (ph). Her mother\ncame and she asked where my father was and she said uh...but she knew that he was ill\nbut she said,also to my brother that no man should go on the streets because they had\nrounded up all the men that they could find and they locked them in the temple and they\nset the temple aflame and then she sort of went out by the back door. And I think that was\ntruly the first impact what happened.",
        "A: I couldn't you tell you day by day, you know. Uh people came. Our our neighbors came,\nour non-Jewish neighbors came...oh, one thing, yes...uh a neighbor who, you\nknow...she...the home in which we lived in not only was I and my brother born there but\nmy mother had been born there. It was a family home, you know, and our grandmother\nhad lived with us. Fortunately, blessedly for her, she died the year before the war broke\nout. She, you know, never faced that. Uh a woman came and she asked where our flag\nwas, the Polish flag, you know, which used to be red and white, and uh my mother said\nwhy, and she said we have to make a German flag out of 1t and my mother pretended to\nlook for it in all places where she knew she wouldn't find it, you know, and then uh the\nwoman left and she said she would be back later. Maybe my father can help look for it,\nand I think that became very clear that we better produce it because she really wanted it\nfor our protection and she said all you have to do is, you know, keep the the red flag and\ncut a round circle from the white, put a black swastika on it and she came to collect it.\nShe did it and then she said she wanted to look where Arthur was because he is very\nstrong. He should hang it up and he apparently could not be found to do it, so the woman\nstruggled to hang the flag up and she sort of said to my mother, you know, if uh if the\nflag is not displayed from here, it would be pretty obvious who you are. And uh I\nremember we couldn't look out of the window to see to see that flying. We had some\nother people you know living in in our home as well who uh who were not Jewish and\nsome were sympathizers and of course they wanted that, because you know, this was the\npart which was German speaking. Bielitz before the war was Austria and later on it was\nalso one of the first things that became uh it was they called it , you know,\n, uh where so we were unfortunately not too far from from Auschwitz, which was\n_____, and that became the perfect which was allegedly self-ruled. Of course it\nwasn't, you know, but we immediately became uh under the symbols as as Germany. So\nuh the people who...I suppose most people were German-speaking people, you see, and\npeople were shouting uh heil Hitler. Thank you for the liberation, and things like that\nbecause they thought that you're not an Austrian Empire was coming back with, you\nknow, Franz Joseph and the beautiful Empress Elizabeth and so on, you know, was the\npart had been under Poland for only twenty years, so uh uh I think there was a lot of\nmis...perhaps misguided feeling on behalf of the people, maybe not so much pro-Nazi at\nthat particular point, but of course all that changed.",
        "A: What I can unfortunately tell you...uh fairly soon an order came that all young men\nbetween I think sixteen and fifty had to register. My father at that point was about fifty\nand since he was ill he did not have to register for a transport. My brother was nineteen\nand, of course, everyday you know, that we knew that England and France declared war,\nyou know, that we knew right away. That happened Sunday. You know, we were\noccupied Sunday morning. Sunday afternoon uh England and and France declared war on\nGermany. Uh then you know, most of the family had fled, our family; however, my\nfather's sister who had uh been separated from her husband and daughter in one of the\ntrains which which were bombed, came back with her son David and she found her\napartment occupied by uh by other people, and she came to stay with us. David was\nabout my brother's age, and David and also my brother went to register to whatever they\nwere going to do and they said that they they would be in uh in some sort of labor\nbattalion to uh build up what was uh destroyed by the war. The date was the 19th of\nOctober on which my brother left. Anyway...I tell you one thing...my my mother refused\nto make his bed for for months. She wanted to keep the imprint of his head on the pillow.\n(Pause) All things got worse from day to day, you know. We didn't hear from my brother\nfor a long, long long time and when we finally did, which I believe was months later, he\nwas uh blessedly in the Russian occupied zone. He was in . And what apparently\nhappened was that uh they were brought into the interior of Poland uh nearthe __.....]\ndon't know exactly what location...pursued by bullets. Those who were good swimmers\nswam across. He was a very good swimmer and he was in in , which was uh\noccupied by the Russians and he worked there. Uh my brother was was trained in\nchemistry uh and he worked in some sort of a factory making germ (ph) or whatever. Uh\nthat was one of the greatest, marvelous moments in the bleakness of our existence to to\nhear that Arthur was alive. Uh I cannot...I really...1 mean I was sort of refreshing my\nmemory and looking at some of the things which I had written after the war which I have\nthe most clear knowledge as far as dates are concerned but I know that uh it probably was\na few months later that we were to move into the basement of our home. It was very wet\nthere and there was no electricity there and uh my father's uh condition deteriorated quite\na bit. He suddenly looked very old. Uh my mother uh who up to that point you see,\nbecause my grand...we had lived with my grandmother and so I was rather pampered and\nyou know, uh given to be very easily discouraged and upset about uh little things like uh\nyou know, table clothes didn't iron properly, or the lace was wrong or something...uh\nshowed incredible strength and fortitude. As a matter of fact she was the one who did not\ncry when my brother left. And my father wept. The first time I saw my father crying. It\nwas sort of reversal of of roles you see and I think to to me a very devastating thing to see\nmy father helpless and and I never saw my father helpless before and uh so we lived in\nthe basement. Uh I learned new skills. I saw my mother uh bringing an old...it was called\npetroleum lampiere (ph), you know...uh lamp....I learned to clean the chimney of the\nlamp and if we got some guests to to make illumination like that, because we had no\nlight. Uh pretty soon of course, you know, uh we exhausted our funds because we we had\nno no money. You know, everything was frozen. My father didn't earn anything and all\nthose things were very hard to come by but where we lived, you know, there there were\nvegetables and things were obtainable and our our neighbors... hada _\u2014_\u2014_\u2014\u00ab, you know, a\nnanny, who was wonderful to us and she lived diagonally across the street and she would\ngo and get vegetables and bring things to us but uh my mother was always a wonderful\nneedlewoman. She could do wonderful things with her hands, so we sort of through\nthat we would be knitting and I learned to...I learned to knit before the war but I wasn't\nparticularly interested in that, you know. I was more of a tomboy running around with\ncats and climbing trees and and I settled down and we would start knitting sweaters for\npeople. My mother really had a wonderful reputation. You know, she would embroider\nthings on sweaters. She did some marvelous things and uh we would be able to get\ncandles. We had quite a store of candles because uh we couldn't use the lamp too often\nbecause petroleum was available, you know, on only limited things and our ration\ncard...we got ration card, you know, with the name Jew and and there was very little to\neat and uh so uh my mother and I would would knit for as long as daylight would allow\nand my father would sit and read to us. And really this is how uh my father was\nwonderful..you see, I went to Polish schools. Even so, my first language was\nGerman...spoke German at home and when I would come home from school I would\nswitch to German, but I couldn't read or write German, you know. I spoke it naturally. It\nwas my first language. So my father unearthed my mother's books and he started teaching\nme to read and write German, and then my father would read to us, you know, and and\nwe would let the candle go down. Then we would take take some wax and my mother\nmade uh little wicks and we would put the candle on again and we would uh we would\nknit. We got...I remember it very clearly...for knitting a sweater, uh intricate sweater.\nYou know, at first I would just knit the sleeves and things and my mother would do the\nintricate work. We would get uh thirty . Well, it was thirty if you could\nbuy food on ration it was fine, but we had to start buying food on the black market, so I\nwould say uh roughly a loaf of bread would cost thirty marks so for knitting a sweater we\nwould able to buy roughly a loaf of bread. And this is how things went. And then started\nthe things of the , you know. It was uh to be sent away and every so often a\nlittle cart would come announcing that...as a matter of fact the first one came uh when we\nhad not heard from Arthur, and I remember at that point my my mother sort of must have\nsuffered a nervous breakdown, at least a momentary lapse because I remember she was\nshe was totally out of things. She was calling for Arthur. She was in bed. And my father\nwas up with her and my father told me to go and to pack. We we were supposed to leave\nwith twenty pounds of our belongings. And uh my father bought for us sort of _ little\nsuitcases and he told me to to pack some things and and word got around to uh in the\ncommunity that we were selling things. Everybody...I mean all the Jews..that was the\nway to do it, and people started to come. My father said whatever anybody gives you,\ntake it, and he stayed with my mother, and then uh word got around that if...I don't\nremember the exact amount...let's say uh kilo gold...something like that...1t might have\nbeen less, it might been more. I don't remember. If that would be given and then that\nwould stay , So you know, everybody scurried to get whatever jewelry people had\nto bring it...of course that was another...was what the Germans did in order to to get the\nvaluables which people were holding and . And apparently they got what uh\nwhatever was needed for for that purpose because uh then a note came to say we could\nstay. You know, , and that would happen roughly every six, seven months, and\nagain I I don't know exactly that, but uh but is after we got, you know, my mother\nseemed to bounce back and became her her strong self and and from that time on I would\nsay until the very end, my mother was absolutely a tower of strength. You know, looking\nback now, my mother was a very young woman at that time. She was she was forty-one\nwhen the war broke out. Of course to me she was an old woman, you know, to a fifteen\nyear old girl, you know. My father was ten years older than my mother. So the existence,\nyou know, and worse and thisis show we survived. This was three years...1939\nthrough the spring of 1942. The very very spring...it could have been March perhaps\nwhen the order came that we had to move to the Jewish ghetto which was the shabby,\nremote part of our town, quite far away from where we had lived, because it was actually\nin you see. Uh Bielitz- it's called now, two , twin cities and that\nwe lived in Bielitz and that was and way out. ___, near a very old cemetery\nwhere we had to to move. And uh as I told you, my my garden hold held most of my\nwonderful childhood memories and uh fairly soon...I would say probably in early 1940,\nuh there was a sign on it that no Jews or dogs were permitted in the garden, so we\nnaturally did not go but on the morning on which we were forced to leave our home, I\njumped over the fence and went to the garden and I ran around. Uh I remember there\nwere the first violets where we had a little brook... , the first violets were there,\nwhich I had picked and I remember sort of planting a branch of a tree where I used to sit\nand pretending what it would be like if if nothing had happened you know and I would go\nin and my parents would be at breakfast and my brother would be going to school, and so\non, and uh you know, even so uh I always firmly believed that I'll go back home. That\nbecame the crutch through all the years. Looking back now I realize that I must have had\na premonition because I remember in that I sort of really started imagining what\nmy garden would look in all seasons, and I knew that I would not see it. But I don't know\nany longer if I thought that I'll never see it for a period of time or if there would be\nfinality in it. I I really don't know. But, you know, you sort of take memories out like uh\nlike cameos and hold them and look at them. And that was it.",
        "A: Well, strange as it may seem, I guess I really was happier in the ghetto than at home\nbecause I had friends there, you know. At home I was uh...well, that isn't quite true. My\nmy father, you know, there were several girls, particularly the one who became\ntremendously close to me, my friend Elsa (ph). There was Esther Bergman who lived not\ntoo far away and she used to come, but my father would teach us and that was still at\nhome. You know, he would take books out and teach us a bit of history and all those\nthings that he knew. He was very knowledgeable so, you know, in a very fragmented\nway, but I think uh in those first three years, almost three years at home, it was my\nfather...I I think I I acquired quite a bit of knowledge. He taught me all...my father my\nfather was supposed to be a rabbi and because you know he came from...you see my\nmother was born in Beilitz which was uh very Austrian and they prided themselves, you\nknow. My...as a matter of fact my my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, uh still\ncelebrated Kaiser Franz Joseph, that's the Austrian Kaiser, uh birthday which is on the\n18th of August which I still remember, you know and because uh and I think they all\ntalked about the good old days, you know, the wars and you know, everybody has to\nthink the good old days, but my father's family uh came from a place called and\n_____ was the seat of the which was he was very well know. As a matter of\nfact even now I read quite a bit...his name was Freidman (ph) and my father's family was\nrelated to him and I have some wonderful childhood memories as a child going to .\nUh should I have continued with with what I talked before...do you wish me to...",
        "A: Alright. But uh I don't remember why I wanted to to tell this particular story. In any\nevent, uh my friends, you know, there was a number of girls and they...we all lived in\nproximity, you know. In the ghetto there was one large building and a number of my\nfriends lived there, so it uh it really was in a way a bit nicer for me where, you know,\nbecause there was a very uh sharp cur...curfew that I could never see my friends like in\nthe evenings or after five o'clock or what have you. Living in the same building was sort\nof...1t was nice to see my friends, you know. And there was also some babies there, and I\nliked babies and I could go and play with the two babies, so for me in a way it was a bit\neasier. It wasn't for very long. As a matter of fact, looking back I realize how little time\nthere was because uh very soon an order came that we had to go and work in uh ina\nshop, sort of factory thing sewing garments in a place called . Uh so my mother\nand I had to go . We went under guard to to a train. The train station was not\ntoo far away and uh we worked sewing garments there and and then my father had to go\nto fortify the river in Suka (ph) and that was very hard because my father could really not\nbend his his arm very well but he said...but he started looking a little better. You see that\nhe was very pale because being home uh for so long so actively being out in the fresh\nair...1t was deceiving but seemed to me that Poppa looked better. It was a very short time,\nreally. Uh come to think of it, it probably was not more than than two months. And then I\nremember my uh in May eighteenth birthday. I was fifteen when the war broke out and I\nwas three years...my eighteenth birthday. My mother decided that I'm going to have a\nparty and uh I just had a wonderful thing. I just had a big birthday, my sixty-fifth, and a\nfriend of mine who now lives in Detroit met my uh____ children give me a party. She\ncame to the party and she was in in Arizona now, and she was at that birthday party. The\nbirthday party was rather grand because my mother had some oatmeal and she had made\nsome wonderful cookies which we all swarmed. They were absolutely like uh tasted like\nuh nuts and I had a birthday party, which was crowned by an incredible thing. I got an\norange. I always loved oranges. Only later did I find out that my mother had gone out of\nthe ghetto, sold a diamond and pearl ring to get me an orange. That was the last birthday\ngift from my parents. (Pause) Uh a couple of my friends were there. One lives in New\nYork and uh she reminded me of something not too terribly long ago because uh the\norders came on the 28th of June...all the men had had to leave on a Sunday...my father\namongst them. (Pause) We went to the station. My father stood in the...it was just\ndreadful. He wore the yellow star. (Pause)\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Right. And then the order that my father's leaving. There is however one thing that I\nwould like to mention as a tribute to my parents. Uh the last night before my father\nleft...of course we all lived in one large room at that point...I heard my parents talking. I\ndon't know if it was for them or for my benefit. They did not mention at all the parting in\nthe morning, but they spoke about their years together. They were, you know, about\nabout the happiness they had shared, about uh my brother's birth and mine, about the\nhopes they had for us, and I think in in death they have instilled something in me which\nwhich has been my legacy all this...uh the value of of the love, of the commitment, of the\nof the family, and uh you know, when the going goes rough as it was in in\nsubsequent times, it uh it was a very comforting thing and I shall always be grateful for\nthat. I mentioned seeing my father for the last time and after that, my friend who\nlives in New York now, uh and I went...we knew...see, they were taking all the men on\nSunday and uh took place on Monday morning. Uh we decided, uh and I,\nthat we should, we we knew what's going to happen to to all the books, probably prayer\nbooks and most of the books which were in Jewish families that were treasured and uh\nafter my father was taken away, we went and collected all the books. I was afraid that the\nGermans are going to use it for unspeakable purposes and we dragged it to the Jewish\ncemetery which was really the ghetto, and uh we buried them there. And I'm\nsorry for not understanding my mother's grief completely at that time. You know, I was\nreally terribly close to my father and that I didn't comfort my mother. Today I think I sort\nof needed to be alone, to lick my own wounds, so to speak. Uh there's just one more thing\nthat I want to mention. Before my father left, he asked me (pause)...",
        "A: And my father said that uh...I'll always remember that one does not carry one's calling\ncard in one's pocket, engraved upon one's ___...(Pause) (Crying)\n(Pause)...anyway I'm sure that many people have given you descriptions of of the leaving\none uh of leaving and I guess our's was not too much different. Except that my mother\ndecided to fast on that day. It was a Monday, and my mother fasted every Monday since\nmy brother had left, and uh she had a bit of precious cocoa she had hoarded throughout\nthe entire war for a special celebration and she made some cocoa for me that morning. I\nmust say it did not taste very sweet. We were marched through the town under the whips\nof the SS uh to a certain collection...I had it happen to me many times during the war.\nLater on that one sees sort of in rapid succession the things which you see as a thing\nwhich 1s a hoax (ph), like uh they were putting a new name of a movie on the marquee,\nuh watching by a shop which sold fabrics and uh remembering the type of fabric that my\nmother bought for a summer dress, but it wasn't colorfast. You know, it was such a...and\nyet it's very funny. I remember it in . [remember them now you know. Uh seeing\nsome neighbor peering from behind the curtain, because you see we went in from from\nthe ghetto, through through the town again to the other side of the town to which was\ncalled the where we went. Uh I marched with my mother. I saw a man with a\ncane. He asked me how old I was. I said eighteen. He told me to go to the left. We were\nloaded on trucks sometime later and I would like to get this over with as fast as I can,\nOK? And I heard my mother's voice...I did. And she was calling be strong, . And I\nheard that. I was in the truck. I jumped off and I said I want to go to my mother. The little\nman in a raincoat came by. Hisname was ___. He was from . I don't know how\nhe had this enormous strength. He was quite short. it was raining. He was wearing a\nraincoat and a hat. And he took me bodily and he threw me back on the truck and he said\nyou are too young to die. So it was the man who probably sent my mother to her death\ndecided I should not run back to her. We went to a place called . There was a\n_____ lager. It was transient camp and there was the 29th of June, 1942, a Monday. A long\nstory _. I'll just confine it to my own....I had the opportunity of leaving there, cause of\n____, you know, a boy who liked me. His parents tried to get me out of the .",
        "A: . (Sigh) Anyway, in my naivete (ph) I made a decision that I did not want to go\noutofthe _ to go back to Bielitz. There was...there were two camps in Beilitz and uh\nI mean again there's a story about a young man there who apparently liked me very much.\nHis name was . He was a very fine artist and uh his family suggested he __\nwith his family that you see you could get out of the \u2014 if you uh had a place of work,\nif you had some working permit and uh that you can put, get out to...and uh he had two\nsisters and they had two sewing machines and they were willing to put one in a shop to\nsecure a place for me, which was an incredible sacrifice. Uh however I knew that if I did\nthat I would probably have to marry __. I made the decision not to go. Uh maybe this\nis a good story to tell because I that I uh I wanted to stay with my friends even\nthough I knew I was going to camp. By strange, almost incredible coincidence, the man\ninthe ||| whocame and told me that I was able to go out...his name 1s Jacob Chancer\n(ph). He now lives in Buffalo, New York, where of course I lived for many years. That\ndecision proved to be a decision which saved my life because unfortunately the Briggs\n(ph) family, all of them, were deported and killed about two months later. And you see uh\nBeilitz, my home town, was renown for its textiles. Uh it was called of central\nEurope. And uh in the they registered your name, your age, and the place you hail\nfrom (ph), and industrialists from all over Germany would come to buy slaves. A man by\nthe name of Keller (ph)...I think it's good to use the names...his name was Director Keller\nfrom a firm called . had several uh spinning uh weaving and uh\ntextile-oriented and associated firms and they needed people to work in the factories.\nWhen he came and he saw that x number of girls from Beilitz were there, for some reason\nhe thought we might have more ex in weaving or whatever and anyway they were\nalways looking because you see that still fairly early. That was '42. They needed German\nspeaking people to be trained, so he bought all of us for a place called Bolkenhein (ph)\nwhich was a new weaving camp in . And in fact this is where we went. In all\nfairness I must say that uh that camp was probably better than than most of certainly what\nfollowed because it was new. You see, we were only fifty girls there. And the person who\nbecame our lager fuhrer, at first sight she looked like a bulldog and I thought she's going\nto tear us limb from limb, and she was a very kind person. She was probably chosen for\nher looks but we all who were in captivity under her owe her a debt of gratitude. And I\nthink by her very decency she pinned a lie to the lips of all who said they had no choices.\nI won't say she particularly loved us. She saved my life once for which I'll be eternally\ngrateful and there was uh as far as I know and I do know, that as long as we were there\nand later in a place called Landeshutz (ph) where she also was, nobody was sent to\nAuschwitz from our camp, from those two camps. And uh she showed that people could\nhelp individually and she did. I only met during my entire years under the Nazis, for six\nyears, I only met two who were really kind and I think that they should be singled out for\nthat. Frau...her name was Frau Keegler (ph), with an umlaut, so uh and we first saw her\nand she barked and everything...I thought this is the end of it all. Well we...I was with my\nfriend Yelda (ph) whom I really would like to mention and in the camp there we became\nas close as sisters. Yelda was a childhood friend only in the sense that her mother and my\nmother were friends, you know, but Yelda played the piano beautifully. She was\nexquisitely mannered. My mother always told me how how I should try to be more like\nYelda, you know, and of course I hated to play with her. She seemed to be the paragon of\nall virtue, and uh we became quite close already in the ghetto when we used to go to the\ncemetery...1t was the only place you could go, but uh in the camps, you see she had a\nlittle sister by the name of Kitty and of course Kitty was sent to Auschwitz. My other\nfriend Gretle (ph) had a sister, so the two sisters...you know, everybody sort of had a\nbuddy and Yelda and I became that to each other. She she showed great promises as a\npianist. She was sent to Vienna uh two years before the war to study at the conservatory\nthere and uh a great future was predicted for her. And Yelda sort of became my sister. As\na matter of fact, we looked quite a bit alike and uh so it was and there was something else\nthat uh perhaps would give you sort of an inkling what it was like. On the train to the\ncamp, to Bolkhain, I met a wonderful girl, a vivid redhead, a wonderful, you know, called\nbeautiful people, tall, wonderful girl. Her name was Suzie Kunz (ph). She was born in\nVienna but her mother had died. Uh she was quite young and since she was sent to\nCzechoslovakia to live with her grandparents because you see uh in that particular\ntransport were mostly girls from Beilitz and from Czechoslovakia and you know we were\nall German speaking and this is why we went to that camp. And I was standing next to\nSuzie on on the train. You know, the it's a train sort of uh...there was a certain freedom\nthere you know. We were in...not confined at the \u2014_. We were out of the and\ngoing someplace and uh Suzie said we'll never ever get out of where we are going and I\nsaid yes we will. And I said I'm sure the war will be over in less than a year, and Suzie\nsaid no, we're not going to make it. And I said I'll bet you and she said OK. She said let's\nbet a quart of strawberries and a quart of whipped cream and we shook hands on that.\nAnd Suzie died on liberation morning. I found her dead. I don't know if she knew or if\nshe didn't...she won that bet. Anyway we came to Bolkenheim. Bolkenheim...you know\nuh it's a terrible thing to say but but I think because we are recording that sort of thing\nshould be said...actually for me it it was easier then. Easier in terms that I didn't see my\nparents suffer. You know, I could sort of put things over there but I uh I was convinced\nthat my parents will survive, that they are someplace which they are probably working. I\npushed all thoughts aside and I was in a way liberated in fact but you know I wasn't\nworried that each of my action might spell danger to my parents. And you know, I know\nif somebody's going to beat me, they aren't going to see it. All the indignities that one has\nsuffered and you know and vice versa, you know. But of course when you're eighteen\nyears old you know, you have the ___ that you don't...anyway uh Bolkenheim was\nrough in terms until we mastered what was expected of us. There was somebody there by\nthe name of Meister Zimmer (ph). He was dreadful. And uh I used to amuse myself when\nhe told us all things, you know, that uh that we are going to be taught decency and all the\nthings, you know, uh that I think that that we knew so well which obviously were were\ndesigned to break our resistance, you know, and said if we behave ourselves and do these\nthings we can live there all our lives you know, and I used to sort of speculate what he\nwould look like when he was dead and things like that, you know. Uh now I...I...you\nknow, fortunately uh you know I I always wrote when I was a little girl and things like\nthat and I I could lift myself from some of the things and do other things in my mind to\nremove that, and I think I did that in the very first weeks when we were there. But you\nknow, he used to sit with, stand with a watch, with a stop watch, and you had to do\nwhich are uh was very intricate uh...what do you call it...1t's funny...I lapse into\nGerman now...uh to tie something, a knot, you know, a weaver's knot to be exact, and\nyou had to do x number a minute and of course you can imagine when you have\nsomebody standing with a stopwatch above you to do that uh your life __ on that. But\nfor some reason most of us were able to do it and those who were not were put in the\nspinner _ or in other things, so nobody was sent to Auschwitz from the original fifty\nthere. And it was by comparison of what came later, relatively easy in as much...I mean\nwe were not that hungry. We we got some food because Mrs. Keegler was decent. Uh we\nuh we worked in the factory long hours and I think that was really the very best thing.\nWe were so exhausted at the end of the day that you had to concentrate so much and to\nwork, you know, that your mind couldn't absorb what...\nEnd of tape #1\nTape #2\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: OK.",
        "A: The weaving...(pause)...we were able to write letters and again in that uh Mrs. Keegler\nwas quite generous because I don't remember exactly, you know, what the ratio was, how\noften you were permitted to, but of course you know there were...who could you write to,\nbut I was fortunate that I had my father's address in s+ which way my father was\nallegedly working on the fortification of that river and uh I wrote to my father. Uh I did\nnot hear. Of course I heard from and I wrote to him and he started sending me\nletters as well as packages which again through the type of person that Mrs. Keegler was,\nthose packages did arrive. Uh I wrote to my father and I waited to hear from my father\nand one day a most incredible thing happened. Mrs. Keegler was handing out mail and\nshe called my name and I saw a letter and I jumped to get it, and then I realized it was the\nletter which I had wrote written to my father and on it it said, without forwarding address.\nUh I think that we needn't go into that. No one think that I I lost my my speech for a day\nand a night. I I could not utter a sound. Anyway uh we worked there and uh the thing was\nuh, you see, the type of thing that I I don't know if it really comes across 1s the\ntremendous support system which existed in the camps. The love and the friendship and\nthe sharing and caring and loyalties that people had for each other, the girls had for each\nother. Uh you know that was sort of the balance against the cruelty which we experienced\nand to me I feel that was probably one of the most important things that existed and I\nsomehow wish that would filter down. I usually attempt to tell my children and now my\ngrandchildren because in the very odd spiritual airs of those who did not survive to know\nthat the legacy of the camps is not the legacy of the horror but of the greatness of our\npeople, the very humanity which existed there in the face of such incredible inhumanity.\nUh I particularly want to talk about my friend Yelda (ph) for a moment but that actually\nhappened in in another camp. I I'll give you the quick progression from camp to camp.\nWe were in Waldenheim, if I remember correctly when you know we were working on\nlooms and pretty soon uh the raw materials started to disappear. We we had to uh work\non uh uh paper. There was paper that they were spinning and of course you know in the\nwarm weather it became brittle and it would break and uh in cold weather it would\ndisintegrate because it got soft, and uh was, you know, those things tore the\nthings which what happened to me. Uh for that you could you could be sent to Auschwitz\nbut somehow Mrs. Keegler intervened that people were not, and I remember at one time\nwhich was what I wanted to talk about Frau Keegler. Uh it was shortly after I received\nthe news about my father uh that I became very ill. I don't know exactly what I had but I\nknow that all my fingernails started to have pus in it and I couldn't touch my hands and\nand I was running a very high fever and we had sort of a little...1t was called in\nwhich people were sick for a day or two could stay, and I was there and all of a sudden\nLindsay (ph), you know, I think he has quite a name in the SS, he came on a sudden\ninspection and Frau Keegler charged into the room. I omitted to say my father made me\nwear my skiing boots. When I left home...I last saw my father on the 28th of June and I\nleft home the 29th and I was separated from my mother the following day. Before my\nfather left, he said to me wear you skiing boots. We were all avid skiers, you know. We\nlived in the the ski mountains. A lot of skiing there. And I said why and my father said I\nwant you to wear them and I said Poppa, skiing shoes in June...you know, I ought to wear\na pair of sandals and my father said you have to wear them. You know, you didn't argue\nwith your father in those days. I wore them and I blessed them every single day because I\nwore them for the entire three years that I was in camp and in the in the lining I had\nhidden the pictures which are now in my book. This is where the pictures were. At first I\nwas able to keep them, at the first camp, but later on and on the death march I had\nconcealed them there. So Mrs. Keegler charged in and she dragged me out of of the bunk\nand she said Lindsay is here. It's a matter of life and death. I'll take you to the factory.\nAnd she stooped down and she started to lace my boots and she dragged me to the\nfactory. She used to work in the factory before and I worked on four looms and she set\nthe looms in motion and she said to me, pull yourself together and I remember I still\nheard the beating of the loom, you know, and everything was sort of at different angles\nbecause I was running a very high temperature and he came for inspection. He went\nthrough and if he would have found me there, she could not have saved me and there was\nno question about it, so that was how Keegler...but pretty soon it became obvious that the\nuh that they needed us in another camp and uh our camp was disbanded and we went to\nuh I think three different ones, Matzdorf (ph), . LT really don't remember the third\none. I was sent to Matzdorf. Matzdorf was a horrible, horrible camp. Uh we were locked\non the fifth or sixth floor and uh every morning they would wake us with whips. I worked\nin the flax detail which was a dreadful place. Uh they were doing linens there, and flax\nuh submerged in a swamp. You had to pull it out of the swamp, you know, and uh when\nyou opened the things and retracted the flax. It was terribly hot. It was in summer and the\nmosquitos were all over us when we were working there and then I I was singled out to\ndo something else, namely to unload coal at night. Allegedly I give fresh answer to uh to\none of the supervisors. They are men, and for that I was banished to work the flax during\nthe day and at the coal detail at night. Uh it was an incredible time. Then we...I also to\nload the flax uh into sort of silos which were I mean I think now that they were ten\nstories high. They probably were not. They probably were three or four, but you know\nyou there was no balance because __ those things. I I remember that it was nothing but\ntorture you know. As soon as we went back to camp, I was called to to go and went and\nunload coal and that was ___ the only time. You know my father had asked me earlier...I\nforgot to mention it...during the first when my mother was so ill...J remember\nstanding at the window and we heard that a family had committed suicide together. And I\nremember standing at that window looking out at the garden, my mother being so sick,\nmy father with his hand in in the sling. I hadn't...we hadn't heard from Arthur, you know,\nand I wished that my parents would suggest that. My father and I were both very close\nand he always knew what I was thinking, and I remember he came behind me and he\nsaid, without looking at me, he said, what you are thinking now is cowardly. He said\npromise that you are never going to do that. I didn't answer him and he took his hand and\nhe turned my head towards him and he said I want your promise now. And I promised\nhim. And I remembered it during the working in the coal trucks. There were trains going\nby. I didn't know if they were going to Auschwitz or whatever, and I remember sort of\nthe tracks beckoning in the moonlight and I thought, you know, it would be over very\nquick. One jump and one pain and that's going to be it because it was so dreadful there.\nAnd at one moment I think I really came fairly close. I felt a very strange pain in my\nneck. Anyway, obviously I didn't do it. So...when things were really very very hard in\nMatzdorf we worked in the swamp one days and I think that was really one of my lowest\nhours, when...we had a lager fuhrer in there who was the exact opposite of Mrs. Keegler.\nShe was maybe eighteen years old, sort of an over-blown thing and she was wearing\nrings on every finger and uh and her great joy was to have a little wagon, like a child's\nwagon, and she had us pull her around in that wagon. She was having a whip about it...I\nmean, you can't imagine the calibre of or the intelligence of that person. And all of a\nsudden she came with somebody else, with a man, and they said...they were calling\nnumbers. You see we all had numbers, of course. And they were calling numbers and I\nwas working next to Yelda and heard them call her number, and I sort of looked up. I\nmust have been dazed, and she pointed and the lager fuhrer and said you idiots. Don't you\neven know your own numbers, and Yelda pointed to me and she said that is her number. I\ndidn't understand what she was doing. She obviously wanted to get me out from whatever\nit was, so the lager came and naturally slapped me and she said don't you even know your\nown number, you idiot and so I...and since they called my real number and we didn't\nknow what was happening or maybe Yelda...I'm I'm really not quite sure on that, but\nwhat happened was as we came to the camp, there was Director Keller from\nWaldenheim. Also I have an interesting thing to tell you about him. And Yelda fell to her\nknees and she said my sister, you don't have her number, something like that, and he\nlooked at me and he says I know you. You worked on four looms. You're coming along.\nThey needed more people for uh working on looms in another camp called Landeshutz\n(ph) and this is how I got out of Matzdorf and Yelda was on it too and we got loaded on a\ntruck and we went to Landeshutz which was the other, the sister camp. Yousee _if\nthey had crossbars behind the open Landeshutz to Matzdorf and one more \u2014__ and when\nwe got there, who would be there but Frau Keegler was in charge of that camp, so that\nwas like a homecoming. So this is how...I had one incident with Keller. He called me into\nhis office once and I just remember this most incredible thing. There was that hugh hugh\nroom or at least to me it seemed hugh with a single carpet and a desk on it and he sat\nalone at the desk and what struck me is that probably in a room of that size, fifty of us\nslept. You know, I think that...and he had a letter in his hand and he said to me you have\nsmuggled out a letter fromthe camp __. I said I never smuggled a letter. I said I have\nwritten some letters and and when I glanced over it I saw...I had an uncle in Turkey who\nwas in the textile business because, you know, most people from Beilitz were in the\ntextile, and my unc...and I gathered that he knew my uncle because it was a letter later on\nmy uncle told me he had written to him.",
        "A: My uncle had...when he found out in what camp I was, had written to my, to Keller about\nme because he had that thing in his...Keller looked at me and he asked me a number of\nquestions. Interesting thing was that apparently my uncle had sent a package and they\nencouraged me to write for more packages. The packages apparently contained chocolate\nand things which were not obtainable, which I never saw. They said the package must\nhave been ripped up but it looked in a very sturdy wooden box but I was only too happy\nto write to my uncle that I received the packages I was told in very good order because\napparently they wanted those things but this way I knew that my uncle was...I mean I\nknew my uncle was safe. He was in Turkey but that he knew where I was. Anyway\ngetting back to the thing...of course we came to Landeshutz which like heaven by\ncomparison with Matzdorf. Uh only in Landeshutz we then faced an...another difficulty.\nAnd that difficulty was that we worked the night shift only. So you know, we didn't see\nany light of day except, you know, uh if you got up during the day you you could and we\nworked there from probably a year or maybe even longer, on the night shift, but you\nknow Frau Keegler was there. Things got worse there because there was very little food\nbut uh she she went on in the same vein that she was before, you know.",
        "A: Uh for instance, you know, if somebody was ill, if somebody got ill, you know, there\nwere not the things which happened in other camps, sent to Auschwitz or beatings or\nthings like that. Uh you got some sort of care or understanding or it was...things were\ncovered for you a bit, you know, as far as work was concerned. Uh she tried to to get\nvegetables. I don't know what rations there were, you know, but it it whatever was so-\ncalled coming to us and believe me things were uh laughable but we got it. Uh I\nremember when this one thing that I always tell young people. Uh you know they knew\nof the Jewish holidays and there was one Yom Kippur when they marched us out and told\nus about the holidays and told uh that if anybody would be foolish enough to fast that that\nwould be construed as sabotage and sabotage was punishable by death, and everybody\nfasted and uh we were given noodles and sugar and nobody touched it and I think you\nknow those are the things that I think future generations should know and to me this\nwas...and I remember then that night when we got our miserable smelling vegetables or\nwhatever it was, there was such a feeling of sanctity, I think almost holiness, you know,\nand they really jumped. She tried to to see that we you know if if we didn't...everybody\nworked with uh uh you know al...almost with with such fervor and things that we couldn't\nfalter. And I think that without such a oneness, such a...I saw so much nobility of spirit in\nthe camps which somehow I wish would be better recorded, you know, when people\nreached out, you know...somebody had a birthday so uh we would uh save...on Sunday\nwe had margarine, a little margarine on the bread, so you know you would cut off some\nof the bread and scrape the margarine and and give it to the person on the bread that she\nwould have a lot of margarine on on her piece of bread. On Hanukkah, we knew it was\nHanukkah and that was still under Mrs. Keegler, and she was busy\ncelebrating... Hanukkah and Christmas are together...you know, and she closed an eye to\nthat sort of thing. We uh made a menorah (ph) out of potatoes and uh of course we knew\nthat you know we couldn't light | but we made a menorah out of potatoes and I I still\nhave the things which I wrote about the story about Hanukkah which we sang. I would\nlike to translate it and give it to you. I had a wondet...if I may skip for one minute just to\nmake a happier thing...when I went to Israel for the first time in 1961 I my friends\nsurprised me. I knew of three that were in Israel but actually ten showed up and I was the\neleventh, and they got out of the elevator in Tel Aviv, singing a song which we had\nwritten for the first Hanukkah in camp, and we carried the menorah which I naturally\nhave now, a beautiful old silver menorah that they give me in memory of the menorah\nwhich we made out of the potatoes, and you know when you made it out of potatoes it\nmeant you didn't eat that night because, you know, you didn't have potatoes. You can\nimagine what that menorah means when my husband kindles the lights and we see our\ngrandchild reflected in that...it's truly . Uh so you know, that was possible under\nFrau Keegler and one of the things that we did was Yelda and I dressed as grandmothers\nand you know, under the looms which we worked there was sort of a white powdery\nsubstance. We put it on our hair to grey and uh and we had a performance between the\nbunks under one naked electric light and see the faces in the bunks, you know. What we\ndid is we started out with uh you know there were two grandmothers and everything, and\ncomes tothe \u2014\u2014 and_\u2014_\u2014_ says oh . That's how how it started out and then\nwe of course predicted a brilliant future for everyone and then our two granddaughters\ncame to listen to us. Strangely enough the person who played my granddaughter...her\nname is Hilda Steinhart Goldschmidt (ph). She lives in Israel. Her son was one of the\nheros of the Six Day War. Hilda never lived to have a grandchild and so the one who\nplayed her granddaughter did not survive and our granddaughters listened to our tale of\nthe past and uh I'll say it in German. The exit line on that was uh . Do\nyou understand German?",
        "A: Uh come and look. I'll show you my newest , you know, what the granddaughter\nSays... , OK. Then the , because old people uh exaggerate so much and\nthen we see them exiting. Now mind you we were eighteen years old at the time and we\nsay to each other, . Dear children, let us just say that uh humans\nendure more than they think they could. And I think somehow uh considering how how\nyoung we were, we must have touched the core of our existence, the hope that someday\nto live in a world where our children and grandchildren would live, but best of all to live\nin such a climate where they will not believe our tales of the past. And that was possible\nunder Frau Keegler. I mean she didn't exactly hear the performance, you know, and and\nwe would sing songs in which we would say, you know, would make probably sound like\na summer camp there you know for her ears and and then we would throw in a few things\nin Polish, you know, which were exactly not meant for her ears, but but by and large uh\nthat part in contrast of uh...of course you know we were fortunate, quote, unquote, that\nwe were taken early yet, you know, before Auschwitz was inits full \u2014_\u2014_\u2014s aspect of\nthe...because after that people didn't go to working camps anymore. OK. Briefly uh and\nfinally Landeshutz was liquidated and we went to the most miserable and bitter camp\ncalled Gruenberg (ph) in . Uh Gruenberg was an enormous camp. Uh its factory\nwas one of the most beautiful in Germany in as much that it boasted the most beautiful\ncollection of roses surrounding the factory. It was direct contradiction of the beauty the\n____ was in. Uh I don't remember his name now...we called him LaLouche (ph). I will\nhave to remember his name. That was the most brutal, sadistic uh...I don't know if he was\ndirector but he was one of the people there. He wore a signet ring on his hand and and he\nwould jump like a cat and beat his victim until blood showed, mostly beat the faces. He\nwould have sort of a glazed look on his face. I don't know if...I tried to suppress the\nfeeling...we called him Lalouche. He was a beast. Uh things changed very drastically\nthen. I still worked in uh for a very little time in the weaving factories, but pretty soon\nthey had very little raw material for that and I was moved into what was considered\nsentence of death...spin__...spinning. Uh we were spinning fabrics or rather threads\nwhich came from raw materials which...the raw material consisted of clothing which\ncame from Auschwitz. It came to a place called ._____ are hugh machines which\nsort of shred that. Uh it was not difficult to imagine that some of the clothes belonged to\nour parents. Uh I worked most of the time on the night shift there and I remember when\nwhenever the the horror of some of that became overwhelming, one or at least I played a\ngame. I perfected it. And that was to imagine my homecoming, with all the details being\nthere including the sort of things that we had long sold but it was the miracle of freedom\nwould always be there. In any event, the most dreaded thing on in Gruenberg was\nthat...I'm not quite sure now if it was every four or every six weeks...we would go to a\ndoctor's office to be x-rayed because tuberculous was rampant and whoever displayed\nanything was immediately sent to Auschwitz, so you had to leave some life, usually\nbetween four and six weeks...I don't remember now if it was four or six weeks. Uh there\nwas something there with those x-rays. I uh did a thing which I will always regret. Uh the\nlast day that I was with my brother, we had to go to the which was something that\nlike the Jewish Federation, you know, when he did his registering, and we uh next to it\nwas the ruins of the temple and we climbed over the debris and we sat there for a moment\nand one column of the eastern wall stood un...undisturbed and everything else was in ruin\nand Arthur picked up a little stone and he handed it to me and he said just look at that\ncolumn and always remember that our people will survive. And he give me the stone, and\nI made a little sack of it and I carried it on my neck, and when we went to to x-rays I took\nit off and I had it in my pocket and I don't know...it was later probably...I think it was on\nthe death march that I lost it. And that was the one thing that I would...you know, pictures\nsurvived because I had them in my boot, but I lost that piece of stone. Anyway, this was\nabout Gruenberg. Gruenberg was a miserable camp. There was a lot of people being sent\nto Auschwitz. And and then see we knew that things were going bad with the war\nbecause there were uh not bombings but we had uh sirens were blowing every so often\nand uh we had to stop working. There was no electricity, and they were going crazy\nbeing vicious. Everybody there was incredibly bad. They made us stand outside for for\nhours on appell, you know. And uh if a piece of bread flew over the fence, which it once\ndid, everybody was beaten and to say who who got it. I'm proud to say about our people\nthat nobody gave away the culprit. We all knew who it was, and I think that this is\nthat...you know, uh what has troubled me so much that I have read some of the accounts\nthat people say how cruel people were, how they stepped on each other, or they make it\nsound like it was like a snake pit that people __ for survival. Look, I don't know what\nhappened in other camps, and this is why, you know, I have always used my maiden\nname on everything that I have written . |! would say that people behaved in the\nmost incredible manner imaginable by and large. And I think that this would be\nsomething that cannot be emphasized enough. It was in Gruenberg that Yelda once found\na raspberry in the gutter on the way to the factory. She carried it in her pocket all day\nlong and presented it to me that night on a leaf which she plucked through the barbed\nwire, had washed it, and gave it to me as a present. I asked her to take a little bit of a bite\nand she wouldn't. One single raspberry. A total possession. She gave it to a friend. There\nwere other acts like that, many. They unfortunately are not recorded. And I think this is\nprobably the greatest tragedy of them all. The nobility and the love that was felt. Anyway\nwhen things got really bad, you know, you sort of knew when things are going bad for\nthe Germans, they're probably going to finish us. When things are going good for for\nthem or well for them I should say, uh they aren't going to let us go. I know we will\nforever be slave, you know. It sort of varies what is going to happen, and that became our\nobvious in January of 1945 where one day uh we knew...we were told we were not going\nto go to the factory any longer, to gather our meager belongings of whatever that was. Uh\nthe night between the 28th and 29th of January, with great commotion and suddenly the\ndoors opened. The camp, you know...we we were then about two thousand girls. An\nadditional transport of two thousand came from Auschwitz. They told us they had walked\nfor I don't know how long from Auschwitz and we were going to to go on a march the\nfollowing morning. Destination later on we heard Orianienberg. Orianienberg was a\nmurder camp also, small enough known near Berlin which fell into the hands of the\nAllies when General Eisenhower made his swift move on Berlin and we started to march\nnow to to...the death march, 29th of January. I remember I had a terrible cold. I was\ncoughing terribly. Uh we were told to assemble in four abreast. Was Yelda, Suzie and\nLeisle (ph). Leisle was probably the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. She sort of...she\nmoved like a deer, had hugh brown eyes, _. She and Suzie were were sort of like\nsisters as Yelda was and I, you know, but the four of us together. Lei...Leisle was from\nfrom Czechoslovakia and Suzie was from Czechoslovakia and Yelda and I from\nBeilitz and the four of us sort of formed friendships, you know. Leisle was the sort who\nlooked after me. I would say oh, it's raining today. Do you think I should wear my green\nraincoat? And she would say no, wear the navy blue one and have you been to the garden\nto pick up apples yet. I mean she would fall into any imaginary game and I remember\nthat morning very vividly. You know there's such scenes in Dr. Zhavigo (ph) when you\nsee this incredible uh almost like a wasteland of white...it was freshly covered snow. The\nsnow, it had snowed during the night and the whole thing in front of the camp in\neffect...1t was all all covered with snow and uh we were assembled and and they lifted\ntheir whips and forward, march. And I remember Yelda said to me, she said I don't know\nhow you're going to make it. We'll all make it. And I was coughing so hard and we\nstarted the first step and I remember taking that step and I remember saying to myself this\nis the last chapter. But you know, I never had any doubt that we'll make it. And Yelda\nwas to my left, Leisle next to me and Suzie on the extreme right. And I'm the only one\nleft. I think the march is documented in I'm sure many other stories. (Pause) It was\nunspeakable. I had my skiing boots. I was the best equipped because I had my boots.\nIt...(pause)...at first we still had a little bit to eat that we took along and hoarded. We\nmarched I don't know how many miles a day. We came to rest sometimes in in a barn. A\nlot of...we stopped ina camp called _ where blessedly a few of our girls escaped. I\ndidn't. Uh people were shot continuously. If somebody stepped out of line, then you\nwould see snow being red and there through the forest, beautifully covered with snow\nand birds chirped sometimes and uh we were marching. Everyday the number got smaller\nand then we came (sniffling) to a place called Flossenberg and in Flossenberg, Yelda was\nalready very sick. Leisle, Suzie and I were still going pretty strong. One time we had\nnothing to eat so we started eating snow which was a terrible thing to do because the\nmore you eat, the more thirsty you are. And of course then diarhhrea and all was rampant.\nUh when we left one morning, one time they uh put us outside. They would spray us with\nwater and then they would herd us, literally hundreds into a small ___ and everybody\nstarted to perspire, put us out again and pneumonia was just like that (snapping\nfingers)...people died like flies. Then one morning we were told, for example, we were\ngoing to leave there. I remember Yelda was frantic. She said that's going to be the end. I\ndon't want to leave. And I said if we are so much better off out in you know in the open.\nMaybe we'll have a better chance. And all of a sudden came in an incredible\nannouncement, that President Roosevelt died. Then I knew it was too late to run because\nyou know we reconstructed at the time was and jubilation broke out, that all the enemies\nof the Fuhrer will perish in such a manner. It was a horrible blow, horrible. But we found\nsomething that day which sort of compensated us a little for that. We found a wrapper of\nmargarine and there was still some little vestiges of margarine stuck to it, so we licked it\ndry. We thought we'll certainly get very strong. And things got very bad from then on.\nYelda was really very, very bad. And one night we slept in...we all used to sleep outside\nand uh it started to snow and sort of reminded me of the story, you know, there's little\nand went around that everybody don't sleep, get up, because if you fall\nasleep and it started snowing, you know, you'll never wake up. Some people said it's the\nbest thing we can do 1s fall asleep like that, and uh then one...we came to an orchard and\nbefore we came to that orchard sort of something incredible happened. Oh yes...one time\nbefore that, because I thought Yelda was so sick, I said to her well we heard, you\nknow...we saw a lot of people on the road already...1t was an evacuation and people were\non wagons sort of similar to when the war started, you know. And those people were\nrunning away from the front, and we heard somebody talking in a similar dialect, German\ndialect, that we had, so we concocted a whole sort of story, that we will run away in the\nnext thing, and we will say that we, you know, will take our and we would say\nthat we were with our mother on the on the wagon and we got lost, you know, and that\nwe are from Beilitz because we had a similar dialect and of course with names like Yelda\nand Gerda you know, it was...and we we really had a whole thing how we are going to do\nit and Leisle and and Suzie were doing something similar, and we said our father was in\nthe Wermarcht and in order to get the numbers if we felt you know , we used our\nhouse numbers and 1939 when the war...had to make it a long number that, you know, if\nthey asked, so they will see that we tell the truth. And we came into that little forest\nwhere we rested, and uh sort of took a signal to each other that we are going to stay there\nwhen they say everybody assembled. And suddenly Yelda looked up at me and she said\nI'm afraid. And I was going to say come on, you know...and I didn't. And when we got\nout of the forest, they rounded up fourteen girls, some of our best friends were in the\nforest and we saw them all being shot. Right then and there I decided no matter what\nhappens I'm never going to run away. I'll go to the end whatever the end is, but I'm not\ngoing to attempt to run away, you know, because we've had people already running and,\nyou know, and uh the Gestapo, the SS was not too much in charge and, you know, it\nwould be it would be OK, but we made a pact until then I said we're never going to run\naway. We were just saved by by her not, by her saying, you know, don't run. And we...it\nwas either that day or the next day...I don't remember, an incredible thing happened.\nPeople were running in the streets and threw bread at us. And so we had bread and that\nnight we rested in an orchard. It was again it was snow...it started to...it was spring\nalready. It was April and this was after President Roosevelt's uh death...1t was something\nlike maybe the third week in April. And uh I told Yelda to watch the bread, to hold on to\nit. She was really very funny, already at this point. And my very dear friend uh ___ ran\naway and she survived. She's in in Detroit. That's quite a story to tell you about her...how\nI found, how we found each other after the war. And uh what we didn't realize was that\nwe had crossed over to Czechoslovakia. And those were the Czech people who were\nthrowing bread and you see, if I would have known that I would have stayed because\nthey would have hidden us. We would not be, you know, because if you could make it\nand went to a barn or something, very possibly so the German farmers turned the girls\nover to be killed. But never in Czechoslovakia...the Czech people threw us things and\nthen there was a wagon and they threw something. It landed and it was an egg, and I was\nsure that that egg is going to make Yelda get well. Hadn't seen an egg in years and years.\nAnd Yelda didn't even feel like having it. And then one night we were again out in a\nmeadow...snowing or raining...and a very dear friend of mine...her name is |\nKeller...she lives in Israel...came by and she brought two potatoes. I don't know where\nshe found it. And I remember I devoured mine. I was so hungry and Yelda had the other\none and Yelda said I'm not hungry. I just couldn't believe it that she wasn't hungry. And\nshe said to me you eat it. And I said maybe she'll feel better later, so I kept it and said I'll\nhold it for you. (Pause) She said she was thirsty, and I went to try to get water for her,\nand an SS man came and kicked her and she said why. (Pause) And then I tried to catch\nsome water in my hand for her. (Pause) Then she said something incredible. She said I'm\nnot angry at anyone. I hope no one is angry at me. And then she said to me, you are going\nto survive. And she said if my parents survived, don't tell them how I died. (Pause)\n(Crying) And then she said something else. She said to me you have to promise me that\nyou are going to go on for one more week. A week was a very long time. And she said\npromise. And I said I'll try. When daylight broke, and I had...there were some, there were\nsome blossoms on the trees and I had gone earlier and I had gotten a blossom for her to\nsmell, and I showed her the blossom...it was all dead, probably from her fever, and when\nthe sun got up, it was over for her. And we were told to bury the dead of that night. I\ncouldn't do it. It's strange...I know she was buried because my friend told me under a tree.\nI remember the most minute details and places, names of cities and towns where we went\nthrough...I still and I cannot remember the name of the place where she died. I can't. And\nsometimes I wonder perhaps it is so that that every tree sort of reminds me of her. You\nknow, she's become over the years my my alterego, my \u2014_ with my childhood. And\nevery year on the 29th of April I sort of step back and did for me some incredible\nthings that happened on the 29th. In the past how many years, forty-eight years...no,\nforty-five, forty-five years. Forty-nine...from 1945. I didn't see Suzie and Leisle. I didn't\nknow where they were because by that point I couldn't walk very well myself and I don't\nknow now if it was a few days later, whatever, they really descended on us, and with\ntremendous vengeance, screaming it was all our fault because the Fuhrer is told...you\nknow, Hitler is dead. We felt if 1t was true then either they're going to kill us now or\nmaybe we will survive. It was uh we came to a place in Czechoslovakia...things were\nreally quite crazy, you know. A lot of people were on on the roads again and uh soldiers\nrunning away and but we were still with the group. We had one woman SS with us and a\ncouple of men. I don't know to to how few our group had uh...it diminished enormously\nfrom thousands to a handful, maybe a little over a hundred and I I think I was quite ill\nalready, you know, because...I know, I mean I was ill anyway and and terrible upset\nabout, you know, Yelda's death and uh one evening we came to rest...was a place...oh, a\nplace in Czechoslovakia. We were in Czechoslovakia at that point, of course. And and\nthat place was called which I only realized that later. Uh we were sort of\noutside. It was quite quiet suddenly and uh a truck came. We were going to go some\nplace and my friend...oh yeah, and one SS woman came and told Keller...the one\nwho's in Israel...to take off my boots. Apparently she wanted...she saw I had good boots.\nShe liked my skiing boots. And said to me, I'll come, I'll hide you, and she hid me\ninsome___, pretended, you know, there wasn't...she never took them off. And then\n_____ said to me, uh and a truck came and the truck was going to take us someplace. I\nhave no idea where. And she said you better get on that truck, so that she shouldn't see\nyou. And I suddenly said to her, you know, I really want to stay here. I don't know what\nbut I'm in no hurry, you know, whatever. And it sort of was a feeling that it is probably\ngoing to happen now. They're going to kill us and I uh it was sort of at that point quite\nwarm. After all the snow, you know, it was a balmy night and I thought to myself it's all\nover. I'm going to start thinking what it would be like for a night like that being home,\nbeing in the garden with my parents, so if they kill me that's the memory I want. And the\npeople, trucks came and some of our girls went on it. I didn't. We waited and waited and\nwaited but the truck did not come back and fortunately I heard that on that truck uh there\nwas one of the SS women who was pregnant apparently. I didn't know that. And uh I\ndon't know if they were shooting, and she was hurt and one of the SS men then turned\nand killed fourteen girls on that truck. Fourteen. No, I think it was fourteen before. You\nknow, it's funny how how you play with numbers...fourteen or was it twenty-five. I really\ndon't know but a goodly number of girls. And we stayed there and uh and they came back\nfor us and took us into sort of a barrack or a hole or something like that and they locked\nus up there. We heard a lot of commotion. There was uh shooting and there were planes\noverhead and everything, and then the story had it uh that they uh attached a time bomb.\nIt was strange...we just went my husband and I to a reunion of the 5th Division Medical\nCorps who were our liberators and they spoke about that bomb and how the __s was\nthere. I mean, you know, for a while we thought you know maybe they just threatened it\nwas a bomb or something but apparently that was so, and they barricaded the doors with\nchains and things and we, you know, we sort to moved. They told that we are going to be\nkilled and I think before that there was some shooting. I remember some shooting was\ngoing on like it was here and there. Nothing nothing happened...just a little skin, and uh\nyou know, at that point I must confess that I'm not absolutely clear. Must have been quite\nill already or or whatever but I remember sort of that night it was quite turbulent and I\nremember them curling up and sort of uh the SS left and they left their coats and things\nbehind and I sort of went and and tried to sleep there. A lot of people were very ill. We\nknew the Americans were coming. I saw two the night before, and then there was the\ncrazy night and in the morning I asked where...I asked Leisle...she was...this was the\nbiggest irony of them all. They were shooting from planes and Suzie was hit in the foot.\nNot Suzie, Leisle. And she was lying there on the straw and I asked her where Suzie was.\nIt was morning and she told me that Suzie went to find some water at the pump and I\nwent to look for her and there she was, lying in the mud and she was dead. And I didn't\nwant to go back to tell Leisle that. So I I went out. You see, I had seen...there were two\nAmericans the night before. I spoke to them sort of. But that that is very vague to me. But\nI remember all the things of that morning and that was after I had found Suzie and I\ncouldn't tell Leisle so I went outside and I stood sort of in the doorway. It was a brilliant\nmorning. Oh yes. I have to tell you that I saw that morning on a steeple of the church a\nhomemade white flag of peace. And I remember that was the first time I cried in many\nmany months. It was a strange thing that I remember that my tears...you know, it's funny\nbecause now I cry at the slightest provocation. I cry when I see a dog or cat or something\nlike that but didn't cry for many years. And uh and I was standing there and saw and all\nof a sudden I saw (pause) a strange car coming down the hill, no longer green, not\nbearing the swastika, but a white star. It was sort of a mud-splattered vehicle but I've\nnever seen a star brighter in my life and two men sort of jumped out, came running\ntowards us and one came toward where I stood. He was wearing battle gear. I have to\nthink...you know, his helmet was this mesh over that and he was wearing dark glasses\nand he spoke to me in German and he said, does anybody here speak German or English,\nand I said I speak German. And I felt that I could tell him we are Jewish and didn't know\nif you would know what the star means or anything, but you know and I uh I was a little\nafraid to tell him that but I said to him, we are Jewish, you know. And he didn't answer\nme for quite a while. And then his own voice sort of betrayed his own emotions and he\nsaid, so am I. I was...1t was the greatest hour of my life. And then he asked an incredible\nquestion. He said, may I see the other ladies? You know, was _____ we have been\naddressed for six years and then to hear this man. He looked to me like a young guard. I\nhave to tell you I weighted sixty-eight pounds. My hair was white. As you can imagine, I\nhadn't had a bath in years. And this creature asked for the other ladies. And I told him\nthat most of the girls were inside, you know. They were too ill to walk and he said won't\nyou come with me. And I said sure. I didn't know what he meant. He held the door open\nfor me and let me precede him and in that gesture he start me to feel ___\u2014_\u2014sand that young\nAmerican today is my husband. (Pause) And that's my story. (Pause) I was very ill after\nthat. They established a hospital. I was in the hospital for quite a while. I was told I was\ngoing to die. Leisle unfortunately died a few days later of the wounds that she sustained. I\nwas in the hospital for quite a long time. He told me...he asked me if he could do\nsomething for me, and I said if you could write to my uncle in Turkey and tell him I was\nalive and see if he had any news about my parents and my brother, and I didn't see him\nfor quite a long time. You see, the following day the war was over too, and how I found\nout about it when we went to the...they was making a hospital out of a school house and\nuh I remember the incredible things. As a matter of fact, as I just told you, we had a\nreunion with the Medical Corps of the Division...",
        "A: Yes, we were married a year later in France. My husband came back after being uh\ndischarged from the Army. He came back. We were married in Paris and I came with him\nto the United States. I landed here on the 30th of August, 1946. Came to Buffalo, New\nYork on the 13th of September. Have three children and eight grandchildren. Do I have\none minute to make one statement? I wrote in a preface of my first book something which\nis very dear to me. It goes like that. As I finished the last chapter of my book, I felt at\npeace at last. I have discharged a burden and paid a debt to many nameless heros resting\nin their unmarked graves. I'm haunted by the thought that I might be the only one left to\ntell their story. Happy in my new life, I've had the last sentence of my past. I've written\nmy story with tears and with love and in the hope that my children, safely asleep in their\ncribs, should not awaken from a nightmare and find it to be reality. I have just put my\nyoungest grandchild, three weeks old, to her crib. It is with this prayer in my heart for all\nchildren everywhere...I hope the world will remember all children.\nEND OF INTERVIEW\n"
