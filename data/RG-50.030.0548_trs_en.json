        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nJos\u00e9 Coltof, conducted by Ina Navazelskis on November 9\"\", 2008 in Alexandria,\nVirginia. Thank you very much for agreeing to talk to us today, Jos\u00e9. We really \u2014",
        "Answer: Jos\u00e9.",
        "Q: \u2014 appreciate it. Jos\u00e9, sorry. Let\u2019s start like we always do in these interviews, at\nthe beginning. Tell me about your \u2014 your family, tell me about where you were\nborn, the circumstances, your mother, father, brother, sisters.",
        "A: Okay. I come from a typical Dutch Jewish middle class family. My mother came\nfrom a family of five, she had two brothers, two sisters and parents, and everybody\nwas married. My father came from a family of three, he had two sisters. One was\nmarried and had six kids, and the other one never married. My father\u2019s sister with\nthe six kids had only one surviving child, my cousin, who was my only survivor\nother than my mother, that survived the war.",
        "Q: What were their names [indecipherable]",
        "A: Their names were \u2014 my mother\u2019s name \u2014 my mother\u2019s maid \u2014 my mother\u2019s name\nwas Hannah Feldman(ph), her maiden name was Feldman(ph), and my father\u2019s\nname was Marwitz(ph) Farp(ph). And my father dealt in animal hides, and my\nmother \u2014 my grandfather del \u2014 was a butcher, a ko \u2014 kosher butcher. And everybody\nlived in Amsterdam at the time, except my grandparents on my mother\u2019s side, they\nNovember 9, 2008\nmoved about 10 years before, to The Hague, for health reasons. My grandfather\nhad some respiratory problems and the doctor suggested that he should be near the\nsalt sea air, so they moved to the \u2014 The Hague. And the life was, you know, very\ntypical, like in the Dutch way. We were a religious family and life was good,\neverybody \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have a \u2014 brothers and sisters?",
        "A: My mother had \u2014 my parents married in 1929, and two years later my mother\nhad a child, a \u2014 a daughter, called Judith, who had some sort of a disease that they\ncouldn\u2019t treat at the time, at the \u2014 when she ate, sh-she vomited or she had diarrhea,\nand they couldn\u2019t stop it, and eventually, at age two, she died. So I never knew \u2014\n[coughing] \u2014 sorry.",
        "Q: That\u2019s all right, mm-hm.",
        "A: \u2014 another sibling. But sh \u2014 they did have another child. And then, I\u2019m the only\nchild.",
        "Q: Well, tell me a little bit \u2014 I mean, if you were born in 1942, as it says here on our\n\u2014 our questionnaire, tell me a little bit about the circumstances you heard of when\nthe war erupted. What happened with your parents?",
        "A: Okay, okay.",
        "Q: What happened before your birth?\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: Okay, okay. My mother, it\u2019s very ironic that she and I are the only ones that\nsurvived. When \u201cMein Kampf\u201d was written, my mother was very smart, and she\nsays, this guy is not fooling around. He\u2019s really gonna kill us all. We better get the\nhell out of here. And a lot of Dutch Jews had the misconception that Holland would\nstay neutral. And why was that? Because during World War I, Holland stayed\nneutral. And they figured \u2014 so they said, well, even if, you know, the war breaks\nout, we\u2019ll just stay neutral in Holland and we have nothing to worry about. And my\nmother was very smart and she says, we may want to stay neutral, but Hitler won\u2019t\nlet us. And she made everybody crazy, said, let\u2019s get out, we have to get out of here.\nIf we \u2014 th \u2014 it\u2019s not good, we must leave Europe. She was obsessed with leaving\nEurope and going to America. And nobody wanted to listen to her, because in\nHolland, like I said, they \u2014 they all thought nothing was gonna happen there. And\nthere were other people like my mother. My \u2014 as a matter of fact, after I got\nmarried, my father-in-law \u2014 my \u2014 my husband\u2019s grandfather was the same thing, he\nalso saw it come. And it got to the point that people didn\u2019t invite him any more,\nbecause they didn\u2019t want to hear this doomsaying, and 1 \u2014 this \u2014 they didn\u2019t want to\nget depressed, and they said he\u2019s crazy. And that\u2019s how a lot of people felt. My\nwhole family could have been saved, because my mother had a brother whose wife\nNovember 9, 2008\nhad a sister in England, in London, married to a famous hazan there, and she\nwould have \u2014",
        "Q: Can you tell me what that is, hazan?",
        "A: A cantor.",
        "Q: A cousin? A cantor.",
        "A: A cantor, a cantor.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, mm-hm.",
        "A: And she would have happily you \u2014 you know, let everybody come. But they just\ndidn\u2019t see it, they just thought that everybody that said, let\u2019s get out, let\u2019s get out,\nlet\u2019s go crazy. So finally my mother said, okay, if nobody will listen to me, [Il try\nto get papers on my own, and I\u2019Il leave on my own. And she went, as she told me,\nshe went already to the American consulate and started to get things going a little\nbit. But of course, then the war broke out and she got stuck like everybody else.",
        "Q: And the war broke out when?",
        "A: The war broke out May \u2014 I believe it was May 10 \u2014 in May, was May 10\" or\nMay 15\". Broke out in May 1940, in Holland.",
        "Q: Okay.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: And she got stuck. So then I was born, and even already before I was born, in\nbeginning of 1942, things started to get \u2014 the very first year or so, things weren\u2019t so\nbad yet.",
        "Q: Can I ask a few questions about that?",
        "A: Yeah, sure. Of course.",
        "Q: Were you born in your family\u2019s home?",
        "A: No, I was born in the CIZ, it was called. Th-The Central Israeli Ziekenhuis. It\nwas th-the Jewish hospital in Amsterdam.",
        "Q: Okay. But your parents still lived in their own home?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did they still have \u2014",
        "A: They had an apartment, and they lived in their apartment, yes. And then what\nthey did is, the men were called up to so-called work camp, and the Dutch are very\ngullible, and they said, well maybe if we do as we\u2019re told, it won\u2019t so bad if we \u2014\nyou know, don\u2019t try to get away with something. And my mother again was smart,\nand she says \u2014 my father was \u2014 I was born in March 4, 1942, and they started to call\nup the men, and my father\u2019s call-up came and my mother said, let\u2019s go into hiding.\nBeing that my father was dealing in animal hides, he knew every farmer in town,\nNovember 9, 2008\nand he was apparently a very nice man. And somebody would have gladly put him\nup. No, no, no, I\u2019ll go, Pll go. And \u2014",
        "Q: This was in Amsterdam?",
        "A: This was in Amsterdam. And he never went into hiding. Then, when I was four\nmonths old, my father left. They \u2014 people had to go to the train station and at s \u2014 at\nthe platform of the train station, my mother said, I beg of you, don\u2019t go. Come \u2014\ncome with me, come, let\u2019s go into hiding. He went. That was the last time she ever\nsaw him.",
        "Q: And you never knew him?",
        "A: Of course not, of course \u2014 I was four months old. So then what happened, she\nwent home to the apartment. And one night, not long after my father had left,\nmaybe a couple of days later, whatever, the Nazis came, you know, they came and\ndid house searches to take people out. And she went upstairs to the bedroom and\nshe put the covers under her head. [tape break]",
        "Q: All right. Okay, sh \u2014 covers were over her head.",
        "A: So, the covers were over her head, and it\u2019s like a miracle, I was a four month old\nbaby, most of the time babies cry, right? I don\u2019t know, instincts, I didn't cry. And it\nwas dark, and my mother describes they \u2014 they had flashlights and they went over\nthe \u2014 with the flashlight and said \u2014 and then one said to his partner, said, ah, there\u2019s\nNovember 9, 2008\nnothing here, let\u2019s get out. At that point my mother said, this is getting a little bit too\nhot, we better go into hiding. So my mother had an address. Her sister worked in a\nbakery.",
        "Q: Did your mother, by the way, was she a homemaker, or wi \u2014 did she also have a\njob someplace?",
        "A: No. No, no, she was a typical \u2014",
        "Q: Homemaker.",
        "A: \u2014 [indecipherable] homemaker, yeah. And her sister worked in this bakery. And\none of her customers said to her once, if you ever need a place to hide, or any of\nyour family, this is our address. And sh-she gave her the [indecipherable] to my\nmother, so my mother had that address. And after this little incident, she went over\nthere.",
        "Q: Can I st \u2014 interrupt again for a second?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: By this point, was the rest of the family still not believing the danger that was\ngoing on? I mean, I \u2014 I take it that what you are telling me now is a retelling as your\nmother explained it to you, what happened.",
        "A: Right. Of course, of course.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "Q: And \u2014 and while one could be incredulous and not believe it when \u201cMein\nKampf\u201d comes out in 1920 \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 in the 1920s, by the time you\u2019re rolling around and it\u2019s 1940 and people are\nbeing taken away and there\u2019s searches, then that could change a few minds. What\nwas that like? I mean, did she ever talk about that?",
        "Q: By \u2014 by then you couldn\u2019t get out, unless you had li \u2014 you had a lot of money\nand a lot of connections. By the time people realized, yeah, that maybe she was\nright, you tried to get out, 1t was almost impossible. You had to, as I said, lots of\nmoney and lots of connections, and lots of luck.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: My in-laws got out, I can tell you about that later, that\u2019s nothing to do with me\nparticularly, but they did get out in 1940, four months after the invasion. But by the\ntime the people realized, 1t was too late, it real \u2014 really was too late.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: There was nothing you could do.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. So let\u2019s go back, she has this address \u2014",
        "A: So, she has this address, and she goes to this family, and they let her in, and\nAmsterdam was the more Protestant family. The sou-southern part of Holland was\nNovember 9, 2008\nmore Catholic, bordering Belgium. The northern part in Amsterdam was more\nProtestant, but there were also Catholic families, they just tended to have bigger\nfamilies, I guess they didn\u2019t believe in birth control or whatever, they just tended to\nhave bigger families. And that particular family also they had a bunch of daughters.\nThere was about six kid \u2014 five, six kids in the family, seven, whatever, I don\u2019t know\nexactly. And so my mother was 35 at that point, and they had a bunch of daughters\nall in their 30s, so my mother could blend in. My mother also did not look Jewish at\nall. My mother could easily have blended in. Some of the Catholics looked more\nJewish than she did, so \u2014 she was a little woman, she was slight, and she did no \u2014\nmy friend here to see \u2014 no, Mama, no, didn\u2019t look Jewish at all. So, she blended in.\nSo they let her in, and while she was there, not very long, they said look, Annie,\nthey\u2019re \u2014 she went by the name Annie \u2014 they said Annie, you know, we \u2014 we want\nyou to stay and you\u2019re welcome to stay with us, but you have to find a place for the\nchild, because our neighbors know that none of my daughters were pregnant, and\nwhen all of a sudden a baby cries, and a baby appeared, they know that something 1s\nup, and the baby will give us all away. And my mother realized, of course, they\nwere right, and she certainly didn\u2019t want to jeopardize their life and her life and my\nlife, so she set about finding a place for me. And she really didn\u2019t have a place. But\napparently, from what she told me, there was an org \u2014 an underground organization\nNovember 9, 2008\nconsisting of doctors, nurses and medical students. And if you needed a place for a\nchild, you could go there, and they would place the child.",
        "Q: But she didn't know them personally? She didn\u2019t know the [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, no, no, she just went to that organi \u2014 it was an underground organization,\nlike, you know, like anything. So, my mother went there and she said, I have a four\nmonths old that needs to be placed, do you have a spot for her? And they said, okay,\non such and such a day, a couple will appear, and they will take your child away;\nthey will take your child into hiding. And they tried to match up the couples with\nthe ages. Like, if there was a teenager, they wouldn\u2019t give it a couple in their early\n20s, that would look out of place, you didn\u2019t want to walk \u2014 so, like I was four\nmonths old, so they gave me to a couple in their 20s. And my mother did, and \u2014",
        "Q: Must have been a tough day for her.",
        "A: And, as she describes, she packed my things, and she put a few special things in\nthere, like a \u2014 what do you call that thing?",
        "Q: A rattle?",
        "A: A rattle. A special rattle and some other things. And I had a little birthmark on\nmy thigh, I think, but I don\u2019t have it any more, but I had that. And she figured if\nwhen the war is over, and she didn\u2019t \u2014 nobody knew when it would be over, and a\nfour months old, after a year you don\u2019t recognize your own child, she would ask for\nNovember 9, 2008\nthe things, at least she would be able to identify her own child. Which, by the way,\nis exactly what happened. And \u2014",
        "Q: Smart lady.",
        "A: \u2014I can just imagine my poor mother, two strangers come to the door, and she\nhanded me to two strangers, not knowing if she would ever see me again. In the\nbeginning of the war from ol \u2014 this is all what she told me, they would tell the\nparents where they took the children. The Nazis soon found out about that, and they\nwould get the parents and torture them long enough that it would give away the\naddress of the children. By the time I was hidden, my mother wasn\u2019t told anything.\nThey wouldn\u2019t tell me wha \u2014 what ci-ci \u2014 what city I went to, who I went to, where,\nshe knew nothing, just handed me, and that was it. I was extraordinarily fortunate.\nWhy? Because I came to a childless couple who were absolutely fantastic to me,\nwho loved me dearly, who did everything and anything in their power to make\nthings bearable...",
        "Q: We were talking about your foster parents.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and your luck.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: As I said, they were very \u2014 they were a childless couple, extraordinarily nice to\nme, and what was my luck? Number one that they were childless. In a way that was\nvery lucky because they put all their love and \u2014 you know, devotion to me.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: And for some reason, I stayed with them the whole war. They \u2014 I guess we\nclicked.",
        "Q: So your earliest real memories would be of them.",
        "A: Of course. So, but \u2014 well, why I say I was lucky, because I have many friends\nthat were 1n hiding, and they were bounced from place to place to place. And that\nwas a terrible th-thing. Every time you were attached to something, you know, they\n\u2014 they had to leave again, for a variety of reasons. That\u2019s why I consider myself\nlucky that they were good people. They treated me like their own. Their extended\nfamily were very good. My foster mother had a brother, a-and a s \u2014 a sister and\nmother-in-law that lived in town, and their children, they were good to me. Her\nparents lived in town. They were all very good to me. And ber \u2014 being a very good\n[indecipherable] I mean, the neighborhood \u2014 I was wa \u2014 hidden in a town called\nUtrecht.",
        "Q: Oh yeah.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: And I was hidden in an area called rivier er buurt, which means the river \u2014 the\nriver neighborhood. Why? Because a lot of the streets were named after rivers. And\napparently there were a lot of Jewish children hidden in that neighborhood. So \u2014\nand the underground knew about that. So, when they staged a raids, most of the\ntime, the underground had enough time to ring the doorbell and said, get the kids\nout of here, a raid is coming. And guess where they took me? To her parents, to her\nsister and brother-in-law and their children. So not only did they \u2014",
        "Q: Also in Utrecht?",
        "A: All na \u2014 all in Utrecht, yes. So, not only did they themselves risk their life, her\nparents, her sister and brother-in-law, their children. I mean, it\u2019s unbelievable, and\nthey were all good to me, I have the fondest of memories. I was playing with their\nchildren \u2014",
        "Q: I'd like to ask you about your earliest memories, then. Now we\u2019re at a point of\nyour story where it\u2019s no longer as it was told to you \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 but where you start \u2014",
        "A: lre\u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 remembering things. Can you tell me, what are those things you remember?\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: Probably I remember being with them, being with my foster parents. I remember\nthem \u2014",
        "Q: Did you call them Mommy and Poppy?",
        "A: Of course, of course.",
        "Q: So they were your Mommy and Poppy.",
        "A: Oh, there\u2019s no question. And her parents were Oma and Opa and \u2014 and her\nsister and brother-in-law were, you know, Ome and Tante, aunt and uncle, of\ncourse, of course. And they were my cousins, no question. Of course, it was lucky\nfor their part also that I was a baby when I came there. A child that comes at a year\nor two had a recollection of their parents, can give it all away by saying something\nwrong. I didn\u2019t know anything but them, so I could never speak out of tur-turn, I\ncould never say anything wrong, because all I knew was them. I remember going to\nlook for food. They would go out of town to the farms, I think \u2014 and buy some f \u2014\nget some food. And I remember they went on like a \u2014 a car, a flat car with big\nwheels, and somebody would pull it. And it was like \u2014 like a hay \u2014 like today kids\nwould go on a hayride, and it was kind of \u2014 of an adventure for a child. And they\ntold me we\u2019re gonna look for food. I remember those things very clearly. We went,\nyou know, as often as we could, whatever they could get. I remember whenever I\nwent outside, if you look at me, brown eyes and brown hair \u2014 brown hair, and as a\nNovember 9, 2008\nchild too, I was, for Holland, a very Jewish looking child. And whenever we went\noutside, I was told to look down so that my eyes couldn\u2019t be seen, and I always got\na kerchief or a hat on my head so my brown hair wouldn\u2019t show. And I remember\nthat. Yoka(ph), I was called Yoka(ph), we all had a name, they gave us a name.",
        "Q: And what was your name?",
        "A: My name was \u2014 th-they called me Yoka(ph).",
        "Q: Yoka(ph).",
        "A: Yoka(ph), yeah.",
        "Q: Is that a nickname or a full, normal name?",
        "A: No, they gave me that name, I mean \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 every child got an \u2014 got a ha \u2014 a hiding name.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Especially if they have Jewish sounding \u2014 Jos\u00e9 is not particularly Jewish\nsounding name, but every \u2014 they \u2014 they identifal \u2014 you know, they \u2014 they give the\nname.",
        "Q: Yes.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: Iremember them very fondly. (Oh, sorry.) I remember very fondly them sitting\nin Holland \u2014 you know, you had no central heating, you had like a \u2014 a st \u2014 what do\nyou c \u2014 pot belly stove \u2014",
        "Q: A little stove, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 you know. And we would sit around it and they would sing songs to me at\nnight. And, now you shouldn\u2019t think there was anything in that potbelly stove, they\nhad nothing to heat it with, but just the illusion, you think you sit in front of the\nstove, you feel warm.",
        "Q: It\u2019s warm, yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s warm. And I remember the singing their songs to me.",
        "Q: What were their names?",
        "A: Turner Hefferness(ph). And the beauty of this, why I tell you this in particular,\nafter I moved to America and I got married, I had them come. And when my\ndaughter was si \u2014 what \u2014 how old was she? She was four, my son was six,\nsomething like that, was the last time they were here together, they would sit with\nmy daughter on their lap and sing the same songs they sang to me. So life really\ncame full cycle. I remember that, I remember being taken to her parents, to my f \u2014 f\n\u2014I don\u2019t know, to my foster mother\u2019s parents, playing with the children. I have\npictures of my playing in the yard with them, I remember the \u2014 the \u2014 the house. All\nNovember 9, 2008\nthose things I do remember. I guess when you live \u2014 and it was very clear that we\nwere living under very bad circumstances. I mean, the na \u2014 the word Nazis was \u2014\nwas used, and \u2014",
        "Q: It was something you remember being \u2014 hearing, like \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 like the Nazi is a boogeyman.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You remember it very well, that outside the house there was danger. And of\ncourse, there were also a number of close calls. Like I told you before, then the na \u2014\nth-the underground would come when they knew they were staging a raid. A few\ntimes \u2014 this is all they told me, this I don\u2019t remember, of course. One time they had\nno time to get me out, so they had to do a little quick thinking and my foster father\ndecided he was going to lay in bed and say he was sick, and they would put me on\nthe foot end of the bed, and he made believe he was laying with his feet up on the\npillow, and I was put in the foot end. And they really came in looking at the house,\nand they didn\u2019t see a child, and they left again.",
        "Q: That was a very close call.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: [indecipherable] a close call, I could have coughed, cried. I was, you know, by\nthat time where I could have been a year old, I don\u2019t know how old I was, I didn\u2019t\nask him how old I was at that point. But it\u2019s like a child senses fear, and those went\nto, you know, do what\u2019s right, I don\u2019t know. Another close call was my foster\nmother\u2019s mother [indecipherable] that they took me to her too sometime. Came for\na visit one day, and she \u2014 the underground came and told them, you have 10\nminutes to get out, they\u2019re very close, get the children out. So she said to my foster\nmother, Ill take her home, just \u2014 and she says, and give me her dirty laundry, go to\nthe laundry. And my foster mother says, why? She says, just \u2014 I just have a hunch,\ndo me a favor, you never know where they\u2019re looking. Because babies clothes\nmeant evidence. So, to satisfy her mother, okay, here\u2019s the dirty laundry. And off\nwe went. They came, is a child here? No, no child, they went looking through the\nhouse, no child. Can I see your dirty laundry, please? If 1t wasn\u2019t for her instinct I\nprobably wouldn\u2019t be sitting here talking to you. Those are the things that\nhappened. You always have to go by your guts.",
        "Q: Yeah, it\u2019s amazing what that instinct can tell people.",
        "A: Always go by your guts.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Always.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "Q: So, aside from \u2014 aside from that memory of going out to the fields in the \u2014 you\nknow, in that hay, in th \u2014 1n that sort of like cart that someone is pushing, what are\nsome of the other memories that you have of them, of the larger family, of your first\nyears.",
        "A: Getting together. I remember going to church, my first religious experience was\nnot in a synagogue, was in church.",
        "Q: Was it a Catholic church, did you \u2014 or was it a Protestant \u2014",
        "A: No, they were Protestant.",
        "Q: They were Protestant.",
        "A: They were Protestant, they were Protestant. It was very important to know that\nnot only were they Protestant, they were very devout Protestant, they were very\nreligious. And the reason they took me was their Christian duty. They felt it was\ntheir Christian duty. Somewhere in the back of their minds, they also figured, well,\nif they don\u2019t come back, they\u2019Il have another Christian child. That was in the back\nof all their mind. Doesn\u2019t bal \u2014 bother me, because you know, what they did was\ngood, the rest doesn\u2019t really matter. But it was definitely \u2014 I don\u2019t know if they were\nnot such devout Christians that they would have done it. They felt 1t was their\nChristian duty to save a \u2014 to save a Jewish child. It was that motivation.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about the church they would take you to? Any kind\nof thoughts, or \u2014",
        "A: No, no, I just remember walking in \u2014 1n a building, 1t was a church and of course\nwhen you\u2019re a young child everything seems very big.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And there was a children\u2019s choir and towards the end of the war I remember\nsinging in it. They \u2014 the little \u2014 there were little kids singing a song. That was my\nfirst, you know, recollection.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Let\u2019s go forward then. I mean, if those are the memories that you have,\nyou're sitting around a potbelly stove, or you\u2019re \u2014 or you\u2019re 1n the choir, or you\u2019re\ngoing out to the \u2014 to the fields \u2014",
        "A: And walking around after dinner, we would take a \u2014 take a walk, usually, if the\nweather permitted. Holland doesn\u2019t have such great weather always, but \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. So, when did \u2014 when did things change? What happened?",
        "A: Interesting you should ask that. For us hidden children, the worst was not during\nthe war. Believe it or not, the worst was after the war was over. Because specially\nthose of us that were born during the war were so young and were given as babies,\nwe didn\u2019t know our families. All we knew is what we knew. These are our parents,\nthis is our family. And one day, I came home \u2014 like I said, we \u2014 I would take a walk\nNovember 9, 2008\nafter dinner with my father, the war was over, and something amazing happened.\nThe war was over and my mother, of course, went to look for survivors, first looked\nfor her child. And that same organization where she went to place me, she went to\nto find me. And she stated her name and the name of her child. And they produced a\nneat, nice, little list, and they said, oh your child is there, and there in that address\n[indecipherable] Utrecht. And I often think to myself, if the Nazis would have\nfound those lists, again I wouldn\u2019t be sitting talking to you. But they were so\norganized, they could tell her immediately where I was. So, she couldn\u2019t get to me\nright away, because there was no transportation of any kind in \u2014 you had to have, I\nguess, some money, I don\u2019t know what. But, after about a couple of month, the next\nmonth or so, or two months, she came for a visit, she came to see me. And I\nremember going for my evening constitutional with my foster father, and we come\nhome, and in the kitchen on a four prong stool \u2014 I\u2019ll \u2014 never in my life do I look at a\nfour prong stool and not associate that \u2014 there\u2019s a lady sitting. And I was raised to\nbe a polite little girl, and I s-stretched my hand out, and I want to shake her hand.\nAnd I said, good evening lady. And just like I\u2019m sitting here talking to you, she\nsays, you don\u2019t have to call me lady. You can call me Mommy. I am your mother,\nthese are not your parents. When you\u2019re a three year old, your life as you know it at\nthat point falls apart. So, like I said, I had kind of a secure little world with people\nNovember 9, 2008\nthat I loved and loved me, and there comes this strange lady, and telling me she\u2019s\nnot my mother. What is a three year old supposed to think about that?",
        "Q: It\u2019s terrifying.",
        "A: They weren\u2019t psychologically very astute in those days. This 1s not the way you\ntell a child, you know, her whereabouts. And life after that was, for us children,\nvery traumatic.",
        "Q: Well, tell me how it was for you. What happened to you?",
        "A: M-My mother came for the visit, she stayed a little bit and she went home. And\nthen she would come to visit. And after she got away from her foster family and\nestablished herself in the apartment, which was \u2014 the Jews in those days didn\u2019t\ninvest their money in stocks and bonds and mutual funds, there was no thing in\nthose days. And the stock market they didn\u2019t trust, so if you had a little money, you\nbought a house, you bought real estate. And those typical European houses, you\nknow, were three, four story homes. So everybody had real estate. So one house,\ntwo house, 10 house, whatever it was.",
        "Q: Smart.",
        "A: And my grandfather had a home in amster \u2014 you know, several houses in\nAmsterdam, and what my mother did is first after she looked to establish herself,\nshe went into one of her house of her father and took an apartment and went to live\nNovember 9, 2008\nthere. So after she came to visit a few times here and there, she took me for a few\ndays to stay with her. Now, also, you have to understand something else. They\ndidn't give me up willingly. My fa \u2014 foster father and mother made a pact that if the\nwar is over and one of my parents would survive or both, they would give me back\nto parents, but to nobody else. So if, for instance, my mother would not have\nsurvived, and my father did not survive, and an aunt or an uncle or a grandparent\nwould come back, they weren\u2019t going to return me. And they had the law of the\nland with them, because the Dutch decided that it was in the best interest of the\nchildren not to be uprooted. S \u2014 and a lot of parents had big problems getting their\nchildren back. And they didn\u2019t give me willingly. They tried to convince my mother\nthat maybe it was better I should stay with them. Now, I can \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m sorry to interrupt here, but do you remember any of\nyour response after that first time when she came and she said, they\u2019re not your\nparents, I am your mother? Did you cry, did you ask about it when she left, did you\n\u2014do you remember anything of \u2014",
        "A: I was so dumbfounded, I don\u2019t think I cried. I \u2014 I must have just stood there, not\nknowing what to think. What do you think? What do you mean this is not my\nmother? A child doesn\u2019t understand \u2014",
        "Q: Of course not.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: \u2014 the reproductive system.",
        "A: Of course not.",
        "A: When somebody says call me mommy, you\u2019re mommy. And they were good to\nme, I had no reason to doubt that they were my parents.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: They couldn\u2019t be better if they tried, they were wonderful people. It\u2019s \u2014 all of a\nsudden the \u2014 I mean, I was just so stunned and dumbfounded, but you sure don\u2019t\nknow what to think any more.",
        "Q: Did you think you \u2014 do you think you changed in who you were and how you\nacted? Do you think \u2014 did they ever tell you, your foster parents, that they saw a\nchange in you?",
        "A: No, no, because I think they were all trying to pull their own weight. My mother,\nyes she had lost her whole family, which by the way, she didn't know yet at that\npoint, because people didn\u2019t know until a few years after if people had survived the\nwar. It wasn\u2019t the computer age, and the Red Cross gave you the information. And\npeople went for years after to look at lists at the Red Cross to see if anybody had\nsurvived. So my mother was not aware that everybody had been killed. She didn\u2019t\nknow yet. But I can imagine, after her own source, and her own \u2014 you know, it\nwasn\u2019t easy for her to be in hiding either, and then you find your child and your\nNovember 9, 2008\nchild is a stranger to you and the child doesn\u2019t want you, and my mother didn't even\nknow right away that it was right, and she asked to see that rattle, and if you\nremember in the beginning I told you she packed some things. She asked to see if\nthey had the suitcase that she packed for me. And sure enough they produced it, and\nshe looked to see if I had the birthmark on my thigh and there it was. I don\u2019t have it\nany more, but it was, I guess, a sign from God to show me who I was. And I can\nimagine how terrible for my mother. I mean, she would \u2014 the children that were\nolder, that were reunited with their parent, they run to their parent, Mommy,\nMommy. I didn\u2019t run to my mother, I didn\u2019t want to go to her. On the other hand I\nalso understand my foster parents, who knew when they took me, it wasn\u2019t an\nadoption. It was \u2014 I was given there for safekeeping. They knew that they weren\u2019t\nsupposed to keep me. But I can also understand, I have children and a grandchild\nmyself, you get attached to a child, especially when you shelter a child against such\nhorror. You don\u2019t want to give the \u2014 I understand their point too, as an adult. As a\nchild, I didn\u2019t, of course. So I remember it was very tense between my foster\nparents, especially my foster father and my mother. It wasn\u2019t an easy relationship.\nAnd my mother would have liked nothing better than I would have said to her, oh, I\ndon\u2019t want nothing to do with these people, I only want to be with you. And I didn\u2019t\ndo that. I loved these people dearly, and I\u2019ve loved them til the end of their days,\nNovember 9, 2008\nand I had them come here to America and they met my husband and my children.\nAnd, you know, I did whatever I could to them.",
        "Q: It is \u2014",
        "A: It is just such a sad \u2014 I mean \u2014",
        "Q: It is tragic, and 1t \u2014 and requires such a sacrifice. You know, as I hear you speak\nand \u2014 and \u2014 and point out, you know, the heartbreak on all of the sides \u2014",
        "A: All of the sides \u2014",
        "Q: All of the sides.",
        "A: \u2014I mean, it is so unfair, I mean, I can understand it was terrible. It wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen as bad for my foster parents, even though they were very attached to me, of\ncourse, to give me up, had they had their own children. I guess that made also a bit\nof a difference. But they didn\u2019t. And many years after the war they told me, no\nmatter how bad the war was, having me were the best years of their life.",
        "Q: Oh, how wonderful.",
        "A: Yeah, imagine that.",
        "Q: How wonderful.",
        "A: And I was an adult, I was living in America already. I have a \u2014 that\u2019s what they\nsaid to me.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "Q: But you know, there\u2019s also something else that \u2014 in what you say that in many\nways it\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s a great deal of joy in this. We\u2019re talking this weekend with a lot\nof people who are child survivors, who were hidden, and one of the themes that\ncomes through in many stories, and a sadness that just doesn\u2019t go away, 1s the\nabandonment. Children were abandoned because they had to be, because the parents\nwanted them to find some way of surviving. And then, after the war, sometimes\nthere were relatives who were never interested in picking up those abandoned\nchildren. And in your case, what you have 1s the opposite of that, 1s that everybody\nwanted you.",
        "A: That, yes.",
        "Q: And then \u2014 and when you think developmentally, what a child needs, every\nsingle one, a chi \u2014",
        "A: Is to be wanted.",
        "Q: Is to be wanted.",
        "A: That, yes.",
        "Q: And the foundation that that gives \u2014",
        "A: That yes, that yes, that yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 for a future life.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: But it was very hard for me. I mean, I couldn\u2019t understand why \u2014 my mother was\nvery grateful to them, but you wouldn\u2019t know it in the way she expressed it. Like \u2014\nlike I said, there was a jealousy. And I belong to a child survivor group and when\nwe sat around and talking about it, most of us that were babies that were born, you\nknow, during the war, they all have the same experience. The \u2014 the parents really\nwould have liked the children to be estranged from the foster parents. But we kids,\nwe wouldn\u2019t let. We really \u2014 I \u2014 it\u2019s probably a sign of strength on our part, as little\nas we were, I wouldn\u2019t let my mother not have contact with them. She would have\nloved it if I would have said, you know what? You\u2019re my mother now, I don\u2019t need\nthem any more. Oh no, I wouldn\u2019t let them do that. I wouldn\u2019t let them do that at\nall.",
        "Q: So, do you remember the \u2014 do you remember the day that you no longer lived\nwith them?",
        "A: No. No, I \u2014 I\u2014I think I probably blocked it out, it must have been so traumatic\nfor me to leave them, that I probably totally blocked it. Like there\u2019s certain things\nyou block out, and I must have blocked that out. I don\u2019t remember the day.",
        "Q: So, do you remember \u2014 do you remember how you felt to your mother, your real\nmother in the beginning, and how that grew and cha \u2014",
        "A: I resented her.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I resented her for taking me away from them, and it was very difficult to be with\nmy mother. She loved me, but she didn\u2019t express it in a way that I express my love\nfor my children. She didn't pick me up and hug me a lot, she wasn\u2019t very\ndemonstrative. And she loved me conditionally, not unconditionally. And it went\nsomething like this, you know, I can take all this love \u2014 loss of all my family, and\nshe really never lost her whole family, if you\u2019re only a good girl, if you\u2019re only \u2014 it\nwas very conditional. And I remember, I was married \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s a huge burden on a child.",
        "A: It\u2019s ridiculous. And I remember \u2014 I think I was married already and I said to my\nmother, you know, what you expect of me is ridiculous. You had \u2014 lost her whole\nfamily, as I said. I said, I only know how to be your daughter. I don\u2019t how to be\nyour husband, I don\u2019t know how to be your brother, your sister, your brother-in-\nlaw, your sister-in-law, your nieces, your nephews. I don\u2019t know \u2014 I can\u2019t make up\nfor all these people. I only know how to be your child, that\u2019s it. And, you know, it\u2019s\n\u2014 she expects it \u2014 something [indecipherable] and wasn\u2019t possible to give to her.\nBut never \u2014 she was \u2014 she felt all alone, and she was all alone. But, I think if she\nwould \u2014 she never gave me a compliment for anything, never, never. And it was\nNovember 9, 2008\nvery stupid. If she would have done that, I would have maybe done more of what\nshe wanted.",
        "Q: How sad.",
        "A: Like, she never told me she loved me til she was almost dying, but she would tell\nother people, oh she\u2019s so wonderful, I love her so much. That\u2019s not the way to raise\na child. So \u2014 and the insecurity by living alone was terrible, as some \u2014 every child\nworries about what happens if their parents die. You know, children are not stupid,\nthey hear the plane crashes, cat \u2014 car crashes. What happens if \u2014 1f my parents die?\nSo I didn\u2019t have parents, I had my mother alone. And I had, as I said before, I had\none surviving cousin, who moved to Los Angeles, at my mother\u2019s assistant. As a\nmatter of fact, after the war, when my cousin came back, my mother stood there,\nand I remember her waving her finger at him. [tape break]",
        "Q: Yes, waving her finger.",
        "A: Margrits(ph), get out of Europe, get out of Holland. If you think this was a bad\nexperience, this was kinderspiel compared to what\u2019s going to come. Get out. And\nshe literally forced him out of Holland. And this lady that you just saw, her parents\nleft in 1949, and they also went, so he had a pla \u2014 he went to Los Angeles. When\nmy cousin left, I was 10 years old. As long as he was around, I felt I had a little\nNovember 9, 2008\nmoral support, a little something. So, after he left, I really felt all alone. Now, my\nmother had remarried after the war.",
        "Q: Excuse me, let me back up just a little bit. How old were you when you switched\nyour families? When you went \u2014 left your first \u2014 first \u2014",
        "A: Oh, about three and a half.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So it was very soo \u2014 actually very soon after the war ended.",
        "A: Yeah, probably it was about five, six months after that my mother took me full\ntime. Before she took me \u2014 you know, you \u2014 she was smart enough to realize you\ncan\u2019t just take me away full time. But \u2014 but it\u2019s a \u2014 a pr \u2014 yeah, probably about four",
        "Q: Was that through \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So \u2014 so \u2014 so nevertheless, you knew \u2014 at four or five and six, you started having\nother memories, of not living with the family \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, sure.",
        "Q: \u2014 but living with your mother?",
        "A: Sure, sure, sure. Sure, sure.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "Q: And can you tell me a little bit about those, some of those early memories that\ncome like episodes in a child\u2019s mind?",
        "A: We lived, as I said before, in the house that my grandfather had owned. And my\nmother found somebody she knew from the past, it was a third cousin or something,\nin The Hague, an elderly lady, she would come to visit. I admire my mother, she\ndid try to establish a life for herself. I remember going with her, being in the house,\ngoing out with her. My \u2014 then in \u201946, my cousin came back, he came to visit. They\ntried to live things normal. She tried to get some of her \u2014 the houses back, it was\nvery complicate \u2014",
        "Q: Did she get them?",
        "A: Some of them, but that\u2019s a whole different story. Things were kind of \u2014 I \u2014 there\nwas no nursery school, my first school experience was five years old. My mother\nwas smart enough \u2014 there was one Jewish school only in Holland, and my mother,\nthank God, was smart enough to send me to that, and I say smart enough, because\nall of us children had gone through the war, be it in concentration camp, hiding, so\nwe became like a family. I had very close friends [indecipherable]. I remember my\nfort \u2014 first Simkhes Torah in \u2014 when she took me \u2014",
        "Q: You must tell me what these are.",
        "A: Oh, Simkhes Torah 1s \u2014 is \u2014 is a holiday.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And after Rosh Hashanah, the last holiday, we have a month long of holidays,\nand the last holiday is Simkhes Torah, and there was \u2014 one of the ceremonies at\nSimkhes Torah in the synagogue is that you take all the children on the retalli(ph)\nand you bless the children. And one of my first memories as I went to shul with my\nmother, to the synagogue and they called up the children to bless the children, and I\nremember all the adults around, everybody was crying, the tear \u2014 crying, and I\ncouldn\u2019t figure out what they\u2019re crying. Of course, now I know why. This was the\nremnant, these were the children that had survived the war, here they were. And\nevery time I see them do that in synagogue on Simkhes Torah, | think back of that\nfirst time. You ne \u2014 you \u2014 certain things just stay with you. You never forget.",
        "Q: This may sou \u2014 sound like a strange question, but it\u2019s born out of that experience\nthat you described. You were with these foster parents, whom you loved, with\nwhom you felt secure, who were Christian, who took you to church. When did you\nstart feeling Jewish?",
        "A: When my mother took me in, she took me to synagogue. I don\u2019t know if the\nword Jewish meant something, or Protestant, but it was different.",
        "Q: Did you feel at home there in that synagogue?\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: Yeah, it was my mother. It didn\u2019t bother me. As a matter of fact, I often think\nabout if my mother wouldn\u2019t have come back, and I would have stayed with them,\nif they wouldn\u2019t have told me I would have been a Jewish child, whatever, figured it\nout. I think I would have.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: I guess I looked different than them. I-I look \u2014 I have very Semitic looks, and I\nthink I would have figured it out. I think there\u2019s a certain \u2014 I think there\u2019s a certain\nwarmth to synagogue, and a certain coldness to church. I think I would have figured\nit out. But I wonder.",
        "Q: I was \u2014 I was after something like that, because at some point a person starts\nidentifying themselves. They find \u2014",
        "A: I was \u2014 I was very comfortable in synagogue, I was very comfortable in a Jewish\n\u2014 not knowing the difference between Christian and Jewish. You don\u2019t know, when\nyou\u2019re that young a child.",
        "Q: No, no, no.",
        "A: I was very comfortable with it, and we went to school, our first school\nexperience was when we were five years old, kindergarten, and it was very Jewish\nand I was very comfortable in it. That I never wanted to go back for, I never said I\nNovember 9, 2008\nwant to go to church. It\u2019s interesting that you bring that up, because I never, ever\nsaid I would like to go to church.",
        "Q: Well, see, what I\u2019m trying to do \u2014",
        "A: I would love \u2014 I always loved seeing my foster parents, that I always was happy\nto go, but I never once in my life uttered the phrase, I\u2019d like to go to church again.\nIsn\u2019t that interesting?",
        "Q: Well, one of the reasons where it becomes a question to me is because you \u2014 you\ndrew a picture of \u2014 of warm foster parents and a \u2014 and a relationship with your\nmother that was fraught with certain tensions and anxieties \u2014",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: \u2014 that wasn\u2019t easy.",
        "A: Very difficult.",
        "Q: So \u2014 so that, if you go from a place that was warm, to a place that has problems,\nand yet today you are someone who 1s very Jewish \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and you \u2014 okay, something else must have brought you there. That\u2019s what I\u2019m\ntrying to \u2014",
        "A: Well, first of all, my mother came from a very religious background.",
        "Q: Okay.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: And she continued that, contrary to some other people that came through the war\nand threw everything away. Now, again, my mother was hidden, she was spared the\ntragedy of the camps. People \u2014 although things weren\u2019t easy, but people were civil\nto her and decent to her. And people that went through the camps saw, of course,\nsuch cruelty that thank God, my mother was spared from. And, like my cousin, who\nbelieves in nothing any more, says, where was God when we needed him? And I la\n\u2014 and my cousin questioned my mother, Tante, why are you still religious? And my\nmother answered him, so if I\u2019m not, would life be better? At least she felt it was\nsomething to hold onto, because she was brought up in that home. And it gave her a\ns \u2014 it gave her life and it did me the same. I went, as I said, to the only Jewish\nschool in Amsterdam, there\u2019s only one Jewish elementary school to this day, it\u2019s\ncalled Rosh Pina, and the high school is now called Maimonides, I went there.\nAnd I\u2019m very grateful my mother didn\u2019t send me to public school because I hear\nwhen I sit in our groups, kids that went \u2014 were sent to public school, they stood out,\nthey were different. Even though th-the \u2014 the Christian children had als \u2014 you know,\nalso had gone through a war, but a totally different experience. They were with their\nparents, they weren\u2019t separated from their families. It was a whole different\nexperience. And they felt strange, and they felt out of place, where even though we\ndidn't talk about our experience, but we all went through the same. And on vacation\nNovember 9, 2008\ntime, when people said, what are you doing on vaca \u2014 oh, I\u2019m going to my foster\nparents, I\u2019m going to my foster parents. And we had very close bonds, and I\u2019m very\ngrateful for that, that was one of the best things my mother ever did, because I\ndidn\u2019t have a family. So \u2014",
        "Q: It became something like that.",
        "A: It became \u2014 absolutely.",
        "Q: Another question. You know your story before you are conscious of it, that is\nyou know of her story, you know of sh \u2014 so at some point she started talking to you,\nshe started telling you.",
        "A: She did. She fa \u2014 she talks \u2014 very interesting, she talked a lot about her own\nfamily, very little about my father. And not too long, not too many years before she\ndied, I said to her once, I said, you know, I'd like to know a little about my father\u2019s\nfamily. You never talk about him, tell me something about my father. She said, he\nwas a very good man, he worked very hard, at night he was tired and he went to\nsleep after he ate. But she was very instrumental in giving me a very vivid picture\nof her life with her parents, with her two brothers and sisters, what that was like.\nThat she \u2014 she talked about a lot. That was important to her.",
        "Q: It \u2014 it\u2019s also, in a totally different context, but I remember as a journalist I once\ninterviewed someone who was a victim of torture in South America and had ended\nNovember 9, 2008\nup in Denmark in a rehabilitation center. And he didn't want to tell his children\nabout what he had gone through. And through his work in this rehabilitation center,\nhe found out that that was a mistake. That when he kept that from him \u2014 from them,\nthey could not get as close to him as they wanted to be. And when he started talking\nto them about his life, his \u2014 you know, the difficult parts, but when he started really\nsaying, this is what my life was made up of, it changed the dynamics. And \u2014 and so,\nit sounds that \u2014 that 1t was a cau \u2014 she \u2014 she was a complicated, amazing woman,\nyour mother.",
        "A: But ag \u2014 but again, she was hidden, and I find that the people that were hidden,\ntalked about their experience much easier than the ones in the concentra \u2014 I \u2014 that \u2014\nthat hell was much harder to talk about.",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: And I think that\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: For understandable reasons.",
        "A: Of course. My only cousin, who I saw a couple of years ago in Los Angeles, and\nI said to him, I said, you know, I know you don\u2019t want to do the Spielberg thing,\nbut I begged him to do the Spielberg thing, or what you are doing, and he wouldn\u2019t\ndo it. I said, for my own personal collection, would you \u2014 and for the tape recorder,\nwould talk with him a little bit? Okay, so he sat down, he talked some basic fact.\nNovember 9, 2008\nBut when it came to anything real, he just got tears in eyes, he said, I don\u2019t want to\ntalk about it. After all these years. You mention the name of his siblings and he\nstarts to cry. After all these years. So \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, it\u2019s horrible. Because it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s ir \u2014 an irrevocable loss.",
        "A: It\u2019s an irrevocable, but again I \u2014 I credit my foster parents with making the \u2014 |\nhave a lot of friends that are in therapy, and this and that, and I think the love that\nthey were able to give me, in these very early month and years of my life, they very,\nvery important foundation. I\u2019m not in therapy. My kids would probably say you\nbeli-long in therapy, but that\u2019s another story.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: But \u2014 Ma, you crazy, but that\u2019s a different story. But I function better, I think,\nthan a \u2014 than a lot of other, beca \u2014 because it\u2019s different where you p-pa \u2014 when you\nschlep from home to home, as many of my friends have. They went from place to\nplace, and so in the end wound up even in the camps, after being in hiding.",
        "Q: Oh, my.",
        "A: Oh yeah, a lot of the kids went in a hiding place \u2014",
        "Q: So they were caught?",
        "A: Yeah, of course. Of course. So, with everything, I consider myself pretty lucky.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit more about your life after the school, and when you \u2014\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: Oh, okay, okay.",
        "Q: \u2014 married, came to the United States and so on.",
        "A: Okay. As I told you before, my mother was obsessed with getting out of Europe.\nThe obsession never stopped. She told my cousin to go, and he listened, and as soon\nas the war was over and things started to normalize a little, my mother still wanted\nto get out of what \u2014 of Europe. What happened, she met a man in the late 40s, pr-\nprobably \u00b048 - \u201949, and they wanted to get married. They couldn\u2019t get married right\naway because I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with the fact that you needed death\ncertificates, and the only ones to provide them were the Red Cross. So she needed a\ndeath certificate that her husband had died, and he needed the death certif \u2014 he was\naman, a German Jew, he needed the death certificate that his wife had died. And it\ntook a couple of years, so they finally got married in 1951. And so he was in\nBergen-Belsen in the camps, and it didn\u2019t do any good to his health. And\neventually, he had a heart condition, after three years he died. So in 1954 he died.\nSo my mother was \u2014",
        "Q: Do you have memories of him?",
        "A: Very unpleasant memories. He was very resentful of me, because he had an 18\nyear old daughter that died, and my mother\u2019s daughter lived. So he tolerated me. He\nwasn\u2019t bad to me, but he wasn\u2019t any good, and I was a little child when they\nNovember 9, 2008\nmarried. So, you know, it would have been nice to have somebody that is nice to\nyou \u2014",
        "Q: Is warm.",
        "A: \u2014 and warm and kind. He tolerated me. He wanted my mother, I was the child,\nhe couldn\u2019t very well say to my mother, get rid of the child. That she wouldn\u2019t have\ndone. So I was tolerated, and I \u2014 I knew it. And it got to the point that I felt so\nunwanted that I was trying to think to myself, I want to get out of here. I don\u2019t \u2014 if\nmy mother wants to be with this man, that\u2019s her story, but I want to get out. And I\nactually hatched a plot how to get out. I had heard about youth aliyah and kids\ngoing to Israel at that point, and I said, you know what? Maybe I can go to youth\naliyah, and I heard about kibbutzim. I said, you know, my \u2014 let me see, maybe I\ncould go on my own to a kibbutz and live there. I don\u2019t want to be with this man\nany more. But that\u2019s up to my mother what she want. And I hate to say it, but when\nhe died, I wasn\u2019t very unhappy. And, so then, after he died, my mother went again\nfor her papers, and HIAS helped people with papers, and we went to \u2014 1955 to\nAmerica for three months.",
        "Q: HIAS being the Hebrew \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, aid society, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: And we came, we got an affidavit through our friends. This lady that you just\nsaw, her parents gave us the affidavit, and we went for three months to America.\nAnd in those days you had to go every two years to America, otherwise you lost\nyour a \u2014 your \u2014 your papers. So, we traveled back and forth, my mother had still\nthings to do in Holland. And when \u2014 and we lived for one year in Los Angeles, we\nwent for one year to L.A. And then we went back, I finished my school. My mother\nwanted me to finish high school, so fine, I did. And then in \u201962 I came permanently.\nAnd I met my husband, let\u2019s see, in 19 \u2014 yeah, December \u201965, and in February \u201965 \u2014\n\u00b066 we got married. And I have a daughter and a son, and they were born 1n \u201971 and\n\"74.",
        "Q: And your husband was an American, or \u2014",
        "A: Very interesting. I met my husband through mutual Dutch friends. As I said to\nyou when you were talking before \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 how come you stayed in, people didn\u2019t get out, as I said, only people with\nmoney and connections got out. My in-laws lived in Rotterdam. Both my families,\nmy \u2014 my family on my side know that they go back hundreds of years in Holland,\nand my husband\u2019s side also. We\u2019re not Dutch, you know, for one generation that\ncame from Poland, or what. We\u2019re as Dutch, real Dutch Jews. My husband\u2019s\nNovember 9, 2008\nfamily, as I said, lived in Rotterdam. My father-in-law was a physician, my\nmother-in-law for her day was extraordinary well educated. She \u2014 women in those\ndays were educated when they finished elementary school, very well educated if\nthey finished high school, and exceptional to go to the university. My mother-in-law\nwent to the University of Leiden, my \u2014 to study law. My father-in-law went to\nstudy medicine, they met at the university, they got married. My f \u2014 mother-in-law\nactually practiced law in those days, in the 30s and all that. And my father-in-law\nhad a practice in Rotterdam. And they had connections. My f\u2014 mother-in-law\u2019s\nfamily was in the scrap metal business, and there was somebody that they knew that\ngot a group together. And they said, if you can get 50,000 guilders, which is like a\nhalf a million today, or more, you can get out. And he had a group and all \u2014 every\ncouple have to pay 50,000 guilders to get out. And my father and mother-in-law\ndescribed a scene where they went to this Nazi\u2019s place, and the money was piled up\non tables to the ceiling, practically. And they did manage to escape. Their flights \u2014\nSteven Spielberg could make a movie of the story how they got out, via Holland,\nBelgium, France, finally Spain. When they were in Spain, I think for a cou-couple\nof months, and then they finally wound up in Cuba and then to Holland.",
        "Q: To the United States.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: To the United States, I\u2019m sorry. My father-in-law had to get again his license to\nstudy medi \u2014 to practice medicine in America. After he had got that and then they\nmoved to Queens. And there was a Dutch family and they heard, oh, there is a\nDutch doctor in town, let\u2019s go to him. And from being doctor patient relationship,\ndeveloped a very wonderful friendship. I knew that family, they know me, they\nknow my husband and they put us together. So even though we \u2014 my husband was\nraising his second \u2014 that ship that they went to, went to Havana, and then they\ncame to America, so his second birthday was in Havana. And I married a\nDutchman here in America.",
        "Q: Wow, wow.",
        "A: Yeah, as he is fond of saying, she is from Amsterdam, I am from Rotterdam,\nand together we have a damn good time. [laughter]. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s his quote. But\nyes, I did marry a Dutchman, and we do speak Dutch at home and my children\nunderstand Dutch and speak it also.",
        "Q: How interesting, how interesting. And you now live in Los Angeles\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t live in Los Angeles \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, so sorry \u2014",

        "Q: Somehow or other, Los Angeles, maybe it\u2019s because your cousin \u2014",
        "A: Because my friend 1s from there, and my cousin went to Los Angeles, yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: And my first, when we went to America the first time, we stayed in Los\nAngeles for \u2014 for three months, and we lived in Los Angeles for a year.",
        "Q: And tell me a little bit about how you maintained contact with your foster\nfamily. You know, how you forced your mother to do so, and how \u2014",
        "A: Oh-",
        "Q: \u2014 and how you maintained that contact then?",
        "A: Well, in those days, you know, there was no email, it was snail mail, so we wrote\nletters to each other. Later on \u2014 the telephone was a luxury in Holland, you know,\nin the early years, so they \u2014 they got the tele \u2014 yeah, telephone, we would have, you\nknow, phone calls back and forth, but mostly letters. I mean, people were big in\nwriting letters.",
        "Q: Did you go st \u2014 did you go stay with them then, let\u2019s say [indecipherable]",
        "A: After I came in amer \u2014 to America?",
        "Q: No, no, I meant when you [indecipherable]\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: When I was a child?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, my mother would \u2014 sometimes she would let me stay with them a little bit,\nan overnight or something. Not much, we usually would go for the day.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: I-I don\u2019t know if she was fearful of \u2014 that they wouldn\u2019t give me back again, I\ndon\u2019t know what was it a ma \u2014 mostly we went, spent the day. And they came to me\nto spend the day, they came for a visit. It was mostly visits.",
        "Q: I see. And then when you became an adult, did your ties in somehow or other\nchange?",
        "A: Well, I was in America, so that was oh \u2014 you know, I came to here when I was\n20 years old. And I always corresponded. When I came to Holland for a visit, of\ncourse, I went to see them. But I had them come to America. They came together\ntwice as a couple, and then my \u2014 so, they had the pleasure of seeing my children\nand my husband. And of course it\u2019s nice that my husband\u2019s also Dutch, so they\ncould communicate, because they didn\u2019t speak a word of English. And after my\nfoster pa \u2014 father died, she came once alone. And so my neighbors, my friends\naround where I live now, actually met my foster parents, which was very interesting\nfor them. And my daughter remembers them. My son was too young, he doesn\u2019t\nNovember 9, 2008\nremember them, but my daughter remembers them, and like I said, it was really\nsomething for me to hear them sing. They brought du \u2014 books with Dutch songs,\nand they were sitting now singing to my children the songs they sung to me. I really\ncame full cir \u2014 full circle.",
        "Q: Very warm \u2014 a very warm thought, a very warm kind of image.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add to what you\u2019ve told, that you think 1s\nimportant for people to know?",
        "A: Ah, yes, I think it\u2019s very important to know that as much as I have a good life,\nand I\u2019m very grateful for the life I have, 1t never leaves you. Like I said, I don\u2019t\nknow if I said it to you, when I go to weddings, or Bar Mitzvahs or places, and I see\nthe people go into a family picture. And the picture, the le \u2014 wide angle lens isn\u2019t\nwide enough, they fi \u2014 ho-how to fit everybody in. And, you don\u2019t need a wide\nangle lens for my family. They si \u2014 except for my husband, my children and my one\ncousin, and he 1s ac \u2014 older already, he was born in 1924, there is no family. And no\nmatter, you know, you miss that always.",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: You always miss that.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "Q: How long was your mother with you?",
        "A: A long time, thank God, she lived a long life. She died in 1998.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: She was almost 92 years old. So she saw my children into adulthood. I\u2019m sorry\nshe didn\u2019t see my daughter get married, but she did have that \u2014 and she was \u2014 like\nit\u2019s funny, like you say what else can you add? As I told you, I \u2014 her love for me\nwas very conditional, but my \u2014 her love for my \u2014 my children was totally unc \u2014 she\nadored them. And I often say, you know, kids, you couldn\u2019t do any wrong, and \u2014 I\ncouldn\u2019t do any good, but you couldn\u2019t do anything wrong. And it was really, you\nknow, I\u2019m glad she lived to see my children, because she really, she adored them,\nand they \u2014 they knew it.",
        "Q: And it also is in a way trying to give you back what she couldn\u2019t have given you\ndirectly, by loving your children, whom you \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 love, you know, it \u2014",
        "A: Also something funny, and I wonder if other people feel that way. When I was\nraising my own children, you just do what you do. You\u2019re busy, yo-you \u2014 yo-you \u2014\nyou \u2014 you go, you change diapers, you make food, you shop, you dress, you bring\nthem to school, whatever it is you do. And I did that. I never stopped to think of\nNovember 9, 2008\nanything else. Now that I have a grandchild, it hits home even more in a way,\nbecause she comes and she goes. I look at this little child and I say, how could these\nbastards have hurt a little child like that? I look at this little girl, she\u2019s now three\nyears old. Some of these little children were left all alone in the world, looking for\nsomebody to hold their hand, to take care of them. How could these bastards, and\nhow can we ever ask to forgive this? Never. When my granddaughter turned four \u2014\nmy daughter knows my whole story, I \u2014 you know, I\u2019ve never been not open about\nit. And when she turned four months old, I said to \u2014 her name is Yerwousha(ph), I\nsaid, Yerwousha(ph), would you imagine your having to give this little girl,\nsomebody coming to your door and somebody taking this child from you? You\nnever know if you will ever see her again. Then she broke out in tears. As much as\nshe knows my story and m-my foster parents, now that she\u2019s a mother herself, she\nunderstands really how it hits home.",
        "Q: And what price was paid.",
        "A: And what price was paid. And like I said, it hit. And now I see this child, I say,\nhow could they hurt a child? How can you do it? How can any human being do\nthis? It \u2014 it hits me in a way even more now, because I take distance. It never leaves\nyou. It never leaves you. As much as I function and I, you know, do everything I\u2019m\nsupposed to do, I-I think, it never leaves you. It will go with you to your grave.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "Q: So hard to hear it, but it is true.",
        "A: It\u2019s true, I mean \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s true.",
        "A: \u2019m-\u2014 you know, function an-and do everything and I don\u2019t feel sorry \u2014 don\u2019t\nthink I ever feel sorry for myself. I consider myself the lucky ones.

And when you\u2019re a little child, and there are two\npeople in the house, you and her, well, if she\u2019s crying, must be my fault. Now, I\nNovember 9, 2008\nunderstand now, as an adult, of course how she cried, she always thought of \u2014 for\nher relatives. I mean, she missed them terribly.

We\u2019re talking this weekend with a lot\nof people who are child survivors, who were hidden, and one of the themes that\ncomes through in many stories, and a sadness that just doesn\u2019t go away, 1s the\nabandonment. Children were abandoned because they had to be, because the parents\nwanted them to find some way of surviving. And then, after the war, sometimes\nthere were relatives who were never interested in picking up those abandoned\nchildren. And in your case, what you have 1s the opposite of that, 1s that everybody\nwanted you.",

        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "Q: So it was very soo \u2014 actually very soon after the war ended.",
        "Q: Was that through \u2014",
        "Q: So \u2014 so \u2014 so nevertheless, you knew \u2014 at four or five and six, you started having\nother memories, of not living with the family \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 but living with your mother?",
        "Q: And can you tell me a little bit about those, some of those early memories that\ncome like episodes in a child\u2019s mind?",
        "Q: Did she get them?",
        "Q: You must tell me what these are.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: This may sou \u2014 sound like a strange question, but it\u2019s born out of that experience\nthat you described. You were with these foster parents, whom you loved, with\nwhom you felt secure, who were Christian, who took you to church. When did you\nstart feeling Jewish?",
        "Q: Did you feel at home there in that synagogue?",

        "Q: No, no, no.",
        "Q: Well, see, what I\u2019m trying to do \u2014",
        "Q: Well, one of the reasons where it becomes a question to me is because you \u2014 you\ndrew a picture of \u2014 of warm foster parents and a \u2014 and a relationship with your\nmother that was fraught with certain tensions and anxieties \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 that wasn\u2019t easy.",
        "Q: So \u2014 so that, if you go from a place that was warm, to a place that has problems,\nand yet today you are someone who 1s very Jewish \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and you \u2014 okay, something else must have brought you there. That\u2019s what I\u2019m\ntrying to \u2014",

My father came from a family of three, he had two sisters. One was\nmarried and had six kids, and the other one never married.

And my father dealt in animal hides, and my\nmother \u2014 my grandfather del \u2014 was a butcher, a ko \u2014 kosher butcher. And everybody\nlived in Amsterdam at the time, except my grandparents on my mother\u2019s side, they\nNovember 9, 2008\nmoved about 10 years before, to The Hague, for health reasons. My grandfather\nhad some respiratory problems and the doctor suggested that he should be near the\nsalt sea air, so they moved to the \u2014 The Hague.

When \u201cMein Kampf\u201d was written, my mother was very smart, and she\nsays, this guy is not fooling around. He\u2019s really gonna kill us all. We better get the\nhell out of here. And a lot of Dutch Jews had the misconception that Holland would\nstay neutral. And why was that? Because during World War I, Holland stayed\nneutral. And they figured \u2014 so they said, well, even if, you know, the war breaks\nout, we\u2019ll just stay neutral in Holland and we have nothing to worry about. And my\nmother was very smart and she says, we may want to stay neutral, but Hitler won\u2019t\nlet us. And she made everybody crazy, said, let\u2019s get out, we have to get out of here.\nIf we \u2014 th \u2014 it\u2019s not good, we must leave Europe. She was obsessed with leaving\nEurope and going to America. And nobody wanted to listen to her, because in\nHolland, like I said, they \u2014 they all thought nothing was gonna happen there. And\nthere were other people like my mother. My \u2014 as a matter of fact, after I got\nmarried, my father-in-law \u2014 my \u2014 my husband\u2019s grandfather was the same thing, he\nalso saw it come.

        "A: And she got stuck. So then I was born, and even already before I was born, in\nbeginning of 1942, things started to get \u2014 the very first year or so, things weren\u2019t so\nbad yet.",
        "A: Yeah, sure. Of course.",
        "A: No, I was born in the CIZ, it was called. Th-The Central Israeli Ziekenhuis. It\nwas th-the Jewish hospital in Amsterdam.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They had an apartment, and they lived in their apartment, yes. And then what\nthey did is, the men were called up to so-called work camp, and the Dutch are very\ngullible, and they said, well maybe if we do as we\u2019re told, it won\u2019t so bad if we \u2014\nyou know, don\u2019t try to get away with something. And my mother again was smart,\nand she says \u2014 my father was \u2014 I was born in March 4, 1942, and they started to call\nup the men, and my father\u2019s call-up came and my mother said, let\u2019s go into hiding.\nBeing that my father was dealing in animal hides, he knew every farmer in town,\nNovember 9, 2008\nand he was apparently a very nice man. And somebody would have gladly put him\nup. No, no, no, I\u2019ll go, Pll go. And \u2014",
        "A: This was in Amsterdam. And he never went into hiding. Then, when I was four\nmonths old, my father left. They \u2014 people had to go to the train station and at s \u2014 at\nthe platform of the train station, my mother said, I beg of you, don\u2019t go. Come \u2014\ncome with me, come, let\u2019s go into hiding. He went. That was the last time she ever\nsaw him.",
        "A: Of course not, of course \u2014 I was four months old. So then what happened, she\nwent home to the apartment. And one night, not long after my father had left,\nmaybe a couple of days later, whatever, the Nazis came, you know, they came and\ndid house searches to take people out. And she went upstairs to the bedroom and\nshe put the covers under her head. [tape break]",
        "A: So, the covers were over her head, and it\u2019s like a miracle, I was a four month old\nbaby, most of the time babies cry, right? I don\u2019t know, instincts, I didn't cry. And it\nwas dark, and my mother describes they \u2014 they had flashlights and they went over\nthe \u2014 with the flashlight and said \u2014 and then one said to his partner, said, ah, there\u2019s\nNovember 9, 2008\nnothing here, let\u2019s get out. At that point my mother said, this is getting a little bit too\nhot, we better go into hiding. So my mother had an address. Her sister worked in a\nbakery.",
        "A: No. No, no, she was a typical \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 [indecipherable] homemaker, yeah. And her sister worked in this bakery. And\none of her customers said to her once, if you ever need a place to hide, or any of\nyour family, this is our address. And sh-she gave her the [indecipherable] to my\nmother, so my mother had that address. And after this little incident, she went over\nthere.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Right. Of course, of course.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: My in-laws got out, I can tell you about that later, that\u2019s nothing to do with me\nparticularly, but they did get out in 1940, four months after the invasion. But by the\ntime the people realized, 1t was too late, it real \u2014 really was too late.",
        "A: There was nothing you could do.",
        "A: So, she has this address, and she goes to this family, and they let her in, and\nAmsterdam was the more Protestant family. The sou-southern part of Holland was\nNovember 9, 2008\nmore Catholic, bordering Belgium. The northern part in Amsterdam was more\nProtestant, but there were also Catholic families, they just tended to have bigger\nfamilies, I guess they didn\u2019t believe in birth control or whatever, they just tended to\nhave bigger families. And that particular family also they had a bunch of daughters.\nThere was about six kid \u2014 five, six kids in the family, seven, whatever, I don\u2019t know\nexactly. And so my mother was 35 at that point, and they had a bunch of daughters\nall in their 30s, so my mother could blend in. My mother also did not look Jewish at\nall. My mother could easily have blended in. Some of the Catholics looked more\nJewish than she did, so \u2014 she was a little woman, she was slight, and she did no \u2014\nmy friend here to see \u2014 no, Mama, no, didn\u2019t look Jewish at all. So, she blended in.\nSo they let her in, and while she was there, not very long, they said look, Annie,\nthey\u2019re \u2014 she went by the name Annie \u2014 they said Annie, you know, we \u2014 we want\nyou to stay and you\u2019re welcome to stay with us, but you have to find a place for the\nchild, because our neighbors know that none of my daughters were pregnant, and\nwhen all of a sudden a baby cries, and a baby appeared, they know that something 1s\nup, and the baby will give us all away. And my mother realized, of course, they\nwere right, and she certainly didn\u2019t want to jeopardize their life and her life and my\nlife, so she set about finding a place for me. And she really didn\u2019t have a place. But\napparently, from what she told me, there was an org \u2014 an underground organization\nNovember 9, 2008\nconsisting of doctors, nurses and medical students. And if you needed a place for a\nchild, you could go there, and they would place the child.",
        "A: No, no, no, she just went to that organi \u2014 it was an underground organization,\nlike, you know, like anything. So, my mother went there and she said, I have a four\nmonths old that needs to be placed, do you have a spot for her? And they said, okay,\non such and such a day, a couple will appear, and they will take your child away;\nthey will take your child into hiding. And they tried to match up the couples with\nthe ages. Like, if there was a teenager, they wouldn\u2019t give it a couple in their early\n20s, that would look out of place, you didn\u2019t want to walk \u2014 so, like I was four\nmonths old, so they gave me to a couple in their 20s. And my mother did, and \u2014",
        "A: And, as she describes, she packed my things, and she put a few special things in\nthere, like a \u2014 what do you call that thing?",
        "A: A rattle. A special rattle and some other things. And I had a little birthmark on\nmy thigh, I think, but I don\u2019t have it any more, but I had that. And she figured if\nwhen the war is over, and she didn\u2019t \u2014 nobody knew when it would be over, and a\nfour months old, after a year you don\u2019t recognize your own child, she would ask for\nNovember 9, 2008\nthe things, at least she would be able to identify her own child. Which, by the way,\nis exactly what happened. And \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I can just imagine my poor mother, two strangers come to the door, and she\nhanded me to two strangers, not knowing if she would ever see me again. In the\nbeginning of the war from ol \u2014 this is all what she told me, they would tell the\nparents where they took the children. The Nazis soon found out about that, and they\nwould get the parents and torture them long enough that it would give away the\naddress of the children. By the time I was hidden, my mother wasn\u2019t told anything.\nThey wouldn\u2019t tell me wha \u2014 what ci-ci \u2014 what city I went to, who I went to, where,\nshe knew nothing, just handed me, and that was it. I was extraordinarily fortunate.\nWhy? Because I came to a childless couple who were absolutely fantastic to me,\nwho loved me dearly, who did everything and anything in their power to make\nthings bearable...",
        "A: Yeah.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: As I said, they were very \u2014 they were a childless couple, extraordinarily nice to\nme, and what was my luck? Number one that they were childless. In a way that was\nvery lucky because they put all their love and \u2014 you know, devotion to me.",
        "A: And for some reason, I stayed with them the whole war. They \u2014 I guess we\nclicked.",
        "A: Of course. So, but \u2014 well, why I say I was lucky, because I have many friends\nthat were 1n hiding, and they were bounced from place to place to place. And that\nwas a terrible th-thing. Every time you were attached to something, you know, they\n\u2014 they had to leave again, for a variety of reasons. That\u2019s why I consider myself\nlucky that they were good people. They treated me like their own. Their extended\nfamily were very good. My foster mother had a brother, a-and a s \u2014 a sister and\nmother-in-law that lived in town, and their children, they were good to me. Her\nparents lived in town. They were all very good to me. And ber \u2014 being a very good\n[indecipherable] I mean, the neighborhood \u2014 I was wa \u2014 hidden in a town called\nUtrecht.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: And I was hidden in an area called rivier er buurt, which means the river \u2014 the\nriver neighborhood. Why? Because a lot of the streets were named after rivers. And\napparently there were a lot of Jewish children hidden in that neighborhood. So \u2014\nand the underground knew about that. So, when they staged a raids, most of the\ntime, the underground had enough time to ring the doorbell and said, get the kids\nout of here, a raid is coming. And guess where they took me? To her parents, to her\nsister and brother-in-law and their children. So not only did they \u2014",
        "A: All na \u2014 all in Utrecht, yes. So, not only did they themselves risk their life, her\nparents, her sister and brother-in-law, their children. I mean, it\u2019s unbelievable, and\nthey were all good to me, I have the fondest of memories. I was playing with their\nchildren \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: lre\u2014\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: Probably I remember being with them, being with my foster parents. I remember\nthem \u2014",
        "A: Of course, of course.",
        "A: Oh, there\u2019s no question. And her parents were Oma and Opa and \u2014 and her\nsister and brother-in-law were, you know, Ome and Tante, aunt and uncle, of\ncourse, of course. And they were my cousins, no question. Of course, it was lucky\nfor their part also that I was a baby when I came there. A child that comes at a year\nor two had a recollection of their parents, can give it all away by saying something\nwrong. I didn\u2019t know anything but them, so I could never speak out of tur-turn, I\ncould never say anything wrong, because all I knew was them. I remember going to\nlook for food. They would go out of town to the farms, I think \u2014 and buy some f \u2014\nget some food. And I remember they went on like a \u2014 a car, a flat car with big\nwheels, and somebody would pull it. And it was like \u2014 like a hay \u2014 like today kids\nwould go on a hayride, and it was kind of \u2014 of an adventure for a child. And they\ntold me we\u2019re gonna look for food. I remember those things very clearly. We went,\nyou know, as often as we could, whatever they could get. I remember whenever I\nwent outside, if you look at me, brown eyes and brown hair \u2014 brown hair, and as a\nNovember 9, 2008\nchild too, I was, for Holland, a very Jewish looking child. And whenever we went\noutside, I was told to look down so that my eyes couldn\u2019t be seen, and I always got\na kerchief or a hat on my head so my brown hair wouldn\u2019t show. And I remember\nthat. Yoka(ph), I was called Yoka(ph), we all had a name, they gave us a name.",
        "A: My name was \u2014 th-they called me Yoka(ph).",
        "A: Yoka(ph), yeah.",
        "A: No, they gave me that name, I mean \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 every child got an \u2014 got a ha \u2014 a hiding name.",
        "A: Especially if they have Jewish sounding \u2014 Jos\u00e9 is not particularly Jewish\nsounding name, but every \u2014 they \u2014 they identifal \u2014 you know, they \u2014 they give the\nname.",
        "A: Iremember them very fondly. (Oh, sorry.) I remember very fondly them sitting\nin Holland \u2014 you know, you had no central heating, you had like a \u2014 a st \u2014 what do\nyou c \u2014 pot belly stove \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know. And we would sit around it and they would sing songs to me at\nnight. And, now you shouldn\u2019t think there was anything in that potbelly stove, they\nhad nothing to heat it with, but just the illusion, you think you sit in front of the\nstove, you feel warm.",
        "A: It\u2019s warm. And I remember the singing their songs to me.",
        "A: Turner Hefferness(ph). And the beauty of this, why I tell you this in particular,\nafter I moved to America and I got married, I had them come. And when my\ndaughter was si \u2014 what \u2014 how old was she? She was four, my son was six,\nsomething like that, was the last time they were here together, they would sit with\nmy daughter on their lap and sing the same songs they sang to me. So life really\ncame full cycle. I remember that, I remember being taken to her parents, to my f \u2014 f\n\u2014I don\u2019t know, to my foster mother\u2019s parents, playing with the children. I have\npictures of my playing in the yard with them, I remember the \u2014 the \u2014 the house. All\nNovember 9, 2008\nthose things I do remember. I guess when you live \u2014 and it was very clear that we\nwere living under very bad circumstances. I mean, the na \u2014 the word Nazis was \u2014\nwas used, and \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: You remember it very well, that outside the house there was danger. And of\ncourse, there were also a number of close calls. Like I told you before, then the na \u2014\nth-the underground would come when they knew they were staging a raid. A few\ntimes \u2014 this is all they told me, this I don\u2019t remember, of course. One time they had\nno time to get me out, so they had to do a little quick thinking and my foster father\ndecided he was going to lay in bed and say he was sick, and they would put me on\nthe foot end of the bed, and he made believe he was laying with his feet up on the\npillow, and I was put in the foot end. And they really came in looking at the house,\nand they didn\u2019t see a child, and they left again.",
        "A: [indecipherable] a close call, I could have coughed, cried. I was, you know, by\nthat time where I could have been a year old, I don\u2019t know how old I was, I didn\u2019t\nask him how old I was at that point. But it\u2019s like a child senses fear, and those went\nto, you know, do what\u2019s right, I don\u2019t know. Another close call was my foster\nmother\u2019s mother [indecipherable] that they took me to her too sometime. Came for\na visit one day, and she \u2014 the underground came and told them, you have 10\nminutes to get out, they\u2019re very close, get the children out. So she said to my foster\nmother, Ill take her home, just \u2014 and she says, and give me her dirty laundry, go to\nthe laundry. And my foster mother says, why? She says, just \u2014 I just have a hunch,\ndo me a favor, you never know where they\u2019re looking. Because babies clothes\nmeant evidence. So, to satisfy her mother, okay, here\u2019s the dirty laundry. And off\nwe went. They came, is a child here? No, no child, they went looking through the\nhouse, no child. Can I see your dirty laundry, please? If 1t wasn\u2019t for her instinct I\nprobably wouldn\u2019t be sitting here talking to you. Those are the things that\nhappened. You always have to go by your guts.",
        "A: Always go by your guts.",
        "A: Always.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: Getting together. I remember going to church, my first religious experience was\nnot in a synagogue, was in church.",
        "A: No, they were Protestant.",
        "A: They were Protestant, they were Protestant. It was very important to know that\nnot only were they Protestant, they were very devout Protestant, they were very\nreligious. And the reason they took me was their Christian duty. They felt it was\ntheir Christian duty. Somewhere in the back of their minds, they also figured, well,\nif they don\u2019t come back, they\u2019Il have another Christian child. That was in the back\nof all their mind. Doesn\u2019t bal \u2014 bother me, because you know, what they did was\ngood, the rest doesn\u2019t really matter. But it was definitely \u2014 I don\u2019t know if they were\nnot such devout Christians that they would have done it. They felt 1t was their\nChristian duty to save a \u2014 to save a Jewish child. It was that motivation.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: No, no, I just remember walking in \u2014 1n a building, 1t was a church and of course\nwhen you\u2019re a young child everything seems very big.",
        "A: And there was a children\u2019s choir and towards the end of the war I remember\nsinging in it. They \u2014 the little \u2014 there were little kids singing a song. That was my\nfirst, you know, recollection.",
        "A: And walking around after dinner, we would take a \u2014 take a walk, usually, if the\nweather permitted. Holland doesn\u2019t have such great weather always, but \u2014",
        "A: Interesting you should ask that. For us hidden children, the worst was not during\nthe war. Believe it or not, the worst was after the war was over. Because specially\nthose of us that were born during the war were so young and were given as babies,\nwe didn\u2019t know our families. All we knew is what we knew. These are our parents,\nthis is our family. And one day, I came home \u2014 like I said, we \u2014 I would take a walk\nNovember 9, 2008\nafter dinner with my father, the war was over, and something amazing happened.\nThe war was over and my mother, of course, went to look for survivors, first looked\nfor her child. And that same organization where she went to place me, she went to\nto find me. And she stated her name and the name of her child. And they produced a\nneat, nice, little list, and they said, oh your child is there, and there in that address\n[indecipherable] Utrecht. And I often think to myself, if the Nazis would have\nfound those lists, again I wouldn\u2019t be sitting talking to you. But they were so\norganized, they could tell her immediately where I was. So, she couldn\u2019t get to me\nright away, because there was no transportation of any kind in \u2014 you had to have, I\nguess, some money, I don\u2019t know what. But, after about a couple of month, the next\nmonth or so, or two months, she came for a visit, she came to see me. And I\nremember going for my evening constitutional with my foster father, and we come\nhome, and in the kitchen on a four prong stool \u2014 I\u2019ll \u2014 never in my life do I look at a\nfour prong stool and not associate that \u2014 there\u2019s a lady sitting. And I was raised to\nbe a polite little girl, and I s-stretched my hand out, and I want to shake her hand.\nAnd I said, good evening lady. And just like I\u2019m sitting here talking to you, she\nsays, you don\u2019t have to call me lady. You can call me Mommy. I am your mother,\nthese are not your parents. When you\u2019re a three year old, your life as you know it at\nthat point falls apart. So, like I said, I had kind of a secure little world with people\nNovember 9, 2008\nthat I loved and loved me, and there comes this strange lady, and telling me she\u2019s\nnot my mother. What is a three year old supposed to think about that?",
        "A: They weren\u2019t psychologically very astute in those days. This 1s not the way you\ntell a child, you know, her whereabouts. And life after that was, for us children,\nvery traumatic.",
        "A: M-My mother came for the visit, she stayed a little bit and she went home. And\nthen she would come to visit. And after she got away from her foster family and\nestablished herself in the apartment, which was \u2014 the Jews in those days didn\u2019t\ninvest their money in stocks and bonds and mutual funds, there was no thing in\nthose days. And the stock market they didn\u2019t trust, so if you had a little money, you\nbought a house, you bought real estate. And those typical European houses, you\nknow, were three, four story homes. So everybody had real estate. So one house,\ntwo house, 10 house, whatever it was.",
        "A: And my grandfather had a home in amster \u2014 you know, several houses in\nAmsterdam, and what my mother did is first after she looked to establish herself,\nshe went into one of her house of her father and took an apartment and went to live\nNovember 9, 2008\nthere. So after she came to visit a few times here and there, she took me for a few\ndays to stay with her. Now, also, you have to understand something else. They\ndidn't give me up willingly. My fa \u2014 foster father and mother made a pact that if the\nwar is over and one of my parents would survive or both, they would give me back\nto parents, but to nobody else. So if, for instance, my mother would not have\nsurvived, and my father did not survive, and an aunt or an uncle or a grandparent\nwould come back, they weren\u2019t going to return me. And they had the law of the\nland with them, because the Dutch decided that it was in the best interest of the\nchildren not to be uprooted. S \u2014 and a lot of parents had big problems getting their\nchildren back. And they didn\u2019t give me willingly. They tried to convince my mother\nthat maybe it was better I should stay with them. Now, I can \u2014",
        "A: I was so dumbfounded, I don\u2019t think I cried. I \u2014 I must have just stood there, not\nknowing what to think. What do you think? What do you mean this is not my\nmother? A child doesn\u2019t understand \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the reproductive system.",
        "A: Of course not.",
        "A: When somebody says call me mommy, you\u2019re mommy. And they were good to\nme, I had no reason to doubt that they were my parents.",
        "A: They couldn\u2019t be better if they tried, they were wonderful people. It\u2019s \u2014 all of a\nsudden the \u2014 I mean, I was just so stunned and dumbfounded, but you sure don\u2019t\nknow what to think any more.",
        "A: No, no, because I think they were all trying to pull their own weight. My mother,\nyes she had lost her whole family, which by the way, she didn't know yet at that\npoint, because people didn\u2019t know until a few years after if people had survived the\nwar. It wasn\u2019t the computer age, and the Red Cross gave you the information. And\npeople went for years after to look at lists at the Red Cross to see if anybody had\nsurvived. So my mother was not aware that everybody had been killed. She didn\u2019t\nknow yet. But I can imagine, after her own source, and her own \u2014 you know, it\nwasn\u2019t easy for her to be in hiding either, and then you find your child and your\nNovember 9, 2008\nchild is a stranger to you and the child doesn\u2019t want you, and my mother didn't even\nknow right away that it was right, and she asked to see that rattle, and if you\nremember in the beginning I told you she packed some things. She asked to see if\nthey had the suitcase that she packed for me. And sure enough they produced it, and\nshe looked to see if I had the birthmark on my thigh and there it was. I don\u2019t have it\nany more, but it was, I guess, a sign from God to show me who I was. And I can\nimagine how terrible for my mother. I mean, she would \u2014 the children that were\nolder, that were reunited with their parent, they run to their parent, Mommy,\nMommy. I didn\u2019t run to my mother, I didn\u2019t want to go to her. On the other hand I\nalso understand my foster parents, who knew when they took me, it wasn\u2019t an\nadoption. It was \u2014 I was given there for safekeeping. They knew that they weren\u2019t\nsupposed to keep me. But I can also understand, I have children and a grandchild\nmyself, you get attached to a child, especially when you shelter a child against such\nhorror. You don\u2019t want to give the \u2014 I understand their point too, as an adult. As a\nchild, I didn\u2019t, of course. So I remember it was very tense between my foster\nparents, especially my foster father and my mother. It wasn\u2019t an easy relationship.\nAnd my mother would have liked nothing better than I would have said to her, oh, I\ndon\u2019t want nothing to do with these people, I only want to be with you. And I didn\u2019t\ndo that. I loved these people dearly, and I\u2019ve loved them til the end of their days,\nNovember 9, 2008\nand I had them come here to America and they met my husband and my children.\nAnd, you know, I did whatever I could to them.",

        "A: All of the sides \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I mean, it is so unfair, I mean, I can understand it was terrible. It wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen as bad for my foster parents, even though they were very attached to me, of\ncourse, to give me up, had they had their own children. I guess that made also a bit\nof a difference. But they didn\u2019t. And many years after the war they told me, no\nmatter how bad the war was, having me were the best years of their life.",
        "A: Yeah, imagine that.",

        "A: But it was very hard for me. I mean, I couldn\u2019t understand why \u2014 my mother was\nvery grateful to them, but you wouldn\u2019t know it in the way she expressed it. Like \u2014\nlike I said, there was a jealousy. And I belong to a child survivor group and when\nwe sat around and talking about it, most of us that were babies that were born, you\nknow, during the war, they all have the same experience. The \u2014 the parents really\nwould have liked the children to be estranged from the foster parents. But we kids,\nwe wouldn\u2019t let. We really \u2014 I \u2014 it\u2019s probably a sign of strength on our part, as little\nas we were, I wouldn\u2019t let my mother not have contact with them. She would have\nloved it if I would have said, you know what? You\u2019re my mother now, I don\u2019t need\nthem any more. Oh no, I wouldn\u2019t let them do that. I wouldn\u2019t let them do that at\nall.",
        "A: No. No, I \u2014 I\u2014I think I probably blocked it out, it must have been so traumatic\nfor me to leave them, that I probably totally blocked it. Like there\u2019s certain things\nyou block out, and I must have blocked that out. I don\u2019t remember the day.",
        "A: I resented her.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: I resented her for taking me away from them, and it was very difficult to be with\nmy mother. She loved me, but she didn\u2019t express it in a way that I express my love\nfor my children. She didn't pick me up and hug me a lot, she wasn\u2019t very\ndemonstrative. And she loved me conditionally, not unconditionally. And it went\nsomething like this, you know, I can take all this love \u2014 loss of all my family, and\nshe really never lost her whole family, if you\u2019re only a good girl, if you\u2019re only \u2014 it\nwas very conditional. And I remember, I was married \u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s ridiculous. And I remember \u2014 I think I was married already and I said to my\nmother, you know, what you expect of me is ridiculous. You had \u2014 lost her whole\nfamily, as I said. I said, I only know how to be your daughter. I don\u2019t how to be\nyour husband, I don\u2019t know how to be your brother, your sister, your brother-in-\nlaw, your sister-in-law, your nieces, your nephews. I don\u2019t know \u2014 I can\u2019t make up\nfor all these people. I only know how to be your child, that\u2019s it. And, you know, it\u2019s\n\u2014 she expects it \u2014 something [indecipherable] and wasn\u2019t possible to give to her.\nBut never \u2014 she was \u2014 she felt all alone, and she was all alone. But, I think if she\nwould \u2014 she never gave me a compliment for anything, never, never. And it was\nNovember 9, 2008\nvery stupid. If she would have done that, I would have maybe done more of what\nshe wanted.",
        "A: Like, she never told me she loved me til she was almost dying, but she would tell\nother people, oh she\u2019s so wonderful, I love her so much. That\u2019s not the way to raise\na child. So \u2014 and the insecurity by living alone was terrible, as some \u2014 every child\nworries about what happens if their parents die. You know, children are not stupid,\nthey hear the plane crashes, cat \u2014 car crashes. What happens if \u2014 1f my parents die?\nSo I didn\u2019t have parents, I had my mother alone. And I had, as I said before, I had\none surviving cousin, who moved to Los Angeles, at my mother\u2019s assistant.

When\nmy cousin left, I was 10 years old. As long as he was around, I felt I had a little\nNovember 9, 2008\nmoral support, a little something. So, after he left, I really felt all alone. Now, my\nmother had remarried after the war.",

And my\nmother found somebody she knew from the past, it was a third cousin or something,\nin The Hague, an elderly lady, she would come to visit. I admire my mother, she\ndid try to establish a life for herself. I remember going with her, being in the house,\ngoing out with her. My \u2014 then in \u201946, my cousin came back, he came to visit. They\ntried to live things normal. She tried to get some of her \u2014 the houses back, it was\nvery complicate \u2014",
        "A: Some of them, but that\u2019s a whole different story. Things were kind of \u2014 I \u2014 there\nwas no nursery school, my first school experience was five years old. My mother\nwas smart enough \u2014 there was one Jewish school only in Holland, and my mother,\nthank God, was smart enough to send me to that, and I say smart enough, because\nall of us children had gone through the war, be it in concentration camp, hiding, so\nwe became like a family.

And one of my first memories as I went to shul with my\nmother, to the synagogue and they called up the children to bless the children, and I\nremember all the adults around, everybody was crying, the tear \u2014 crying, and I\ncouldn\u2019t figure out what they\u2019re crying. Of course, now I know why. This was the\nremnant, these were the children that had survived the war, here they were. And\nevery time I see them do that in synagogue on Simkhes Torah, | think back of that\nfirst time. You ne \u2014 you \u2014 certain things just stay with you. You never forget.",

        "A: Yeah, it was my mother. It didn\u2019t bother me. As a matter of fact, I often think\nabout if my mother wouldn\u2019t have come back, and I would have stayed with them,\nif they wouldn\u2019t have told me I would have been a Jewish child, whatever, figured it\nout. I think I would have.",
        "A: I guess I looked different than them. I-I look \u2014 I have very Semitic looks, and I\nthink I would have figured it out. I think there\u2019s a certain \u2014 I think there\u2019s a certain\nwarmth to synagogue, and a certain coldness to church. I think I would have figured\nit out. But I wonder.",

That I never wanted to go back for, I never said I\nNovember 9, 2008\nwant to go to church. It\u2019s interesting that you bring that up, because I never, ever\nsaid I would like to go to church.",
        "A: I would love \u2014 I always loved seeing my foster parents, that I always was happy\nto go, but I never once in my life uttered the phrase, I\u2019d like to go to church again.\nIsn\u2019t that interesting?",
        "A: Absolutely.",

        "A: And she continued that, contrary to some other people that came through the war\nand threw everything away. Now, again, my mother was hidden, she was spared the\ntragedy of the camps. People \u2014 although things weren\u2019t easy, but people were civil\nto her and decent to her. And people that went through the camps saw, of course,\nsuch cruelty that thank God, my mother was spared from. And, like my cousin, who\nbelieves in nothing any more, says, where was God when we needed him? And I la\n\u2014 and my cousin questioned my mother, Tante, why are you still religious? And my\nmother answered him, so if I\u2019m not, would life be better? At least she felt it was\nsomething to hold onto, because she was brought up in that home. And it gave her a\ns \u2014 it gave her life and it did me the same. I went, as I said, to the only Jewish\nschool in Amsterdam, there\u2019s only one Jewish elementary school to this day, it\u2019s\ncalled Rosh Pina, and the high school is now called Maimonides, I went there.\nAnd I\u2019m very grateful my mother didn\u2019t send me to public school because I hear\nwhen I sit in our groups, kids that went \u2014 were sent to public school, they stood out,\nthey were different. Even though th-the \u2014 the Christian children had als \u2014 you know,\nalso had gone through a war, but a totally different experience. They were with their\nparents, they weren\u2019t separated from their families. It was a whole different\nexperience. And they felt strange, and they felt out of place, where even though we\ndidn't talk about our experience, but we all went through the same. And on vacation\nNovember 9, 2008\ntime, when people said, what are you doing on vaca \u2014 oh, I\u2019m going to my foster\nparents, I\u2019m going to my foster parents. And we had very close bonds, and I\u2019m very\ngrateful for that, that was one of the best things my mother ever did, because I\ndidn\u2019t have a family. So \u2014",
        "A: It became \u2014 absolutely.",
        "A: She did. She fa \u2014 she talks \u2014 very interesting, she talked a lot about her own\nfamily, very little about my father. And not too long, not too many years before she\ndied, I said to her once, I said, you know, I'd like to know a little about my father\u2019s\nfamily. You never talk about him, tell me something about my father. She said, he\nwas a very good man, he worked very hard, at night he was tired and he went to\nsleep after he ate. But she was very instrumental in giving me a very vivid picture\nof her life with her parents, with her two brothers and sisters, what that was like.\nThat she \u2014 she talked about a lot. That was important to her.\nNovember 9, 2008\nup in Denmark in a rehabilitation center. And he didn't want to tell his children\nabout what he had gone through. And through his work in this rehabilitation center,\nhe found out that that was a mistake. That when he kept that from him \u2014 from them,\nthey could not get as close to him as they wanted to be. And when he started talking\nto them about his life, his \u2014 you know, the difficult parts, but when he started really\nsaying, this is what my life was made up of, it changed the dynamics. And \u2014 and so,\nit sounds that \u2014 that 1t was a cau \u2014 she \u2014 she was a complicated, amazing woman,\nyour mother.",
        "A: But ag \u2014 but again, she was hidden, and I find that the people that were hidden,\ntalked about their experience much easier than the ones in the concentra \u2014 I \u2014 that \u2014\nthat hell was much harder to talk about.",
        "A: And I think that\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Of course. My only cousin, who I saw a couple of years ago in Los Angeles, and\nI said to him, I said, you know, I know you don\u2019t want to do the Spielberg thing,\nbut I begged him to do the Spielberg thing, or what you are doing, and he wouldn\u2019t\ndo it. I said, for my own personal collection, would you \u2014 and for the tape recorder,\nwould talk with him a little bit? Okay, so he sat down, he talked some basic fact.\nNovember 9, 2008\nBut when it came to anything real, he just got tears in eyes, he said, I don\u2019t want to\ntalk about it. After all these years.

        "A: It\u2019s an irrevocable, but again I \u2014 I credit my foster parents with making the \u2014 |\nhave a lot of friends that are in therapy, and this and that, and I think the love that\nthey were able to give me, in these very early month and years of my life, they very,\nvery important foundation. I\u2019m not in therapy. My kids would probably say you\nbeli-long in therapy, but that\u2019s another story.",
        "A: But \u2014 Ma, you crazy, but that\u2019s a different story. But I function better, I think,\nthan a \u2014 than a lot of other, beca \u2014 because it\u2019s different where you p-pa \u2014 when you\nschlep from home to home, as many of my friends have. They went from place to\nplace, and so in the end wound up even in the camps, after being in hiding.",
        "A: Oh yeah, a lot of the kids went in a hiding place \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, of course. Of course. So, with everything, I consider myself pretty lucky.",
        "A: Oh, okay, okay.",
        "A: Okay. As I told you before, my mother was obsessed with getting out of Europe.\nThe obsession never stopped. She told my cousin to go, and he listened, and as soon\nas the war was over and things started to normalize a little, my mother still wanted\nto get out of what \u2014 of Europe. What happened, she met a man in the late 40s, pr-\nprobably \u00b048 - \u201949, and they wanted to get married. They couldn\u2019t get married right\naway because I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with the fact that you needed death\ncertificates, and the only ones to provide them were the Red Cross. So she needed a\ndeath certificate that her husband had died, and he needed the death certif \u2014 he was\naman, a German Jew, he needed the death certificate that his wife had died. And it\ntook a couple of years, so they finally got married in 1951. And so he was in\nBergen-Belsen in the camps, and it didn\u2019t do any good to his health. And\neventually, he had a heart condition, after three years he died. So in 1954 he died.\nSo my mother was \u2014",
        "A: Very unpleasant memories. He was very resentful of me, because he had an 18\nyear old daughter that died, and my mother\u2019s daughter lived. So he tolerated me. He\nwasn\u2019t bad to me, but he wasn\u2019t any good, and I was a little child when they\nNovember 9, 2008\nmarried. So, you know, it would have been nice to have somebody that is nice to\nyou \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and warm and kind. He tolerated me. He wanted my mother, I was the child,\nhe couldn\u2019t very well say to my mother, get rid of the child. That she wouldn\u2019t have\ndone. So I was tolerated, and I \u2014 I knew it. And it got to the point that I felt so\nunwanted that I was trying to think to myself, I want to get out of here. I don\u2019t \u2014 if\nmy mother wants to be with this man, that\u2019s her story, but I want to get out. And I\nactually hatched a plot how to get out. I had heard about youth aliyah and kids\ngoing to Israel at that point, and I said, you know what? Maybe I can go to youth\naliyah, and I heard about kibbutzim. I said, you know, my \u2014 let me see, maybe I\ncould go on my own to a kibbutz and live there. I don\u2019t want to be with this man\nany more. But that\u2019s up to my mother what she want. And I hate to say it, but when\nhe died, I wasn\u2019t very unhappy. And, so then, after he died, my mother went again\nfor her papers, and HIAS helped people with papers, and we went to \u2014 1955 to\nAmerica for three months.",

        "A: \u2014 how come you stayed in, people didn\u2019t get out, as I said, only people with\nmoney and connections got out. My in-laws lived in Rotterdam. Both my families,\nmy \u2014 my family on my side know that they go back hundreds of years in Holland,\nand my husband\u2019s side also. We\u2019re not Dutch, you know, for one generation that\ncame from Poland, or what. We\u2019re as Dutch, real Dutch Jews. My husband\u2019s\nNovember 9, 2008\nfamily, as I said, lived in Rotterdam. My father-in-law was a physician, my\nmother-in-law for her day was extraordinary well educated. She \u2014 women in those\ndays were educated when they finished elementary school, very well educated if\nthey finished high school, and exceptional to go to the university. My mother-in-law\nwent to the University of Leiden, my \u2014 to study law. My father-in-law went to\nstudy medicine, they met at the university, they got married. My f \u2014 mother-in-law\nactually practiced law in those days, in the 30s and all that. And my father-in-law\nhad a practice in Rotterdam. And they had connections. My f\u2014 mother-in-law\u2019s\nfamily was in the scrap metal business, and there was somebody that they knew that\ngot a group together. And they said, if you can get 50,000 guilders, which is like a\nhalf a million today, or more, you can get out. And he had a group and all \u2014 every\ncouple have to pay 50,000 guilders to get out. And my father and mother-in-law\ndescribed a scene where they went to this Nazi\u2019s place, and the money was piled up\non tables to the ceiling, practically. And they did manage to escape. Their flights \u2014\nSteven Spielberg could make a movie of the story how they got out, via Holland,\nBelgium, France, finally Spain. When they were in Spain, I think for a cou-couple\nof months, and then they finally wound up in Cuba and then to Holland.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: To the United States, I\u2019m sorry. My father-in-law had to get again his license to\nstudy medi \u2014 to practice medicine in America. After he had got that and then they\nmoved to Queens. And there was a Dutch family and they heard, oh, there is a\nDutch doctor in town, let\u2019s go to him. And from being doctor patient relationship,\ndeveloped a very wonderful friendship. I knew that family, they know me, they\nknow my husband and they put us together. So even though we \u2014 my husband was\nraising his second \u2014 that ship that they went to, went to Havana, and then they\ncame to America, so his second birthday was in Havana. And I married a\nDutchman here in America.",

When I came to Holland for a visit, of\ncourse, I went to see them. But I had them come to America. They came together\ntwice as a couple, and then my \u2014 so, they had the pleasure of seeing my children\nand my husband. And of course it\u2019s nice that my husband\u2019s also Dutch, so they\ncould communicate, because they didn\u2019t speak a word of English. And after my\nfoster pa \u2014 father died, she came once alone. And so my neighbors, my friends\naround where I live now, actually met my foster parents, which was very interesting\nfor them. And my daughter remembers them. My son was too young, he doesn\u2019t\nNovember 9, 2008\nremember them, but my daughter remembers them, and like I said, it was really\nsomething for me to hear them sing. They brought du \u2014 books with Dutch songs,\nand they were sitting now singing to my children the songs they sung to me. I really\ncame full cir \u2014 full circle.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Ah, yes, I think it\u2019s very important to know that as much as I have a good life,\nand I\u2019m very grateful for the life I have, 1t never leaves you. Like I said, I don\u2019t\nknow if I said it to you, when I go to weddings, or Bar Mitzvahs or places, and I see\nthe people go into a family picture. And the picture, the le \u2014 wide angle lens isn\u2019t\nwide enough, they fi \u2014 ho-how to fit everybody in. And, you don\u2019t need a wide\nangle lens for my family. They si \u2014 except for my husband, my children and my one\ncousin, and he 1s ac \u2014 older already, he was born in 1924, there is no family. And no\nmatter, you know, you miss that always.",
        "A: You always miss that.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: A long time, thank God, she lived a long life. She died in 1998.",
        "A: She was almost 92 years old. So she saw my children into adulthood. I\u2019m sorry\nshe didn\u2019t see my daughter get married, but she did have that \u2014 and she was \u2014 like\nit\u2019s funny, like you say what else can you add? As I told you, I \u2014 her love for me\nwas very conditional, but my \u2014 her love for my \u2014 my children was totally unc \u2014 she\nadored them. And I often say, you know, kids, you couldn\u2019t do any wrong, and \u2014 I\ncouldn\u2019t do any good, but you couldn\u2019t do anything wrong. And it was really, you\nknow, I\u2019m glad she lived to see my children, because she really, she adored them,\nand they \u2014 they knew it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Also something funny, and I wonder if other people feel that way. When I was\nraising my own children, you just do what you do. You\u2019re busy, yo-you \u2014 yo-you \u2014\nyou \u2014 you go, you change diapers, you make food, you shop, you dress, you bring\nthem to school, whatever it is you do. And I did that. I never stopped to think of\nNovember 9, 2008\nanything else. Now that I have a grandchild, it hits home even more in a way,\nbecause she comes and she goes. I look at this little child and I say, how could these\nbastards have hurt a little child like that? I look at this little girl, she\u2019s now three\nyears old. Some of these little children were left all alone in the world, looking for\nsomebody to hold their hand, to take care of them. How could these bastards, and\nhow can we ever ask to forgive this? Never. When my granddaughter turned four \u2014\nmy daughter knows my whole story, I \u2014 you know, I\u2019ve never been not open about\nit. And when she turned four months old, I said to \u2014 her name is Yerwousha(ph), I\nsaid, Yerwousha(ph), would you imagine your having to give this little girl,\nsomebody coming to your door and somebody taking this child from you? You\nnever know if you will ever see her again. Then she broke out in tears. As much as\nshe knows my story and m-my foster parents, now that she\u2019s a mother herself, she\nunderstands really how it hits home.",
        "A: And what price was paid. And like I said, it hit. And now I see this child, I say,\nhow could they hurt a child? How can you do it? How can any human being do\nthis? It \u2014 it hits me in a way even more now, because I take distance. It never leaves\nyou. It never leaves you. As much as I function and I, you know, do everything I\u2019m\nsupposed to do, I-I think, it never leaves you. It will go with you to your grave.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: It\u2019s true, I mean \u2014",
        "A: \u2019m-\u2014 you know, function an-and do everything and I don\u2019t feel sorry \u2014 don\u2019t\nthink I ever feel sorry for myself. I consider myself the lucky ones. I also don\u2019t have\nsurvivor guilt, like some people have survivor guilt. Why? The world would be\nbetter if I would be dead too? No, at least I\u2019m survived and I have two children an-\nand grandchildren. I don\u2019t have survivor guilt, maybe that\u2019s bad of me, I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "A: I don\u2019t have that at all.",
        "A: A lot of people have that.",
        "A: And my early \u2014 oh, one thing I want to say of my earliest recollect \u2014 you asked\nfor my earliest recollection with my mother. I remember the first years, at least five\nyears after the war, no matter what happened, at some point of the day, my mother\nwould break out in tears and cry. And when you\u2019re a little child, and there are two\npeople in the house, you and her, well, if she\u2019s crying, must be my fault. Now, I\nNovember 9, 2008\nunderstand now, as an adult, of course how she cried, she always thought of \u2014 for\nher relatives. I mean, she missed them terribly. But that\u2019s the environment we grew\nup in. That was it.",
        "A: Take it or leave it, that was it. But I\u2019m very lucky because I have a wonderful\nhusband, a really sweet, nice guy and I have wonderful healthy children and a\nhealthy grandchild, with another one on the way, so I\u2019m really the lucky one.",
        "A: Listen, there \u2014 there are lots of other tragedies.",
        "A: You\u2019re very welcome.",
        "A: Jose.",
        "A: You said nine before.\n54November 9, 2008",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Wait a min \u2014 we can look in my book.",
