        "A: Used to be a big place, but it\u2019s gone.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Oh. And did you go to school there and through high school there?",

        "Q: Why did you decide to become a nurse?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a long story. When I was a kid, I wanted to be a librarian, but I did a\nwhole lot of nursing all my life, with six siblings and I was the oldest. After I got out\nof high school, I was too young to go to nurse\u2019s training, so I did practical nursing in\nour neighborhood. So my aunt decided -- who was a nurse, decided that I need that I\nneed to be a nurse. And I had no funds to g -- be a librarian, so I went into nursing.\nAnd I enjoyed it, yeah. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m in it.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And after I graduated from Saint Luke\u2019s down here, then I took a job at Saint\nLuke\u2019s, until I went in the service.",

        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And how did you decide to go in the service?",
        "A: Well, I was working nights with a friend and I didn\u2019t like the work. And I wanted\nto get in the service, so I had to keep fighting with my director and the Red Cross to\nget in. That was it, I wanted to go.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "Q: Did your family want you to go?",
        "A: Oh, they -- they wouldn\u2019t -- I was independent [inaudible] family [inaudible]",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t matter?",

        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Worked my way through school and so forth.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Did -- what -- what -- what were you saying about the Red Cross\nand --",
        "A: Well, at that time our director of nursing was involved with the Red Cross\nrecruitment. She wouldn\u2019t let me go from the hospital for awhile.",
        "Q: She wouldn\u2019t let you leave?",
        "A: No, wouldn\u2019t let me leave the hospital job that I had. It was essential, they called it\nessential at that time. And after asking her two or three different times, she finally\nconsented to let -- release me. So I entered in, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And where did you do your basic training?",
        "A: I did my basic training in Atlantic City.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. With a lot of these other women here?",
        "A: Yes, with Claire Fikes was here, yeah. She was in my class. And [indecipherable]\nwas in a class before me or after me. All Atlantic City.",
        "Q: How was that? [indecipherable]\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Well, it was rough, because it wasn\u2019t nursing. We marched, you know, 20 miles\nand with a pack on your back, in the sand down there, in the hot sun in June and July.\nAnd we all had shots for all different kinds of diseases and after they gave us the shots\nthey told us we could have a weekend home and nobody -- everybody was too sick to\ngo home. So we just stayed in the hotels down there, where they billeted us until we\nwere Si -- reassigned.",
        "Q: That was what, six weeks or so?",
        "A: Six weeks we had there and then we were reassigned to different hospitals. And I\nwas reassigned to Tilton, which is in Fort -- Fort Dix, New Jersey, near Trenton.\nAnd then when they got the 131st unit together, we were picked out to go down to\nSouth Carolina, to train again.",
        "Q: And what kind of training was that?",
        "A: And down there it was learning how to dig a foxhole and how to set up a tent. More\nwalking, more training. That\u2019s about all I remember of that down there. Hot. Yeah,\nbarracks living and -- when you\u2019re young it doesn\u2019t, you know, you take it as it comes.\nI came off the farm with no -- we had no facilities at the farm, so you know, camping\nwas second nature.",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t bother you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you like it?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. Yeah, I enjoyed the girls, you know, we all had a good time, yeah.\nWe\u2019d go into town, you know, after we were all finished and then we were -- had\nblisters on our feet and whatnot and we were tired, but we\u2019d still go in and have a\ngood time and those that drank, course, had a better time, I guess. I just went arane --\nalong for the ride because I never drank and -- and had to -- I had the -- what do you\nsay, moniker of being the orange juice girl all the way through.",
        "Q: Because you just drank orange juice when you went [indecipherable]",
        "A: Because I enjoy -- when I went to a party of any kind, I drank orange juice, mm-\nhm, so --",
        "Q: Then when did you go over?",
        "A: Then we -- let\u2019s see, was December, before Christmas. We boarded the boat. We\ncame up by train of course to Camp Kilmer and then onto New York, where we\nboarded the Queen Elizabeth. That plancake -- that gangplank looked pretty bad. We\ndidn\u2019t want to go, when we got there.",
        "Q: How did it loo -- how did it look?",
        "A: Was a long way up and we knew we were leaving, you know and --",
        "Q: Feeling sad?",
        "A: The -- th-the final, the -- yeah, the final thing you know. Before that 1t was\nadventure, but at this point we were leaving the USA you know, and family. That\nJuly 15, 1995\nmade a difference, especially at Christmastime. Course we landed over there before\nChristmas, but -- and --",
        "Q: What was the crossing like?",
        "A: Crossing wasn\u2019t bad. We were only three or four days going over, you know, three\n-- nights. I had a harmonica that one of my neighbors had given me, so I entertained\nmyself with that. Sat in the porthole, we had 17 in the stateroom. I took the top bunk\nand I was up under a ventilator pipe of some sort, you know, of the ship, but at least I\nwas on top. The rest of them that were sick were on the bottom. And we went over\nfully clothed.",
        "Q: Sleeping, you mean?",
        "A: Fully clothed all the time.",
        "Q: In case there was an evacuation?",
        "A: And a -- yeah, with your life jacket on, yeah, because the submarines were chasing\nthe -- there was always a sub pack chasing the Queen Elizabeth and she was a\nzigzagger and she went about 30 what do they call it? Hm. Not miles, but --",
        "Q: Kilometers?",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Or knot -- 30 knot [indecipherable]",
        "A: Knots. 30 knots, they call it. And she zigzagged all the time, so of course you\u2019re --\nyou\u2019re all like this all the time, but --\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "Q: Was it a smooth crossing?",
        "A: Yeah, we didn\u2019t have any -- other than the zigzagging, we didn\u2019t have any\nproblems, that I know of, and --",
        "Q: The ship was crowded?",
        "A: 15,000 troops. Now they put 1500 on, you know, one of those ships, for\nentertainment, whatnot. So we were crowded. The boys slept on the deck, they swung\nfrom hammocks and slept along the railings and whatever, you know. We --we girls\nhad the bunks, of course, but we were stacked -- I think it was four high and two sets\ngoing that way and two sets coming across this way, so you just had an aisle down the\nmiddle to the john over here and we all shared one little stateroom john.",
        "Q: 17 of you?",
        "A: The salt water in one -- yeah. And then we had to spend twice a day going up three\nor four decks to a meal. And by the time they got back down, was time to turn around\nand go back up for the other meal.",
        "Q: Hurry up and wait.",
        "A: Yeah. So it was two meals a day and -- British type, you know, it wasn\u2019t American\nstyle. Fish and chips and oh, all their fish din-dinners, yeah. And we sat with -- they\nhad, oh, like a three or four inch ridge around the table to keep the di-dishes on the\ntable, because of the zigzagging, and --",
        "Q: To keep the dishes from falling off the table?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Yeah, off on your lap, sure, yeah, yeah. And it was -- it was good food, it just was\ndifferent, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And do you remember landing, when you --",
        "A: Yeah, we landed in Scotland. Greenock, Scotland. And took a train down to\nEngland and they -- was beautiful country, but it was awful cold. And they landed us\ndown in a -- below Manchester in a place called Alteringham, where we were\nassigned a -- a big house. All they had was little fireplaces in each room, very cold and\nthe fire didn\u2019t keep the room warm. And in order to keep the fires going, we had to\nthrow straw out of our mattresses that they had given us, to keep it going. And then\neventually the house we were in got burned down and we had to move to another\nhouse.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: Fireplace burned through. Got too big a fire in the fireplaces. And we had to move\nto another house. And then we were on quarantine all that time. I\u2019ve forgotten just how\nmany hours, but anyway it was over Christmas.",
        "Q: What does that mean, on quarantine?",
        "A: We couldn\u2019t go anywhere. We had to stay either -- in the perimeter of the house,\nsee?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Or -- well, we weren\u2019t allowed out around anybody. That\u2019s -- quarantine is one of\nthe things they do when you land in an area from here.",
        "Q: Why -- why?",
        "A: I suppose so we don\u2019t give diseases to anybody or pass anything along or -- to the\nenemy or whatever, you know. And -- so as -- we were billeted and had to stay there,\nexcept to go to our meals, which we -- we would walk to a certain place to get our\nmeals, then walk back. I don\u2019t know -- was part of a mile. And so it came Christmas\neve and we were still quarantined and the captain said, anybody that\u2019s Catholic can go\nto midnight mass, they allowed that. So everybody was Catholic, we all went to\nmidnight mass. Snow all around, you know, up like this, and a beautiful, beautiful\nchurch. We couldn\u2019t all get in the church, so we were outside, but we went to midnight\nmass and we got away from the house. Protestants, Jewish, Catholic, whatever you\nwere, you know. We were all the same the night. It didn\u2019t matter, it was Christmas\neve, you know. And that\u2019s all I remember of there. All I can remember 1s the girls do\nwith their helmets, they put their helmets on the bunks and filled them full of lipstick\nand incidentals and then when the sirens went off, they had to have their helmet on\ntheir head, everything got dumped on their heads.",
        "Q: They have drills fo -- is that what the sirens were?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: No, just the sirens in the -- in the English area at the time, because there were -- be\nbombs and planes and so forth going over, so when the warning came, the sirens went\noff and you were supposed to protect yourself. That was the way we did it.",
        "Q: Was the place where you -- the town where you were bombed while you were\nthere?",
        "A: Not that I know of, no, no. The only place I ever saw any bombs was in London.\nAnd -- while we were on leave once, that\u2019s all. But no, we were never bombed there.\nAnd eventually, the people in the town, around Christmastime, there, took us 1n for\ndinner. And we had -- I had a real good experience on one of those, because they\ninvited three of us to dinner that didn\u2019t drink. And so we went to tea. And they didn\u2019t\nhave much to eat, but before they did, they had what they call gin and tonics. We had\nno idea what they were, but we didn\u2019t dare refuse. So three of us ate gin and -- drank\ngin and tonics, promptly fell asleep. I'll never forget that. And boy were they mortified\nto find out we didn\u2019t drink, but they\u2019d given us drinks, you know. But they thought all\nAmericans drank, so. But anyway, we had a nice dinner and they were very good to\nus, you know. And we went to an English dance while we were there -- doing the\nhokey-pokey. I suppose you\u2019ve heard of that? That\u2019s all you knew.",
        "Q: Were you nursing -- doing any nursing",
        "A: Let\u2019s see -- yes, well after -- see, af-after that, when they took us out of the\nquarantine time, we were all sent to detached service, different hospitals. And I was\nJuly 15, 1995\nsent to one near Chester. And was assigned to a hospital, established hospital there\nand all of their wards went around a circle where the nurses were. There was ward --\nlike a spider, all the way around. And my job at the time, was this ward full of -- all\nthese wards were filled with venereal diseases. All the boys that were, you know,\n[indecipherable] had parties.",
        "Q: GIs?",
        "A: Yeah. And so, I was assigned to give them penicillin. At the time, penicillin was\njust coming out. So I would take my little tray, about so big and a great big syringe,\nI'll never forget it, about that long and a -- a bunch of needles and that was full of\npenicillin, you go along and you\u2019d just -- as you -- as you came out, the boys would\njust roll over. They knew they were getting it, so just roll over and be ready for you,\nyou know? And that was my job, all the way around the spider, just to pass out\npenicillin. Supposed to be a cure, you know, until next time. And --",
        "Q: Did it work?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I never saw the boys again, you know, just one round after the other,\nby the time you got around here, why they were gone out the other way. So, that was\nmy experience on detached service and living in cold, Quonset huts. Concrete floors\nand they were always wet, you know. And there was snow, of course, everywhere.\nAnd, so that -- I had a chance to visit Chester and the Roman wall and all the nice\nthings like that, so -- so we really enjoyed that, you know. And from there we were\nJuly 15, 1995\nsent back to Alteringham, where we all assembled and were sent overseas, eventually,\nin -- I think we went in March.",
        "Q: Across the channel?",
        "A: Across the channel on the Sobiesky. Yeah, we were overnight on the ship, which I\nheard later was bombed, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: With troops that were going over also?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t remember any troops going, it might have been -- our hospital unit\nmight have [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know, but we were all sent over the channel and\nwe were on it overnight, cause we slept on the ship and landed in France. And from\nthen on we just kept traveling, yeah.",
        "Q: You were the -- you went east and you went to --",
        "A: We went to Paris and we stopped in Paris and got something to eat at lunchtime\nand all our gear. We went into a nice, beautiful restaurant, with waitresses with little --\nlittle frilly aprons on and caps on, you know, and here we are with mud caked and --\nand all of our outfit on, you know, as we were traveling. [indecipherable] bag on your\nback and all these heavy clothes. And we had dinner there and then they put us on\ntrucks to go on to a -- well, we went to Sedan and Sedan is where we -- we did some\ndrilling as far as our hospital unit goes and made -- made gauze packages and things\nfor a hospital unit and got ready to have a set up. And trained from there on. And we --\nJuly 15, 1995\nthen we -- let\u2019s see, where did we go from the Sedan? We stopped at a boy\u2019s school\novernight somewhere. That was a big French school. And --",
        "Q: Do you know where sa -- is the name of the city Sedan?",
        "A: Sedan, uh-huh",
        "Q: Do you know where that is?",
        "A: It\u2019s around Reims, Versailles, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t was near your well known during the\nWorld War One.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: Not too far from Paris?",
        "A: No, not too far, no. And like I say, we went -- traveled there and then we overnight\nto another place and -- and on through Luxembourg. Oh, I\u2019ve forgotten -- into\nGermany.",
        "Q: So when you got to Germany, then [indecipherable] the first place they set up\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: In Germany is where we first set up the hospital to use, yeah. And took care of our\nwounded GIs. And I had a post-op ward, so as they came out of surgery, they came\ninto my tent. They were given all medications that they needed and bandage care and\nwe did their -- we did their baths as we could, out of their helmets. They had to bring\ntheir own helmets and we did baths out of the helmets and I had one little German boy\nJuly 15, 1995\nthat had been throwing grenades and he had an arm taken off and course all these GIs\ndidn\u2019t like him because he was a enemy. So I had to watch him carefully. And -- but I\nhad a nice ward boy and he [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Because you were afraid that they\u2019d --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- do something? But did they?",
        "A: They never did, no, no, they were -- they were kind enough. But that was what we\nwere always scared of, because you know, all of us hated them, really, you know, from\nseeing what they did to the boys. And whatever happened to him, I don\u2019t know, but\nthey shipped him out from my ward. And our boys were shipped out as they -- as soon\nas we got them taken care of and they were ready to travel, why they went on out too,\nby plane, yeah.",
        "Q: How -- how long would they stay with you in that ward?",
        "A: Well, it depended on how bad they were. You know, some of them could go within\na week and some could -- had to stay. But we were only set up for a short time\nanyway, you know, so I only saw a turnover a couple of times, really. And then they\nwere transferred on to some other hospital, if they couldn\u2019t make the trip all the way\nacross, you know. And th -- we picked up behind General Patton, and so, like we\nalways said, we were the fastest moving hospital --",
        "Q: Moving fast.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: -- in the CTO, you know? Because we just kept on going until we hit the\nconcentration camp.",
        "Q: Yeah. When you were caring for those men in that post-operative ward, y-y-you\nmust have had a chance to talk with them?",
        "A: Some, yeah, some.",
        "Q: What did they want to talk about or --",
        "A: Oh, they were just glad to see you, you know, and -- and sometimes you wrote a\nletter, 1f you could, you know, for them. We didn\u2019t have any Red Cross to help us. So\nyou wrote a letter if you could or did what you could for whatever they wanted. But\nthere really wasn\u2019t much time, you know, spent with them and I suppose some forward\nhospital could, you know, because we just didn\u2019t have the facilities, really. Just --",
        "Q: Would it be just one person on duty there in that ward at a time?",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, well, it\u2019d be one nurse. They\u2019d have a night nurse and a day\nnurse, I was a day nurse and | had a -- a corpsman that was very apt. He was a pre-med\nstudent. So he could give plasma or transfusions, so forth. So all I had to do was give\nmedications and whatever care -- the bandages and so forth, that they needed. He went\naround and gave all the -- all the [Vs and the plasma stuff, yeah. And -- but I did have\ncontrol of the medicines, he would -- he couldn\u2019t give those.",
        "Q: Did you like that work?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Oh yes. That\u2019s hospital work, that\u2019s nurses work, you know, yeah. If you can ease\ntheir pain, you know, and make them feel -- but you know, when you\u2019re young, you\ncan\u2019t be their mother, even though you\u2019re a nurse, you know, but you have to take\ntheir place, you know, and do the best you can. Big sister, whatever, you know and\nsince I\u2019d had a lot of it at home, why, you know, just comes second nature, yeah. And",
        "Q: And then you packed up and --",
        "A: They packed us up in the middle of the night and shipped us off to a place near the\nconcentration camp. I think it was Bamburg, I\u2019m not sure, but I think it was there,\nwhere we were assigned to a -- a hospital that was already there, in the field and the\ncolonel wouldn\u2019t let us go on with the boys. The boys all went ahead of us to take care\nof the camp before the nurses were taken in. And probably was at least a week before\nwe were allowed in to the camp. And it was quite a shock, you know.",
        "Q: Did they prepare you for that?",
        "A: The colonel just told us we\u2019re -- that we\u2019re going and that we didn\u2019t have to go if\nwe didn\u2019t want to. And that it was pretty bad. But we all -- we were there for a\npurpose, so we -- we went, you know.",
        "Q: Did you discuss it among yourselves?",
        "A: No. Was no problem, no problem. We were all waiting to go, you know? Sitting\naround there in the sun in Germany, we were just waiting to go. And we hadn\u2019t had\nJuly 15, 1995\nthat much activity, that one -- one set up, you know, was all we really had had of\nactivity. It was a busy one at the time, but so short -- so short a time. But that\u2019s what\nan evacuation hospital is, you just keep on going. And --",
        "Q: You can put that however you want.",
        "A: Well, it just fell off there, I didn\u2019t want to pull anything.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But -- so like I say, we moved and when they climbed out of the back of the truck,\nwhy it was -- was too much of a jump for me, I guess and too much weight on my\nfoot, so --",
        "Q: You broke your foot?",
        "A: So I had what they call a march fracture. And since I\u2019d never heard of a march\nfracture, none of the girls had, why he presented me to the medical staff. So I was the\nfirst guinea pig over there for that. And then I ran around -- as I say, I ran around with\na ga -- pair of galoshes on and of course it was muddy and that rubber just pulled, you\nknow, on that foot. It was no fun. But I -- I worked for about three days and --",
        "Q: So, first three days of the --",
        "A: So the first three days of -- that we were there --",
        "Q: You were --",
        "A: I was assigned to this ward C and we were all corralled in -- in a office and pumped\nfull of DDT and --\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "Q: They would spray it in your clothes?",
        "A: Oh, in your hair -- we had turbans -- in your hair and down your clothes and down\nthe waistband and into your legs and so forth, so you were covered, because these\npatients had typhus and all sorts of diseases. And then you were assigned a stack of\nmedicine, which was sulfa at the time, the only thing they had was sulfadiazene. And\na great big pitcher of water, there\u2019d be two of you. One take a bigger -- big pitcher of\nwater and the other all these pills and the guard, because a guard always had to be with\nus, we weren\u2019t to touch anybody. And the first -- my first [indecipherable]\nrecollection of seeing them, was a great rack of three or four tier wooden bunks and as\nfar back as that -- toward the wall, you could see was probably five or six patients at\nleast, some on top of the other, all skin and bones and the fellas had given some of\nthem I'V\u2019s and transfusions and -- and plasma. And some of them were dead, with\nthese things still running, you know and so anybody that looked like they were half\nalive, you\u2019d ask them if they had diarrhea. If they did, you gave them a handful of pills\nto swallow with a glass of water, if they could get 1t down and how many others in that\nsame tier and then you go on to the next one, you know. And they were just naked on -\n- on these things and of course naive little nurses, you know, I -- we\u2019d had hospital\nnursing, but to see all these naked men and you know and all bones, couldn\u2019t speak,\nsome of them. Of course, none of them could speak English. And -- real sad, real sad.\nCause you knew you wouldn\u2019t see them -- next time, next round around, you wouldn\u2019t\nJuly 15, 1995\nsee those same people, they\u2019d be dead, you know. Very few of them that came out.\nAnd -- was real rough. But like I say, I spent about three days in and then we had this\naccident so, I didn\u2019t get back down to the camp, except to eat, you know. Three of us\nwere laid up in the same room.",
        "Q: Tell me about the accident. Well, General Gavin, 15th army had a -- was having a\nbig party over in Linz, which was about 10 miles away and ever -- al-all the party girls\nof course wanted to go and they went and a lot of them had dates and whatnot. And\nthe general sent -- was going to send transportation for us. And our group didn\u2019t want\nto go, we were going to stay --",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t party girls?",
        "A: We weren\u2019t party girls, we didn\u2019t drink, we didn\u2019t party. One of them was married -\n- two of them were married. And, you know, we just didn\u2019t want to go. And the\ncaptain, our chief -- our chief nurse, ordered us to go. So we had to get dressed -- all\ndressed up in our finery and our class A uniform and wait for the transportation and\nwhen it came, course we had to get in the Jeep we were assigned and the one that we\ngot into, the fellow was drunk.",
        "Q: Did you know that right away?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know it right away, til we got started. He had -- we found out that he\nhad put water in the gas tank.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: To -- well, I don\u2019t know the reason. I don\u2019t really know the reason, but anyway,\nsince he put this water -- probably -- maybe cause he was drunk, he had put this in and\nhe knew he had to keep up with the others, because he didn\u2019t know for sure whether he\nwas going to make it or not. So he was driving a very fast pace. I wouldn\u2019t know how\nfast, I would say 80 miles an hour, but I don\u2019t know. But in this mud and slick stuff.\nAnd --",
        "Q: It was raining and it was dark?",
        "A: Raining and was black as ace of spades and we didn\u2019t even know where we were.\nAnd we were -- I don\u2019t -- I think maybe we were last -- last bunch out and as we went\ndown the road, the one girl was Catholic, she was saying her rosary. The other two\nwere Ser -- praying 1n the back seat and the girl in the front seat was hanging on and all\nof a sudden we went right off -- it was an -- a big apple tree in this curve and we went\nright over -- sailed right over that apple tree and landed right down in -- a -- over a\nbank, I don\u2019t remember how deep it was. The girl in the front seat -- well, the driver\nwas flopped out and he was all right, he was drunk. The girl in the front seat hit the\nwindshield, she had a concussion. One of the girls in the back seat had a long gash in\nher leg and she was tied up under the Jeep. The other girl -- I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t\nremember what damage she had, but she and the other were under the back seats. I was\nthrown out, half my clothes off and I was the only one able to get up the bank and wait\nfor somebody to come back and find us, when we didn\u2019t show up. Lady Feldhusen\nJuly 15, 1995\nwas one of the group that came back and found us. And to this day, they never put\nanything in the records. This makes us very unhappy. But, like I say, we were laid up\nthen, taken back to the clinic and fixed up and taken up to our quarters, where we laid,\nside by side on cots in one room. Were taken down to meals, they came and sent a\ntruck up and we were taken down to meals at the camp and then brought back home\nagain and that\u2019s where we were until we came home. And then they told me -- I was\non crutches and they told me that if I didn\u2019t throw the crutches away, I had to stay over\nthere. Well, the rest of the group were coming home and one of the girls husband was\nover there, so she was going to stay. That was all right with her, but I wanted to come\nhome. So I threw the crutches away and hobbled onto the ship when they finally got\nthere. They were assigned to come home. They thought they were going to fly us\nhome, but then something happened to the plane, so they brought us home by train,\nacross the continent, in wooden -- wooden bench trains with no windows. And we\nslept on th-those overnight, you know, on the trips. And we stopped along the way and\ngot our meals at a -- a tent camp, where they had food set up. Raining, pitchforks and\nhammer handles and your tray was full of peaches and mashed potatoes and whatever,\nall mixed up together and hailstorms and the tents were full of holes. P\u2019Il never forget\nit. And I\u2019ve forgotten how many days we were coming across. Then they camped us\non the banks of the Seine and that wasn\u2019t very -- very nice camp, but it was just a\nholding camp. And some of the boys from another outfit felt sorry for the nurses, so\nJuly 15, 1995\nthey invited us that -- to come over to Deauville, which was a resort, you know,\noriginally and probably still is -- and spend some time over there in a hotel, so we had\n-- we spent some time in the hotel in the swimming areas and so forth, so we had a\ngood time there -- until we were -- actually til we were aboard ships -- and aboard ship\nand we were sent a Navy ship, US Navy, Bliss and we had ice cream and everything\nwe wanted coming home, nice clean sheets and everything, til we landed in Boston.\nAnd that was a good -- we had a good crossing, we had no problems with that either,\nyou know. Til we landed in Boston and all the fire whistles and whatnot. Put us on a\ntrain and headed us for Trenton again.",
        "Q: At Gusen, did you have -- did you have any impression at the time about who those\npeople were in the camp? Did you know, or did any --",
        "A: Oh, they were all foreign -- there weren\u2019t any -- if there were any that spoke\nEnglish, 1t was probably broken English, so I had never heard any speak English. I\nknow there were some there, because there were a lot of professionals there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I never spoke to them, so I wouldn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: But at the time, did you have -- did you know who they were and why they were\nthere? Did anybody tell you?",
        "A: Mm, not at the time we went in. Well, we learned this while we were there, you\nknow. And --\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "Q: You knew that it was a concentration camp?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. We were told that before we went there. And that it was so\ngruesome that we shouldn\u2019t go. And we knew this, because they\u2019d sent the boys on\nahead, you know. And it must have been bad. But you don\u2019t really comprehend until\nyou actually are in it, you know? You see all these walking skeletons, no clothes and\nthen, you know, they had some women there. Not too many around where we were.\nAnd then, of course we were taken on a brief tour of the crematorium and the -- and\nthe gas chambers and that kind of thing. And you gradually understood what was\ngoing on, you know. But I\u2019ve learned a lot more since, you know, since leaving there -\n- since the war.",
        "Q: Did you know at the time, that this was going on in other places as well?",
        "A: No. No, I don\u2019t believe I did. In fact I don\u2019t believe I'd knew about this until we\nactually got down there in Germany. Because we were following Patton and we were\ntrying to take your own boys, you know, so you really didn\u2019t understand that these\nother things were going on until you actually got in there. I don\u2019t believe I ever did,\nno. And y-you just can\u2019t believe such things can happen, you know. Just can\u2019t. And\nthat people on the outside never knew about it. Just -- 1t -- just impossible.",
        "Q: Mean -- what do you mean?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: People -- farmers that lived, you know, right outside the wall. They were farming\nfields and everything right where we lived and everything and they didn\u2019t even know\nanything about it. You know, denial.",
        "Q: They said that? Did you talk to them?",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t, no. But this was what was going on, you know. Some of the -- the\nfellas with the, you know, the armor division and stuff like that, they had linguists and\nstuff with them that could understand. But the farming went on just as normal as could\nbe, around them and -- til the boys went out and rounded everybody up to come in and\nhelp at the camp and then I\u2019m sure they knew, but --",
        "Q: They brought in people from Linz to work --",
        "A: Yeah. All around the area, they we -- just went out and whoever was loose, they\nbrought them in and put them to work. This is before us girls came, help get the bodies\nin the graves and whatnot, and the -- so the chaplain could have his services and you\nsaw the pictures of the big cemeteries of course, that we had, you know -- but he did a\ngreat job, but -- just weren\u2019t enough of our boys to do it all, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah. I want to ask you one more question.",
        "A: Mm-hm. What is -- having witnessed people who were victims of the Holocaust,\nwhat a -- what do you think about that now, 50 years later? What -- how did it -- how\ndid it change you?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: How did it change me? Well, just going over there, I -- just a little bit more about\nEurope and seeing the pay -- the people with all their, you know, languages that I\ndidn\u2019t understand, it was overwhelming, because you couldn\u2019t communicate. I don\u2019t\nknow, I was just happy to see those that could leave and very sad about those that\ncouldn\u2019t, you know? And I just hoped it never happened again and now it\u2019s happening\nagain, you know, I just -- I couldn\u2019t even watch Schindler\u2019s List or any of those. I -- I\nwatched this one they showed downstairs through once, I couldn\u2019t do it again. And --",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: I\u2019m an old sentimentalist, I guess, you know. Very sad, very sad thing. I can\u2019t even\nwatch a funeral. I went to my aunt\u2019s funeral, but I had to get out fast, you know, I just\ncan\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know what there -- what there 1s --",
        "Q: You get too -- you get emotional?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can\u2019t do it. Didn\u2019t even go to my own father\u2019s funeral. But\n-- I got criticized for it, but I yust couldn\u2019t do it. Yes, it\u2019s -- it -- like I say, when you\u2019re\nyoung at that time, it makes an awful impression and it stays with you.",
        "Q: It stays with you?",
        "A: Oh yeah, it will stay with you.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: Forget about it?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: No way. No way. My grandmother denied it ever happened.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, til the day she went to her grave, yup.",
        "Q: Did you try and discuss it?",
        "A: I showed her pictures, I talked to her and she was old, firm Baptist and nothing like\nthat could happen because she just knew it couldn\u2019t happen, you know? There weren\u2019t\npeople like that.",
        "Q: There weren\u2019t -- people weren\u2019t that bad, you mean?",
        "A: There weren\u2019t people like that wouldn\u2019t do anything to another human being. My\nmother never had an opinion and she hasn\u2019t to this day. She\u2019s 94 now. But my brother\nwent over and he saw. He went over when I came home and transported a lot of them\nback home, transported the POWs, the Germans, different places and put them to\nwork and he couldn\u2019t believe it either til he saw all these people walking around like\nskeletons, still you know, when he went over. All of them going back to their own\nhomes. And so there are some, you know, that\u2019Il deny if forever, probably. Yeah. But\nI'll never forget it and I know the girls won\u2019t forget it either.

        "Q: And you think they were covering up for that GI because he was drunk, or because\nthey made you go to the party?",

Why didn\u2019t our chief nurse\nput it in, or our -- our colonel? And that was one thing that hurt. They never even came\nto see you, you know. The three of us were up there.

        "A: Well, I was working nights with a friend and I didn\u2019t like the work. And I wanted\nto get in the service, so I had to keep fighting with my director and the Red Cross to\nget in. That was it, I wanted to go.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Oh, they -- they wouldn\u2019t -- I was independent [inaudible] family [inaudible]",
        "A: I'd been working since I was 12 years old, away from home, so it didn\u2019t matter, no.",
        "A: Worked my way through school and so forth.",
        "A: Well, at that time our director of nursing was involved with the Red Cross\nrecruitment. She wouldn\u2019t let me go from the hospital for awhile.",
        "A: No, wouldn\u2019t let me leave the hospital job that I had. It was essential, they called it\nessential at that time. And after asking her two or three different times, she finally\nconsented to let -- release me. So I entered in, yeah.",
        "A: I did my basic training in Atlantic City.",
        "A: Yes, with Claire Fikes was here, yeah. She was in my class. And [indecipherable]\nwas in a class before me or after me. All Atlantic City.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Well, it was rough, because it wasn\u2019t nursing. We marched, you know, 20 miles\nand with a pack on your back, in the sand down there, in the hot sun in June and July.\nAnd we all had shots for all different kinds of diseases and after they gave us the shots\nthey told us we could have a weekend home and nobody -- everybody was too sick to\ngo home. So we just stayed in the hotels down there, where they billeted us until we\nwere Si -- reassigned.",
        "A: Six weeks we had there and then we were reassigned to different hospitals. And I\nwas reassigned to Tilton, which is in Fort -- Fort Dix, New Jersey, near Trenton.\nAnd then when they got the 131st unit together, we were picked out to go down to\nSouth Carolina, to train again.",
        "A: And down there it was learning how to dig a foxhole and how to set up a tent. More\nwalking, more training. That\u2019s about all I remember of that down there. Hot. Yeah,\nbarracks living and -- when you\u2019re young it doesn\u2019t, you know, you take it as it comes.\nI came off the farm with no -- we had no facilities at the farm, so you know, camping\nwas second nature.",
        "A: No.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. Yeah, I enjoyed the girls, you know, we all had a good time, yeah.\nWe\u2019d go into town, you know, after we were all finished and then we were -- had\nblisters on our feet and whatnot and we were tired, but we\u2019d still go in and have a\ngood time and those that drank, course, had a better time, I guess. I just went arane --\nalong for the ride because I never drank and -- and had to -- I had the -- what do you\nsay, moniker of being the orange juice girl all the way through.",
        "A: Because I enjoy -- when I went to a party of any kind, I drank orange juice, mm-\nhm, so --",
        "A: Then we -- let\u2019s see, was December, before Christmas. We boarded the boat. We\ncame up by train of course to Camp Kilmer and then onto New York, where we\nboarded the Queen Elizabeth. That plancake -- that gangplank looked pretty bad. We\ndidn\u2019t want to go, when we got there.",
        "A: Was a long way up and we knew we were leaving, you know and --",
        "A: The -- th-the final, the -- yeah, the final thing you know. Before that 1t was\nadventure, but at this point we were leaving the USA you know, and family. That\nJuly 15, 1995\nmade a difference, especially at Christmastime. Course we landed over there before\nChristmas, but -- and --",
        "A: Crossing wasn\u2019t bad. We were only three or four days going over, you know, three\n-- nights. I had a harmonica that one of my neighbors had given me, so I entertained\nmyself with that. Sat in the porthole, we had 17 in the stateroom. I took the top bunk\nand I was up under a ventilator pipe of some sort, you know, of the ship, but at least I\nwas on top. The rest of them that were sick were on the bottom. And we went over\nfully clothed.",
        "A: Fully clothed all the time.",
        "A: And a -- yeah, with your life jacket on, yeah, because the submarines were chasing\nthe -- there was always a sub pack chasing the Queen Elizabeth and she was a\nzigzagger and she went about 30 what do they call it? Hm. Not miles, but --",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Knots. 30 knots, they call it. And she zigzagged all the time, so of course you\u2019re --\nyou\u2019re all like this all the time, but --\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Yeah, we didn\u2019t have any -- other than the zigzagging, we didn\u2019t have any\nproblems, that I know of, and --",
        "A: 15,000 troops. Now they put 1500 on, you know, one of those ships, for\nentertainment, whatnot. So we were crowded. The boys slept on the deck, they swung\nfrom hammocks and slept along the railings and whatever, you know. We --we girls\nhad the bunks, of course, but we were stacked -- I think it was four high and two sets\ngoing that way and two sets coming across this way, so you just had an aisle down the\nmiddle to the john over here and we all shared one little stateroom john.",
        "A: The salt water in one -- yeah. And then we had to spend twice a day going up three\nor four decks to a meal. And by the time they got back down, was time to turn around\nand go back up for the other meal.",
        "A: Yeah. So it was two meals a day and -- British type, you know, it wasn\u2019t American\nstyle. Fish and chips and oh, all their fish din-dinners, yeah. And we sat with -- they\nhad, oh, like a three or four inch ridge around the table to keep the di-dishes on the\ntable, because of the zigzagging, and --\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Yeah, off on your lap, sure, yeah, yeah. And it was -- it was good food, it just was\ndifferent, you know?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, we landed in Scotland. Greenock, Scotland. And took a train down to\nEngland and they -- was beautiful country, but it was awful cold. And they landed us\ndown in a -- below Manchester in a place called Alteringham, where we were\nassigned a -- a big house. All they had was little fireplaces in each room, very cold and\nthe fire didn\u2019t keep the room warm. And in order to keep the fires going, we had to\nthrow straw out of our mattresses that they had given us, to keep it going. And then\neventually the house we were in got burned down and we had to move to another\nhouse.",
        "A: Fireplace burned through. Got too big a fire in the fireplaces. And we had to move\nto another house. And then we were on quarantine all that time. I\u2019ve forgotten just how\nmany hours, but anyway it was over Christmas.",
        "A: We couldn\u2019t go anywhere. We had to stay either -- in the perimeter of the house,\nsee?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Or -- well, we weren\u2019t allowed out around anybody. That\u2019s -- quarantine is one of\nthe things they do when you land in an area from here.",
        "A: I suppose so we don\u2019t give diseases to anybody or pass anything along or -- to the\nenemy or whatever, you know. And -- so as -- we were billeted and had to stay there,\nexcept to go to our meals, which we -- we would walk to a certain place to get our\nmeals, then walk back. I don\u2019t know -- was part of a mile. And so it came Christmas\neve and we were still quarantined and the captain said, anybody that\u2019s Catholic can go\nto midnight mass, they allowed that. So everybody was Catholic, we all went to\nmidnight mass. Snow all around, you know, up like this, and a beautiful, beautiful\nchurch. We couldn\u2019t all get in the church, so we were outside, but we went to midnight\nmass and we got away from the house. Protestants, Jewish, Catholic, whatever you\nwere, you know. We were all the same the night. It didn\u2019t matter, it was Christmas\neve, you know. And that\u2019s all I remember of there. All I can remember 1s the girls do\nwith their helmets, they put their helmets on the bunks and filled them full of lipstick\nand incidentals and then when the sirens went off, they had to have their helmet on\ntheir head, everything got dumped on their heads.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: No, just the sirens in the -- in the English area at the time, because there were -- be\nbombs and planes and so forth going over, so when the warning came, the sirens went\noff and you were supposed to protect yourself. That was the way we did it.",
        "A: Not that I know of, no, no. The only place I ever saw any bombs was in London.\nAnd -- while we were on leave once, that\u2019s all. But no, we were never bombed there.\nAnd eventually, the people in the town, around Christmastime, there, took us 1n for\ndinner. And we had -- I had a real good experience on one of those, because they\ninvited three of us to dinner that didn\u2019t drink. And so we went to tea. And they didn\u2019t\nhave much to eat, but before they did, they had what they call gin and tonics. We had\nno idea what they were, but we didn\u2019t dare refuse. So three of us ate gin and -- drank\ngin and tonics, promptly fell asleep. I'll never forget that. And boy were they mortified\nto find out we didn\u2019t drink, but they\u2019d given us drinks, you know. But they thought all\nAmericans drank, so. But anyway, we had a nice dinner and they were very good to\nus, you know. And we went to an English dance while we were there -- doing the\nhokey-pokey. I suppose you\u2019ve heard of that? That\u2019s all you knew.",
        "A: Let\u2019s see -- yes, well after -- see, af-after that, when they took us out of the\nquarantine time, we were all sent to detached service, different hospitals. And I was\nJuly 15, 1995\nsent to one near Chester. And was assigned to a hospital, established hospital there\nand all of their wards went around a circle where the nurses were. There was ward --\nlike a spider, all the way around. And my job at the time, was this ward full of -- all\nthese wards were filled with venereal diseases. All the boys that were, you know,\n[indecipherable] had parties.",
        "A: Yeah. And so, I was assigned to give them penicillin. At the time, penicillin was\njust coming out. So I would take my little tray, about so big and a great big syringe,\nI'll never forget it, about that long and a -- a bunch of needles and that was full of\npenicillin, you go along and you\u2019d just -- as you -- as you came out, the boys would\njust roll over. They knew they were getting it, so just roll over and be ready for you,\nyou know? And that was my job, all the way around the spider, just to pass out\npenicillin. Supposed to be a cure, you know, until next time. And --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I never saw the boys again, you know, just one round after the other,\nby the time you got around here, why they were gone out the other way. So, that was\nmy experience on detached service and living in cold, Quonset huts. Concrete floors\nand they were always wet, you know. And there was snow, of course, everywhere.\nAnd, so that -- I had a chance to visit Chester and the Roman wall and all the nice\nthings like that, so -- so we really enjoyed that, you know. And from there we were\nJuly 15, 1995\nsent back to Alteringham, where we all assembled and were sent overseas, eventually,\nin -- I think we went in March.",
        "A: Across the channel on the Sobiesky. Yeah, we were overnight on the ship, which I\nheard later was bombed, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t remember any troops going, it might have been -- our hospital unit\nmight have [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know, but we were all sent over the channel and\nwe were on it overnight, cause we slept on the ship and landed in France. And from\nthen on we just kept traveling, yeah.",
        "A: We went to Paris and we stopped in Paris and got something to eat at lunchtime\nand all our gear. We went into a nice, beautiful restaurant, with waitresses with little --\nlittle frilly aprons on and caps on, you know, and here we are with mud caked and --\nand all of our outfit on, you know, as we were traveling. [indecipherable] bag on your\nback and all these heavy clothes. And we had dinner there and then they put us on\ntrucks to go on to a -- well, we went to Sedan and Sedan is where we -- we did some\ndrilling as far as our hospital unit goes and made -- made gauze packages and things\nfor a hospital unit and got ready to have a set up. And trained from there on. And we --\nJuly 15, 1995\nthen we -- let\u2019s see, where did we go from the Sedan? We stopped at a boy\u2019s school\novernight somewhere. That was a big French school. And --",
        "A: Sedan, uh-huh",
        "A: It\u2019s around Reims, Versailles, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t was near your well known during the\nWorld War One.",
        "A: And --",
        "A: No, not too far, no. And like I say, we went -- traveled there and then we overnight\nto another place and -- and on through Luxembourg. Oh, I\u2019ve forgotten -- into\nGermany.",
        "A: In Germany is where we first set up the hospital to use, yeah. And took care of our\nwounded GIs. And I had a post-op ward, so as they came out of surgery, they came\ninto my tent. They were given all medications that they needed and bandage care and\nwe did their -- we did their baths as we could, out of their helmets. They had to bring\ntheir own helmets and we did baths out of the helmets and I had one little German boy\nJuly 15, 1995\nthat had been throwing grenades and he had an arm taken off and course all these GIs\ndidn\u2019t like him because he was a enemy. So I had to watch him carefully. And -- but I\nhad a nice ward boy and he [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: They never did, no, no, they were -- they were kind enough. But that was what we\nwere always scared of, because you know, all of us hated them, really, you know, from\nseeing what they did to the boys. And whatever happened to him, I don\u2019t know, but\nthey shipped him out from my ward. And our boys were shipped out as they -- as soon\nas we got them taken care of and they were ready to travel, why they went on out too,\nby plane, yeah.",
        "A: Well, it depended on how bad they were. You know, some of them could go within\na week and some could -- had to stay. But we were only set up for a short time\nanyway, you know, so I only saw a turnover a couple of times, really. And then they\nwere transferred on to some other hospital, if they couldn\u2019t make the trip all the way\nacross, you know. And th -- we picked up behind General Patton, and so, like we\nalways said, we were the fastest moving hospital --\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: -- in the CTO, you know? Because we just kept on going until we hit the\nconcentration camp.",
        "A: Some, yeah, some.",
        "A: Oh, they were just glad to see you, you know, and -- and sometimes you wrote a\nletter, 1f you could, you know, for them. We didn\u2019t have any Red Cross to help us. So\nyou wrote a letter if you could or did what you could for whatever they wanted. But\nthere really wasn\u2019t much time, you know, spent with them and I suppose some forward\nhospital could, you know, because we just didn\u2019t have the facilities, really. Just --",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, well, it\u2019d be one nurse. They\u2019d have a night nurse and a day\nnurse, I was a day nurse and | had a -- a corpsman that was very apt. He was a pre-med\nstudent. So he could give plasma or transfusions, so forth. So all I had to do was give\nmedications and whatever care -- the bandages and so forth, that they needed. He went\naround and gave all the -- all the [Vs and the plasma stuff, yeah. And -- but I did have\ncontrol of the medicines, he would -- he couldn\u2019t give those.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Oh yes. That\u2019s hospital work, that\u2019s nurses work, you know, yeah. If you can ease\ntheir pain, you know, and make them feel -- but you know, when you\u2019re young, you\ncan\u2019t be their mother, even though you\u2019re a nurse, you know, but you have to take\ntheir place, you know, and do the best you can. Big sister, whatever, you know and\nsince I\u2019d had a lot of it at home, why, you know, just comes second nature, yeah. And",
        "A: They packed us up in the middle of the night and shipped us off to a place near the\nconcentration camp. I think it was Bamburg, I\u2019m not sure, but I think it was there,\nwhere we were assigned to a -- a hospital that was already there, in the field and the\ncolonel wouldn\u2019t let us go on with the boys. The boys all went ahead of us to take care\nof the camp before the nurses were taken in. And probably was at least a week before\nwe were allowed in to the camp. And it was quite a shock, you know.",
        "A: The colonel just told us we\u2019re -- that we\u2019re going and that we didn\u2019t have to go if\nwe didn\u2019t want to. And that it was pretty bad. But we all -- we were there for a\npurpose, so we -- we went, you know.",
        "A: No. Was no problem, no problem. We were all waiting to go, you know? Sitting\naround there in the sun in Germany, we were just waiting to go. And we hadn\u2019t had\nJuly 15, 1995\nthat much activity, that one -- one set up, you know, was all we really had had of\nactivity. It was a busy one at the time, but so short -- so short a time. But that\u2019s what\nan evacuation hospital is, you just keep on going. And --",
        "A: Well, it just fell off there, I didn\u2019t want to pull anything.",
        "A: But -- so like I say, we moved and when they climbed out of the back of the truck,\nwhy it was -- was too much of a jump for me, I guess and too much weight on my\nfoot, so --",
        "A: So I had what they call a march fracture. And since I\u2019d never heard of a march\nfracture, none of the girls had, why he presented me to the medical staff. So I was the\nfirst guinea pig over there for that. And then I ran around -- as I say, I ran around with\na ga -- pair of galoshes on and of course it was muddy and that rubber just pulled, you\nknow, on that foot. It was no fun. But I -- I worked for about three days and --",
        "A: So the first three days of -- that we were there --",
        "A: I was assigned to this ward C and we were all corralled in -- in a office and pumped\nfull of DDT and --\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Oh, in your hair -- we had turbans -- in your hair and down your clothes and down\nthe waistband and into your legs and so forth, so you were covered, because these\npatients had typhus and all sorts of diseases. And then you were assigned a stack of\nmedicine, which was sulfa at the time, the only thing they had was sulfadiazene. And\na great big pitcher of water, there\u2019d be two of you. One take a bigger -- big pitcher of\nwater and the other all these pills and the guard, because a guard always had to be with\nus, we weren\u2019t to touch anybody. And the first -- my first [indecipherable]\nrecollection of seeing them, was a great rack of three or four tier wooden bunks and as\nfar back as that -- toward the wall, you could see was probably five or six patients at\nleast, some on top of the other, all skin and bones and the fellas had given some of\nthem I'V\u2019s and transfusions and -- and plasma. And some of them were dead, with\nthese things still running, you know and so anybody that looked like they were half\nalive, you\u2019d ask them if they had diarrhea. If they did, you gave them a handful of pills\nto swallow with a glass of water, if they could get 1t down and how many others in that\nsame tier and then you go on to the next one, you know. And they were just naked on -\n- on these things and of course naive little nurses, you know, I -- we\u2019d had hospital\nnursing, but to see all these naked men and you know and all bones, couldn\u2019t speak,\nsome of them. Of course, none of them could speak English. And -- real sad, real sad.\nCause you knew you wouldn\u2019t see them -- next time, next round around, you wouldn\u2019t\nJuly 15, 1995\nsee those same people, they\u2019d be dead, you know. Very few of them that came out.\nAnd -- was real rough. But like I say, I spent about three days in and then we had this\naccident so, I didn\u2019t get back down to the camp, except to eat, you know. Three of us\nwere laid up in the same room.",
        "A: We weren\u2019t party girls, we didn\u2019t drink, we didn\u2019t party. One of them was married -\n- two of them were married. And, you know, we just didn\u2019t want to go. And the\ncaptain, our chief -- our chief nurse, ordered us to go. So we had to get dressed -- all\ndressed up in our finery and our class A uniform and wait for the transportation and\nwhen it came, course we had to get in the Jeep we were assigned and the one that we\ngot into, the fellow was drunk.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know it right away, til we got started. He had -- we found out that he\nhad put water in the gas tank.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: To -- well, I don\u2019t know the reason. I don\u2019t really know the reason, but anyway,\nsince he put this water -- probably -- maybe cause he was drunk, he had put this in and\nhe knew he had to keep up with the others, because he didn\u2019t know for sure whether he\nwas going to make it or not. So he was driving a very fast pace. I wouldn\u2019t know how\nfast, I would say 80 miles an hour, but I don\u2019t know. But in this mud and slick stuff.\nAnd --",
        "A: Raining and was black as ace of spades and we didn\u2019t even know where we were.\nAnd we were -- I don\u2019t -- I think maybe we were last -- last bunch out and as we went\ndown the road, the one girl was Catholic, she was saying her rosary. The other two\nwere Ser -- praying 1n the back seat and the girl in the front seat was hanging on and all\nof a sudden we went right off -- it was an -- a big apple tree in this curve and we went\nright over -- sailed right over that apple tree and landed right down in -- a -- over a\nbank, I don\u2019t remember how deep it was. The girl in the front seat -- well, the driver\nwas flopped out and he was all right, he was drunk. The girl in the front seat hit the\nwindshield, she had a concussion. One of the girls in the back seat had a long gash in\nher leg and she was tied up under the Jeep. The other girl -- I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t\nremember what damage she had, but she and the other were under the back seats. I was\nthrown out, half my clothes off and I was the only one able to get up the bank and wait\nfor somebody to come back and find us, when we didn\u2019t show up. Lady Feldhusen\nJuly 15, 1995\nwas one of the group that came back and found us. And to this day, they never put\nanything in the records. This makes us very unhappy. But, like I say, we were laid up\nthen, taken back to the clinic and fixed up and taken up to our quarters, where we laid,\nside by side on cots in one room. Were taken down to meals, they came and sent a\ntruck up and we were taken down to meals at the camp and then brought back home\nagain and that\u2019s where we were until we came home. And then they told me -- I was\non crutches and they told me that if I didn\u2019t throw the crutches away, I had to stay over\nthere. Well, the rest of the group were coming home and one of the girls husband was\nover there, so she was going to stay. That was all right with her, but I wanted to come\nhome. So I threw the crutches away and hobbled onto the ship when they finally got\nthere. They were assigned to come home. They thought they were going to fly us\nhome, but then something happened to the plane, so they brought us home by train,\nacross the continent, in wooden -- wooden bench trains with no windows. And we\nslept on th-those overnight, you know, on the trips. And we stopped along the way and\ngot our meals at a -- a tent camp, where they had food set up. Raining, pitchforks and\nhammer handles and your tray was full of peaches and mashed potatoes and whatever,\nall mixed up together and hailstorms and the tents were full of holes. P\u2019Il never forget\nit. And I\u2019ve forgotten how many days we were coming across. Then they camped us\non the banks of the Seine and that wasn\u2019t very -- very nice camp, but it was just a\nholding camp. And some of the boys from another outfit felt sorry for the nurses, so\nJuly 15, 1995\nthey invited us that -- to come over to Deauville, which was a resort, you know,\noriginally and probably still is -- and spend some time over there in a hotel, so we had\n-- we spent some time in the hotel in the swimming areas and so forth, so we had a\ngood time there -- until we were -- actually til we were aboard ships -- and aboard ship\nand we were sent a Navy ship, US Navy, Bliss and we had ice cream and everything\nwe wanted coming home, nice clean sheets and everything, til we landed in Boston.\nAnd that was a good -- we had a good crossing, we had no problems with that either,\nyou know. Til we landed in Boston and all the fire whistles and whatnot. Put us on a\ntrain and headed us for Trenton again.",
        "A: Oh, they were all foreign -- there weren\u2019t any -- if there were any that spoke\nEnglish, 1t was probably broken English, so I had never heard any speak English. I\nknow there were some there, because there were a lot of professionals there.",
        "A: But I never spoke to them, so I wouldn\u2019t know.",
        "A: Mm, not at the time we went in. Well, we learned this while we were there, you\nknow. And --\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. We were told that before we went there. And that it was so\ngruesome that we shouldn\u2019t go. And we knew this, because they\u2019d sent the boys on\nahead, you know. And it must have been bad. But you don\u2019t really comprehend until\nyou actually are in it, you know? You see all these walking skeletons, no clothes and\nthen, you know, they had some women there. Not too many around where we were.\nAnd then, of course we were taken on a brief tour of the crematorium and the -- and\nthe gas chambers and that kind of thing. And you gradually understood what was\ngoing on, you know. But I\u2019ve learned a lot more since, you know, since leaving there -\n- since the war.",
        "A: No. No, I don\u2019t believe I did. In fact I don\u2019t believe I'd knew about this until we\nactually got down there in Germany. Because we were following Patton and we were\ntrying to take your own boys, you know, so you really didn\u2019t understand that these\nother things were going on until you actually got in there. I don\u2019t believe I ever did,\nno. And y-you just can\u2019t believe such things can happen, you know. Just can\u2019t. And\nthat people on the outside never knew about it. Just -- 1t -- just impossible.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: People -- farmers that lived, you know, right outside the wall. They were farming\nfields and everything right where we lived and everything and they didn\u2019t even know\nanything about it. You know, denial.",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t, no. But this was what was going on, you know. Some of the -- the\nfellas with the, you know, the armor division and stuff like that, they had linguists and\nstuff with them that could understand. But the farming went on just as normal as could\nbe, around them and -- til the boys went out and rounded everybody up to come in and\nhelp at the camp and then I\u2019m sure they knew, but --",
        "A: Yeah. All around the area, they we -- just went out and whoever was loose, they\nbrought them in and put them to work. This is before us girls came, help get the bodies\nin the graves and whatnot, and the -- so the chaplain could have his services and you\nsaw the pictures of the big cemeteries of course, that we had, you know -- but he did a\ngreat job, but -- just weren\u2019t enough of our boys to do it all, you know?",
        "A: Mm-hm. What is -- having witnessed people who were victims of the Holocaust,\nwhat a -- what do you think about that now, 50 years later? What -- how did it -- how\ndid it change you?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: How did it change me? Well, just going over there, I -- just a little bit more about\nEurope and seeing the pay -- the people with all their, you know, languages that I\ndidn\u2019t understand, it was overwhelming, because you couldn\u2019t communicate. I don\u2019t\nknow, I was just happy to see those that could leave and very sad about those that\ncouldn\u2019t, you know? And I just hoped it never happened again and now it\u2019s happening\nagain, you know, I just -- I couldn\u2019t even watch Schindler\u2019s List or any of those. I -- I\nwatched this one they showed downstairs through once, I couldn\u2019t do it again. And --",
        "A: I\u2019m an old sentimentalist, I guess, you know. Very sad, very sad thing. I can\u2019t even\nwatch a funeral. I went to my aunt\u2019s funeral, but I had to get out fast, you know, I just\ncan\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know what there -- what there 1s --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can\u2019t do it. Didn\u2019t even go to my own father\u2019s funeral. But\n-- I got criticized for it, but I yust couldn\u2019t do it. Yes, it\u2019s -- it -- like I say, when you\u2019re\nyoung at that time, it makes an awful impression and it stays with you.",
        "A: Oh yeah, it will stay with you.",
        "A: No.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: No way. No way. My grandmother denied it ever happened.",
        "A: Yeah, til the day she went to her grave, yup.",
        "A: I showed her pictures, I talked to her and she was old, firm Baptist and nothing like\nthat could happen because she just knew it couldn\u2019t happen, you know? There weren\u2019t\npeople like that.",
        "A: There weren\u2019t people like that wouldn\u2019t do anything to another human being. My\nmother never had an opinion and she hasn\u2019t to this day. She\u2019s 94 now. But my brother\nwent over and he saw. He went over when I came home and transported a lot of them\nback home, transported the POWs, the Germans, different places and put them to\nwork and he couldn\u2019t believe it either til he saw all these people walking around like\nskeletons, still you know, when he went over. All of them going back to their own\nhomes. And so there are some, you know, that\u2019Il deny if forever, probably. Yeah. But\nI'll never forget it and I know the girls won\u2019t forget it either. You can\u2019t, anyway.\n[inaudible]",
        "A: Mm-hm.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t any of them forget it, you know?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: You mean in that area, or everywhere? No, I didn\u2019t have anything else. There were\nnice things happened and there were bad things happened in all. And you just take it in\nyour stride. And like I say, the only thing that upset me was when it wa -- nothing was\nput into my record about the accident.",
        "A: Because if you need this in the future, if you\u2019re disabled and you need this help in\nthe future, you can\u2019t get it if you don\u2019t have some documentation.",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- well, why would -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think they\u2019d cover up for him\nbecause he was drunk, because he was from another outfit. Why didn\u2019t our chief nurse\nput it in, or our -- our colonel? And that was one thing that hurt. They never even came\nto see you, you know. The three of us were up there. Course, we were able to talk and\ntake care of each other, you know, up there. But at the same time, somebody should\nhave visited us, you know, other than just sending a truck up and back. But that\u2019s life.\nJuly 15, 1995",
