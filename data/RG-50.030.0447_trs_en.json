        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mrs. Lore Perl. It\u2019s\nNovember 13, 1996 and we\u2019re here in the Perl\u2019s home in Beltsville, Maryland. And the\ninterviewers today Arwen Donahue and Scott Miller. And Mrs. Perl, I\u2019d like to start by asking you\nwhen you were born, the exact date.",
        "Answer: On the 13 of March, 1913. That, it\u2019s a very long time ago.",
        "Q: And where were you born, exactly?",
        "A: In Askersdorf. That was a suburb of Vienna.",
        "Q: What was your name at birth?",
        "A: A very long, Leonore Maria Luise. For such a little thing, imagine.",
        "Q: And your, your maiden name?",
        "A: Was Rollig, R-O-L-L-I-G.",
        "Q: Would you say something about your family background, your, your father, first his name and\nthen what he did?",
        "A: Fine. My father\u2019s name was Franz Xaver and shortly after I was born, World War I broke out\nand he went into the Army and my mother and I, we were alone. My, then there was no money for\nsoldiers\u2019 wives and so on and my family wasn\u2019t rich so Mother had to work. And she went to work\nat a very unusual way. She worked for, as an, importer for a firm that reproduced wooden barrels.\nAnd she went all over to buy the right wood, I don\u2019t know any more and I never knew and never\nwill know what kind of wood it was. But she was very good at that and when my father came home\nin 1918, I was five years old. I hardly recognized him. I told my mother, \u201cThere\u2019s a strange man\nout there, would you go look for him?\u201d Then I knew it was Father. During the war he occasionally\ncame and brought food because food was very, very rare in Vienna. I have very bad memories as\nfar as food goes that Mother and I, we were standing in line for a long time. I\u2019ve, now, if, I try to\nremember, it seems it was the whole night in order to get some food ration that, that was supposed\nto come to us and when we got there, was sometimes there was no food left and sometimes, once at\nleast, I remember when we came home, there were potatoes and they were all spoiled and Mother\ncried. So I was then maybe three years old. Occasionally, we went to my grandparents. They had a\nfarm in, in Silesia, no, in, in [talkover], no, Moravia...",
        "Q: Moravia.\nAnd my, my father\u2019s parents had a farm in Moravia. My father\u2019s parents, they had the farm in\nMoravia and Mother and I went there several times in order to get some food. They, they did not\nsuffer so much because they had all kinds of animals and, and, and, it\u2019s, it, it wasn\u2019t too bad for\nthem and when we came home, we always had food for the few weeks to eat, until that went low\nagain and then we went back to them again. They were very good to us and I have very vivid\nmemories of my grandmother, who carried me on her back, no perambulator or something like that.\nShe just carried me on her back. So I must have been very little and probably very light also. So\nwhen the war was over my father came home. He was a mechanical engineer and there was no job\nfor him to get so he worked as a ditch digger and in a factory as this and in a factory as that until the\nsituation had settled.",
        "Q: What was your mother\u2019s name and her family background?",
        "A: My, my mother\u2019s name was Anna Steiner, and my grandfather had, well factory is said too\nmuch, he had a little, what would you say...",
        "A: Shop.",
        "A: A little shop where he produced linen and I still have napkins from him. And one tablecloth that\nhe, he produced, it\u2019s a long time. And he lost that and my grandmother and two sisters and a\nbrother were alone. Grandfather died. And she...",
        "Q: He lost that because of the war?",
        "A: No, that was before the war. There, I do not know whether you are familiar with European\nhistory but there was a very, very hard time and people like now, they just had to close up. There\nwas no more, asking for good supplies and good things. People bought whatever they could and as\nlong as it wasn\u2019t too expensive and apparently what he produced was very expensive. You can see\nif I have now still something that he produced, it must have been good. Now it\u2019s more than hundred\nyears now almost. So, my mother and my father married in 1909 and I was born in 1913.",
        "Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?",
        "A: My mother had one stillborn child. That, that was all, no more. That was before me. I was an\nonly one. He claims you can still see it. But it doesn\u2019t, ;",
        "Q: What were your parents\u2019 political leanings?",
        "A: My father was a Social Democrat. He was very much concerned with the welfare of poor people\nand he tried to help as much as he could. He became a councilman in the city council and he was,\nhe was kind of, well shunned, because wherever it was and wherever he went he would say, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s\nfine but, but you have to do something for those people.\u201d For instance he organized that, at\nChristmas, baskets would go out with food to poor families and of course, he wasn\u2019t loved for that\nby the people who had to fill the baskets. And, I guess I grew up in that spirit. I still love to send\nbaskets too but I send them, so. And my mother was very helpful in everything that had to be done\nin this respect. In fact, my father used to say, \u201cIf you want something from Mother, she will give\nyou her last shirt.\u201d And it, it was true, so.",
        "Q: Did you have a particular religious upbringing, religious education, also?",
        "A: Yeah. My mother was very religious. She was Catholic. She was very religious in the way that\nshe thought you have to, you have a certain amount of obligation and you have to help wherever\nher, you can. That was mostly her religion. The rest of her family, there was one aunt who went to\nchurch almost daily and my father didn\u2019t think very much in religious terms. He always said that\nreligion is the crutch of the poor and the church tries to keep them in bondage. That was his feeling\nSO aS you can see my, for some time, I went to parochial school because apparently it was then\nalready, also better than the public schooling. It was not too good an experience for me, and I\ndropped out.",
        "Q: What was your father\u2019s attitude toward Jews?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, he never had any. For us, in our house, my father had a friend who was a priest.\nThey came and they came together and they argued for hours. And my father used to say, \u201cAnd\nwhere was God when, on the, on the, in the war when the people were lying on the ground moaning\nand dying by the hundreds? Where was God then?\u201d That\u2019s what people ask now about the\nHolocaust, too, right? He had the same attitude. We had, we had Jewish friends. I had a very, very\ngood Jewish friend. She died last year in California. We, we kept very close all the time. Whether\nsomebody was as he always said, \u201cWhether somebody\u2019s green, blue or red, it doesn\u2019t matter, as\nlong as they are good.\u201d And this was his attitude. And for religious reason, he didn\u2019t really, I don\u2019t\nthink he had any feelings for or against any kind of religion. He just didn\u2019t believe into the\ndoctrines of the religions. [talkover]",
        "Q: Did you, do you remember from your childhood seeing any type of anti-Semitism or any type of\ndiscrimination? Were you aware of, of that in Vienna at that time?",
        "A: Discrimination, really only against me. My father, we, I was once detained, wrongly in the\nafternoon and my parents were very concerned that I didn\u2019t come home, even then you didn\u2019t know\nwhat happened. If your child is supposed to be home at one thirty, and at three or four o\u2019clock, it\u2019s\nnot at home, you wonder. So my father came to school and I recall that the, the priest had kept me\nand a few other girls in school for a very funny incidence. He asked what was Christ when he was\nfor 40 days in the, in the desert and there was no food and that was at this time, the time of the\npeople who were called \u201chunger artists\u201d. I don\u2019t think you know what that means here. There were\npeople who were going on a hunger strike for so and so long in order to, to show, to prove\nsomething. And when, when the priest asked what was Christ, one of the girls said, \u201cA hunger\nartist.\u201d And then he said, \u201cWho said that?\u201d And of course, nobody did say so I was one of the ones\nwho were supposed to have said it and three or four others were there too. And my father came and\nhe told the priest that what he did was wrong because he can keep me at, if he thinks I did\nsomething wrong the next day, am I too wordy?",
        "Q: [negative grunt]",
        "A: That he can keep me the next day but not on the day when my parents don\u2019t know about it. And\nfrom this day on when the priest came into the class, every morning he said, \u201c go\ninto the corner.\u201d And then I had to stand all, all the whole hour until the hour was over. So this was\nthe discrimination I experienced. Well, then there, of course, the girls or the boys that were not\nCatholic, they could sit in the rear of the class but I didn\u2019t find that this was discrimination.",
        "Q: When you, when you say not Catholic, were these Protestants or, or Jews?",
        "A: Protestant and Jews. They were, they could sit in the rear of the class and they could read or do\nanything else. I never felt that this was discrimination. [talkover] I, no, not exactly, but I know that\nthree girls I was close with, they were in my class...",
        "Q: Three, there were three Jewish girls.",
        "A: Three Jewish girls. I was pretty close with, I visited them, they visited me. We played together\nand it was, it was, well a very close relationship. So, of, of course, when the Nazis came, it changed\ndrastically, then. Everything changed and they were resettled. I didn\u2019t have any contact then with\nthe three girls. I was, I did go up because I went then to school in Vienna and I wasn\u2019t in\nAskersdorf and things had changed quite a lot. And then when the Nazis came, I tried to contact\none of the girls but they already, the father was a physician, they already had left but they were not\nresettled. They had left for, I do not remember, America, anything, anywhere.",
        "Q: When, when did you move to Vienna?",
        "A: I lived in Vienna all the time but it was a suburb and I went then, I moved then into the city,\nproper, in the first district. When was it? I think in \u201937, \u2019?36 or \u2019?37. I worked there. My father\nwasn\u2019t very happy that I moved there but I, living 1n the suburb as it is here, in order to go from the\nWhite House to Silver Spring or to even Beltsville(ph), 1t takes you an hour and a half because we\ndidn\u2019t have cars at this ttme. You used public transportation and it worked out well. I had a good\njob. I, I liked my job and, and I met my husband.",
        "Q: Go back just a bit. In \u201934, as I understand it, Dolfus had banned all political parties including the\nSocialists. What effect did that have on your father, on your family life and on your perception?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it had very much effect. My father did anyhow what he wanted to do. He always\ndid. Like almost all men do, right? And, well, Dolfus, he had a party of people and he had many\npeople around him who were thought kind of ridiculous people, die Hamenschwenzler?",
        "A: Yah. They, they ridiculous.",
        "A: Hmmm?",
        "A: They were ridiculous Poland.",
        "A: Yeah, they, they were, they wore hats with a, a cock feather on their hats or they were called\naccording to the cock feather and were made ridiculous, this is about all I know.",
        "Q: But he wasn\u2019t persecuted any way.",
        "A: No, no, no, no. He was not persecuted. Whatever he did, he got away with it. He was, even\nwhen I was arrested when he went, no, no, out.",
        "Q: We can get into that...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That time later.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did you have any knowledge of the, did, did you have much political awareness, what was going\non in Germany?",
        "A: No. No, no, I did, unfortunately I didn\u2019t have very much political awareness. See I went to\nschool and I worked and it really took up all my time. And my mother was sickish and I also took\ncare of her. So whatever time there was, I didn\u2019t have time for politics. I was interested in it, but I\ncould never take an active part. I took an active part in politics only after Hitler came to Vienna.\nThen I started to become much more aware of what was going on and I, because many of my\nfriends were affected by it. And, and I, I tried to fight it.",
        "Q: Tell me about what you were studying in school [talkover] and what you were doing for work\nafter?",
        "A: Oh I worked, first of all I, I went to the Institute, Lehrerbildungsanstalt, I don\u2019t know now...",
        "A: Teacher college.",
        "A: It\u2019s a teacher\u2019s college, okay, and while I, in my free time, I worked in the Jewish kindergarten\nwhich I enjoyed immensely. I, I never knew that I would love children that much but it was a\ndelightful job. I even thought sometime that I would write about the sayings of the children and\ntheir behavior. I never did of course, that was just a dream. And then after I had my degree I\nstarted, I tried to start to work in a public kindergarten but it was absolutely impossible because as I\napplied for the job, the interviewer told me, \u201cWell, I tell you, we do take two people a year. We hire\ntwo people a year. We have hundred and three applications so you figure out how long it will take\nbefore you are being hired.\u201d So my, my aspects of being a being a public kindergarten teacher went\nall the way down. Then I just tried to get all kinds of jobs and it was \u201933, the time when it was very,\nvery hard to get jobs. It was in America the same. There was the big crash on the, on the Borse, on\nthe stock market and in Europe it was the same. Jobs were very scarce. So finally I did get, I\nworked as a secretary in a, in a factory, no, no, in an office that imported wood from Yugoslavia.\nThen I worked for sometimes in an office that imported from Germany, dryers, commercial dryers\nand what else did I do? And then I, one of my father\u2019s acquaintances lost his wife and he needed\nsomebody to take care of his books and help him in his praxis. I took that job and this is when I met\nhim while I was there and I, I stayed in this job until I was arrested.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to your working with children. You were working with, in this kindergarten\nimmediately after you got out of school?",
        "A: No, no, no, while I was studying. I was working two or three [talkover] three days, yah.",
        "Q: As an intern.",
        "A: Studying to be a teacher in Vienna is quite different. I do not know whether this like that here\nbut I remember that we had to work for three months in an institute for the blind. Three months in\nan institute for the deaf! and three months we worked in an institute or institution for the retarded.\nAnd I remember that this was the hardest part of my studying, so. And whatever I had on free time,\nI worked in the kindergarten, partly as part of my training, partly also because I liked it.",
        "Q: What did you like about it? You said you were surprised by how much you liked it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was that experience?",
        "A: Well, I always liked children but I never knew how much you can do to help them grow up and\nto help them to develop their abilities to see the world, to learn how to talk. I remember that I tried\nto teach them English, English songs and one of the first one was pitter patter pit pat, listen to the\nrain. You know that? No, you don\u2019t know an English children\u2019s song?",
        "Q: You want to sing it?",
        "A: No, it was, pitter patter pit pat, listen to the rain, falling in the garden, running down the pane. A\nbig song and the, another one that we, that I tried to teach them was the teensy weensy spider\n[talkover] you know that, went up the water spout. And those very tiny little things and the kids\nwere just delightful. I remember that once we went out to the park and one of the little boys says,\n\u201cWill you please excuse me but the fire engine has to make pee-pee.\u201d [talkover] So those, all those\nthings made me to get so much closer to the children, to understand them so much more. You learn\na lot from books but you do not learn what you can learn from a personal contact. Their warmth,\ntheir love and later on I often thought how many made it. That was the hard part because I am sure\nthat many of them and their parents perished.",
        "Q: And this, these, this kindergarten was a Jewish kindergarten specifically?",
        "A: Yes, it was, it was run by a Jewish organization but I do not remember anymore by what\norganization.",
        "Q: How did you end up in a Jewish kindergarten?",
        "A: This was arranged from, this, from the college. The college sent people out to this, and to this,\nand to this kindergarten and I happened to get this one. sit, youll fall down. [talkover]",
        "Q: Did you have, you mentioned that you had, you had many Jewish friends and that you had\nJewish friends in your family and your father had Jewish acquaintances and yet there, there was a\ngrowing perhaps sense of anti-Semitism especially after Hitler came in. Did you, did you have\nfriends who weren\u2019t Jewish, who were, who were questioning your teaching Jewish children and\nenjoying them so much or did you experience any sort of derisive comments for doing that sort of\nwork?",
        "A: No, no, I, I did not. I don\u2019t remember, I didn\u2019t have very many, no Jewish friends and so I had\none or two and I don\u2019t think that they ever questioned anything. It was more, we were young\npeople and it was more, you do what you think is right and I do what I do think is right. I only knew\none young man who was an SS man later. He helped me get somebody out of concentration camp\nso he was in the way, he helped also partly to get Bill\u2019s family safe. Those, this is my only known\nJewish acquaintance Bekarntsdaft, Bekarntentkreis(ph) who had anything to do with my activities.",
        "Q: How did it happen that you had mostly Jewish friends? Wasn\u2019t that unusual?",
        "A: No, because the school I went to was mostly Jewish. So, as I told you we, I had a friend all my\nlife, she only died last year (1995) in California. We visited her often. We supported her financially\nand she died last year. We were very close to the very end, I\u2019m now very close, no, close with her,\nwith her daughter and even the grandchildren send me invitation to their bar-mitzvah, bas-mitzvah\nand so on.",
        "Q: What was this school, what was, was this your college? What was. . .",
        "A: A teacher\u2019s college. The Vienna teacher\u2019s college. And like most of the colleges, no I shouldn\u2019t\nsay most. But in all the colleges there was a large percentage of Jewish people and large, and it was\nmore Jewish than anywhere else because Vienna had the large Jewish population.",
        "Q: Now...",
        "A: I, I also worked with Jews a lot. It, somehow, I, I can\u2019t tell you how it happened but my feelings\nwere kind of, well, not biased in any way. A person was a person and that\u2019s it. That\u2019s what my\nfather\u2019s teaching was.",
        "Q: Did you consider yourself unusual? Were you aware?",
        "A: No, no. I was always just a very ordinary person.",
        "Q: You must have been very surprised when the, during the Anschluss . . .",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When the Germans were...",
        "A: That was a very, very major blow for me first of all because I was worried about Bill. We were\ngoing to be married in March and in March Hitler came in...",
        "Q: March of 1938.",
        "A: 1938. And then Hitler came and the euphoria of the people of Vienna when they were lining the\nstreets greeting Hitler and his entourage. It was, it was just unbelievable. Just thinking of it, I\ncringe.",
        "Q: Would you describe your meeting with, how you met Dr. Perl and that day?",
        "A: I do not know exactly the date but it was sometimes in June, [talkover], \u00b037. And I had a big\nargument with my father, as I told you he wasn\u2019t happy that I moved out of the house and moved\ninto the city proper and I was sitting in the park, crying and there was a very long row, in the park\nthere was a large row of chairs and you know in Vienna, the chairs were chained one to another so\nthat nobody could take one away. And I was sitting there crying and as Bill says, he walked by\nseveral times. And I don\u2019t remember that but he says so. And finally he asked me, \u201cIs this chair\nhere free?\u201d The chair next to me. And I just spit at him something like, \u201cOh you idiot, there are\nhundreds of chairs, leave me alone.\u201d [talkover] So of course he sat next to me and then we talked\nand he started talking and he started telling me and then we found out that I live in Postgasse 11 and\nhe lived in Postgasse.\n[End of side 1 of tape 1]",
        "Q: This is a U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lore Perl. This is tape one, side B\nand you were describing that you and Dr. Perl found out you were neighbors the day that you met.",
        "A: Right and he, we, he accompanied me to the house and then we made a date for a later date and,\nand that\u2019s how it happened.",
        "Q: What were your first impressions of him?",
        "A: A very brash young man. But he was very likable because, and he was very lively. He told me a\nlot of things that he had done, about his traveling and so on and so forth and I found him interesting.\nAnd then we, we had a date and we wanted to go out. I think I told him, come and, he should come\nand visit me and then I met him in front of the door and I said, \u201cI have friends upstairs. Come and\ncome upstairs,\u201d but he didn\u2019t want to do that.",
        "A: What was the point? So she says, \u201cVisit me.\u201d people there so I said, \u201cNo. Not if\nthere are people there.\u201d",
        "A: So then we, we went out a couple of times together and then we thought well, this is something\nthat will go into something more, more earnest and I wanted, well then he said, told me that he\nwould never marry a Jewish girl, a non Jewish girl and whether I would consider converting. And\nsomehow I felt that converting was absolutely not necessary for me because my feelings were\nanyhow for, against Nazism and for everything that stood in Jewish life. But we broke up anyhow,\nso, because he didn\u2019t want to put any kind of pressure on me and we parted. And then came\nChristmas and he send me a lilac bush, a white lilac bush as a Christmas gift. It\u2019s, in a, it was for\nlong time in the garden of a cousin of mine in, in Vienna. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s still there. He\ndied and so on and a friend of mine when she saw that bush she said, \u201cEh! That means marriage.\u201d\nAnd I told her, \u201c\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, we just broke up.\u201d She was right. So we got the, I, I called him and I\nthanked him and we got in touch again and then the, our, the relationship became much closer and\nwe decided we would marry. I would convert and we would marry. And then Hitler came.",
        "Q: Were you aware of what it would mean for you, any personal dangers?",
        "A: I was aware. I was very much aware. And especially my father was aware of it. He was, I\nthink, much more aware because he was politically much more astute than I was. And after we\nwere married, it was very kind of sad affair. My father, his brother, I and he. I think, I don\u2019t\nremember anymore who walked first. We went to the, to the Seitenstadter Temple where Rabbi\n[talkover] Tageslicht had agreed to marry us.",
        "Q: You were converted?",
        "A: I had converted, yeah. But there was no mikvah anymore so the conversion was not complete\nbut it, I was converted as far as Tageslicht went and he, he took into consideration all the\ncircumstances.",
        "Q: What did you have to do to convert?",
        "A: I, first of all I had to study and I had to tell him a lot about Judaism. I told him my thoughts\nabout Judaism and so on and apparently, whatever we talked and whatever I had learned about, he,\nhe was satisfied when he questioned me. And then, when we got married it was a very short\nceremony and we all, I guess, listened, whether the SS is coming. And after, afterwards, we just all\nleft the way we came, one behind the other and he went home and I, I don\u2019t think I went with you.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I only later came to you.",
        "A: Yah.",
        "A: And, well it was, as I said it was a sad affair instead of a happy one.",
        "A: Was illegal from both points, from the Jewish point of view and from the...",
        "A: Nazi point of view.",
        "A: Nazi point of view. From the Jewish point of view because she had not really fully completed\nthe conversion. She had completed it according to his saying but she had not fulfilled all the\nrequirement. She hadn\u2019t studied enough and there was no mikvah, but Rabbi Tageslicht was a good\nfriend of mine from, I was and he knew her and he felt that she\u2019s a very valuable\nperson as he told me. And he said, \u201cIf she converts, well you cannot wish for better Jewish children\nthan from her.\u201d He was concerned. So he says and from the Nazi point of view it was\na major, very major crime.",
        "A: We both would have been killed if they would have found out so it was, as I said it was a rather\nsad affair.",
        "A: He would have been killed too.",
        "A: And probably he too. But killing for them was a very easy thing so...",
        "Q: So you remember being there at the wedding and feeling a sadness [talkover] even at the\nbeginning [talkover].",
        "A: For years, I dreamt that the SS would come and chase us and I would run with him through the\ndifferent rooms and the different steps up because the old building was, a very old building in\nVienna [talkover]",
        "A: Jewish community.",
        "A: Where you, where you had to go this step and here some step and here a few steps and it would\ngo all around and you could run and run and run and I dreamt again and again and again that we\ntwo, the two of us run. [talkover]",
        "A: The synagogue was in this building. The Jewish synagogue still is in this building.",
        "A: But it\u2019s a new building now. Well, and then, we never lived together. I went to my apartment.\nHe was in his apartment and on the, we married on the 17\" of April. And on the 10 of June he left\nfor, after he had been arrested, and freed, he left for England.",
        "Q: Did you consider yourself, were you able to consider yourself Jewish? Did you feel that you\nwere able to really become Jewish or did you feel that that was just a side consequence of your\nmarriage?",
        "A: I did not feel the conversion had made me more Jewish in thinking and acting than I was before.\nThat\u2019s the answer to your question. After Bill had left, I did collect food for the people who were\nsent to the East and I very often worked for Gildermeister. Do you know who Gildermeister was?\nAnd I do recall one woman and a, her son and until today, I sometimes talk about it that I couldn\u2019t, I\ndo not know whether they got out because I was arrested before I could know whether they did\nreally succeed in getting out. And until today I think of the little boy who was delightful and he had\na charming mother. And I sometimes wonder if I would have said that I adopt that child. Nobody\nknew that I was Jewish. If I would have adopted that child maybe I could have made sure that he\u2019s\nalive.",
        "A: You will never have adopted a Jewish child.",
        "A: At this time...",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been possible, I don\u2019t know. But I feel, for one reason or another I\nalways feel guilty that I let those two down.",
        "Q: Will you try to describe or reconstruct your growing political awareness?",
        "A: It started to become more political, not only feelings after I had met Bill. He told me about the\nplight of the people in Poland and he told me about Palestine. And that was, Palestine was\nsomething that was not in my thinking at all. It was too far away. But through him I became aware\nof so many things and I recall the first time when he told me that he had collected some betterim(ph)\nfrom Poland and they would go illegally to Israel and he showed me and introduced me to them. It\nwas always very clandestine. It always had to be very secretly so that I wouldn\u2019t be caught with any\none of them. And then he asked me whether I would consider keeping his, we were not married\nthen, keeping his, the passports of the people. And I remember that I kept all the 16 passports and I\nwas a very, very big secret agent. I put them into a leather chair here in the rear and I thought that\nwould be absolutely safe. But fortunately nobody looked for them and nobody came and asked so it\nwas safe. That was the first time when I really was involved in saving some people\u2019s lives. I, I\nknew about it but I, I only knew intellectually but now I had met the people and it was quite\ndifferent. And from then on as I was aware of his and became more and more aware of his activities\nI, I was, let\u2019s say caught.",
        "Q: It sounds like you and Dr. Perl were in many ways very, very different. He had a different level\nof political awareness than you certainly.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was the bond or the attraction? Can you, do you think you can describe or characterize it?",
        "A: I think that I was, I was drawn to him. As I told you before it was his spirit and it was his\nmentality that drew me to him and then when I realized that he was going out, out of his way and\nforgetting about himself and helping other people even to the, to the maybe end that he\u2019s would be\nkilled, it, it formed a bond. And if I think about it now, it might also be that 1t reminded me of my\nfather. I never thought about it, it just occurred to me now. So you are now my therapist. But it, it\nmight be that because my father was always so concerned with the underdog that this was another\nattraction.",
        "Q: How did your father feel about Dr. Perl? Did, what was...",
        "A: He didn\u2019t have very many feelings except that he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll get into problems and you, you\ndon\u2019t know what you are heading for.\u201d But he would never say don\u2019t do it or don\u2019t do that, never.\nHe just said, \u201cHe will be working and he will have to work and at times he will have to forget about\nyou and wherever you will be. If you are together, you will be an albatross about his neck and if\nyou are not together, you will have to worry and worry and worry.\u201d And this is how it was.",
        "Q: Did your friends know of the marriage?",
        "A: Nobody except my father, his brother and the two of us.",
        "A: Nobody the whole time.",
        "A: So. People did suspect. People did suspect my closeness because I always kept\nalone. I didn\u2019t go out and I didn\u2019t go and see anybody. It was seven years, right? So.",
        "Q: When Dr. Perl went to London, when he left Vienna for London...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Soon after you were married...",
        "A: Married.",
        "Q: Was there a possibility of, of you going? Did you want to go, just the idea of escaping, getting\nout of Austria?",
        "A: I could have probably gone because I could travel very freely but it, at this time it was for many\nreason not possible. My mother was very sick and I, I just didn\u2019t want to abandon her. And then as\nmy father always pointed out again and again, \u201cYou\u2019ll be an albatross about his neck. Don\u2019t go. He\nwill have so much to do, so much to worry. He has to worry about his safety and the safety of the\npeople whom he tries to, to get into Palestine. If you would go, it would not be a good thing.\u201d I\nrealized that and I didn\u2019t go. And then when Bill was in America he sent an affidavit for my parents\nand for me but the war had broken out and it was not, and my mother had died and very shortly after\nmy mother died, my father died. Fortunately in a way because then when I was arrested I didn\u2019t\nhave to worry about anybody but myself. I knew he was halfway safe. I knew he was in America.",
        "Q: Meaning Dr. Perl.",
        "A: Right. And my father and my mother didn\u2019t live anymore so I was on my own.",
        "Q: Soon in, after the war broke out were you aware being as they said in quotes\nresettled in the East. Did you have any idea what that meant to be resettled?",
        "A: No, I did not know in the beginning but after I saw that they took sick and old people to resettle,\nI am a very gullible person. I hoped against my better knowledge because I went to the resettlement\ncenters with food that I had collected from a very good friend of mine. She had a delicatessen store\nand whatever she could, she gave me. And whatever I could get from other people and food, there\nwere already rations then. But whatever anybody could give, I brought it down to the settlement\nstation. So I believed first that it 1s resettkement but when I saw the misery, the illness and\neverything I knew that, because Hitler at this time had already ordered the, the killing of the\nmentally ill in Vienna. So I knew that this was not resettlement. I mean knew in quotation mark. I,\nI, I felt that 1t was not resettlement.",
        "Q: You were aware of the killing of the mentally ill?",
        "A: Yes. I was aware of this because I had a friend who was a nurse in the hospital for mental,\nmentally disturbed men but I, and, she had told me that they came in and took the incurable out.",
        "Q: And she knew what this meant?",
        "A: Yes. There was also one special institution, Steinhof, the, the Yard of, of Stones, literary\ntranslation. There were only incurable mentally ill and this, within a short time, 1t was completely\nemptied and you knew that. I think all Vienna knew it.",
        "Q: When you used to go and bring packages, food packages to the resettlement center, were you,\nwere you, was that a risky thing to do? Were a lot of people doing that? Were you under suspect?",
        "A: I do not know whether a lot of people do it. I do not know whether I was a suspect and I tell you\nI didn\u2019t care. I just went there and I brought it and that was it. There are times when you really\ndon\u2019t, I hope you never will be in a situation like that, when you do not really care what happens to\nyou, you just do what you think you have to do. And this is, I knew I could not help everybody\nthere, that there 1s, but I knew I could give one or the other people hope. That was, that was all I\ncould do. I, I, 1f I would have been able to bring wagons full of food it might have helped one\nsegment of settlement but with my little things that I brought, it, it, 1t was just a little bit of hope and\nmaybe also not only hope but seeing that somebody cares that helped a little bit. That was all.",
        "Q: Can we go back to the Anschluss once again and that period immediately after. . .",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you had that shocking realization of the welcome of...",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Of the German army. Would you describe your, your awareness of anti-Semitism was, did, how\ndid that grow?",
        "A: I knew then because as I told you I had very many Jewish friends and right after the Anschluss\nwhen the SS started rounding up Jews, that was for me, let\u2019s say a very hard awakening. I knew\nabout anti-Semitism and I knew what it meant but I didn\u2019t realize that 1t would go to that extreme.\nThat, for instance, I had many friends, one cut his wrist, died in the bathtub. Another one jumped\noff the window from the fourth floor and another one shot himself. So all this, you can\u2019t help but\nbeing more aware of what\u2019s going on. Then you saw the people in the street, how the SS made old\nJews with long beards wash the sidewalk, how women had to scrub the sidewalk, ahh. It was a\nhorror.",
        "Q: Did any members of your family or acquaintances of yours join the Nazi Party?",
        "A: Only the one I told you about, that was the only one. I think, wasn\u2019t Mundle(ph) also a member?",
        "A: ,",
        "A: [had a cousin who joined the Nazi Party but I do not know what he did. He was not active. He\njust had, was a member. Some, in some organizations you had to become a member in order to\nkeep your job. Maybe he did that. He was much too complacent a person to be active in anything\nand I know something. I, I just remember something now. We had a Jewish butcher and this\ncousin went to him and told him that if he need some help, whatever he can do, he would do. So.",
        "Q: So there seemed to be a real, did you have the impression that there was a real sort of split\npersonality going on among the Austrian people? Or did you, do you think that you just weren\u2019t\nimmediately acquainted with the people who were really rabid anti-Semites?",
        "A: No, I was not acquainted with anybody who was, who was real an anti-Semite. I, if I tried very\nhard to remember, no, no. Some people were saying, oh well, the Jews, the, the women flaunted\ntheir jewels, their jewelry and so on and people got very jealous and, but I don\u2019t think they were\naware that those were anti-Semitic feelings or anti-Semitic statements.",
        "Q: So do you think that the majority of the Viennese people were perhaps, apathetic toward...",
        "A: Yes, yes. But, but when it then came to looting, I should say it, it\u2019s ugly to say but I feel that the\nAustrians are very, very big opportunists. Every single one of them and when it came to looting\nthen, the Jewish homes and the Jewish stores, they were all for it. All. I had a cousin who\u2019s, once,\nwhen the Nuremburg Laws came out and when the laws came out that you, that non Jews shouldn\u2019t\nbuy at Jewish stores, she said, \u201cHell with them.\u201d And went to her store where she always bought\nand for the whole day she sat in a window, in a display window with a sign in front of her that said,\nthis Jewish, this Christian swine buys in the Jewish store. It rhymes in German. This is,\n. She sat for the whole day there in the window. That\u2019s, many people saw, but many\npeople didn\u2019t have the courage to do it.",
        "Q: When, when the Nuremburg race laws were imposed in Austria, how, how did that make you\nfeel? You were...",
        "A: Well, I knew about it from the beginning. For me it wasn\u2019t anything new and I wasn\u2019t going to\nmarry a Jew anymore. Right? So it really didn\u2019t affect me. But I know, I know for instance an\nacquaintance of mine went to, to the prison where I was also because he had a Jewish girlfriend and\nI, I visited him in the prison not knowing that a short time later I would be in there too. So.",
        "Q: So you, did you, would you say that, you described that when you, when you were married that\nthere was a sad feeling...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And perhaps a feeling of danger. Did you continue to feel that or did you feel . . .",
        "A: No, I, I felt very, in a way I felt euphoric. Now we did it, hell with them. And, and the other\nside I said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s in store for us. But now we are together.\u201d",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t feel that somehow you...",
        "A: An, an oppressive mood. No, no, no. I felt, for him, for my husband, I was always trying to get\nhim out of the country as quickly as he could because I knew he was in danger. Before we were\nmarried, we once walked very close to where I lived and with a friend of his and three Nazis...",
        "A: That was before the Nazis came to power.",
        "A: Three Nazis came towards us and this Jewish friend of ours had a very heavy Polish accent and\nwhen those three came they mimicked our Jewish friend. They were so tall that Bill had to\npractically jump and hit one into the face. I was paralyzed with fear, what will they do? They\ndidn\u2019t do anything. They just walked on this way and we walked on that way in the opposite\ndirection but I think my heart stopped beating. So I knew that he would do things like that. I knew\nhim and I always tried to push, go, go, go. Until he went. And his going, no, it didn\u2019t take seven\nyears because I came visiting him in Yugoslavia for two days, three days on his birthday the next\nyear. I went on the train. [talkover] Right. In September \u201938 it was?",
        "A: Yah.",
        "Q: \u2018Kay. I went down to Yugoslavia and I met him there in the hotel and we, we tried to forget\neverything bad even as we knew that the Gestapo was very close by, watching us. It didn\u2019t matter.\nHe had then dealings with the Greek Underground for ships that he rented in order to bring illegal\nimmigrants to Palestine and the three days went by very, very fast.",
        "Q: This is September of \u201938.",
        "A: September, \u201938. His birthday is the 21\u201c of September. So I came down, I think it was a Saturday\nor Sunday and I stayed Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Then I went back to Vienna.",
        "Q: Were you aware of all that Dr. Perl was doing?",
        "A: Yes. I was aware. [talkover] Yes. I did, in some way even try to help. I do not know whether I\nwas much help but I tried anyhow.",
        "Q: In what way?",
        "A: With his office. He had the office and I went very often there to, to see what is going on and\nwhat the, the girls, he had a, a number of secretaries what they were doing. \u2018Kay?",
        "Q: So you were just checking in on them?",
        "A: Yes and if there, when I thought that there was something to be done that could be done that they\ndidn\u2019t think of I told them get in touch with this person, get in touch with this person, and so on and\nso on.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s pause.\nEnd of Tape 1.\nTape 2",
        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mrs. Lore Perl. It\u2019s\nNovember 13\", 1996 and this is Arwen Donahue, Scott Miller is also an interviewer and this is tape\nnumber two, side A. And Mrs. Perl, tell us a little bit more about your visit with Dr. Perl, how,\n[talkover]",
        "A: Now the first, he came, first of all I had smuggled money out to cousins of his which I gave them\nin, in Fume and then I went to his hotel. I, I think he wasn\u2019t even there and when he returned and he\nfound me he was quite happy. And then we went out and we came into a demonstration that was\nvery, very scary for me. The, the people were shouting Hitler, Duce of, Hitler and, and Mussolini.",
        "A:",
        "A: Yah. And Hitler and the Duce should go down.",
        "A: The Duce.",
        "A: The Duce, the Mussolini, they should go down [talkover] and, and he brought, no pulled me into\na doorway and we there we were standing. I, you cannot imagine the, though the street was filled\nwith people, one next to the other, it was really a horrible feeling. And after the whole thing was\ncalmed down, we went into the hotel and we, we tried to forget what had been and what we had\nbeen through and we just were happy to be together. And then we went out for dinner and it must\nhave been a long dinner because I do not recall how long it took. We took home a carriage.",
        "A: I had been drinking. I, that\u2019s one of the three times I have been high. I wasn\u2019t drunk in my life\nbut I was high and she always tells me how in the carriage I was singing at the top of my voice.",
        "A: Yes, he was really singing at the top of his voice. When we came to the hotel I tried to shush\nhim. And I think I probably succeeded because it was already very late, so, this, this was our\nhoneymoon. And the next day I had to leave.",
        "Q: Did you, it sounds as if you both may have had really a feeling of, of hopefulness for the future.",
        "A: I tell you, I always thought if Willie promised me to get the moon, he will get it. And well, so.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: At this time I knew that he would not stay in Europe, that he would go to America and he will\nmake it. I, I had so, I can\u2019t talk, can\u2019t talk. There might have been dangerous times, I knew that\nalso but I knew that he would make it. I knew it. As I always told when I came home, when the\nwar was over and I came home from concentration camp, I always told everybody Willie will be\nhere in May. Well he was, he was here on the 22\u2122 of June. So every, every soothsayer can make a,\na three week error, right? That\u2019s it and he was there. So I, I really knew whatever will happen it\nwill end well. And I think he is an eternal optimist, he, anyhow, for him there\u2019s nothing that can be\nbad. Everything will turn out well and it did. So.",
        "Q: Back in Vienna, it was September of \u201938...",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Do you remember Kristallnacht and the events?",
        "A: Oh sure, sure. I remember that very well. His aunt Liesel whom I loved very much, no Valerie. .",
        "A: Valerie, yah.",
        "A: Valerie called me and said, \u201cCan you help?\u201d And I said, \u201cI, I really don\u2019t know what to, you\ncouldn\u2019t come here because you are two.\u201d She had a friend. And the friend was a very, a person\nwhom you could see because he was very tall, very heavy, very big so you would not be able to\nmiss him, you cannot hide him.",
        "A: He was very Jewish looking.",
        "A: Yeah, you couldn\u2019t hide him. So I told her, \u201cI\u2019Il come to you and we\u2019ll see what we can do.\u201d\nSo, and when I was there, we developed a plan that the best thing would probably be to take a taxi\nand drive around. And this is what we did. The whole night we drove around in the taxi. I sat next\nto the chauffeur and the two of them sat in the rear. And, we were driving and we saw everything\nand the guy, we told the guy just drive here and there and we drove into neighborhoods where we\nknew that there were very few Jews so that it wasn\u2019t too obviously. But the guy was very good a\ndriver. He drove us and drove us and in the morning when it, when the sky got gray he drove us\nback to the house and the two were safe. By the way, her two sons were saved too. They had come\nwith the first transport to Israel.",
        "A: Too risky for . Risky for a few days before the so-called Kristallnacht which is a\nmisnomer, the Germans give it the name Kristallnacht because the crystal, the broken crystals cover\nthe streets and this is a, . Kristallnacht makes, takes away of the horror.\nKristallnacht is the night of the national German pogrom. That\u2019s how I call it. And you, I think you\nshould, she should tell you of some of the things which she saw during .",
        "A: No, no. This doesn\u2019t help, I\u2019m sure you have heard this a hundred times. How the mob went\nand broke into houses, into, into stores, how they carried as I told you when it came to plundering,\nthey were all not anti-Semitic but they were on the bandwagon. They carried furniture and\neverything around and they, it, 1t was, it was horrible. You saw the flames leaping up. No, I can\u2019t\ntalk about it, really.",
        "Q: Were any of your friends hurt?",
        "A: I, I do not remember that. I don\u2019t remember any more. This is, I told you that I\u2019m very good in\nrepressing and this is one of the things that I have completely blocked out. Even you as a\npsychiatrist or, or a pseudo-psychologist wouldn\u2019t be able to get it out.",
        "Q: And then in September 1939 of course, is the beginning of, of the war.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: The, Germany invades Poland.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What were your feelings then asa...",
        "A: That, that\u2019s very odd. I remember that I wanted to go swimming and a cousin of mine came and,\nand she said, she shouted at the window, \u201cWar has broken out!\u201d So we, I\u2019m not going swimming.\nThat, that was the side of the war breaking out. No, but I knew and I hoped it would\nbe the end. But of course I hoped wrongly. I hoped that with the break, the breaking out of the war,\nthat America would get into the war right away and it would be an end. And then the Russians\ncame and the Russians said now Germany, kaput, then America, kaput. That was their motto. So.",
        "Q: What activities were you involved in? What did you do in Vienna in the early years of the war\nuntil your arrest?",
        "A: I was working and I was arrested at the place that I told you that imported from Germany dryers,\nfrom there I was arrested. I worked there as a secretary and the guy was a very good Nazi and I\nremember that there was a, a lady working there. She had one son and that one son was killed in the\nwar. And I remember that she put an ad into the newspaper, was proud, so I announce the dead of\nmy son. Those were the people I worked with but it didn\u2019t affect me in any way. I was Miss Rollig\nand that was it. And when I was arrested I know that he night away ran to the Gestapo to find out\nwhat I had done. I had never heard from him again, of course not.",
        "Q: What reports were you getting from Poland by 1941, 1942? The, the final solution was\nunderway.",
        "A: Well, you know that we could not listen to foreign radios. Foreign radios, there were trucks\ngoing up and down the streets which checked who is listening to foreign broadcasts. We did it\nanyhow but the broadcasts were scarce and they really did, at least for me, they did not tell me too\nmuch. I knew that when the Germans went in that there would be massacres. I knew that. But I\nknew only through my feeling, I didn\u2019t really, it was not certified.",
        "A: ,",
        "A: And no it wasn\u2019t also information it was just my feeling that they would do horrible things.\nThen I, I was arrested. My arrest came about, I had a very good friend and she came to me and she\ntold me, she had married one of the richest men in Vienna. His name was Tappish Rockshine(ph).\nShine was his name and the Rock because he had the largest Oriental rock stores in Vienna. And\nshe married him in the hope that with his money, they might come to America. Well one day she\ncame to me and she told me, \u201cWe have received notice that we have to go to the resettlement point.\u201d\nAnd the resettlement point was there, there and she said, \u201cI know he will go, I won\u2019t go. Can you\nhelp me?\u201d Said, \u201cSure, stay here.\u201d So she stayed with me and my father had just died and I, I was\nvery down and I wanted to go on vacation and I went to relatives in Silesia to, for two weeks to\nrecuperate. And in order to not make it obvious that, that she is alone in the apartment, I ask a\ncousin of mine to stay in the apartment with her. So when light is on, the water is running, that\npeople do not say hey, who\u2019s there, this apartment isn\u2019t empty, she isn\u2019t there. And while I was\ngone, she did something very stupid. She went to her lawyer. And when she came to her lawyer,\nthe Gestapo was there because he had a Jewish wife. So when she came, they said, \u201cEh, come on\nin,\u2019 and so on. And I do not know what they did to her but she told them that she had been hiding\nand the Gestapo came from my cousin and, and told, and she told him then the Gestapo that I am\naway and when I will be back. And when I came back, she told me, \u201cYou have visitors.\u201d So I\nthought that maybe that SS man of whom I told you that he was so nice, that he had sent them. But\nthey, he hadn\u2019t sent them. They just interviewed me and they took me to the Gestapo headquarter\nand there they were telling me all kinds of things and threatening me, me with all kinds of things\nand telling me what a threat I am to the, to the German spirit with my doing what I am doing. And\nthen they let me go again. [talkover] Don\u2019t, don\u2019t, yah, I said to them, \u201cListen I, I have, I didn\u2019t\nknow that she was Jewish. I have been friend with her for a long time and she came that she had a\nfight with her husband and she wanted to stay away from him for a while.\u201d So the, I don\u2019t whether\nthey believed it but they let me go. But don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it again. And then, I went home and I\nstayed at home for some time when I got the letter from this friend, Valerie, that she is in, in a very\nbad situation. She needs food and she needs clothes. Would I please send it to her. Of course I\nmade the package and I send it to her. And this is when the Gestapo came and arrested me.",
        "Q: Where was Valerie at the time? Where was the package sent?",
        "A: To Poland. To some place in Poland, I do not recall anymore to where at, but 1t was the end, I\nnever heard from her again, and, and I was brought to the Gestapo and from the Gestapo I was\nbrought to Rossaeur Lande(ph), that was the prison where I told you before that I visited a friend of\nours who had an affair with a Jewish girl who was there imprisoned. This is where I went first.",
        "Q: So you were arrested, not because you were Jewish, married to a Jew.",
        "A: No, because I helped Jews. Oh I can show you...",
        "A: The arrest...",
        "A: The arrest report. I, I can get it. I have an arrest report that says that I was arrested for behavior\nthat\u2019s not worth a, a Gentile woman and that I do sacrifice the, the, the, for the person it would be\nhealth, I do not know what [talkover] it is. Endangered the, the security of the German people. So\nthat, that was my arrest report. I think he\u2019s going to find it. And I was for three weeks in Vienna at\nthe Rossauer Lande Prison and then I was brought to Ravensbriick. The trip to Ravensbruck lasted\nweeks because they, we were in a train and they used the train for troop movement so whenever we\nwere somewhere in the way, they put us aside so that the, the troops can move. We, I was in a little\ncell that was meant for two people. We were five in there. Three had to stand, two could sit. And\nit would always change.",
        "Q: Was this in the jail, in...",
        "A: No, that was in the, in the train that was used for transporting prisoners. And then we stopped at\nevery little place where they had prisons that they could putted us in. We stopped I know in\nSanpurltin(ph) and then in, there was one prison that had just been built that was a very clean one.\nWe were very happy to be there even if we were in a one-man cell, five or six people. It was clean.\nWe also stopped at the Pankrus(ph) that\u2019s the big prison in Prague. That was a horrible experience.\nWe had to stand there with our back to the wall and our hands stretch out that, try to do that for an\nhour. And try to do that for five and six hours and you will see how hard it is. Then finally when I\ngot into a cell, there were Yugoslav partisans in, there was such a stench, you cannot imagine. It\nwas a stench of, of, of flesh being, being eaten up by illness. And those partisans had been beaten\nbadly on the soles of their feet and on their backs. Their backs were raw. There was no bandage,\nno nothing. I remember that I tore up chemise...",
        "A: Cloth?",
        "Q: Huh?",
        "A: A rag, a cloth.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Shirt.",
        "A: No, an undershirt [talkover]. And I tore it up to strips in order to help one of the women to cover\nher back. There was no salve, no medicine, no nothing and the groaning and the moaning I have\nstill in my ears. From there we went then on Wieherachen, there was another big place and some\nother prisons which I do not remember into Berlin. Berlin Alexanderplatz. This was the, the big\nprison in, in Berlin. While we were there, bombs were falling. Bedbugs were one of the first\nthings. You could hear them when they came down and fell on you. And the stench, unbelievable.\nAnd while we were there, the bombs were falling and people were praying. Some were crying and I\nalways told them, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we'll get out of this.\u2019 We did get out of it. We came to\nRavensbruck and until today, I do not know how we get from Berlin to Ravensbruck. I know we\ngot there because I was there but I couldn\u2019t tell you how. I only know when we arrived in\nRavensbruck we were had to stand in formation, two holes deep. And all the time in the prison and\non the trip from the prison to Ravensbruck I, I always had the feeling it\u2019s not I that\u2019s happening to,\nsomebody else, and I was outside just watching what was happening. When we came to\nRavensbruck I learned, I had to wake up. While we were standing there, there were two witnesses\nof Jehovah coming and they had a big basket in between them. They were walking on the street the\nso-called Lagerstrasse and a big truck was coming. And the truck would, was going so close that\nthe mirror that a side mirror that he had, hit one of the women. The women fell and the rear wheel\nwent over her. All the people who were standing there in formation searched for what. But the\noverseers right away did sick the dogs at us. And this was the moment when I awoke and knew, I\ncan\u2019t dream anymore. That\u2019s I, that\u2019s not somebody else. So sometimes I think that that woman\ndied so that I can live, okay. Now while I was in Vienna there was a girl there who\ntold, who had come in from Ravensbruck for an interview of, at the Gestapo. And she had told me\nwhen you come to Ravensbruck I\u2019m sure that\u2019s where you\u2019re going, ask for so and so. She will be\nable to help you. She is a very tiny dark-haired girl and she has, she is in the, in the receiving line\nfor all the people who come in. And she\u2019ll help you. And this is what I did and the girl told me,\n\u201cTl come visit you in the block in the evening,\u201d and this is, this is what she did. I stayed at the\nreceiving block who was run by a Viennese prostitute. Everybody went into this block first. And\nwe stayed there, we, there were the bunks. And every bunk was supposed to hold one person.\nThere, in every bunk were at least three. Two this way and one this way. And in the morning when\nI woke up I noticed that my cloths were missing and I couldn\u2019t go for to a in clothes\nwithout shoes so I, I called and the block, the Blockalteste, the leader, this prostitute she came and\nshe said to me, \u201cYou are Viennese?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d She said, \u201cWait.\u201d And a few moments later she\ncame with other, with other clothes, not with my own so I was saved for the moment. And for the\nwhile, I think for about three or four days we stayed in this block which was horrible because there\nwas really everybody in there. And then we were separated and I went into block number one, the\nolder, not old but some political prisoners were. Rosel Jochman who became a member of\nParliament in Austria after the war, she was there. Helena Popptetts(ph) who became also some\nkind of big wig in the Austrian government after the war, she was there. And I was there and oh I\ndidn\u2019t tell you one story. When I came in Vienna into the prison, I had to wait out in the hallway for\nthe little while and for, for the few hours, a little while. And then a door was opened and I was\npushed into a room. The room was, you couldn\u2019t make out anything, it was so full of steam, of\nsmell. Everything was kind of hazy and out of this haze somebody came towards me and said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry, it isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d And this was a former teacher of mine. Muti Tiechman was her name.\nShe also had helped Jews and this was, was, was the reason why she was arrested. And when I\ncame to Ravensbruck, she already was in Ravensbruck, also into, also in this number one block.\nAnd there we, we kept up very much contact. I was her former pupil, she was my former teacher\nand somehow a bond was formed. After the war, she adopted Saul whom you met now as her\ngrandson. And she came to visit us in America twice. When we went to Europe we always visited\nher. Then she died. Now. The number one block, is that all? No.",
        "Q: You mentioned that most of the people in the number one block were political prisoners.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were they mostly Viennese?",
        "A: No, no, no. There were some Viennese but there were of course a number of Germans. The\nGermans, the young German girls mostly were arrested for distributing Communist pamphlets into\nthe population or printing them or they were Communists. They were the real Communists. And\none person was there\n[End of side 1 of tape 2]",
        "Q: This 1s tape two, side B of an interview with Lore Perl. And before we flipped the tape you were\ntalking about Ravensbruck and your block and I wondered also if you could say something about\nyour, what happened upon arrival. Were you, were you given a uniform or a badge of some sort?",
        "A: No, first of all, I do not remember our arrival. I just know that we went then into a building. We\nwent through a line where this young lady was I told you about who was supposed to help me and I\ntalked to her and they took all our belongings away and then we went on and we came into a room\nwhere we had to undress and where we got Lager clothes. And, and then we were again assembled\nand then we went out and went to this block to, no, in the beginning we all went to the block that\nwas the receiving block where everyone of us had to go. In our group that arrived there were\nFrench nuns, Polish youngsters from, the SS had closed up or emptied the whole, the Lyzeum. I\nthink you can say Lyzeum in English too. Lycee? No, I don\u2019t know. And they were all there and\nall, the baby\u2019s crying, and all of them were of course stand frightened, bewildered. That was all that\nyou could be. Then you were thrown into this mass of people in the, in the receiving block where\neverybody was there. From criminals to political prisoners. They all were and all, the women were\nall unwashed, dirty. The clothes that we received was not the cleanest either and, and it was\nmiserable.",
        "Q: You mentioned seeing the two women who were Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses . . .",
        "A: Witnesses.",
        "Q: How, how could you tell that they were?",
        "A: Oh, they had, everyone in the camp had a different, the triangle on the sleeve and the purple\ntriangle was the Witnesses of Jehovah. And those two women had those triangles.",
        "Q: So at the time you, you didn\u2019t know that they were...",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. I only learned later what they were. I recognized the, the triangle and the color of it\nbut I did not know. Maybe somebody told me also. I couldn\u2019t tell you.",
        "Q: Do you remember, were you given a number?",
        "A: Sure. Right when you entered you were given a number and you were supposed to sew the\nnumber on your sleeve. I had some 80,000 and some, 18 thousand and something, I do not know\nhow much it was. I don\u2019t remember anymore. I just know the 18 thousand. My baby\u2019s asleep.",
        "Q: What color badge were you given?",
        "A: Red. Red. All the political prisoners had red badges. The so-called, the Jews had yellow,\nyellow triangles and the people who were, they were the, some of them had black triangles, those\nwere like the, our block and the, and the receiving block the one who was a prostitute or also the, I, I\nthink that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: Was there segregation between the different classes of prisoners? Or did you have. . .",
        "A: Sure. Sure. Sure, we would not have associated with criminals, right? The criminals also had\nblack and I think that the political prisoners did keep a lot together. By the way, in the same block\nthat I was was also Jan McGlock(ph). Jan McGlock(ph) was the sister of LaGuardia the mayor of\nNew York. When the camp was liberated, Eisenhower wanted to bring her over on a special quota\nbut of course LaGuardia was very much against it. He wanted her to come the regular way. She\nwas there with her daughter and her grandson. For a long time they had been in the bunker because\nthe SS didn\u2019t want them to be in, in the population, in the camp population, but finally all three of\nthem were released.",
        "Q: You had quite a, a group of people in your block, it sounds like...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You mentioned several people who really .. .",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Became prominent later on.",
        "A: Right, right. And I think that amount of Germans, there were also people who became\nprominent later. But I, as they were not Austrians and not from Vienna, I didn\u2019t keep track of them.\nBut the people in our block were really special, altogether special people, not that I claim to be a\nspecial people but the others were, most of them were.",
        "Q: Did you know at the time that LaGuardia\u2019s sister was there? Did you know that she was the...",
        "A: When, after she came...",
        "Q: Sister of the mayor of New York?",
        "A: Yah, after she came out of the bunker and came into our block, she of course told us. And you\nknow that she was the one we practiced English with? If there was a word, I remember she brought\nme a book that I should read, the first book in English in the camp was Men Against Death. Do you\nknow? I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t. It\u2019s about Sammelvise(ph), the guy who found out in Hungary that so\nmany women died, died in childbirth because the doctors didn\u2019t wash hands. That was the first, she,\nand there were of course words that I didn\u2019t understand in spite of the fact that my English was, let\u2019s\nsay, pretty good for European school English. But there were certain words that I didn\u2019t get and\nthen she would be the one who, to tell me what it means. So, I did something for my\neducation in Ravensbruck.",
        "Q: Did you...",
        "Q: Were Jewish prisoners in a, in any way...",
        "A: Separate.",
        "Q: Separate, were they in any way singled out in terms of harsh treatment?",
        "A: No, no. Harsh treatment was really for everybody the same. It was just the kind of work that\nyou could get that would remove some of the harshness of the life. See for instance, I worked in the\nlibrary and I worked in the book binding. For me, life as such wasn\u2019t that harsh because I didn\u2019t\nhave to go out in the morning and pull the...",
        "A: Steamroller.",
        "A: The steamroller. Women used to every day go out and pull the steamroller and I had, later on I\nmade a friend whom I got away from there because somehow prisoners did have some influence on\nwhat could happen to prisoners and I got her away. Her name was Annemarie Thiele. She came\nthen to America as a cousin of ours. We sent her an affidavit.",
        "A: She was not Jewish.",
        "A: But she was in camp because she had an affair with a Jewish man. And she wore the black and\nyellow star, so. We sent her then an affidavit to come to America. She was a cousin of mine.",
        "Q: Did you witness other brutality?",
        "A: Yes, but, but I do not want to talk about it. It\u2019s, it\u2019s too, too, it\u2019s too harmful for me and it\nwouldn\u2019t do any, and it wouldn\u2019t do anything. I have here still a big dent where a SS woman kicked\nme. I have this where an SS woman slashed against me and when I made like that, she stabbed my\nhand and you see the finger?",
        "Q: She stabbed it.",
        "A: Yes, she was angry at me because I wasn\u2019t fast enough with something or I didn\u2019t understand\nwhat she meant, so she grabbed a scalpel and she went like that to me and I made of course like that\nand, did you see it? So, I knew that there were experiments going on because when you went on the\nstreet that ran between the barracks, the two rows of barracks, you could hear the moaning and the\ngroaning. And, so you knew what, what happening. Some...",
        "Q: Medical experiments?",
        "A: Yes. Medical experiments and some of the prisoners, some, there was one block where they kept\nthe prisoners who had gone over the edge. And it was really terrible. It was so bad that after I had\nmy first son, in, within a very short time, he, he found out if he cried in a certain way, he could have\nanything he wanted, because it did remind me so much of Ravensbruck that I just wanted him to be\nquiet and not cry. In this way, he found out very early. Children do.",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t drive through the tunnel in New York.",
        "A: Oh yeah, a long, late, when I was in New York, for a long time when we went through the\nLincoln Tunnel, I felt sick. I felt like throwing up, die, I always told him, \u201cPlease, let\u2019s not,\u201d told\nmy husband, \u201cPlease, let\u2019s not go through the tunnel anymore.\u201d And then we talked and we talked,\nand after all he\u2019s a psychologist. And one day he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go and look what\u2019s what.\u201d And it was\na very slow traffic and I really looked and you know what\u2019s really amazing, at the bottom end,\npardon me, and at the top of the tunnel of the tiles, were black stripes. I do not remember now\nanymore whether they were double stripes or single stripes. I knew that was in the shower room in\nRavensbruck. From then I could go through the tunnel without any problem. We had found out\nwhat caused the problem. So. When I already was in America I could for instance, not eat steak.\nThe smell of seared flesh just made me sick. Courtesy of Ravensbruck.",
        "Q: What was the first job that you had there? What was your first work detail?",
        "A: My first work detail was in the SS library. Working with the SS like for instance in the library,\nin the book binding and so on, we, we, were mostly political prisoners and we had all\none advantage. We could take a shower once a week because the SS was afraid that they might get\nlice too 1f we get lice, right? So they, they tried to keep us clean. And I remember that the shower\nwas something that was very, very important for us, because it separated you more or less from the\ndirtiness of the camp. Because the camp was not paved. Everything was dust. And then you were\nstanding for hours and hours at attention whether it was cold or hot. It didn\u2019t do very much to your\nimage.",
        "A: Roll call in the morning.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Every morning would you go for roll call?",
        "A: Very early in the morning. We got up, I don\u2019t remember the time anymore but it was very early.\nIt was either five, four or five o\u2019clock. And we had about so and so many minutes to get ready and\nhave our breakfast, then we had to stand at attention, at the apell(ph) as it was called. And then we\nwere standing there as long as the SS did feel it was good for us. And then a bell rang and we could\ngo to work.",
        "Q: Did you, were, was it cold?",
        "A: Sure it was cold. We didn\u2019t have any clothes. We had very thin prisoner\u2019s clothes. And you\ndidn\u2019t have, you hardly had any underwear. Later on when I was a little bit familiar with the camp,\nI went to some of the Witnesses of Jehovah who were in charge of all the clothing that had come in\nand they stole for me for my bundle, underwear so that I could have underwear. You, you had some\nvery flimsy stuff. You, you must know from, from the museum and so on, you know how thin the\nclothes was that you had and sometimes when it got very cold, we got a jacket which didn\u2019t very\nmuch against the cold either. And up there it can get very cold. The wind is extremely cold and if\nsomebody, for instance, out of fatigue or not feeling well, if somebody fainted, that was fatal\nbecause he was just trampled, or she was just trampled to death. Not that somebody picked her up\nand brought her to the doctor, to the hospital, she was just trampled to death. That\u2019s if somebody\nfelt sick, we always tried to lean one against the other to hold her up. Sometimes it failed.",
        "Q: How was your health?",
        "A: Pretty good until one day I had a, a very odd episode. I reached for something and when I\nreached I, I collapsed. I got all blue and I don\u2019t know, until today I don\u2019t know why. I just\ncollapsed and they brought me then to the so-called Revier. Revier is infirmary. And there the,\nthere was a Czech heart specialist, a prisoner and she looked at me and she said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s the camp.\u201d\nAnd I remember, I thought, I thought it\u2019s my heart because I\u2019m all blue so they didn\u2019t have any\nmedicine. I just was lying there for some time and she ordered some rest. I went to the hospital and\nI stayed in the hospital a few days and then I went out again. That was all. So. And with this here I\ngot bandaged and they couldn\u2019t do anything because they didn\u2019t have suture material.",
        "Q: With the wound on your hand.",
        "A: Yeah, so it just grew the way it is and when I came to America, the friend of ours said, \u201cHave it\ndone, you can have this all fixed.\u201d But then I had a baby, I had a new life, a new, a new house and\nreally a new husband because we hadn\u2019t lived together for too long a time. I didn\u2019t want to be in a\ncast for six months. This is what, no, six weeks. That\u2019s what they said. I didn\u2019t want it. So I still,\nuntil now, I don\u2019t play piano, I don\u2019t play guitar anymore, so...",
        "A: You can\u2019t type.",
        "A: I cannot type because I hit another type. Now it comes in handy because I don\u2019t have to work\nthe computer. So, see? There\u2019s always some silver lining, even if you don\u2019t know tt.",
        "Q: How many, how, what were your hours of work each day?",
        "A: Of, I believe from seven \u2018til twelve but this, I\u2019m not absolutely sure. Billy, you\u2019re banging.",
        "Q: Twelve...",
        "A: From, twelve noon. And then we had an hour for lunch and then again of, until five, until six. I,\nI really don\u2019t remember. But in the evening we could sit together after dinner, when after work we\nhad dinner, the food was brought in very, very big...",
        "A: Pockets(ph).",
        "A: No, kettles, a kettle with handles on the side. They were almost as big as we and they carried it, I\nremember that we sometimes four, two on each side tried to hold onto the handle and drag it. And\nevery block got one of those things and this is the way we were being fed. In the morning we got\nsomething that was called coffee. It was some kind of a brown water and a piece of bread. And at\nlunch we got some soup. It was again water with a little bit of something swimming in it. And in\nthe evening sometimes it was rice with milk, also very watery. Well, when I came out, I had, I\nweighed 90 pounds. So you know I weigh now 127. So I, I looked like that.",
        "Q: Did you have any supplemental food at all?",
        "A: Oh yes. Yes. I was very, very fortunate. I tell you all my life long I was always fortunate.\nWhen I came to camp I had the, the name of a woman who helped me to get into a good block.\nWhen I was in camp such, I had the support of Muti Teichman and the support of Rosel Jochman\nand Helen and so on. And I had really a lot of support and from the outside as I had sent packages\nto other people, now other people send packages to me. It wasn\u2019t much, because there was\nrationing going on but it was always a big joy. For everybody around. Even if you got only a bite,\nit was already, well I mean it was life.",
        "Q: You would share the packages that you received?",
        "A: Of course, of course. So would other people. The only people who did not share anything were\nthe Polish girls. They didn\u2019t give.",
        "A: Jewish people were gentle.",
        "A: This I don\u2019t know. But the Polish girl, Poland still had a lot of food and they really got food but\nthey rather let 1t spoil than share it with somebody who was not Polish. This is something I, until\ntoday, I do not understand. We worked with one Polish girl, she worked with me in the library and I\ncould never understand how they could do this.",
        "Q: What about your work in the library, what did you do there?",
        "A: Just play in library and work, I, I gave books out, I note, marked it and I got the books returned\nand if books were late I sent out a reminder, that was all. Was not a very hard job. And in the, in\nthe, in book binding, it was interesting, I really learned book binding. So if you have a book to bind,\ndon\u2019t bring it to me.",
        "Q: Who was checking out books at the library? Who was the library for?",
        "A: The SS people. That was the SS library.",
        "Q: What sorts of books did the library have?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I didn\u2019t read a single one. I would assume, and just an assumption that this\nwere all political books. They wouldn\u2019t have novels or anything of that kind. My assumption. So.",
        "Q: But the prisoners were not allowed to check out any books.",
        "A: No, no, we did not, the prisoners did not have a library. So there, this would have been too much\nof a privilege.",
        "Q: Were, who were the other people working in the library, were they all political prisoners?",
        "A: Yes, yes. One of them was this one Polish girl. She was very beautiful, a blonde, a little bit\ndumpy, Jewish girl and she stayed dumpy because she got a lot of food from the outside. I do not\nremember anybody else. I think Helena Pottetts(ph) came sometime, as kind of an overseer,\nchecking whether everything is okay. But not for us, for them. \u2018Kay?",
        "Q: And then, was the work in the book bindery a separate job where you transferred?",
        "A: Sure, sure. Book binding was together a, it was a separate job and the overseer of book binding\nwas also a Fursorgerin and he help out.",
        "A:",
        "A: She was leading the social work program of the camp. That was all in one and she was a\nmiserable, miserable thing. Very tiny, very dried up with the, pardon me, with the hair around in,\nin, braids around her head, on the top of her head. And she told us that she was in love with a\nJewish man and he jilted her and she\u2019s very happy that she didn\u2019t marry him. So you know what\nkind of a person she was. She wrote, if people inquired how prisoners are, is, how is so and so and\nhow is so and so. I remember answering one letter for her. I sometimes did typing there and I\nanswered one letter, writing to the parents of a girl who was there. She is okay, she\u2019s very busy and\nshe\u2019s too lazy to write, but Pll make her write. That\u2019s what I typed. The, that girl was dying of TB,\nSO.",
        "Q: Did you, did you know the girl personally?",
        "A: After I had sent the letter I wanted to tell her your parents inquired. In fact I went to her, she was\ndying. But, she was a very young kid, maybe 18 maybe 19. So.",
        "Q: Did you have any contact with the outside world? For example did you have any contact with\nDr. Perl at all?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I had a, I had a telegram going through Red Cross. And one day I had a, a call that I\nhave to come to the Kommandant to his office and when I came, he asked me, \u201cWho is Mr.\nLindpeutner?\u201d\u2019 And I said, \u201cMr. Lindpeutner is a cousin of mine.\u201d \u201cHow come you have contact\nwith America?\u201d \u201cWell, he\u2019s in love with me and he wants to marry me.\u201d That\u2019s what the telegram\nsaid. So he said, \u201cOh, and is he a Jew?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, how can Lindpeutner be a Jew? Right?\u201d So he\nlet me go and I knew that Willie knew where I was because the, I\u2019m sure the Red Cross did tell him.\nI had occasionally a letter from a friend of mine and that was about it. I could write once, I think\nonce a month, I do not remember.",
        "Q: You mentioned that people were sending you food packages occasionally.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: Who was it that was sending them?",
        "A: There was one couple that, whose daughter I had tutored to get through school and they were\nalways very fond of me and while I was in Vienna in prison still, they said they would help. And he\nwent with the Postal Service to Romania and to Hungary and so on. And he got at those other\ncountries, food. That was really all that counted. And they were one, that was one couple that send\nme food. Then I had another friend, her husband was a painter and they were absolutely apolitical.\nI, if I ever saw a person as apolitical as those two were, they were very much concerned with\nholistic medicine and, and, and all kinds of things...",
        "A: psychology.",
        "A: And not, they were not interested in life per say. So they also, she was a very lively person and\nshe also, she went to this friend of mine who used to give me food for the transports. She went to\nher and she got there food for me. So that\u2019s how I, those were the two people who send packages.",
        "Q: And did those showers that you were allowed to take every week prevent you from getting lice at\nall\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah, sure, because you see when you are able to change your clothes, lice don\u2019t grow and if\nyou're not too, in too close contacts, I mean a louse doesn\u2019t grow on your body, you have to get\none from somebody else, right?",
        "Q: So no one in that block one had lice.",
        "A: Right, right. We were very, as I told you I was, through all that tragedy, I was always very\nfortunate. For instance, when I was released, why was I released? I had an uncle who worked in the\nForeign Ministry and he was what you see in there, the grouch. The picture. That, that was he,\npardon me. He was one, he never became a Party member, never. Being in the Foreign Ministry\nand not being a Party member, they were all scared of him because whatever it was, he found a hair\nin every soup. And when he heard that I was arrested, he went to the Gestapo and he bothered the\nGestapo day in, day out, saying, \u201cI will...\u201d",
        "A: I\u2019m lying comfortably ,",
        "A: \u201cT will, I will take her into my house and I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t do anything anymore against the\ngovernment.\u201d I was called and I was told that he will vouch for me but I should live in his house. I\nwas very stupid and very stubborn because I didn\u2019t like him. I said, \u201cWhy should I go to him? I\nhave my own apartment, right?\u201d Well I was released anyhow, much earlier than was expected.\nAnd after I came home, I didn\u2019t even find the heart to tell him thank you. Because I really thought\nthat not he but his son-in-law who happened to be an SS man that he was the one who got me out. I\ndo not, I do not recall anymore how my release went. I know that I was called in the morning\nEnd of Tape 2.\nTape 3",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side A of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nLore Perl. This is Arwen Donahue and Scott Miller is also with me doing this interview and it\u2019s\nNovember 13\", 1996. Go ahead.",
        "A: I told you when I was released how it went but I still remember I got kind of a ticket for the train.\nI got a few marks and I got the bundle that I had brought to the camp. And then I do not know how\nI went to the train, how I got to the train. In any case, before I left one of the girls whispered to me,\n\u201cIf you are stuck in Berlin, call this and this number. They will help you.\u201d So when I came to\nBerlin, it was nighttime and there was no place for me to go and I didn\u2019t know really what to do. I\nwas at the station, there was no train the same night anymore. An air raid was on. I went to the\nshelter and when I sought my release from camp they said for people like you we don\u2019t have a space\nin the shelter. [talkover]",
        "A: an 1.d.",
        "A: Right. When I stood and while the bombs were falling around the station I stood in kind of\nhoping that nothing will happen. But all the time I was sure nothing will happen. I\nhadn\u2019t lived through camp and through all of this and now I should be killed by a Allied bomb, no.\nThat was just simply impossible for me. And then I went to a telephone and I called the number\nthat the girl had told me and the people told me, \u201cGo and this and this railroad and we\u2019ll pick you\nup.\u201d And they really did. And I stayed there overnight and I had the first meal. That was another\nthing that could have landed me night back again, nght? I did it anyhow. So next day I went to the\nstation and I got the train and of course the trains were constantly checked by SS and when an SS\nman came and saw my release from Ravensbruck he just looked at me and disgustedly gave it back\nto me. Fine with me. And then I arrived in Vienna. I do not remember anymore the how and when\nand what. I just went to my apartment and there lo and behold in my apartment was an aunt and a\ncousin of mine because they had been bumped out and they had moved into my apartment with all\ntheir furniture. So, the, everything was just stuck full and the second floor, two rooms were filled\nwith furniture from top to bottom. Now, if I wanted one thing or I did not want one thing to live\nwith women after I had been forced to live with so many women for so long a time. So I moved up\ninto the furniture. Into the furniture rooms and left them down there.",
        "Q: I just wanted to backtrack a bit and ask you how long all told, you were in Ravensbruck.",
        "A: About a year and a half, about, so.",
        "Q: And when you, on the day that you were allowed to leave when you were hauled to the\nCommandant\u2019s office, what were you thinking? Were you scared?",
        "A: Yeah, sure, because you never know. You really never knew what will happen. It was the\nsecond time within a short time. The first time when his telegram came...",
        "A: What was in the telegram, I don\u2019t remember the telegram?",
        "A: Just longing to be united in marriage with you. That was it. Hans Lindpeutner",
        "Q: Had you agreed on that name before?",
        "A: Yes, yes, because we had correspondent. We did write to one another via the friend in\nSwitzerland. He wrote to him, the friend put the letter into an envelope, send it to me and I did the\nsame. So I knew, I knew who Hans Lindpeutner was.",
        "A:",
        "Q: I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "A: I remember.",
        "Q: Were any of your colleagues in the block one on transports out of Ravensbruck or was the\npopulation pretty stable while you were there?",
        "A: Stable, pretty stable. There were occasionally one or two new ones came 1n but usually it was, I\ncan say only while I was there because after I was gone, I heard Rudy\u2019s mother...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: She, people were sent out into ammunition factories to work and so on and they were mostly\nkilled. But those were also people from block one.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts about the future? Did you still feel hopeful during that time?",
        "A: I tell you one thing, after I came home, I was euphoric. Then when the bombs fell all around, I\nhoped one would hit. Then later on, I would question, why am I alive? Why are all the others\ndead? Why? And it was very hard, so, the future, I knew really would come. I always told my, as I\ntold you before, always told my aunt, he\u2019ll be here in May and she would say, \u201cHa!\u201d When May\nwas over, she said, \u201cHe still didn\u2019t come.\u201d [talkover]",
        "A: When I came to pick her up she was all packed. packed, ready to leave.",
        "A: There wasn\u2019t very much to be packed because while I was gone and the Russians came near, my,\nthe cousin who had moved into the house, she had taken all the clothes that was mine. She had put\nit into suitcases and send it to, into the Burgenland [talkover] It\u2019s a province of Austria. And to, to\na, a farm, a wine growers farm that was, that belonged to the people whose daughter I tutored and\nwho sent packages. She sent all the suitcases there, hoping that when I come back that I have\nsomething left. Well what happened was, the Russians came via this village, they opened the\nsuitcases and everything that was wearable they took out and the evening gowns and the afternoon\ngowns, this way, I still have one afternoon gown.",
        "A: I remember that you had your trunk ready.",
        "A: Yes, but the trunk was ready with, with bedding and with linen [talkover] and so on. And I, I\nstill have [talkover] comforters, comforters. So? I still have comforters from Vienna. You won\u2019t\nbelieve it? It 1s so.",
        "Q: May I ask why you had such a strong feeling of not liking your uncle that you would have\npreferred staying in Ravensbruck to going and living with him?",
        "A: He was a miserable . He was just a miserable person.",
        "A: He\u2019s very stubborn. you wouldn\u2019t expect it. He\u2019s very stubborn. and\nthat\u2019s it. And nothing will change.",
        "A: No, he was, he was just miserable. I, listen, my aunt loved a dog. He knew that she loved the\ndog so he killed the dog. Is that miserable? I, I just, I just did, there are very few people whom I do\nnot like but I disliked him with a passion.",
        "A: When I asked her once why she did it, she told me, \u201cIn everything, I went in the\nconcentration camp, I tried to keep my dignity. It would have been undignified if I agree to stay\nwith this man.\u201d",
        "A: I really disliked him so utterly, I would have given up everything I stood for, so.",
        "Q: But they let you go anyway.",
        "A: They let me go anyhow.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea why?",
        "A: No. Because I was lucky. I told you, I was in all my life always very lucky, very fortunate. The\nhouse where I lived 56 bombs fell, all around. The last bomb hit across the street and destroyed the\nhouse here. All the windows were blown out...",
        "A: Of your house, where you lived.",
        "A: Yeah, the roof was gone but a flowerpot stood on the window intact. No? Isn\u2019t that a good sign?\nAnd then Willie came. Yeah, I started as, as I told you before I love children and everything was\ndisorganized, the Russians came closer and there were no schools or nothing so I collected all the\nchildren in the neighborhood and went to a place that used to be before, the kindergarten. And I, I\ntaught them and I spoke to them and we played. I had them there. And one day I got a phone call\nthat a, the, the wife of a friend of his called. Her father had died and I should provide a casket else\nhe would go into a mass grave. People always came to me if they needed something. So I, I knew a\ncarpenter so I went to the carpenter but not right away. I went down the hill in order to go the\ncarpenter. When I went down the hill I saw a jeep passing me, a jeep held in front of the house.\nAnd a man got out and I said, \u201cThose damned Russians,\u201d only Russians were in Vienna at that time.\nAnd Muti Teichman\u2019s son said, \u201cUh-uh, those are a British or Americans, Lore, those are not\nRussians [talkover].\u201d I said, \u201cBritish or Americans, that\u2019s Willie.\u201d And I started running. It was\nWillie, see.",
        "A: You were , how we met in the operation action in detail,\nhow I got her out. I still have this passport, provided for the Russian who let me\nin.",
        "Q: But...",
        "A: And then you know, yeah?",
        "Q: Oh, before we go, I, I think it\u2019s, it would be very interesting to hear how you got out of Vienna\nbut I wondered how you came back to Vienna. You had nothing, you were coming back to a place\nthat had really been destroyed. How did you manage and on top of managing organize these\nchildren?",
        "A: Well, there are certain things, you cannot say I will do this. You see there are children on the\nstreet, there you see that the children are scared. You see that the children need some kind of\ndirection that there is nobody here so you just say come, come with me and we will play together. It\nworked. Somehow I was also able always to get a piece of candy or a cookie or something. It\nhelped.",
        "Q: How did you get food for yourself?",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. I remember that the cousin who lived in my apartment did give all my\nrecords, I had a record collection, to an SS man and she got a big shopping bag full of sugar. That\nwas one way. So you bought it. I went with Muti Teichman into the countryside to get some flour\nand some butter or whatever it was. We bartered clothes, whatever we had and survive.",
        "A: And you went to this, to the SS ,",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no. That was not SS. The, there was, I don\u2019t know, we should turn it off. You\nask me what we lived from. Very, very frugal but one day when, after the SS had left and the\nRussians came close, we went to the pig farm and everybody was there, trying to get a pig and\neverybody who never had slaughtered a pig slaughtered the pigs. So a, this neighbor of ours who\nsend me packages to, to the camp, he also had gone up there and he brought home a pig and he\nslaughtered it. And of, from the meat and the fat that we got from that pig, we lived a long time.\nBesides this, there were bread that was rationed. Every now and then, you could get, 1f you stood in\nline very early in the morning, you could get bread and it wasn\u2019t very much but you had your ration\nand it help for the, for week maybe, if you really were very careful. So we, we lived very frugal.\nMaybe you cannot even call it living. But we survived.",
        "Q: Do you remember when the Russians entered Vienna?",
        "A: Oh sure. Day and night we heard this, I do not know how it\u2019s called in, in Vienna it was called\nthe Russian Organ(ph).",
        "A: The Italian(ph) Organ(ph).",
        "A: No, the Russian organ(ph), the .",
        "A:",
        "A: And it was going constantly, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. And this came closer and closer and\nwe had SS in our house and they were duck in the garden and what the bombs didn\u2019t destroy, they\ndestroyed with their shooting. And one night, you heard only [sound of footsteps], the SS had run.\nOh they first came to us into the basement whether we would like to go and with them. And I\nremember I said, \u201cIf I die, I don\u2019t want to die on the roadside, I die rather here.\u2019 And then in the\nmorning all was quiet and the Russians came down the street. And there was a delegation of people\nwho were very happy that the Russians came. One of them was Helena Pottsett\u2019s(ph) father. And\nhe greeted the Russians with open arms and the Russians were very happy to see them and they\ntook everything they had off them. The rings, the watches, everything. So Helena Pottsett\u2019s(ph)\nfather was then no Communist anymore. And we had next to the house a little park and this is\nwhere some of them settled down. And I remember that, the saying, now Germany kaput. Then\nAmerika kaputt. Fortunately, they were not right. Germany was kaput but they couldn\u2019t get\nAmerica kaput. And well, the rest I told you. How I came to Willie and how I had everything\npacked, the story about how we met in front of the door you have in, in the book to read and...",
        "Q: Did you tell anyone after the war had ended that you were married?",
        "A: Sure. We could. Now nobody could arrest us anymore, right? So...",
        "Q: Did anyone suspect it? Did anyone react?",
        "A: No, no. No, they just thought he\u2019s my boyfriend. In fact 1t was so much that he\u2019s my boyfriend\nthat my cousin had, what she ever had left in jewelry, she gave, gave to me and said, \u201cHere, in case\nWillie should change his mind and leave you.\u201d So.",
        "A: The Russians didn\u2019t behave well.",
        "A: No, the Russians behaved very poorly but they were an occupying force. Those were the, the\nfront troops. I guess you cannot expect anybody else, why should the Russians behave better than\nanybody else, right?",
        "A: They raped the women by the dozens, by the hundreds...",
        "A: Yeah, we, my cousin who lived in the apartment together now with me, she and I we slept for\ntwo weeks in the hospital for mentally ill that I told you a, a friend of ours was the head nurse. We\nslept there on benches because the Russians would...",
        "A:",
        "A: Yah.",
        "Q: At this point in, in 1945, did you, had you realized what had happened to the Jews of Europe as a\nwhole? Had you, at what point did you realize the full story?",
        "A: I tell you, while I was in camp, we were pretty much isolated. We didn\u2019t know very much.\nWhen I came out, it was more or less a question of day to day surviving. I do not think that then I\ndid realize what happened. Only when Willie came. Then, and we talked.",
        "Q: And he told you?",
        "A: And he told me, then did I realize what had happened.",
        "A: a little piece of margarine?",
        "A: Now, once a week I got in Ravensbruck a little piece of margarine. Now I knew he was in\nAmerica and I knew American women are beautiful. I didn\u2019t have any skin cream so what do you\ndo with the margarine? You put it on your face so in order not to get wrinkles. Today I laugh about\nit but it really wasn\u2019t a laughing matter. So. Now I have told you all my secrets. When Willie\ncame then, we, I got into the jeep and we went with the jeep with a Russian soldier that they had\ngiven him to accompany him and with a sergeant whom we called Red who by the way was here a\nfew months ago visiting with his wife. And...",
        "A: And his name used to be but he changed it now and he\u2019s Franklin, in\nNew York, and he for himself wrote for some magazine the story of how we\u2019re going\nto Vienna and my and it is the same with the exception of a few details which I don\u2019t\nremember anymore as mine.",
        "A: So we went back and the trip back was something like going into a fairy tale. The roads were\nnot roads. They had big bump holes and we, we had to go around and around the riverbeds, no\nbridges there. And towards us came those little Russian wagons with those little Russian horses and\non top were women sitting with fantastic head draped into drapes that they had taken, that they had\nlooted and it was such a, a unbelievable, colorful picture that you cannot forget it. And I remember\nthat once we had lost the way and a truck came towards us and the Russian asked the truck, we had\nlost the way, how to go and the Russian told him. And by the way, he showed him, look, how many\nwatches he had. He had...",
        "A: \u201cT have a watch,\u201d he told you. \u201c the watch.\u201d",
        "A: And that\u2019s the, the truck driver said, \u201cLook here.\u201d\u2019 And he had watches up to his elbow.",
        "A: few people in each village had their watch. watch for me. When I left\nfor, to pick up Lore, I . couple of watches from the PX. [talkover]",
        "Q: I think we got this on, on your interview. I think we got that information.",
        "A: Yeah. [talkover] he showed this proudly to this Russian truck driver who\nshowed us the way, we always, we got lost and the Russian said, \u201cLook,\u201d the whole arm full of\nwatch.",
        "A: So. And then we came to the first American station and Willie was very happy now, I will get a\ngood meal. Couldn\u2019t hold it. Not even the coffee and there were, all the toilets were only for men\nso he chased everybody out, he stood in front and if somebody wanted to go in he said, \u201cUh-uh. My\nwife is in there.\u201d And they wondered, a wife? But it, it worked. Then we came to, back to the\nstation and he drove me then to Bottnow-hime(ph) where I stayed in the hospital for three or four\nmonths. And, and then everything, from then on everything went smooth.",
        "Q: Were you very ill?",
        "A: Yes. I had angina acquired and I was physically all the way down.",
        "Q: And after how long, it wasn\u2019t so long afterwards that you became pregnant, was it?",
        "A: Yeah, about from June until March. So, I wanted a child very badly. We had lost so much time,\nso, it turned out fine. And now he, we have two grandchildren from him, so.",
        "Q: And you knew at this, at this point you were going settle in the United States, you knew you\nweren\u2019t going stay in Europe?",
        "A: No we did not know where. We had a very, very funny decision made. On the way over here\n[talkover], I was, I was on a bride ship.",
        "A: I had managed to be in control of this or something on this bride ship.",
        "A: I, so, we looked at, at a magazine and we saw a Peter, a Peter Arnoo(ph) cartoon. There, there\nwas a woman, one of those women standing on the podium and saying to secretary down there and\nnow you send this resolution to Marshall Tito(ph) so he should know where, what the women of\nMamal(ph) think about him.",
        "A:",
        "A: So he said, \u201c , let\u2019s look it up.\u201d And you know what, we bought a house in\nMamal(ph) when we came back. A Peter Arnoo(ph) cartoon, see? You never know what influences\nyour life. And I remember when I had Rafael(ph), he was a baby, and Willie went out into the\ncountry to look for houses and he came and he said, \u201cI found the house that, that I, you will like.\u201d\nBecause I always said I want soft ground under my feet.

And when we came to the border, we didn\u2019t have a passport, we didn\u2019t have car papers,\nwe didn\u2019t have anybody. That\u2019s how much I hated to go back.

That, and somehow, sometimes I feel that it\u2019s like an,\npardon me, like an umbrella above us so that really nothing can hit us and I always tell it to the\nchildren.

The Catholic religion has so\nmany restrictions which the Jewish religion doesn\u2019t have.",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "A: Such as. You can talk to God, you don\u2019t need an, a mediary. You can, you can even scold God\nif you feel like it, right? You are not forced to do this and this, this.

Where was God? And I have talked to our rabbi about it and he said, \u201cTI\ndo not know where he was but it was for the good of the Jewish people.\u201d What good can this do to\nthe Jewish people?

        "A: Yes. Now you see, if, I think that both of us and also our children have accepted my conversion.\nI didn\u2019t tell you when I came to America, in order to make it really completely prove and secure I\nwent through another conversion with dipping in the, in the mikvah and cutting the lace and cutting\nthe hair, I did that all over again, so.

        "A: Fine. My father\u2019s name was Franz Xaver and shortly after I was born, World War I broke out\nand he went into the Army and my mother and I, we were alone. My, then there was no money for\nsoldiers\u2019 wives and so on and my family wasn\u2019t rich so Mother had to work. And she went to work\nat a very unusual way. She worked for, as an, importer for a firm that reproduced wooden barrels.\nAnd she went all over to buy the right wood, I don\u2019t know any more and I never knew and never\nwill know what kind of wood it was. But she was very good at that and when my father came home\nin 1918, I was five years old. I hardly recognized him. I told my mother, \u201cThere\u2019s a strange man\nout there, would you go look for him?\u201d Then I knew it was Father. During the war he occasionally\ncame and brought food because food was very, very rare in Vienna. I have very bad memories as\nfar as food goes that Mother and I, we were standing in line for a long time. I\u2019ve, now, if, I try to\nremember, it seems it was the whole night in order to get some food ration that, that was supposed\nto come to us and when we got there, was sometimes there was no food left and sometimes, once at\nleast, I remember when we came home, there were potatoes and they were all spoiled and Mother\ncried. So I was then maybe three years old. Occasionally, we went to my grandparents. They had a\nfarm in, in Silesia, no, in, in [talkover], no, Moravia...\nfor him to get so he worked as a ditch digger and in a factory as this and in a factory as that until the\nsituation had settled.",
        "A: My, my mother\u2019s name was Anna Steiner, and my grandfather had, well factory is said too\nmuch, he had a little, what would you say...",
        "A: Shop.",
        "A: A little shop where he produced linen and I still have napkins from him. And one tablecloth that\nhe, he produced, it\u2019s a long time. And he lost that and my grandmother and two sisters and a\nbrother were alone. Grandfather died. And she...",
        "A: No, that was before the war. There, I do not know whether you are familiar with European\nhistory but there was a very, very hard time and people like now, they just had to close up. There\nwas no more, asking for good supplies and good things. People bought whatever they could and as\nlong as it wasn\u2019t too expensive and apparently what he produced was very expensive. You can see\nif I have now still something that he produced, it must have been good. Now it\u2019s more than hundred\nyears now almost. So, my mother and my father married in 1909 and I was born in 1913.",
        "A: My mother had one stillborn child. That, that was all, no more. That was before me. I was an\nonly one. He claims you can still see it. But it doesn\u2019t, ;",
        "A: My father was a Social Democrat. He was very much concerned with the welfare of poor people\nand he tried to help as much as he could. He became a councilman in the city council and he was,\nhe was kind of, well shunned, because wherever it was and wherever he went he would say, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s\nfine but, but you have to do something for those people.\u201d For instance he organized that, at\nChristmas, baskets would go out with food to poor families and of course, he wasn\u2019t loved for that\nby the people who had to fill the baskets. And, I guess I grew up in that spirit. I still love to send\nbaskets too but I send them, so. And my mother was very helpful in everything that had to be done\nin this respect. In fact, my father used to say, \u201cIf you want something from Mother, she will give\nyou her last shirt.\u201d And it, it was true, so.",
        "A: Yeah. My mother was very religious. She was Catholic. She was very religious in the way that\nshe thought you have to, you have a certain amount of obligation and you have to help wherever\nher, you can. That was mostly her religion. The rest of her family, there was one aunt who went to\nchurch almost daily and my father didn\u2019t think very much in religious terms. He always said that\nreligion is the crutch of the poor and the church tries to keep them in bondage. That was his feeling\nSO aS you can see my, for some time, I went to parochial school because apparently it was then\nalready, also better than the public schooling. It was not too good an experience for me, and I\ndropped out.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, he never had any. For us, in our house, my father had a friend who was a priest.\nThey came and they came together and they argued for hours. And my father used to say, \u201cAnd\nwhere was God when, on the, on the, in the war when the people were lying on the ground moaning\nand dying by the hundreds? Where was God then?\u201d That\u2019s what people ask now about the\nHolocaust, too, right? He had the same attitude. We had, we had Jewish friends. I had a very, very\ngood Jewish friend. She died last year in California. We, we kept very close all the time. Whether\nsomebody was as he always said, \u201cWhether somebody\u2019s green, blue or red, it doesn\u2019t matter, as\nlong as they are good.\u201d And this was his attitude. And for religious reason, he didn\u2019t really, I don\u2019t\nthink he had any feelings for or against any kind of religion. He just didn\u2019t believe into the\ndoctrines of the religions. [talkover]",
        "A: Discrimination, really only against me. My father, we, I was once detained, wrongly in the\nafternoon and my parents were very concerned that I didn\u2019t come home, even then you didn\u2019t know\nwhat happened. If your child is supposed to be home at one thirty, and at three or four o\u2019clock, it\u2019s\nnot at home, you wonder. So my father came to school and I recall that the, the priest had kept me\nand a few other girls in school for a very funny incidence. He asked what was Christ when he was\nfor 40 days in the, in the desert and there was no food and that was at this time, the time of the\npeople who were called \u201chunger artists\u201d. I don\u2019t think you know what that means here. There were\npeople who were going on a hunger strike for so and so long in order to, to show, to prove\nsomething. And when, when the priest asked what was Christ, one of the girls said, \u201cA hunger\nartist.\u201d And then he said, \u201cWho said that?\u201d And of course, nobody did say so I was one of the ones\nwho were supposed to have said it and three or four others were there too. And my father came and\nhe told the priest that what he did was wrong because he can keep me at, if he thinks I did\nsomething wrong the next day, am I too wordy?",
        "A: That he can keep me the next day but not on the day when my parents don\u2019t know about it. And\nfrom this day on when the priest came into the class, every morning he said, \u201c go\ninto the corner.\u201d And then I had to stand all, all the whole hour until the hour was over. So this was\nthe discrimination I experienced. Well, then there, of course, the girls or the boys that were not\nCatholic, they could sit in the rear of the class but I didn\u2019t find that this was discrimination.",
        "A: Protestant and Jews. They were, they could sit in the rear of the class and they could read or do\nanything else. I never felt that this was discrimination. [talkover] I, no, not exactly, but I know that\nthree girls I was close with, they were in my class...",
        "A: Three Jewish girls. I was pretty close with, I visited them, they visited me. We played together\nand it was, it was, well a very close relationship. So, of, of course, when the Nazis came, it changed\ndrastically, then. Everything changed and they were resettled. I didn\u2019t have any contact then with\nthe three girls. I was, I did go up because I went then to school in Vienna and I wasn\u2019t in\nAskersdorf and things had changed quite a lot. And then when the Nazis came, I tried to contact\none of the girls but they already, the father was a physician, they already had left but they were not\nresettled. They had left for, I do not remember, America, anything, anywhere.",
        "A: I lived in Vienna all the time but it was a suburb and I went then, I moved then into the city,\nproper, in the first district. When was it? I think in \u201937, \u2019?36 or \u2019?37. I worked there. My father\nwasn\u2019t very happy that I moved there but I, living 1n the suburb as it is here, in order to go from the\nWhite House to Silver Spring or to even Beltsville(ph), 1t takes you an hour and a half because we\ndidn\u2019t have cars at this ttme. You used public transportation and it worked out well. I had a good\njob. I, I liked my job and, and I met my husband.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it had very much effect. My father did anyhow what he wanted to do. He always\ndid. Like almost all men do, right? And, well, Dolfus, he had a party of people and he had many\npeople around him who were thought kind of ridiculous people, die Hamenschwenzler?",
        "A: Yah. They, they ridiculous.",
        "A: Hmmm?",
        "A: They were ridiculous Poland.",
        "A: Yeah, they, they were, they wore hats with a, a cock feather on their hats or they were called\naccording to the cock feather and were made ridiculous, this is about all I know.",
        "A: No, no, no, no. He was not persecuted. Whatever he did, he got away with it. He was, even\nwhen I was arrested when he went, no, no, out.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No. No, no, I did, unfortunately I didn\u2019t have very much political awareness. See I went to\nschool and I worked and it really took up all my time. And my mother was sickish and I also took\ncare of her. So whatever time there was, I didn\u2019t have time for politics. I was interested in it, but I\ncould never take an active part. I took an active part in politics only after Hitler came to Vienna.\nThen I started to become much more aware of what was going on and I, because many of my\nfriends were affected by it. And, and I, I tried to fight it.",
        "A: Oh I worked, first of all I, I went to the Institute, Lehrerbildungsanstalt, I don\u2019t know now...",
        "A: Teacher college.",
        "A: It\u2019s a teacher\u2019s college, okay, and while I, in my free time, I worked in the Jewish kindergarten\nwhich I enjoyed immensely. I, I never knew that I would love children that much but it was a\ndelightful job. I even thought sometime that I would write about the sayings of the children and\ntheir behavior. I never did of course, that was just a dream. And then after I had my degree I\nstarted, I tried to start to work in a public kindergarten but it was absolutely impossible because as I\napplied for the job, the interviewer told me, \u201cWell, I tell you, we do take two people a year. We hire\ntwo people a year. We have hundred and three applications so you figure out how long it will take\nbefore you are being hired.\u201d So my, my aspects of being a being a public kindergarten teacher went\nall the way down. Then I just tried to get all kinds of jobs and it was \u201933, the time when it was very,\nvery hard to get jobs. It was in America the same. There was the big crash on the, on the Borse, on\nthe stock market and in Europe it was the same. Jobs were very scarce. So finally I did get, I\nworked as a secretary in a, in a factory, no, no, in an office that imported wood from Yugoslavia.\nThen I worked for sometimes in an office that imported from Germany, dryers, commercial dryers\nand what else did I do? And then I, one of my father\u2019s acquaintances lost his wife and he needed\nsomebody to take care of his books and help him in his praxis. I took that job and this is when I met\nhim while I was there and I, I stayed in this job until I was arrested.",
        "A: No, no, no, while I was studying. I was working two or three [talkover] three days, yah.",
        "A: Studying to be a teacher in Vienna is quite different. I do not know whether this like that here\nbut I remember that we had to work for three months in an institute for the blind. Three months in\nan institute for the deaf! and three months we worked in an institute or institution for the retarded.\nAnd I remember that this was the hardest part of my studying, so. And whatever I had on free time,\nI worked in the kindergarten, partly as part of my training, partly also because I liked it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I always liked children but I never knew how much you can do to help them grow up and\nto help them to develop their abilities to see the world, to learn how to talk. I remember that I tried\nto teach them English, English songs and one of the first one was pitter patter pit pat, listen to the\nrain. You know that? No, you don\u2019t know an English children\u2019s song?",
        "A: No, it was, pitter patter pit pat, listen to the rain, falling in the garden, running down the pane. A\nbig song and the, another one that we, that I tried to teach them was the teensy weensy spider\n[talkover] you know that, went up the water spout. And those very tiny little things and the kids\nwere just delightful. I remember that once we went out to the park and one of the little boys says,\n\u201cWill you please excuse me but the fire engine has to make pee-pee.\u201d [talkover] So those, all those\nthings made me to get so much closer to the children, to understand them so much more. You learn\na lot from books but you do not learn what you can learn from a personal contact. Their warmth,\ntheir love and later on I often thought how many made it. That was the hard part because I am sure\nthat many of them and their parents perished.",
        "A: Yes, it was, it was run by a Jewish organization but I do not remember anymore by what\norganization.",
        "A: This was arranged from, this, from the college. The college sent people out to this, and to this,\nand to this kindergarten and I happened to get this one. sit, youll fall down. [talkover]",
        "A: No, no, I, I did not. I don\u2019t remember, I didn\u2019t have very many, no Jewish friends and so I had\none or two and I don\u2019t think that they ever questioned anything. It was more, we were young\npeople and it was more, you do what you think is right and I do what I do think is right. I only knew\none young man who was an SS man later. He helped me get somebody out of concentration camp\nso he was in the way, he helped also partly to get Bill\u2019s family safe. Those, this is my only known\nJewish acquaintance Bekarntsdaft, Bekarntentkreis(ph) who had anything to do with my activities.",
        "A: No, because the school I went to was mostly Jewish. So, as I told you we, I had a friend all my\nlife, she only died last year (1995) in California. We visited her often. We supported her financially\nand she died last year. We were very close to the very end, I\u2019m now very close, no, close with her,\nwith her daughter and even the grandchildren send me invitation to their bar-mitzvah, bas-mitzvah\nand so on.",
        "A: A teacher\u2019s college. The Vienna teacher\u2019s college. And like most of the colleges, no I shouldn\u2019t\nsay most. But in all the colleges there was a large percentage of Jewish people and large, and it was\nmore Jewish than anywhere else because Vienna had the large Jewish population.",
        "A: I, I also worked with Jews a lot. It, somehow, I, I can\u2019t tell you how it happened but my feelings\nwere kind of, well, not biased in any way. A person was a person and that\u2019s it. That\u2019s what my\nfather\u2019s teaching was.",
        "A: No, no. I was always just a very ordinary person.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That was a very, very major blow for me first of all because I was worried about Bill. We were\ngoing to be married in March and in March Hitler came in...",
        "A: 1938. And then Hitler came and the euphoria of the people of Vienna when they were lining the\nstreets greeting Hitler and his entourage. It was, it was just unbelievable. Just thinking of it, I\ncringe.",
        "A: I do not know exactly the date but it was sometimes in June, [talkover], \u00b037. And I had a big\nargument with my father, as I told you he wasn\u2019t happy that I moved out of the house and moved\ninto the city proper and I was sitting in the park, crying and there was a very long row, in the park\nthere was a large row of chairs and you know in Vienna, the chairs were chained one to another so\nthat nobody could take one away. And I was sitting there crying and as Bill says, he walked by\nseveral times. And I don\u2019t remember that but he says so. And finally he asked me, \u201cIs this chair\nhere free?\u201d The chair next to me. And I just spit at him something like, \u201cOh you idiot, there are\nhundreds of chairs, leave me alone.\u201d [talkover] So of course he sat next to me and then we talked\nand he started talking and he started telling me and then we found out that I live in Postgasse 11 and\nhe lived in Postgasse.\n[End of side 1 of tape 1]",
        "A: Right and he, we, he accompanied me to the house and then we made a date for a later date and,\nand that\u2019s how it happened.",
        "A: A very brash young man. But he was very likable because, and he was very lively. He told me a\nlot of things that he had done, about his traveling and so on and so forth and I found him interesting.\nAnd then we, we had a date and we wanted to go out. I think I told him, come and, he should come\nand visit me and then I met him in front of the door and I said, \u201cI have friends upstairs. Come and\ncome upstairs,\u201d but he didn\u2019t want to do that.",
        "A: What was the point? So she says, \u201cVisit me.\u201d people there so I said, \u201cNo. Not if\nthere are people there.\u201d",
        "A: So then we, we went out a couple of times together and then we thought well, this is something\nthat will go into something more, more earnest and I wanted, well then he said, told me that he\nwould never marry a Jewish girl, a non Jewish girl and whether I would consider converting. And\nsomehow I felt that converting was absolutely not necessary for me because my feelings were\nanyhow for, against Nazism and for everything that stood in Jewish life. But we broke up anyhow,\nso, because he didn\u2019t want to put any kind of pressure on me and we parted. And then came\nChristmas and he send me a lilac bush, a white lilac bush as a Christmas gift. It\u2019s, in a, it was for\nlong time in the garden of a cousin of mine in, in Vienna. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s still there. He\ndied and so on and a friend of mine when she saw that bush she said, \u201cEh! That means marriage.\u201d\nAnd I told her, \u201c\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, we just broke up.\u201d She was right. So we got the, I, I called him and I\nthanked him and we got in touch again and then the, our, the relationship became much closer and\nwe decided we would marry. I would convert and we would marry. And then Hitler came.",
        "A: I was aware. I was very much aware. And especially my father was aware of it. He was, I\nthink, much more aware because he was politically much more astute than I was. And after we\nwere married, it was very kind of sad affair. My father, his brother, I and he. I think, I don\u2019t\nremember anymore who walked first. We went to the, to the Seitenstadter Temple where Rabbi\n[talkover] Tageslicht had agreed to marry us.",
        "A: I had converted, yeah. But there was no mikvah anymore so the conversion was not complete\nbut it, I was converted as far as Tageslicht went and he, he took into consideration all the\ncircumstances.",
        "A: I, first of all I had to study and I had to tell him a lot about Judaism. I told him my thoughts\nabout Judaism and so on and apparently, whatever we talked and whatever I had learned about, he,\nhe was satisfied when he questioned me. And then, when we got married it was a very short\nceremony and we all, I guess, listened, whether the SS is coming. And after, afterwards, we just all\nleft the way we came, one behind the other and he went home and I, I don\u2019t think I went with you.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I only later came to you.",
        "A: Yah.",
        "A: And, well it was, as I said it was a sad affair instead of a happy one.",
        "A: Was illegal from both points, from the Jewish point of view and from the...",
        "A: Nazi point of view.",
        "A: Nazi point of view. From the Jewish point of view because she had not really fully completed\nthe conversion. She had completed it according to his saying but she had not fulfilled all the\nrequirement. She hadn\u2019t studied enough and there was no mikvah, but Rabbi Tageslicht was a good\nfriend of mine from, I was and he knew her and he felt that she\u2019s a very valuable\nperson as he told me. And he said, \u201cIf she converts, well you cannot wish for better Jewish children\nthan from her.\u201d He was concerned. So he says and from the Nazi point of view it was\na major, very major crime.",
        "A: We both would have been killed if they would have found out so it was, as I said it was a rather\nsad affair.",
        "A: He would have been killed too.",
        "A: And probably he too. But killing for them was a very easy thing so...",
        "A: For years, I dreamt that the SS would come and chase us and I would run with him through the\ndifferent rooms and the different steps up because the old building was, a very old building in\nVienna [talkover]",
        "A: Jewish community.",
        "A: Where you, where you had to go this step and here some step and here a few steps and it would\ngo all around and you could run and run and run and I dreamt again and again and again that we\ntwo, the two of us run. [talkover]",
        "A: The synagogue was in this building. The Jewish synagogue still is in this building.",
        "A: But it\u2019s a new building now. Well, and then, we never lived together. I went to my apartment.\nHe was in his apartment and on the, we married on the 17\" of April. And on the 10 of June he left\nfor, after he had been arrested, and freed, he left for England.",
        "A: I did not feel the conversion had made me more Jewish in thinking and acting than I was before.\nThat\u2019s the answer to your question. After Bill had left, I did collect food for the people who were\nsent to the East and I very often worked for Gildermeister. Do you know who Gildermeister was?\nAnd I do recall one woman and a, her son and until today, I sometimes talk about it that I couldn\u2019t, I\ndo not know whether they got out because I was arrested before I could know whether they did\nreally succeed in getting out. And until today I think of the little boy who was delightful and he had\na charming mother. And I sometimes wonder if I would have said that I adopt that child. Nobody\nknew that I was Jewish. If I would have adopted that child maybe I could have made sure that he\u2019s\nalive.",
        "A: You will never have adopted a Jewish child.",
        "A: At this time...",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been possible, I don\u2019t know. But I feel, for one reason or another I\nalways feel guilty that I let those two down.",
        "A: It started to become more political, not only feelings after I had met Bill. He told me about the\nplight of the people in Poland and he told me about Palestine. And that was, Palestine was\nsomething that was not in my thinking at all. It was too far away. But through him I became aware\nof so many things and I recall the first time when he told me that he had collected some betterim(ph)\nfrom Poland and they would go illegally to Israel and he showed me and introduced me to them. It\nwas always very clandestine. It always had to be very secretly so that I wouldn\u2019t be caught with any\none of them. And then he asked me whether I would consider keeping his, we were not married\nthen, keeping his, the passports of the people. And I remember that I kept all the 16 passports and I\nwas a very, very big secret agent. I put them into a leather chair here in the rear and I thought that\nwould be absolutely safe. But fortunately nobody looked for them and nobody came and asked so it\nwas safe. That was the first time when I really was involved in saving some people\u2019s lives. I, I\nknew about it but I, I only knew intellectually but now I had met the people and it was quite\ndifferent. And from then on as I was aware of his and became more and more aware of his activities\nI, I was, let\u2019s say caught.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I think that I was, I was drawn to him. As I told you before it was his spirit and it was his\nmentality that drew me to him and then when I realized that he was going out, out of his way and\nforgetting about himself and helping other people even to the, to the maybe end that he\u2019s would be\nkilled, it, it formed a bond. And if I think about it now, it might also be that 1t reminded me of my\nfather. I never thought about it, it just occurred to me now. So you are now my therapist. But it, it\nmight be that because my father was always so concerned with the underdog that this was another\nattraction.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t have very many feelings except that he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll get into problems and you, you\ndon\u2019t know what you are heading for.\u201d But he would never say don\u2019t do it or don\u2019t do that, never.\nHe just said, \u201cHe will be working and he will have to work and at times he will have to forget about\nyou and wherever you will be. If you are together, you will be an albatross about his neck and if\nyou are not together, you will have to worry and worry and worry.\u201d And this is how it was.",
        "A: Nobody except my father, his brother and the two of us.",
        "A: Nobody the whole time.",
        "A: So. People did suspect. People did suspect my closeness because I always kept\nalone. I didn\u2019t go out and I didn\u2019t go and see anybody. It was seven years, right? So.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Married.",
        "A: I could have probably gone because I could travel very freely but it, at this time it was for many\nreason not possible. My mother was very sick and I, I just didn\u2019t want to abandon her. And then as\nmy father always pointed out again and again, \u201cYou\u2019ll be an albatross about his neck. Don\u2019t go. He\nwill have so much to do, so much to worry. He has to worry about his safety and the safety of the\npeople whom he tries to, to get into Palestine. If you would go, it would not be a good thing.\u201d I\nrealized that and I didn\u2019t go. And then when Bill was in America he sent an affidavit for my parents\nand for me but the war had broken out and it was not, and my mother had died and very shortly after\nmy mother died, my father died. Fortunately in a way because then when I was arrested I didn\u2019t\nhave to worry about anybody but myself. I knew he was halfway safe. I knew he was in America.",
        "A: Right. And my father and my mother didn\u2019t live anymore so I was on my own.",
        "A: No, I did not know in the beginning but after I saw that they took sick and old people to resettle,\nI am a very gullible person. I hoped against my better knowledge because I went to the resettlement\ncenters with food that I had collected from a very good friend of mine. She had a delicatessen store\nand whatever she could, she gave me. And whatever I could get from other people and food, there\nwere already rations then. But whatever anybody could give, I brought it down to the settlement\nstation. So I believed first that it 1s resettkement but when I saw the misery, the illness and\neverything I knew that, because Hitler at this time had already ordered the, the killing of the\nmentally ill in Vienna. So I knew that this was not resettlement. I mean knew in quotation mark. I,\nI, I felt that 1t was not resettlement.",
        "A: Yes. I was aware of this because I had a friend who was a nurse in the hospital for mental,\nmentally disturbed men but I, and, she had told me that they came in and took the incurable out.",
        "A: Yes. There was also one special institution, Steinhof, the, the Yard of, of Stones, literary\ntranslation. There were only incurable mentally ill and this, within a short time, 1t was completely\nemptied and you knew that. I think all Vienna knew it.",
        "A: I do not know whether a lot of people do it. I do not know whether I was a suspect and I tell you\nI didn\u2019t care. I just went there and I brought it and that was it. There are times when you really\ndon\u2019t, I hope you never will be in a situation like that, when you do not really care what happens to\nyou, you just do what you think you have to do. And this is, I knew I could not help everybody\nthere, that there 1s, but I knew I could give one or the other people hope. That was, that was all I\ncould do. I, I, 1f I would have been able to bring wagons full of food it might have helped one\nsegment of settlement but with my little things that I brought, it, it, 1t was just a little bit of hope and\nmaybe also not only hope but seeing that somebody cares that helped a little bit. That was all.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I knew then because as I told you I had very many Jewish friends and right after the Anschluss\nwhen the SS started rounding up Jews, that was for me, let\u2019s say a very hard awakening. I knew\nabout anti-Semitism and I knew what it meant but I didn\u2019t realize that 1t would go to that extreme.\nThat, for instance, I had many friends, one cut his wrist, died in the bathtub. Another one jumped\noff the window from the fourth floor and another one shot himself. So all this, you can\u2019t help but\nbeing more aware of what\u2019s going on. Then you saw the people in the street, how the SS made old\nJews with long beards wash the sidewalk, how women had to scrub the sidewalk, ahh. It was a\nhorror.",
        "A: Only the one I told you about, that was the only one. I think, wasn\u2019t Mundle(ph) also a member?",
        "A: ,",
        "A: [had a cousin who joined the Nazi Party but I do not know what he did. He was not active. He\njust had, was a member. Some, in some organizations you had to become a member in order to\nkeep your job. Maybe he did that. He was much too complacent a person to be active in anything\nand I know something. I, I just remember something now. We had a Jewish butcher and this\ncousin went to him and told him that if he need some help, whatever he can do, he would do. So.",
        "A: No, I was not acquainted with anybody who was, who was real an anti-Semite. I, if I tried very\nhard to remember, no, no. Some people were saying, oh well, the Jews, the, the women flaunted\ntheir jewels, their jewelry and so on and people got very jealous and, but I don\u2019t think they were\naware that those were anti-Semitic feelings or anti-Semitic statements.",
        "A: Yes, yes. But, but when it then came to looting, I should say it, it\u2019s ugly to say but I feel that the\nAustrians are very, very big opportunists. Every single one of them and when it came to looting\nthen, the Jewish homes and the Jewish stores, they were all for it. All. I had a cousin who\u2019s, once,\nwhen the Nuremburg Laws came out and when the laws came out that you, that non Jews shouldn\u2019t\nbuy at Jewish stores, she said, \u201cHell with them.\u201d And went to her store where she always bought\nand for the whole day she sat in a window, in a display window with a sign in front of her that said,\nthis Jewish, this Christian swine buys in the Jewish store. It rhymes in German. This is,\n. She sat for the whole day there in the window. That\u2019s, many people saw, but many\npeople didn\u2019t have the courage to do it.",
        "A: Well, I knew about it from the beginning. For me it wasn\u2019t anything new and I wasn\u2019t going to\nmarry a Jew anymore. Right? So it really didn\u2019t affect me. But I know, I know for instance an\nacquaintance of mine went to, to the prison where I was also because he had a Jewish girlfriend and\nI, I visited him in the prison not knowing that a short time later I would be in there too. So.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, I, I felt very, in a way I felt euphoric. Now we did it, hell with them. And, and the other\nside I said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s in store for us. But now we are together.\u201d",
        "A: An, an oppressive mood. No, no, no. I felt, for him, for my husband, I was always trying to get\nhim out of the country as quickly as he could because I knew he was in danger. Before we were\nmarried, we once walked very close to where I lived and with a friend of his and three Nazis...",
        "A: That was before the Nazis came to power.",
        "A: Three Nazis came towards us and this Jewish friend of ours had a very heavy Polish accent and\nwhen those three came they mimicked our Jewish friend. They were so tall that Bill had to\npractically jump and hit one into the face. I was paralyzed with fear, what will they do? They\ndidn\u2019t do anything. They just walked on this way and we walked on that way in the opposite\ndirection but I think my heart stopped beating. So I knew that he would do things like that. I knew\nhim and I always tried to push, go, go, go. Until he went. And his going, no, it didn\u2019t take seven\nyears because I came visiting him in Yugoslavia for two days, three days on his birthday the next\nyear. I went on the train. [talkover] Right. In September \u201938 it was?",
        "A: Yah.",
        "A: September, \u201938. His birthday is the 21\u201c of September. So I came down, I think it was a Saturday\nor Sunday and I stayed Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Then I went back to Vienna.",
        "A: Yes. I was aware. [talkover] Yes. I did, in some way even try to help. I do not know whether I\nwas much help but I tried anyhow.",
        "A: With his office. He had the office and I went very often there to, to see what is going on and\nwhat the, the girls, he had a, a number of secretaries what they were doing. \u2018Kay?",
        "A: Yes and if there, when I thought that there was something to be done that could be done that they\ndidn\u2019t think of I told them get in touch with this person, get in touch with this person, and so on and\nso on.\nTape 2",
        "A: Now the first, he came, first of all I had smuggled money out to cousins of his which I gave them\nin, in Fume and then I went to his hotel. I, I think he wasn\u2019t even there and when he returned and he\nfound me he was quite happy. And then we went out and we came into a demonstration that was\nvery, very scary for me. The, the people were shouting Hitler, Duce of, Hitler and, and Mussolini.",
        "A:",
        "A: Yah. And Hitler and the Duce should go down.",
        "A: The Duce.",
        "A: The Duce, the Mussolini, they should go down [talkover] and, and he brought, no pulled me into\na doorway and we there we were standing. I, you cannot imagine the, though the street was filled\nwith people, one next to the other, it was really a horrible feeling. And after the whole thing was\ncalmed down, we went into the hotel and we, we tried to forget what had been and what we had\nbeen through and we just were happy to be together. And then we went out for dinner and it must\nhave been a long dinner because I do not recall how long it took. We took home a carriage.",
        "A: I had been drinking. I, that\u2019s one of the three times I have been high. I wasn\u2019t drunk in my life\nbut I was high and she always tells me how in the carriage I was singing at the top of my voice.",
        "A: Yes, he was really singing at the top of his voice. When we came to the hotel I tried to shush\nhim. And I think I probably succeeded because it was already very late, so, this, this was our\nhoneymoon. And the next day I had to leave.",
        "A: I tell you, I always thought if Willie promised me to get the moon, he will get it. And well, so.",
        "A: At this time I knew that he would not stay in Europe, that he would go to America and he will\nmake it. I, I had so, I can\u2019t talk, can\u2019t talk. There might have been dangerous times, I knew that\nalso but I knew that he would make it. I knew it. As I always told when I came home, when the\nwar was over and I came home from concentration camp, I always told everybody Willie will be\nhere in May. Well he was, he was here on the 22\u2122 of June. So every, every soothsayer can make a,\na three week error, right? That\u2019s it and he was there. So I, I really knew whatever will happen it\nwill end well. And I think he is an eternal optimist, he, anyhow, for him there\u2019s nothing that can be\nbad. Everything will turn out well and it did. So.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Oh sure, sure. I remember that very well. His aunt Liesel whom I loved very much, no Valerie. .",
        "A: Valerie, yah.",
        "A: Valerie called me and said, \u201cCan you help?\u201d And I said, \u201cI, I really don\u2019t know what to, you\ncouldn\u2019t come here because you are two.\u201d She had a friend. And the friend was a very, a person\nwhom you could see because he was very tall, very heavy, very big so you would not be able to\nmiss him, you cannot hide him.",
        "A: He was very Jewish looking.",
        "A: Yeah, you couldn\u2019t hide him. So I told her, \u201cI\u2019Il come to you and we\u2019ll see what we can do.\u201d\nSo, and when I was there, we developed a plan that the best thing would probably be to take a taxi\nand drive around. And this is what we did. The whole night we drove around in the taxi. I sat next\nto the chauffeur and the two of them sat in the rear. And, we were driving and we saw everything\nand the guy, we told the guy just drive here and there and we drove into neighborhoods where we\nknew that there were very few Jews so that it wasn\u2019t too obviously. But the guy was very good a\ndriver. He drove us and drove us and in the morning when it, when the sky got gray he drove us\nback to the house and the two were safe. By the way, her two sons were saved too. They had come\nwith the first transport to Israel.",
        "A: Too risky for . Risky for a few days before the so-called Kristallnacht which is a\nmisnomer, the Germans give it the name Kristallnacht because the crystal, the broken crystals cover\nthe streets and this is a, . Kristallnacht makes, takes away of the horror.\nKristallnacht is the night of the national German pogrom. That\u2019s how I call it. And you, I think you\nshould, she should tell you of some of the things which she saw during .",
        "A: No, no. This doesn\u2019t help, I\u2019m sure you have heard this a hundred times. How the mob went\nand broke into houses, into, into stores, how they carried as I told you when it came to plundering,\nthey were all not anti-Semitic but they were on the bandwagon. They carried furniture and\neverything around and they, it, 1t was, it was horrible. You saw the flames leaping up. No, I can\u2019t\ntalk about it, really.",
        "A: I, I do not remember that. I don\u2019t remember any more. This is, I told you that I\u2019m very good in\nrepressing and this is one of the things that I have completely blocked out. Even you as a\npsychiatrist or, or a pseudo-psychologist wouldn\u2019t be able to get it out.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: That, that\u2019s very odd. I remember that I wanted to go swimming and a cousin of mine came and,\nand she said, she shouted at the window, \u201cWar has broken out!\u201d So we, I\u2019m not going swimming.\nThat, that was the side of the war breaking out. No, but I knew and I hoped it would\nbe the end. But of course I hoped wrongly. I hoped that with the break, the breaking out of the war,\nthat America would get into the war right away and it would be an end. And then the Russians\ncame and the Russians said now Germany, kaput, then America, kaput. That was their motto. So.",
        "A: I was working and I was arrested at the place that I told you that imported from Germany dryers,\nfrom there I was arrested. I worked there as a secretary and the guy was a very good Nazi and I\nremember that there was a, a lady working there. She had one son and that one son was killed in the\nwar. And I remember that she put an ad into the newspaper, was proud, so I announce the dead of\nmy son. Those were the people I worked with but it didn\u2019t affect me in any way. I was Miss Rollig\nand that was it. And when I was arrested I know that he night away ran to the Gestapo to find out\nwhat I had done. I had never heard from him again, of course not.",
        "A: Well, you know that we could not listen to foreign radios. Foreign radios, there were trucks\ngoing up and down the streets which checked who is listening to foreign broadcasts. We did it\nanyhow but the broadcasts were scarce and they really did, at least for me, they did not tell me too\nmuch. I knew that when the Germans went in that there would be massacres. I knew that. But I\nknew only through my feeling, I didn\u2019t really, it was not certified.",
        "A: ,",
        "A: And no it wasn\u2019t also information it was just my feeling that they would do horrible things.\nThen I, I was arrested. My arrest came about, I had a very good friend and she came to me and she\ntold me, she had married one of the richest men in Vienna. His name was Tappish Rockshine(ph).\nShine was his name and the Rock because he had the largest Oriental rock stores in Vienna. And\nshe married him in the hope that with his money, they might come to America. Well one day she\ncame to me and she told me, \u201cWe have received notice that we have to go to the resettlement point.\u201d\nAnd the resettlement point was there, there and she said, \u201cI know he will go, I won\u2019t go. Can you\nhelp me?\u201d Said, \u201cSure, stay here.\u201d So she stayed with me and my father had just died and I, I was\nvery down and I wanted to go on vacation and I went to relatives in Silesia to, for two weeks to\nrecuperate. And in order to not make it obvious that, that she is alone in the apartment, I ask a\ncousin of mine to stay in the apartment with her. So when light is on, the water is running, that\npeople do not say hey, who\u2019s there, this apartment isn\u2019t empty, she isn\u2019t there. And while I was\ngone, she did something very stupid. She went to her lawyer. And when she came to her lawyer,\nthe Gestapo was there because he had a Jewish wife. So when she came, they said, \u201cEh, come on\nin,\u2019 and so on. And I do not know what they did to her but she told them that she had been hiding\nand the Gestapo came from my cousin and, and told, and she told him then the Gestapo that I am\naway and when I will be back. And when I came back, she told me, \u201cYou have visitors.\u201d So I\nthought that maybe that SS man of whom I told you that he was so nice, that he had sent them. But\nthey, he hadn\u2019t sent them. They just interviewed me and they took me to the Gestapo headquarter\nand there they were telling me all kinds of things and threatening me, me with all kinds of things\nand telling me what a threat I am to the, to the German spirit with my doing what I am doing. And\nthen they let me go again. [talkover] Don\u2019t, don\u2019t, yah, I said to them, \u201cListen I, I have, I didn\u2019t\nknow that she was Jewish. I have been friend with her for a long time and she came that she had a\nfight with her husband and she wanted to stay away from him for a while.\u201d So the, I don\u2019t whether\nthey believed it but they let me go. But don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it again. And then, I went home and I\nstayed at home for some time when I got the letter from this friend, Valerie, that she is in, in a very\nbad situation. She needs food and she needs clothes. Would I please send it to her. Of course I\nmade the package and I send it to her. And this is when the Gestapo came and arrested me.",
        "A: To Poland. To some place in Poland, I do not recall anymore to where at, but 1t was the end, I\nnever heard from her again, and, and I was brought to the Gestapo and from the Gestapo I was\nbrought to Rossaeur Lande(ph), that was the prison where I told you before that I visited a friend of\nours who had an affair with a Jewish girl who was there imprisoned. This is where I went first.",
        "A: No, because I helped Jews. Oh I can show you...",
        "A: The arrest...",
        "A: The arrest report. I, I can get it. I have an arrest report that says that I was arrested for behavior\nthat\u2019s not worth a, a Gentile woman and that I do sacrifice the, the, the, for the person it would be\nhealth, I do not know what [talkover] it is. Endangered the, the security of the German people. So\nthat, that was my arrest report. I think he\u2019s going to find it. And I was for three weeks in Vienna at\nthe Rossauer Lande Prison and then I was brought to Ravensbriick. The trip to Ravensbruck lasted\nweeks because they, we were in a train and they used the train for troop movement so whenever we\nwere somewhere in the way, they put us aside so that the, the troops can move. We, I was in a little\ncell that was meant for two people. We were five in there. Three had to stand, two could sit. And\nit would always change.",
        "A: No, that was in the, in the train that was used for transporting prisoners. And then we stopped at\nevery little place where they had prisons that they could putted us in. We stopped I know in\nSanpurltin(ph) and then in, there was one prison that had just been built that was a very clean one.\nWe were very happy to be there even if we were in a one-man cell, five or six people. It was clean.\nWe also stopped at the Pankrus(ph) that\u2019s the big prison in Prague. That was a horrible experience.\nWe had to stand there with our back to the wall and our hands stretch out that, try to do that for an\nhour. And try to do that for five and six hours and you will see how hard it is. Then finally when I\ngot into a cell, there were Yugoslav partisans in, there was such a stench, you cannot imagine. It\nwas a stench of, of, of flesh being, being eaten up by illness. And those partisans had been beaten\nbadly on the soles of their feet and on their backs. Their backs were raw. There was no bandage,\nno nothing. I remember that I tore up chemise...",
        "A: Cloth?",
        "A: A rag, a cloth.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No, an undershirt [talkover]. And I tore it up to strips in order to help one of the women to cover\nher back. There was no salve, no medicine, no nothing and the groaning and the moaning I have\nstill in my ears. From there we went then on Wieherachen, there was another big place and some\nother prisons which I do not remember into Berlin. Berlin Alexanderplatz. This was the, the big\nprison in, in Berlin. While we were there, bombs were falling. Bedbugs were one of the first\nthings. You could hear them when they came down and fell on you. And the stench, unbelievable.\nAnd while we were there, the bombs were falling and people were praying. Some were crying and I\nalways told them, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we'll get out of this.\u2019 We did get out of it. We came to\nRavensbruck and until today, I do not know how we get from Berlin to Ravensbruck. I know we\ngot there because I was there but I couldn\u2019t tell you how. I only know when we arrived in\nRavensbruck we were had to stand in formation, two holes deep. And all the time in the prison and\non the trip from the prison to Ravensbruck I, I always had the feeling it\u2019s not I that\u2019s happening to,\nsomebody else, and I was outside just watching what was happening. When we came to\nRavensbruck I learned, I had to wake up. While we were standing there, there were two witnesses\nof Jehovah coming and they had a big basket in between them. They were walking on the street the\nso-called Lagerstrasse and a big truck was coming. And the truck would, was going so close that\nthe mirror that a side mirror that he had, hit one of the women. The women fell and the rear wheel\nwent over her. All the people who were standing there in formation searched for what. But the\noverseers right away did sick the dogs at us. And this was the moment when I awoke and knew, I\ncan\u2019t dream anymore. That\u2019s I, that\u2019s not somebody else. So sometimes I think that that woman\ndied so that I can live, okay. Now while I was in Vienna there was a girl there who\ntold, who had come in from Ravensbruck for an interview of, at the Gestapo. And she had told me\nwhen you come to Ravensbruck I\u2019m sure that\u2019s where you\u2019re going, ask for so and so. She will be\nable to help you. She is a very tiny dark-haired girl and she has, she is in the, in the receiving line\nfor all the people who come in. And she\u2019ll help you. And this is what I did and the girl told me,\n\u201cTl come visit you in the block in the evening,\u201d and this is, this is what she did. I stayed at the\nreceiving block who was run by a Viennese prostitute. Everybody went into this block first. And\nwe stayed there, we, there were the bunks. And every bunk was supposed to hold one person.\nThere, in every bunk were at least three. Two this way and one this way. And in the morning when\nI woke up I noticed that my cloths were missing and I couldn\u2019t go for to a in clothes\nwithout shoes so I, I called and the block, the Blockalteste, the leader, this prostitute she came and\nshe said to me, \u201cYou are Viennese?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d She said, \u201cWait.\u201d And a few moments later she\ncame with other, with other clothes, not with my own so I was saved for the moment. And for the\nwhile, I think for about three or four days we stayed in this block which was horrible because there\nwas really everybody in there. And then we were separated and I went into block number one, the\nolder, not old but some political prisoners were. Rosel Jochman who became a member of\nParliament in Austria after the war, she was there. Helena Popptetts(ph) who became also some\nkind of big wig in the Austrian government after the war, she was there. And I was there and oh I\ndidn\u2019t tell you one story. When I came in Vienna into the prison, I had to wait out in the hallway for\nthe little while and for, for the few hours, a little while. And then a door was opened and I was\npushed into a room. The room was, you couldn\u2019t make out anything, it was so full of steam, of\nsmell. Everything was kind of hazy and out of this haze somebody came towards me and said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry, it isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d And this was a former teacher of mine. Muti Tiechman was her name.\nShe also had helped Jews and this was, was, was the reason why she was arrested. And when I\ncame to Ravensbruck, she already was in Ravensbruck, also into, also in this number one block.\nAnd there we, we kept up very much contact. I was her former pupil, she was my former teacher\nand somehow a bond was formed. After the war, she adopted Saul whom you met now as her\ngrandson. And she came to visit us in America twice. When we went to Europe we always visited\nher. Then she died. Now. The number one block, is that all? No.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no, no. There were some Viennese but there were of course a number of Germans. The\nGermans, the young German girls mostly were arrested for distributing Communist pamphlets into\nthe population or printing them or they were Communists. They were the real Communists. And\none person was there\n[End of side 1 of tape 2]",
        "A: No, first of all, I do not remember our arrival. I just know that we went then into a building. We\nwent through a line where this young lady was I told you about who was supposed to help me and I\ntalked to her and they took all our belongings away and then we went on and we came into a room\nwhere we had to undress and where we got Lager clothes. And, and then we were again assembled\nand then we went out and went to this block to, no, in the beginning we all went to the block that\nwas the receiving block where everyone of us had to go. In our group that arrived there were\nFrench nuns, Polish youngsters from, the SS had closed up or emptied the whole, the Lyzeum. I\nthink you can say Lyzeum in English too. Lycee? No, I don\u2019t know. And they were all there and\nall, the baby\u2019s crying, and all of them were of course stand frightened, bewildered. That was all that\nyou could be. Then you were thrown into this mass of people in the, in the receiving block where\neverybody was there. From criminals to political prisoners. They all were and all, the women were\nall unwashed, dirty. The clothes that we received was not the cleanest either and, and it was\nmiserable.",
        "A: Witnesses.",
        "A: Oh, they had, everyone in the camp had a different, the triangle on the sleeve and the purple\ntriangle was the Witnesses of Jehovah. And those two women had those triangles.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. I only learned later what they were. I recognized the, the triangle and the color of it\nbut I did not know. Maybe somebody told me also. I couldn\u2019t tell you.",
        "A: Sure. Right when you entered you were given a number and you were supposed to sew the\nnumber on your sleeve. I had some 80,000 and some, 18 thousand and something, I do not know\nhow much it was. I don\u2019t remember anymore. I just know the 18 thousand. My baby\u2019s asleep.",
        "A: Red. Red. All the political prisoners had red badges. The so-called, the Jews had yellow,\nyellow triangles and the people who were, they were the, some of them had black triangles, those\nwere like the, our block and the, and the receiving block the one who was a prostitute or also the, I, I\nthink that\u2019s all.",
        "A: Sure. Sure. Sure, we would not have associated with criminals, right? The criminals also had\nblack and I think that the political prisoners did keep a lot together. By the way, in the same block\nthat I was was also Jan McGlock(ph). Jan McGlock(ph) was the sister of LaGuardia the mayor of\nNew York. When the camp was liberated, Eisenhower wanted to bring her over on a special quota\nbut of course LaGuardia was very much against it. He wanted her to come the regular way. She\nwas there with her daughter and her grandson. For a long time they had been in the bunker because\nthe SS didn\u2019t want them to be in, in the population, in the camp population, but finally all three of\nthem were released.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right, right. And I think that amount of Germans, there were also people who became\nprominent later. But I, as they were not Austrians and not from Vienna, I didn\u2019t keep track of them.\nBut the people in our block were really special, altogether special people, not that I claim to be a\nspecial people but the others were, most of them were.",
        "A: When, after she came...",
        "A: Yah, after she came out of the bunker and came into our block, she of course told us. And you\nknow that she was the one we practiced English with? If there was a word, I remember she brought\nme a book that I should read, the first book in English in the camp was Men Against Death. Do you\nknow? I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t. It\u2019s about Sammelvise(ph), the guy who found out in Hungary that so\nmany women died, died in childbirth because the doctors didn\u2019t wash hands. That was the first, she,\nand there were of course words that I didn\u2019t understand in spite of the fact that my English was, let\u2019s\nsay, pretty good for European school English. But there were certain words that I didn\u2019t get and\nthen she would be the one who, to tell me what it means. So, I did something for my\neducation in Ravensbruck.",
        "A: Separate.",
        "A: No, no. Harsh treatment was really for everybody the same. It was just the kind of work that\nyou could get that would remove some of the harshness of the life. See for instance, I worked in the\nlibrary and I worked in the book binding. For me, life as such wasn\u2019t that harsh because I didn\u2019t\nhave to go out in the morning and pull the...",
        "A: Steamroller.",
        "A: The steamroller. Women used to every day go out and pull the steamroller and I had, later on I\nmade a friend whom I got away from there because somehow prisoners did have some influence on\nwhat could happen to prisoners and I got her away. Her name was Annemarie Thiele. She came\nthen to America as a cousin of ours. We sent her an affidavit.",
        "A: She was not Jewish.",
        "A: But she was in camp because she had an affair with a Jewish man. And she wore the black and\nyellow star, so. We sent her then an affidavit to come to America. She was a cousin of mine.",
        "A: Yes, but, but I do not want to talk about it. It\u2019s, it\u2019s too, too, it\u2019s too harmful for me and it\nwouldn\u2019t do any, and it wouldn\u2019t do anything. I have here still a big dent where a SS woman kicked\nme. I have this where an SS woman slashed against me and when I made like that, she stabbed my\nhand and you see the finger?",
        "A: Yes, she was angry at me because I wasn\u2019t fast enough with something or I didn\u2019t understand\nwhat she meant, so she grabbed a scalpel and she went like that to me and I made of course like that\nand, did you see it? So, I knew that there were experiments going on because when you went on the\nstreet that ran between the barracks, the two rows of barracks, you could hear the moaning and the\ngroaning. And, so you knew what, what happening. Some...",
        "A: Yes. Medical experiments and some of the prisoners, some, there was one block where they kept\nthe prisoners who had gone over the edge. And it was really terrible. It was so bad that after I had\nmy first son, in, within a very short time, he, he found out if he cried in a certain way, he could have\nanything he wanted, because it did remind me so much of Ravensbruck that I just wanted him to be\nquiet and not cry. In this way, he found out very early. Children do.",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t drive through the tunnel in New York.",
        "A: Oh yeah, a long, late, when I was in New York, for a long time when we went through the\nLincoln Tunnel, I felt sick. I felt like throwing up, die, I always told him, \u201cPlease, let\u2019s not,\u201d told\nmy husband, \u201cPlease, let\u2019s not go through the tunnel anymore.\u201d And then we talked and we talked,\nand after all he\u2019s a psychologist. And one day he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go and look what\u2019s what.\u201d And it was\na very slow traffic and I really looked and you know what\u2019s really amazing, at the bottom end,\npardon me, and at the top of the tunnel of the tiles, were black stripes. I do not remember now\nanymore whether they were double stripes or single stripes. I knew that was in the shower room in\nRavensbruck. From then I could go through the tunnel without any problem. We had found out\nwhat caused the problem. So. When I already was in America I could for instance, not eat steak.\nThe smell of seared flesh just made me sick. Courtesy of Ravensbruck.",
        "A: My first work detail was in the SS library. Working with the SS like for instance in the library,\nin the book binding and so on, we, we, were mostly political prisoners and we had all\none advantage. We could take a shower once a week because the SS was afraid that they might get\nlice too 1f we get lice, right? So they, they tried to keep us clean. And I remember that the shower\nwas something that was very, very important for us, because it separated you more or less from the\ndirtiness of the camp. Because the camp was not paved. Everything was dust. And then you were\nstanding for hours and hours at attention whether it was cold or hot. It didn\u2019t do very much to your\nimage.",
        "A: Roll call in the morning.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Very early in the morning. We got up, I don\u2019t remember the time anymore but it was very early.\nIt was either five, four or five o\u2019clock. And we had about so and so many minutes to get ready and\nhave our breakfast, then we had to stand at attention, at the apell(ph) as it was called. And then we\nwere standing there as long as the SS did feel it was good for us. And then a bell rang and we could\ngo to work.",
        "A: Sure it was cold. We didn\u2019t have any clothes. We had very thin prisoner\u2019s clothes. And you\ndidn\u2019t have, you hardly had any underwear. Later on when I was a little bit familiar with the camp,\nI went to some of the Witnesses of Jehovah who were in charge of all the clothing that had come in\nand they stole for me for my bundle, underwear so that I could have underwear. You, you had some\nvery flimsy stuff. You, you must know from, from the museum and so on, you know how thin the\nclothes was that you had and sometimes when it got very cold, we got a jacket which didn\u2019t very\nmuch against the cold either. And up there it can get very cold. The wind is extremely cold and if\nsomebody, for instance, out of fatigue or not feeling well, if somebody fainted, that was fatal\nbecause he was just trampled, or she was just trampled to death. Not that somebody picked her up\nand brought her to the doctor, to the hospital, she was just trampled to death. That\u2019s if somebody\nfelt sick, we always tried to lean one against the other to hold her up. Sometimes it failed.",
        "A: Pretty good until one day I had a, a very odd episode. I reached for something and when I\nreached I, I collapsed. I got all blue and I don\u2019t know, until today I don\u2019t know why. I just\ncollapsed and they brought me then to the so-called Revier. Revier is infirmary. And there the,\nthere was a Czech heart specialist, a prisoner and she looked at me and she said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s the camp.\u201d\nAnd I remember, I thought, I thought it\u2019s my heart because I\u2019m all blue so they didn\u2019t have any\nmedicine. I just was lying there for some time and she ordered some rest. I went to the hospital and\nI stayed in the hospital a few days and then I went out again. That was all. So. And with this here I\ngot bandaged and they couldn\u2019t do anything because they didn\u2019t have suture material.",
        "A: Yeah, so it just grew the way it is and when I came to America, the friend of ours said, \u201cHave it\ndone, you can have this all fixed.\u201d But then I had a baby, I had a new life, a new, a new house and\nreally a new husband because we hadn\u2019t lived together for too long a time. I didn\u2019t want to be in a\ncast for six months. This is what, no, six weeks. That\u2019s what they said. I didn\u2019t want it. So I still,\nuntil now, I don\u2019t play piano, I don\u2019t play guitar anymore, so...",
        "A: You can\u2019t type.",
        "A: I cannot type because I hit another type. Now it comes in handy because I don\u2019t have to work\nthe computer. So, see? There\u2019s always some silver lining, even if you don\u2019t know tt.",
        "A: Of, I believe from seven \u2018til twelve but this, I\u2019m not absolutely sure. Billy, you\u2019re banging.",
        "A: From, twelve noon. And then we had an hour for lunch and then again of, until five, until six. I,\nI really don\u2019t remember. But in the evening we could sit together after dinner, when after work we\nhad dinner, the food was brought in very, very big...",
        "A: Pockets(ph).",
        "A: No, kettles, a kettle with handles on the side. They were almost as big as we and they carried it, I\nremember that we sometimes four, two on each side tried to hold onto the handle and drag it. And\nevery block got one of those things and this is the way we were being fed. In the morning we got\nsomething that was called coffee. It was some kind of a brown water and a piece of bread. And at\nlunch we got some soup. It was again water with a little bit of something swimming in it. And in\nthe evening sometimes it was rice with milk, also very watery. Well, when I came out, I had, I\nweighed 90 pounds. So you know I weigh now 127. So I, I looked like that.",
        "A: Oh yes. Yes. I was very, very fortunate. I tell you all my life long I was always fortunate.\nWhen I came to camp I had the, the name of a woman who helped me to get into a good block.\nWhen I was in camp such, I had the support of Muti Teichman and the support of Rosel Jochman\nand Helen and so on. And I had really a lot of support and from the outside as I had sent packages\nto other people, now other people send packages to me. It wasn\u2019t much, because there was\nrationing going on but it was always a big joy. For everybody around. Even if you got only a bite,\nit was already, well I mean it was life.",
        "A: Of course, of course. So would other people. The only people who did not share anything were\nthe Polish girls. They didn\u2019t give.",
        "A: Jewish people were gentle.",
        "A: This I don\u2019t know. But the Polish girl, Poland still had a lot of food and they really got food but\nthey rather let 1t spoil than share it with somebody who was not Polish. This is something I, until\ntoday, I do not understand. We worked with one Polish girl, she worked with me in the library and I\ncould never understand how they could do this.",
        "A: Just play in library and work, I, I gave books out, I note, marked it and I got the books returned\nand if books were late I sent out a reminder, that was all. Was not a very hard job. And in the, in\nthe, in book binding, it was interesting, I really learned book binding. So if you have a book to bind,\ndon\u2019t bring it to me.",
        "A: The SS people. That was the SS library.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I didn\u2019t read a single one. I would assume, and just an assumption that this\nwere all political books. They wouldn\u2019t have novels or anything of that kind. My assumption. So.",
        "A: No, no, we did not, the prisoners did not have a library. So there, this would have been too much\nof a privilege.",
        "A: Yes, yes. One of them was this one Polish girl. She was very beautiful, a blonde, a little bit\ndumpy, Jewish girl and she stayed dumpy because she got a lot of food from the outside. I do not\nremember anybody else. I think Helena Pottetts(ph) came sometime, as kind of an overseer,\nchecking whether everything is okay. But not for us, for them. \u2018Kay?",
        "A: Sure, sure. Book binding was together a, it was a separate job and the overseer of book binding\nwas also a Fursorgerin and he help out.",
        "A:",
        "A: She was leading the social work program of the camp. That was all in one and she was a\nmiserable, miserable thing. Very tiny, very dried up with the, pardon me, with the hair around in,\nin, braids around her head, on the top of her head. And she told us that she was in love with a\nJewish man and he jilted her and she\u2019s very happy that she didn\u2019t marry him. So you know what\nkind of a person she was. She wrote, if people inquired how prisoners are, is, how is so and so and\nhow is so and so. I remember answering one letter for her. I sometimes did typing there and I\nanswered one letter, writing to the parents of a girl who was there. She is okay, she\u2019s very busy and\nshe\u2019s too lazy to write, but Pll make her write. That\u2019s what I typed. The, that girl was dying of TB,\nSO.",
        "A: After I had sent the letter I wanted to tell her your parents inquired. In fact I went to her, she was\ndying. But, she was a very young kid, maybe 18 maybe 19. So.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I had a, I had a telegram going through Red Cross. And one day I had a, a call that I\nhave to come to the Kommandant to his office and when I came, he asked me, \u201cWho is Mr.\nLindpeutner?\u201d\u2019 And I said, \u201cMr. Lindpeutner is a cousin of mine.\u201d \u201cHow come you have contact\nwith America?\u201d \u201cWell, he\u2019s in love with me and he wants to marry me.\u201d That\u2019s what the telegram\nsaid. So he said, \u201cOh, and is he a Jew?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, how can Lindpeutner be a Jew? Right?\u201d So he\nlet me go and I knew that Willie knew where I was because the, I\u2019m sure the Red Cross did tell him.\nI had occasionally a letter from a friend of mine and that was about it. I could write once, I think\nonce a month, I do not remember.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: There was one couple that, whose daughter I had tutored to get through school and they were\nalways very fond of me and while I was in Vienna in prison still, they said they would help. And he\nwent with the Postal Service to Romania and to Hungary and so on. And he got at those other\ncountries, food. That was really all that counted. And they were one, that was one couple that send\nme food. Then I had another friend, her husband was a painter and they were absolutely apolitical.\nI, if I ever saw a person as apolitical as those two were, they were very much concerned with\nholistic medicine and, and, and all kinds of things...",
        "A: psychology.",
        "A: And not, they were not interested in life per say. So they also, she was a very lively person and\nshe also, she went to this friend of mine who used to give me food for the transports. She went to\nher and she got there food for me. So that\u2019s how I, those were the two people who send packages.",
        "A: Yeah, sure, because you see when you are able to change your clothes, lice don\u2019t grow and if\nyou're not too, in too close contacts, I mean a louse doesn\u2019t grow on your body, you have to get\none from somebody else, right?",
        "A: Right, right. We were very, as I told you I was, through all that tragedy, I was always very\nfortunate. For instance, when I was released, why was I released? I had an uncle who worked in the\nForeign Ministry and he was what you see in there, the grouch. The picture. That, that was he,\npardon me. He was one, he never became a Party member, never. Being in the Foreign Ministry\nand not being a Party member, they were all scared of him because whatever it was, he found a hair\nin every soup. And when he heard that I was arrested, he went to the Gestapo and he bothered the\nGestapo day in, day out, saying, \u201cI will...\u201d",
        "A: I\u2019m lying comfortably ,",
        "A: \u201cT will, I will take her into my house and I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t do anything anymore against the\ngovernment.\u201d I was called and I was told that he will vouch for me but I should live in his house. I\nwas very stupid and very stubborn because I didn\u2019t like him. I said, \u201cWhy should I go to him? I\nhave my own apartment, right?\u201d Well I was released anyhow, much earlier than was expected.\nAnd after I came home, I didn\u2019t even find the heart to tell him thank you. Because I really thought\nthat not he but his son-in-law who happened to be an SS man that he was the one who got me out. I\ndo not, I do not recall anymore how my release went. I know that I was called in the morning\nEnd of Tape 2.\nTape 3",
        "A: I told you when I was released how it went but I still remember I got kind of a ticket for the train.\nI got a few marks and I got the bundle that I had brought to the camp. And then I do not know how\nI went to the train, how I got to the train. In any case, before I left one of the girls whispered to me,\n\u201cIf you are stuck in Berlin, call this and this number. They will help you.\u201d So when I came to\nBerlin, it was nighttime and there was no place for me to go and I didn\u2019t know really what to do. I\nwas at the station, there was no train the same night anymore. An air raid was on. I went to the\nshelter and when I sought my release from camp they said for people like you we don\u2019t have a space\nin the shelter. [talkover]",
        "A: an 1.d.",
        "A: Right. When I stood and while the bombs were falling around the station I stood in kind of\nhoping that nothing will happen. But all the time I was sure nothing will happen. I\nhadn\u2019t lived through camp and through all of this and now I should be killed by a Allied bomb, no.\nThat was just simply impossible for me. And then I went to a telephone and I called the number\nthat the girl had told me and the people told me, \u201cGo and this and this railroad and we\u2019ll pick you\nup.\u201d And they really did. And I stayed there overnight and I had the first meal. That was another\nthing that could have landed me night back again, nght? I did it anyhow. So next day I went to the\nstation and I got the train and of course the trains were constantly checked by SS and when an SS\nman came and saw my release from Ravensbruck he just looked at me and disgustedly gave it back\nto me. Fine with me. And then I arrived in Vienna. I do not remember anymore the how and when\nand what. I just went to my apartment and there lo and behold in my apartment was an aunt and a\ncousin of mine because they had been bumped out and they had moved into my apartment with all\ntheir furniture. So, the, everything was just stuck full and the second floor, two rooms were filled\nwith furniture from top to bottom. Now, if I wanted one thing or I did not want one thing to live\nwith women after I had been forced to live with so many women for so long a time. So I moved up\ninto the furniture. Into the furniture rooms and left them down there.",
        "A: About a year and a half, about, so.",
        "A: Yeah, sure, because you never know. You really never knew what will happen. It was the\nsecond time within a short time. The first time when his telegram came...",
        "A: What was in the telegram, I don\u2019t remember the telegram?",
        "A: Just longing to be united in marriage with you. That was it. Hans Lindpeutner",
        "A: Yes, yes, because we had correspondent. We did write to one another via the friend in\nSwitzerland. He wrote to him, the friend put the letter into an envelope, send it to me and I did the\nsame. So I knew, I knew who Hans Lindpeutner was.",
        "A:",
        "A: I remember.",
        "A: Stable, pretty stable. There were occasionally one or two new ones came 1n but usually it was, I\ncan say only while I was there because after I was gone, I heard Rudy\u2019s mother...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: She, people were sent out into ammunition factories to work and so on and they were mostly\nkilled. But those were also people from block one.",
        "A: I tell you one thing, after I came home, I was euphoric. Then when the bombs fell all around, I\nhoped one would hit. Then later on, I would question, why am I alive? Why are all the others\ndead? Why? And it was very hard, so, the future, I knew really would come. I always told my, as I\ntold you before, always told my aunt, he\u2019ll be here in May and she would say, \u201cHa!\u201d When May\nwas over, she said, \u201cHe still didn\u2019t come.\u201d [talkover]",
        "A: When I came to pick her up she was all packed. packed, ready to leave.",
        "A: There wasn\u2019t very much to be packed because while I was gone and the Russians came near, my,\nthe cousin who had moved into the house, she had taken all the clothes that was mine. She had put\nit into suitcases and send it to, into the Burgenland [talkover] It\u2019s a province of Austria. And to, to\na, a farm, a wine growers farm that was, that belonged to the people whose daughter I tutored and\nwho sent packages. She sent all the suitcases there, hoping that when I come back that I have\nsomething left. Well what happened was, the Russians came via this village, they opened the\nsuitcases and everything that was wearable they took out and the evening gowns and the afternoon\ngowns, this way, I still have one afternoon gown.",
        "A: I remember that you had your trunk ready.",
        "A: Yes, but the trunk was ready with, with bedding and with linen [talkover] and so on. And I, I\nstill have [talkover] comforters, comforters. So? I still have comforters from Vienna. You won\u2019t\nbelieve it? It 1s so.",
        "A: He was a miserable . He was just a miserable person.",
        "A: He\u2019s very stubborn. you wouldn\u2019t expect it. He\u2019s very stubborn. and\nthat\u2019s it. And nothing will change.",
        "A: No, he was, he was just miserable. I, listen, my aunt loved a dog. He knew that she loved the\ndog so he killed the dog. Is that miserable? I, I just, I just did, there are very few people whom I do\nnot like but I disliked him with a passion.",
        "A: When I asked her once why she did it, she told me, \u201cIn everything, I went in the\nconcentration camp, I tried to keep my dignity. It would have been undignified if I agree to stay\nwith this man.\u201d",
        "A: I really disliked him so utterly, I would have given up everything I stood for, so.",
        "A: They let me go anyhow.",
        "A: No. Because I was lucky. I told you, I was in all my life always very lucky, very fortunate. The\nhouse where I lived 56 bombs fell, all around. The last bomb hit across the street and destroyed the\nhouse here. All the windows were blown out...",
        "A: Of your house, where you lived.",
        "A: Yeah, the roof was gone but a flowerpot stood on the window intact. No? Isn\u2019t that a good sign?\nAnd then Willie came. Yeah, I started as, as I told you before I love children and everything was\ndisorganized, the Russians came closer and there were no schools or nothing so I collected all the\nchildren in the neighborhood and went to a place that used to be before, the kindergarten. And I, I\ntaught them and I spoke to them and we played. I had them there. And one day I got a phone call\nthat a, the, the wife of a friend of his called. Her father had died and I should provide a casket else\nhe would go into a mass grave. People always came to me if they needed something. So I, I knew a\ncarpenter so I went to the carpenter but not right away. I went down the hill in order to go the\ncarpenter. When I went down the hill I saw a jeep passing me, a jeep held in front of the house.\nAnd a man got out and I said, \u201cThose damned Russians,\u201d only Russians were in Vienna at that time.\nAnd Muti Teichman\u2019s son said, \u201cUh-uh, those are a British or Americans, Lore, those are not\nRussians [talkover].\u201d I said, \u201cBritish or Americans, that\u2019s Willie.\u201d And I started running. It was\nWillie, see.",
        "A: You were , how we met in the operation action in detail,\nhow I got her out. I still have this passport, provided for the Russian who let me\nin.",
        "A: And then you know, yeah?",
        "A: Well, there are certain things, you cannot say I will do this. You see there are children on the\nstreet, there you see that the children are scared. You see that the children need some kind of\ndirection that there is nobody here so you just say come, come with me and we will play together. It\nworked. Somehow I was also able always to get a piece of candy or a cookie or something. It\nhelped.",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. I remember that the cousin who lived in my apartment did give all my\nrecords, I had a record collection, to an SS man and she got a big shopping bag full of sugar. That\nwas one way. So you bought it. I went with Muti Teichman into the countryside to get some flour\nand some butter or whatever it was. We bartered clothes, whatever we had and survive.",
        "A: And you went to this, to the SS ,",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no. That was not SS. The, there was, I don\u2019t know, we should turn it off. You\nask me what we lived from. Very, very frugal but one day when, after the SS had left and the\nRussians came close, we went to the pig farm and everybody was there, trying to get a pig and\neverybody who never had slaughtered a pig slaughtered the pigs. So a, this neighbor of ours who\nsend me packages to, to the camp, he also had gone up there and he brought home a pig and he\nslaughtered it. And of, from the meat and the fat that we got from that pig, we lived a long time.\nBesides this, there were bread that was rationed. Every now and then, you could get, 1f you stood in\nline very early in the morning, you could get bread and it wasn\u2019t very much but you had your ration\nand it help for the, for week maybe, if you really were very careful. So we, we lived very frugal.\nMaybe you cannot even call it living. But we survived.",
        "A: Oh sure. Day and night we heard this, I do not know how it\u2019s called in, in Vienna it was called\nthe Russian Organ(ph).",
        "A: The Italian(ph) Organ(ph).",
        "A: No, the Russian organ(ph), the .",
        "A:",
        "A: And it was going constantly, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. And this came closer and closer and\nwe had SS in our house and they were duck in the garden and what the bombs didn\u2019t destroy, they\ndestroyed with their shooting. And one night, you heard only [sound of footsteps], the SS had run.\nOh they first came to us into the basement whether we would like to go and with them. And I\nremember I said, \u201cIf I die, I don\u2019t want to die on the roadside, I die rather here.\u2019 And then in the\nmorning all was quiet and the Russians came down the street. And there was a delegation of people\nwho were very happy that the Russians came. One of them was Helena Pottsett\u2019s(ph) father. And\nhe greeted the Russians with open arms and the Russians were very happy to see them and they\ntook everything they had off them. The rings, the watches, everything. So Helena Pottsett\u2019s(ph)\nfather was then no Communist anymore. And we had next to the house a little park and this is\nwhere some of them settled down. And I remember that, the saying, now Germany kaput. Then\nAmerika kaputt. Fortunately, they were not right. Germany was kaput but they couldn\u2019t get\nAmerica kaput. And well, the rest I told you. How I came to Willie and how I had everything\npacked, the story about how we met in front of the door you have in, in the book to read and...",
        "A: Sure. We could. Now nobody could arrest us anymore, right? So...",
        "A: No, no. No, they just thought he\u2019s my boyfriend. In fact 1t was so much that he\u2019s my boyfriend\nthat my cousin had, what she ever had left in jewelry, she gave, gave to me and said, \u201cHere, in case\nWillie should change his mind and leave you.\u201d So.",
        "A: The Russians didn\u2019t behave well.",
        "A: No, the Russians behaved very poorly but they were an occupying force. Those were the, the\nfront troops. I guess you cannot expect anybody else, why should the Russians behave better than\nanybody else, right?",
        "A: They raped the women by the dozens, by the hundreds...",
        "A: Yeah, we, my cousin who lived in the apartment together now with me, she and I we slept for\ntwo weeks in the hospital for mentally ill that I told you a, a friend of ours was the head nurse. We\nslept there on benches because the Russians would...",
        "A:",
        "A: Yah.",
        "A: I tell you, while I was in camp, we were pretty much isolated. We didn\u2019t know very much.\nWhen I came out, it was more or less a question of day to day surviving. I do not think that then I\ndid realize what happened. Only when Willie came. Then, and we talked.",
        "A: And he told me, then did I realize what had happened.",
        "A: a little piece of margarine?",
        "A: Now, once a week I got in Ravensbruck a little piece of margarine. Now I knew he was in\nAmerica and I knew American women are beautiful. I didn\u2019t have any skin cream so what do you\ndo with the margarine? You put it on your face so in order not to get wrinkles. Today I laugh about\nit but it really wasn\u2019t a laughing matter. So. Now I have told you all my secrets. When Willie\ncame then, we, I got into the jeep and we went with the jeep with a Russian soldier that they had\ngiven him to accompany him and with a sergeant whom we called Red who by the way was here a\nfew months ago visiting with his wife. And...",
        "A: And his name used to be but he changed it now and he\u2019s Franklin, in\nNew York, and he for himself wrote for some magazine the story of how we\u2019re going\nto Vienna and my and it is the same with the exception of a few details which I don\u2019t\nremember anymore as mine.",
        "A: So we went back and the trip back was something like going into a fairy tale. The roads were\nnot roads. They had big bump holes and we, we had to go around and around the riverbeds, no\nbridges there. And towards us came those little Russian wagons with those little Russian horses and\non top were women sitting with fantastic head draped into drapes that they had taken, that they had\nlooted and it was such a, a unbelievable, colorful picture that you cannot forget it. And I remember\nthat once we had lost the way and a truck came towards us and the Russian asked the truck, we had\nlost the way, how to go and the Russian told him. And by the way, he showed him, look, how many\nwatches he had. He had...",
        "A: \u201cT have a watch,\u201d he told you. \u201c the watch.\u201d",
        "A: And that\u2019s the, the truck driver said, \u201cLook here.\u201d\u2019 And he had watches up to his elbow.",
        "A: few people in each village had their watch. watch for me. When I left\nfor, to pick up Lore, I . couple of watches from the PX. [talkover]",
        "A: Yeah. [talkover] he showed this proudly to this Russian truck driver who\nshowed us the way, we always, we got lost and the Russian said, \u201cLook,\u201d the whole arm full of\nwatch.",
        "A: So. And then we came to the first American station and Willie was very happy now, I will get a\ngood meal. Couldn\u2019t hold it. Not even the coffee and there were, all the toilets were only for men\nso he chased everybody out, he stood in front and if somebody wanted to go in he said, \u201cUh-uh. My\nwife is in there.\u201d And they wondered, a wife? But it, it worked. Then we came to, back to the\nstation and he drove me then to Bottnow-hime(ph) where I stayed in the hospital for three or four\nmonths. And, and then everything, from then on everything went smooth.",
        "A: Yes. I had angina acquired and I was physically all the way down.",
        "A: Yeah, about from June until March. So, I wanted a child very badly. We had lost so much time,\nso, it turned out fine. And now he, we have two grandchildren from him, so.",
        "A: No we did not know where. We had a very, very funny decision made. On the way over here\n[talkover], I was, I was on a bride ship.",
        "A: I had managed to be in control of this or something on this bride ship.",
        "A: I, so, we looked at, at a magazine and we saw a Peter, a Peter Arnoo(ph) cartoon. There, there\nwas a woman, one of those women standing on the podium and saying to secretary down there and\nnow you send this resolution to Marshall Tito(ph) so he should know where, what the women of\nMamal(ph) think about him.",
        "A:",
        "A: So he said, \u201c , let\u2019s look it up.\u201d And you know what, we bought a house in\nMamal(ph) when we came back. A Peter Arnoo(ph) cartoon, see? You never know what influences\nyour life. And I remember when I had Rafael(ph), he was a baby, and Willie went out into the\ncountry to look for houses and he came and he said, \u201cI found the house that, that I, you will like.\u201d\nBecause I always said I want soft ground under my feet. I don\u2019t want to live in the city. And I ask\nhim, \u201cWhat\u2019s, how\u2019s the house?\u201d And he says, \u201cIt has a beautiful garden.\u201d That was all he knew\nabout the house. But we bought the house anyhow.",
        "A: It, it had to be a ,",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: suburb of New York.",
        "A: No, Europe was completely out for me. I could, I couldn\u2019t even, when after years we went back\nand we picked up our car in Lugano, and drove back with the car towards Austria, close to the\nAustrian border Solomon had to...",
        "A: Rafael(ph).",
        "A: No, Solomon had to go to the bathroom and I threw all the papers that I had on my lap, I threw\nthem out. And when we came to the border, we didn\u2019t have a passport, we didn\u2019t have car papers,\nwe didn\u2019t have anybody. That\u2019s how much I hated to go back. I didn\u2019t throw it up, out on purpose\nand I, but I remember then where it must have happened and we found the papers. We went back.\nThey were still lying there. But that\u2019s how I felt about Europe.",
        "A: With some of them, I had still contact. Come when they were in America but most of them,\nunfortunately were killed. Most of them. One was in, in London, I do not recall anybody else. His\nfamily of course, they were all in America but, and this one friend I was really close to, she came\nalso to America and I had contact with her. And that\u2019s about it, I do not know anything of anybody\nwho was close to me in Vienna. It\u2019s sad but things were so, in such a tumult that from one day to\nthe other, you didn\u2019t know what would happen. And you just lost contact and I think with the other\npeople, it was just the same.",
        "A: I tell you something. I always believed in God and God is everywhere so give it any kind of\nstamp. It\u2019s God. And I really believe that God was not only during all that time with us, that God 1s\nwith us all the time. I really believe that. That, and somehow, sometimes I feel that it\u2019s like an,\npardon me, like an umbrella above us so that really nothing can hit us and I always tell it to the\nchildren. They, so that they should feel the same way. I think that the Jewish religion in, in\ncomparison with the Catholic religion has so much more positive. The Catholic religion has so\nmany restrictions which the Jewish religion doesn\u2019t have.",
        "A: Such as. You can talk to God, you don\u2019t need an, a mediary. You can, you can even scold God\nif you feel like it, right? You are not forced to do this and this, this. There are certain restrictions in\nthe Jewish religions too and you have to obey certain, certain laws but it\u2019s not as harsh as the, as the\nCatholic religion.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. And I, I, I always if something bad happens, I remember my father saying,\n\u201cWhere was God when the soldiers were dying?\u201d Where was God when all this happen in, in, in\nAuschwitz and everywhere? Where was God? And I have talked to our rabbi about it and he said, \u201cTI\ndo not know where he was but it was for the good of the Jewish people.\u201d What good can this do to\nthe Jewish people? You learn, can\u2019t you learn differently only so misery of others? You have to\naccept certain things and that\u2019s it.",
        "A: I haven\u2019t found any answers. If the rabbi doesn\u2019t find an answer, we have talked through this\nmany, many evenings, right?",
        "A: One thing that she always tells me she appreciates in the Jewish religion is that it counts what\nyou do not what you feel. What you believe. You can believe and listen to , you feel\nthis but what you do 1s the final decision.",
        "A: Yes. Now you see, if, I think that both of us and also our children have accepted my conversion.\nI didn\u2019t tell you when I came to America, in order to make it really completely prove and secure I\nwent through another conversion with dipping in the, in the mikvah and cutting the lace and cutting\nthe hair, I did that all over again, so. In order to make it foolproof. That\u2019s, that sound all very odd\nto you?",
        "A: No, okay.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. We both did but there was a price on Bill\u2019s head and he couldn\u2019t go back to Israel.",
        "A: By the British. The British had put a price on his head.",
        "A: Thousand pounds.",
        "A: Thousand pounds he was worth, see? And there, there was simply no way we could have gone\nthere. We even considered later when Rafael(ph) our older son, was twelve years. He wanted very\nbadly to go to Israel. We were in Israel [talkover].",
        "A: The state of Israel exist...",
        "A: Yah.",
        "A: We could have gone by then.",
        "A: Right. And we went there for the first Yom Ha-Atzmaut.",
        "A: Right. And Rafael(ph) was so enamored with Israel. He begged, \u201cLet\u2019s us, let us stay here, let\nus stay here.\u201d And, but Willie had a job here, we had an existence here. In Israel we didn\u2019t have\nanything. So we went back. And now our oldest son married an Israeli and he intends to go back to\nIsrael when he retires. He even bought some property there now.",
        "A: Rafael(ph). Say?",
        "A: His children are being brought up in ?",
        "A: His children.",
        "A: His children are being brought up in ; . Twice a year they go to\nIsrael, early in the, the spring and in, in the fall. And he, when he retires, he\u2019s in the federal service,\nhe\u2019s going to retire to Israel.",
        "A: So. I do not know whether we did things wrong, whether we did them right. I think we did the\nbest we could, both of us. And that\u2019s all you can ask of anybody. [talkover]",
        "A: Jewish is when we came back from Israel, she always tried to persuade me to walk to the\nsynagogue regularly because she had the idea from the Catholic school that you have to go to\nchurch every week. And I didn\u2019t want to, to the synagogue every day or every week. So she\ndissatisfied with this.",
        "A: ,",
        "A: No, that I appreciate that you came. I appreciate it very, very much. It\u2019s your time and it\u2019s not\nvery pleasant. Mostly not a very pleasant experience to listen to other people\u2019s misfortune.\n"
