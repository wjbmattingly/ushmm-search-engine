        "Q: What year were your parents born?",
        "A: My father was born in year 1905 and my mother was born in 1910. So and they were, my\nmother came to town as I said from southern Poland which used to be called, before 1918, before\nPoland regained its independence was called Galicia which was part of the Austro-Hungarian\nempire. Those who know history will know that Poland didn\u2019t exist on the maps for about 125\nyears. And when it regained independence in 1918 was made up of three previously partitioned\nparts \u2014 Prussian on the west, Russia on the east, and Austro-Hungarian Empire on the south,\nwhich included Galicia.",
        "Q: How did your parents meet?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "A: My parents met most likely if I can recall it well, in the post office of Gora Kalwaria. My\nmother was a teacher in nearby village. And my father at that time was working in the post\noffice. My father was a bachelor at that time and he had great ease of communication with\npeople so I am not surprised that they met. They married in 1931. I have beautiful picture\nshowing their wedding and I was born four years later. My father was an accountant. He worked\nin the bank for some time and also in post office. And my mother was grammar school teacher.\nShe was really gifted and praised by many parents for her exceptional human skills and ability to\ncommunicate with children and motivate children.\nSo my first memories were started with the age about three. When my father was assigned a job,\ntemporary job outside of our town and I was sent to the store and I already at that time had a\ngood sense of humor. I was kind of the cracking jokes which I believe were told to me and then I\nthink I remembered, but I\u2019m not sure which 1s it. My first major shocking experiences were\nrelated to the war because in 1939 at the beginning of September, when Germans were bombing\nPolish cities and they attacking Poland from the west, Warsaw was attacked relatively early by\nbombers. And although there was only 20 miles between Warsaw and Gora Kalwaria, German\nbombers apparently made mistake and they were looking for military objects. They bombed the\nresidential part of our town, although there were military barracks on the other end of the town.\nThey were all made of bricks, covered with the yellow shingles made of clay. And from the air\nthey could have looked identical to the big hospital area which was next to my house. So they\nmade a mistake and they dropped several bombs and one of them landed very near of my house\nwhere family of 11 people, escapees from Warsaw were hiding in. The escapees from Warsaw\nwhen they thought, they saved their lives by running from Warsaw. However, German bomb\ndropped on that house killed all of them, ten of them were killed. Only one person was saved.",
        "Q: Before we get too far into your memories of the war and the beginning of the war, can you\ntell me more about your family background. Your father\u2019s family and where they came from as\nwell as your mother\u2019s.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "A: So starting with my father, my father\u2019s family was -- it\u2019s a long history cause one of my\nuncles was keeping the history of our family. Unfortunately this book which was, hand written\nbook, which was keeping notes was destroyed after the war. But what I remember was read to\nme was that Polish kings nominated in 17\u201c century, one of our ancestors, he was a general,\nYosef Orlowski, as a commander of old town which had the medieval walls around it. And then\nthere was water around, I\u2019m missing terms.",
        "Q: The moat.",
        "A: The moat. And this structure survived for several centuries, defending eastern territories of\nPoland against the invasions of Tartars and other armies which were trying to conquer Europe\nfrom east.",
        "Q: Was it in Gora Kalwaria also? Or outside?",
        "A: No, Gora Kalwaria was more to the west. On Vistula river. Gora Kalwaria was in east located\non the western shore of Vistula river which was the main river in Poland, running from almost\nthe border with Czech republic and now was Czechoslovakia at that time to Baltic sea.",
        "Q: So where did this ancestor live?",
        "A: They, some of them they lived in this area. Others lived in, which is called Ukraine and my\ngreat grandfather was participant in 1970, 71 uprising against Russians.",
        "Q: 1871.",
        "A: 1870. There was called Postalistichi Novy [ph]. In translation its January uprising that was\n1870, 1871. And he was caught by the Russians and sent to Siberia. He was very intelligent\nman and he learned Russian quickly. He changed his physiognomy by starting a beard, side\nburns and hair style and acquire false documents and he run away from this camp. And then was\ntraveling mostly by foot. Sometimes working as a handyman on the way to earn some money for\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nfood. But it took him 11 and a half months by foot to get from Siberia back to the area which he\nlived near Warsaw. Meanwhile, all his property including quite an amount of land was\nconfiscated by Russians so he had to start his life from square one.\nHe managed to have two children, a boy and girl which were raised by somebody else because\nhe became ill and he died very shortly afterwards. So I still visit his grave when I am in Warsaw\nand one of the \u2014 pardon me.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: His name was Saldwan [ph] which was normally by Polish kings was Josef and my\ngrandfather was Karl and the one which 1s at the cemetery \u2014 what my memory now escaped. I\nwill recall it, during this conversation. So \u2014",
        "Q: Does your mother\u2019s family have a colorful past just like that?",
        "A: Just returning to my father, to my grandfathers. They came from an impoverished nobility of\nmedium kind of the level they had their own coat of arms and everything was recorded and my\nuncle was keeping these records which unfortunately were destroyed.\nOn my mother\u2019s side. My mother came \u2014 my mother was raised on a small farm in the\nmountains. She I would call it, she was a mountaineer. I was visiting this area many times after\nthe war and I met all her cousins. Family was rather big and when my father was born he was\nthe oldest. He had three sisters. My mother had one sister and four brothers. And there were two\nor three who died because of the illnesses of the time and bad medical care obviously. So it was\nI would say strange combination of the history of these two families and I have to admit that my\nparents were not the best matched couple, as I see it, especially from the distance of time.\nHowever, I loved my both parents and when my father was arrested in 1943 in Warsaw, he was\ntraveling between Warsaw and Gora Kalwaria often, and trading with different items. One of the\nmost important items he was trading was golden coins because those who know life in Poland,\nduring the occupation they would know that everybody was trading, even children. There was\neither barter or cash. Everybody knew value of everything else. All was illegal. Germans\nabsolutely didn\u2019t allow trading unless it was sanctioned by them, by stores which they would\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\napprove and you have to be either confident or some other, doing some other functions, useful\nfor Germans. Or the trades was illegal. And, but everybody was really smuggling to survive.\nJobs were very scarce. Food was difficult to obtain. Even if you had money, you couldn\u2019t enter\nthe store and buy what you wanted. So my mother was an early \u2014 when my father was traveling\nbetween Warsaw and Gora Kalwaria, my mother was very involved in social movements. My\nmother was involved in the trade union, the labor union, teachers labor union. She was\ndemonstrating in 1937, 8, I know from her memories. I was too small to remember that. There\nwere demonstrations for higher salaries, for better working conditions and so on. Partially\nsuccessful. During the war my mother relatively quickly joined underground movement which\nwas led by Polish government in exile in London. It was pro-western, it was called Armia\nKrajowa [ph] in English. Actually 1t was AK in English was national army. Yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about your mother\u2019s occupation as a teacher, what she taught and her role\nwithin the community?",
        "A: Before war, my mother was teaching grades one to five, I believe, four or five. And she was\nteaching all basic things. Usually teachers on that level they didn\u2019t have specialty so she was\nteaching history, geography, Polish language, less sciences. However, during the war, Germans\n-- it was very lucky that in our town there were somehow more liberal. And we had two schools\nand each was \u2014 had classes one to seven. However, what I heard at the same time in different\nparts of Poland, they were allow, the classes were only from one to four. And obviously they\nwould allow teaching history, geography, anything which would enlighten people. They wanted\nPoles to just read and write and do the basic calculus. They didn\u2019t, the all middle schools, all\nuniversities were all forbidden.\nHowever, there was a lot of underground schooling. There were regular classes in people\u2019s\nhouses. Some of them denounced, people were arrested. Torture sometimes. There were all kind\nof sanctions, but many, many of the schools because of the solidarity between the people.\nEverybody was interested having the children educated in spite of German restrictions.\nMost of the schools I would say survived and there were all different levels. Diplomas were\ngiven. Exams were passed. It was just very normal and popular for -- and people were chipping\nin, in different ways.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nFor example, the parents of this \u2014 for example my mother was giving tutorials after the regular\nschool hours. There were, different kids are coming different days, different hours to my house\nand my mom was teaching them, helping them to catch up to the level which was expected and\nthere were either less talented or they had harder conditions at home. Parents which are\nuneducated and they couldn\u2019t help them with homework. So my mother was fulfilling that role.\nAnd well she was paid with real goods, usually food. Like farmers cheese, homemade bread,\neggs, carrots, onions, chickens sometime which was already plucked and ready to cook for soup\nor whatever.\nSo we are relatively, relatively and there were periods of time when there was shortage of food,\nwhere there were no tutorials and they depended on detention and what was happening outside\nwhere, especially at the beginning of the war and just before the end of war, when they were first\nuprising in Warsaw ghetto and then Warsaw uprising of 1944 which were major upheaval for the\nWarsaw and the near surroundings where we lived.",
        "Q: Kind of the beginning of the war, do you remember hearing about the war, hearing about the\ntensions between the Germans on the radio or the rise of anti-Semitism in Germany?",
        "A: We\u2019re not allowed to have radios.",
        "Q: Before the war?",
        "A: Before war, yes. Oh you\u2019re talking about before war.",
        "Q: Yeah did you have any sense that a war was coming before September first?",
        "A: Yes and no. There was some talks but most of the population were kept in the belief and that\nincluded Jewish population. I mean all citizens were kept under belief that 1f Germans attack. It\nwas considered a, such a possibility, French and English are going to attack from the west\nbecause there were international agreements signed between the governments who were the\nwestern powers declare that if the Poland is attacked they are going to attack as well.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nHowever, what we learned later and obviously Hitler and his intelligence services had very good\nrecognition of the mood and plans which French and German had and that\u2019s what I learned was\nlater obviously when I was four, five, six years old I didn\u2019t know that. But I knew it shortly after\nthe war. Germans kept 92 percent of their armies in the eastern front and there were absolutely\nvulnerable from the west. And Poles, Polish army and civilians were defending Warsaw for\nseveral weeks. Warsaw was encircled by German army but there were organized resistance.\nThere was some w, ammunition and arms to protect Warsaw against the German army and it was\nvery harrowing defense. However Germans had superiority in the air. They were bombing and\nthey had superior tanks so in spite of the barricades and all these fortifications which were built\naround the outskirts, on the outskirts of, of center of the city, was conquered after several weeks.",
        "Q: What was the response from your parents when the war began? Was there any talk about\nfleeing the area and going elsewhere?",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s very good question because what happened here. After the first bombs were dropped\non Gora Kalwaria, there was real -- start to be just somewhere else. Germans are attacking them.\nThey come here eventually or maybe Polish army would defend them. Maybe French and\nGermans would attack from the west. The whole resistance was hinging on that promise cause\notherwise Poland realized it, its population realized that they didn\u2019t have any chance because the\nGermans who had huge amount of the very well, well trained, well equipped, quite modern arms,\nartillery, airplanes and so on.\nAnd so what happens here that my parents at the very beginning, after the first bombing,\norganized a group of families, perhaps was six, seven people in that group, plus the owner of the\nbig truck, Mr. Victor Balitzky was his name. We packed our belongings within hours. Packed\nour belongings on the top of the truck and we are running towards Russia to escape Germans.\nOn the roads and roads were narrow, whole traffic was mostly towards east. And there were\ncolumns and columns. Sometime trucks which were rarity. Small cars also rarity. Mostly was\ncarts pulled by horses and people loading their belongings and there were columns as long as you\ncan reach by eyesight. What German fire, the planes were doing. They were running along,\nflying along these roads and from the machine guns and also small bombs they were dropping on\nthese convoys. So whatever it would have and we could distinguish between Polish aircraft and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nGerman aircraft. There was something different. And my task on the top of the truck was to look\nto the west and watch and listen for the sounds and I was the one who was bringing attention of\nthe adults and then what people were doing, they running quickly to the left and the right side\nleaving truck in the center of the road. And they were hiding in between the potato or rye or\nwheat you know whatever we could \u2014 or trees if it was nearby. And we\u2019re sitting there waiting\nuntil they go away because they came for a couple of minutes and they were gone and then\nmaybe next time, whether it will be the same day or maybe three times next day. It was nothing\nregular or they are not \u2014 unpredictable. This way we reached Russian borders which was Soviet\nUnion at that time but we called it Russian. And since Russians enter Poland from the east on\nSeptember 17, we were at that time in Russia already, not deep.\nAnd we are ordered to go back towards west, towards Poland itself which was still Poland but it\nwas already occupied by Russians that territory. And not many people know that the Russia took\nmore territory in 1939 or September than Germans took before that. However the population\ndensity was much higher in the western territories which were eastern territories. Also eastern\nterritories had much more minorities and so and Russia started to resettle Poles to Siberia, or to\nwest, Kazakhstan, towards Siberia. They had to, were less organized than German but they had\ntrains which were equipped with pig, with cars adapted to transport pigs. There were no\npassenger cars. And they were sent to which they later was called Kulaks, gulags.",
        "Q: During this evacuation and when you were listening out for the airplanes coming, do you\nremember being scared. I mean weren\u2019t you frightened?",
        "A: Well scared is understatement. I had you know my shorts full of almost and \u2014 you know I\nmean?",
        "Q: Did you comprehend it?",
        "A: How, you know what\u2019s a child\u2019s reaction when he sees front of the plane going towards you\nand kind of the almost aiming at you and they were coming very low sometime so when they\u2019re\ncoming low we are definitely out of truck already, but was very, very scary experience and one\nwhich you cannot forget til the end of your life.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "Q: Do you remember what your parents told you? Do you remember them communicating with\nyou at this time?",
        "A: They were scared by themselves so you know this is the time when children mature much\nfaster than their chronological calendars. During the war my father was already in Auschwitz.\nMy mother was part of this underground movement and during the day quite often when she was\nat work, my house looked normal. There was nothing unusual but on occasion, once every week,\nevery two weeks on an irregular basis, we have a crew coming to our house. Crew, and those are\nthe members of the same underground movement which my mother belonged and they were\ncoming with the radio transmitter, receiver in pieces.\nSome of the pieces were hidden in our house. Some of -- they were bringing and putting\ntogether in minutes literally and they are starting communication by Morse code with radio base\nwhich was located on the outskirts of London.\nAnd they are communicating forth and back, sending information which 1s coded also besides\nthe Morse code. They were also using some coded, so it was not easy. However, Germans knew\nabout these stations, that they exist. However, they couldn\u2019t easily find them because they are\nvillages, small towns. They couldn\u2019t be everywhere all the time so my task was that as soon as\nthe station was ready to go, I was told to go outside, although I remember some time the Morse\ncode I can hear it today (sound effects) are the key. My task was to go outside and I had friends\nwho were fulfilling similar role, although some time they were, didn\u2019t know all the details,\nbecause we didn\u2019t talk among our self, all the details for obvious reasons. And was to look for\nthe German, they look like a pick-up truck today, but it was a low truck, small truck, which\ndipole antenna which, the antenna which allows to determine from which direction signal is\ncoming, from that station. So to determine where is exact location of that station, of the\ntransmitter, they had to have two measurements from different angles. And then on the map they\ncould identify very exactly which, almost which house, that this transmitter was located.\nSo my task and my friends\u2019 task was to detect existence of this German trucks nearby and notify\nmy mother one to another one were standing on the corners of the streets. So within seconds my\nmother knew there is a truck nearby. And my mother was running inside of our house and telling\nthe crew. They were taking apart that radio station, hiding whatever they could, take the rest of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nthem and they obviously they are not running around the streets. They are going in the back of\nour house, through the orchards. Orchard to orchard. Orchard to orchard, never going through\nthe town itself, but on the outskirts, through the dense whatever the forest and usually there were\nno Germans in this area. Besides they knew exactly where the concentration German where\npolice headquarters. When they come into town they knew exactly where to go and not to go.",
        "Q: How many times do you remember seeing a truck and having to warn your mother that it was\ncoming?",
        "A: Fortunately, not even once we detected this truck at the time when a radio station \u2014 yeah, I\nsaw these trucks but at that time there was never that station in my house. So we were lucky.\nThis same crew which came to us several times, we learned they were shot when they were\njumping through, were escaping and they were machine gunned. They were decimated, all of\nthem, two or three were coming to our house when another crew was coming. But they were\ndetected and killed in some neighboring small town.",
        "Q: It was a different town that that happened.",
        "A: Yes, they were going from town to town through different places on irregular basis,\nunpredictable for anybody else but they have their own system will allow them to coordinate\nwith the house owner and having this system of people who were protecting them from. In this\none case the system failed obviously and they were killed.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sure you talked to your mother at some point, especially after the war about her\nexperience. Did she share with you how she got involved with the underground movement?",
        "A: Yes there was, my mom was very friendly with the principal of the school at which she was\nteaching and his wife was teacher as well. And this lady, she was the head of that women\u2019s\ndivision in support of other girl fighters cause my mom didn\u2019t have, she didn\u2019t train. She knew\nhow to shoot but she was not really specially trained. And there was not a role for the women.\nThere was mostly role for men. The women had a lot of supportive roles. One of them, for\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nexample was, and there was, as a part of underground movement, but also as the interest of my\nmother. Because as a teacher she had a lot of Jewish kids as her pupils. By average, her classes\nwas around 50 percent of the kids were Jewish, before ghetto was created in 1940. For, and it\nexisted for about half a year. So my mom had a lot of good acquaintances, I wouldn\u2019t say closest\nfriends. But a lot of people who respected her and from both religions and including Orthodox\nJews who, many of them they were sending their kids not only to cheder, Jewish school, but\nthey sent them to the public schools, to the Polish because they were doing business.\nMost of the stores in our town were Jewish owned. There were excellent relationship between\nboth religions and as I mentioned no accidents. So my mom was involved and at the very\nbeginning there was a lot of smuggling going between Warsaw which was the biggest center\nwhere you could get food. Or from countryside farms, to the ghetto in Gora Kalwaria. Ghetto in\nGora Kalwaria was very unusual because it did have sections with the barbed wire fences.\nHowever specially during the night, the traffic was unbelievable. That somehow people were\nable to bribe the guards which were part of Judenrat organization which was set up to\ncommunicate between Germans and the Jewish population.",
        "Q: So the guards were mostly Jewish?",
        "A: Jewish with the bands on the arm, civilian or semi-civilian dressed but during the night was\nlike a shift and I had a friend who had the, his house windows were looking at the ghetto fence.\nAnd I had to pass, my house was located less than half a mile from border of the ghetto.",
        "Q: What streets was the ghetto on?",
        "A: Piarska, Pewsitskago [ph]. They are descriptions of that. For example, I \u2014 a good friend of\nmy mother is a gentleman who died recently. His name was Henrik Price. Here is article about\nhim. And I was admiring him. He ran away from ghetto. And there is one recording in\nHolocaust Museum which you sent to me, the -- you are there, and his, the general\u2019s name is\nFelix Kartman. He describes in much better, in greater detail than which I wouldn\u2019t be able to\ndescribe what was going on inside because I was not inside Polish of non-Jewish, non-Jews were\nnot allowed to enter.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "Q: Can you tell me more about your mother\u2019s involvement in the underground movement and\nsome of the tasks that she was given to do?",
        "A: So one of the tasks my mother took and also she was assigned later officially by the\nunderground movement was to find people who would be actively involved in smuggling food to\nghetto, either from country side by her knowledge of the farmers who were parents of the\nchildren which she was teaching at the school. Or people who were traveling regularly or\nwilling to travel to Warsaw and bring some items which were not regularly available locally.\nAnd there is too many names to mention here, but they are people still alive, my peers or people\nwho are already recorded in the archives of Holocaust Museum, like Mr. Felix Kartman and Mr.\nAvram Henrik Price. There are You Tubes, they are very detailed interviews with him. He, I\nwas -- my mother was on very good terms with him. Last time I visited him about ten years ago,\nand I spoke to his sister a couple weeks ago by phone. This gentleman died in the age of 101 and\na half. Unbelievably strong physically and mentally. He describes his life in great details and\nthere is so much to be learned about his life and the life of other people.",
        "Q: So your mother worked with him?",
        "A: My mother worked with him after the war in different organizations. But my mother knew\nhim and he knew both my parents because I talked to him about my father especially from before\nwar. He knew my father quite well. So \u2014",
        "Q: Did your mother ever go to the ghetto when she was trying to get food into the ghetto from all\nthese famers?",
        "A: As I mentioned, the non-Jews were restricted. They couldn\u2019t, they were not allowed to enter.\nSo but, through mutual friends and mutual acquaintances there was quite good communication\nand again, in spite of German regulations, people tried to conduct normal life. By normal life I\nmean people are working in ghetto. People are trying to preserve food, to sell items. Everybody\nbelieved in the ghetto that this just, just temporary solution, that they would be resettled in a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\ndifferent place. They would be saved from \u2014 people didn\u2019t want to admit that this is any of kind\nof the organized massacre and they are going to be killed. Everybody had hope and as you well\nknown that kept people going and living because once you remove the hope from human beings,\nthe whole life doesn\u2019t make sense.\nSo obviously there were moments when people becoming depressed or they stop to be positive\nand optimistic, but there was role of others to keep the spirit alive and so there were all kind of\npreoccupations, including small theater, singing groups, educational aspects, organizations were\ngetting together and having discussions.",
        "Q: Outside the ghetto or inside?",
        "A: Inside, everything inside the ghetto and unbelievable overcrowding. People were living\nsometimes eight, six, eight up to ten people in one room. Incredible. And but this gentleman like\nthe three people whom I am well familiar and I knew them, was Henrik Price, Felix Kartman and\nHeinrich Mayevsky.",
        "Q: So they were friends of yours who were in the ghetto?",
        "A: Those are the people who were able to escape, hide and they were able to survive and they\nreturned to Gora Kalwaria after. Out of three, around three and a half thousand Jewish people\nwho lived in prewar Poland, that\u2019s were people who were able to \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have friends who were in the ghetto?",
        "A: Not in my age and not my classmates. But they were like friends of my friends. A lot of\npeople who I knew because of my parents\u2019 acquaintance being there. Or there\u2019s very interesting\nstory. My, one of my three or four best friends -- they live in this, closer to center of town. And\nthey had a house with several rooms. My friends and his last name is Ptak, Witold Ptak.",
        "Q: How do you spell that?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "A: P-T-A-K which in translation means a belt, a belt.",
        "Q: And his first name was?",
        "A: His name is Witold, W-I-T-O-L-D. Witold. I was quite often visiting him.And one of the\nreasons was that his grandma was doing excellent white barsht which is like made of it\u2019s like a\nsour dough soup, kind of, I don\u2019t know how to translate it even in English. It\u2019s made of the\nsourdough bread which is added some aging, you know like you make kefir. Ferment. Went\nthrough the process of fermentation. So to get the essence of that I was coming to their house and\nbringing empty bottle, like one liter bottle. I was paying for it, whatever was asked. And then it\nwas like a broth for making a soup. Potato was added and one of my (part of our?) when my\nmother was in school I was doing the cooking. I was preparing dinner. And my mother and \u2014 I\nwas six, seven, eight year old but I was preparing dinner. My mother came from school quite\noften and either dinner was ready or not much left to finish the dinner.\nSo this, my friend\u2019s uncle which was brother of his mother\u2019s, mother\u2019s brother. He fell in love\nwith a Jewish girl. At the beginning of ghetto when she was surrounded and she was forced to\nresettle and live in that ghetto, she escaped, like a lot of people did. But not high percentage.\nAnd she, and it was interesting that people who were escaping from ghetto, they either tried to be\nin countryside which was easier to hide. Living with a farmer like this gentleman, Henrik Price.\nHe was adopted. He got the false document and he was adopted by a family of farmers who had\nson of similar age who didn\u2019t return from war. He was part of the Polish army and he didn\u2019t\nreturn. And this family adopted Mr. Price. And \u2014",
        "Q: What happened to the uncle\u2019s girlfriend?",
        "A: She, when she escaped from Gora Kalwaria, she went to another ghetto in a small town on the\nother side of the Vistula river. There was no bridge so you have to be, there was some special\npeople who for a fee they took you in a small boat, one p, two persons, three people that could fit\non that ferry so it was just basically like a major canoe. And a long stick and that\u2019s the way they\ngot on the other side of the river. The river was quite substantial and you could get in troubles if\nyou tried to swim across. Anyhow so she went to another ghetto which was much more liberal so\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nto speak, much easy to get in and out and so on. And then again she escaped from there because\nhe was able, he was working at the cemeteries of smaller towns and he found on the grave a\nname of the Polish woman and her name was Yanina, fitting the age. He went to the priest and\nhe got falsified document for the name of Yanina, I forgot the name.\nAnd she was under that name til they got married, this couple but meanwhile there was not the\nend of this story.\nMeanwhile she was sent under the falsified name and there was Jews, not as much as non-Jews.\nThey were sent to Germany to work on the farms because Germans were short of manual, menial\nworkers. And so a lot of Poles, depending on the historian, but their calculation at least one\nmillion Poles worked on the farms in Germany during the war and were obviously all forced.\nThey were paid a little bit, tiny bit, given food and shelter and many of them survive. And to the\nextent that the family of bakers who owned the bakery, German in the small town, they loved her\nso much that they were being ordered. They wanted to give the bakery to her. However she\ndidn\u2019t want to stay in Germany. She returned after the war to Gora Kalwaria and she married my\nfriend\u2019s uncle. Her name is Salome, or Solika they called her, her real name and again I forgot\nher real last name. But they had two children. They have children again and my friend was\nbaptizing.

        "A: Surprising, surprisingly I cannot recall many, but I know many others including my cousins\nwhich I visited later in Belgium. My cousin met her husband who came from Belgium. He was\nof Polish descent. She was of Polish descent from Poland. They married and they settled in\nBelgium and they have two daughters and I visited them after the war several times in Belgium.\nNot from our town. Somehow if they were, I was not familiar with them, a small percentage but\nI heard there were many, many others who went and they return. A lot of people in our town\nwere in hiding. I wouldn\u2019t say majority, definitely not. But in my family one of my cousins was,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nmost of the German occupation he was just hiding. He was not at home because if he showed at\nhome he would be either denounced or he would be sought by police and he would be arrested.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Because they had records. Either they beat somebody, some German and they runaway and\nthe police knew who was he, came home. He was gone. So luckily they -- nobody got, the\nGermans didn\u2019t care the other members of the family but he was gone and he stayed alive. He 1s\n90 something.",
        "Q: What\u2019s his name?",

        "A: That\u2019s right so my father was arrested in Warsaw. And miraculously.",
        "Q: Before that, so that was in 1943 that he was arrested, but before that what was he doing\nduring the beginning of the war?",
        "A: He was traveling between Warsaw and Gora Kalwaria but then more and more he was staying\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nin Warsaw because his -- what trading he was doing involved presence of big like a farmer\u2019s\nmarket in Warsaw. Gora Kalwaria had farmer\u2019s market when farmers were coming once a week\nwith their horse pulled, horse pulled cart full of goods which they grew. Warsaw had market but\nthere was less farmers but more middle men and women and who could get a lot of interesting\nthings there. Not everything was exposed. There are certain things which are shown and other\nthings which were kind of behind counter or underneath. Only when you struck a conversation\nand since people got familiar with you they had some level of trust. Then they tell you, you know\nI have this yet, I have that yet. Like other.",
        "Q: Contraband materials or black market kind of?",
        "A: Definitely materials which Germans didn\u2019t allow, including cold cuts. Unfortunately there\nwere not refrigeration so you can imagine have to be fresh and salt. They couldn\u2019t take them\noutside, so by the end of day they were selling for less and less and less. Also you could bargain.\nYou could \u2014",
        "Q: Barter\u2019?",

        "Q: Haggle.",
        "A: Haggle is the word. You need to haggle and the more you haggle you know one another\nbetter. And that is a satisfaction for both sides involved. There is more pleasant feeling about the\ntransaction when you haggle. If you just pay, if you just pay what you are asked for, it\u2019s kind of\nyou don\u2019t get much respect from the salesperson. That\u2019s the psychology of specially small town\nand you know village.",
        "Q: So your father was acting as kind of one of these middle people?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "A: He was middle people because he didn\u2019t produce anything. He was buying and selling but\nyou need to know where to buy and what price and to know where to go and sell. And you buy\nthrough your own trusted channels and you sell where it\u2019s a lot of people when you again\nestablish certain relationship. You sell certain items to strangers maybe most of them but you\nhave your own customers who know you, come and you are always standing in the same place so\n-- or the same area and people recognize one another and they wave and then they go sometimes\nto the site. They don\u2019t do transaction with everybody is looking at their hands. So the whole\nculture.",
        "Q: That\u2019s kind of an occupational shift for your father, right?",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: He was an accountant. Why did he switch?",
        "A: Because the pay, pay couldn\u2019t get job at the very beginning. Pay was poor and you could be\nmuch better off. And later as, as I learned my father and those are -- I don\u2019t have hundred percent\nproof but I think my father was renting room from some people. And then I think from a lady.\nAnd there could have been some relationship there which he was obviously hiding from my\nmother. My mother -- women have this instinct and can sense; however we didn\u2019t have proof.",
        "Q: This was in Warsaw?",
        "A: It was Warsaw itself. So when he was arrested barely anybody in our small town knew. Only\nthat he was arrested, only because he was not often coming to Gora Kalwaria. So he was not\ncoming for longer time. He was arrested, sent to Auschwitz and people didn\u2019t know about that.\nOnly closest trusted people knew about that. We didn\u2019t broadcast it, we didn\u2019t spread that\ninformation. Obviously his mother, his sisters knew about that. And they again didn\u2019t talk to\nanybody about it. Because there was nobody\u2019s interest to talk about that. Was too many\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nquestions. People were asking so, and so and so on. Avoid unnecessary lying or making stories\npeople rather avoiding subject.",
        "Q: Why was he arrested?",
        "A: That\u2019s a big mystery, which is mystery to me til today. I do not have hundred percent proof\nbut the hypothesis which were my mother\u2019s hypothesis and since my father died 33 years ago,\nthey are my hypothesis and I never met anybody who really knew my father in Warsaw who\nwould get the -- from the first hand.",
        "Q: And your father wouldn\u2019t tell you?",
        "A: My father had different theories and he was avoiding the subject. And besides, 1946 my\nfather is divorced so my father changed the location. He moved to so called regained territories\nfrom Germany. He started a new family in Yeren Yagoda. He had two children there and I\nmaintained very loose relationship to the extent that when I immigrated, I left Poland in 1970\nand he died in 1983. My mother died in 1985. My mother died in my home, United States. My\nfather died in Poland, 1983 in a town called Yeren Yagoda and I was on his grave. However, I\ndidn\u2019t maintain the relationship with his new family.",
        "Q: He was sent to Auschwitz immediately or was he sent and \u2014",
        "A: First he was tortured in Warsaw special headquarters where they specialized in torturing\nprisoners to get the information about the coworkers, what he knew about underground\nmovement. They didn\u2019t learn much because he didn\u2019t know much. The underground movement\nin Gora Kalwaria didn\u2019t accept my father. He didn\u2019t apply for it and my mother would be,\nwouldn\u2019t agree for that because he was traveling a lot and he was talkative and he might not keep\nthe secrets. The underground movement, most of the people who were members they knew only\npseudonyms of one another, unless they knew them self from before.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nBut that was rather recommended that to work together with people whom you didn\u2019t know\nbefore and used pseudonyms which were different from your real names. In the case you are\narrested, you are beaten tortured, you couldn\u2019t say if you didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did your mother have a pseudonym?",
        "A: My mother had a pseudonym. Everything is written. I have books describing. They are by\nhistorian who wrote a book Heroes of Two Towns and he describes especially one, one it\u2019s in\nPolish, Bohaterodia Dvu Myastits [ph] in Polish in the original. And yes, she did and so after\nthe removal of the ghetto from Gora Kalwaria, as you can imagine a lot of real estate left there.\nThree thousand people were crowded but it was a lot of empty housing, which Germans didn\u2019t\ncare because they were not specially high quality housing. They are not office buildings. They\ndid confiscate my school and they keeping their hospital, they keeping for certain time school for\nGerman children, families. German officials who were in town. And then there was in a hospital\nfor German prisoners who were returning from eastern front and I vividly remember they were\ngetting off the train and they walked through the town and how they were wrapped around up to\nsometimes barely their noses that were sticking from the bandages around. There were people\nwho were the soldiers who were returning from Stalingrad when Germans were, Russians\ndefended them self and then was part of the \u2014 from the defense mode they started to press. And\nthere was full winter. Germans absolutely unprepared to survive Russian, Siberian type of the\nweather. And many of them they lost parts of the body, noses, ears. They were all wrapped\naround when they were coming for reconvalison [ph], for recovery. It was like a military\nhospital there when they were staying for a couple of months and they were going back to\nGermany because they were not, many of them were not capable to fight any more. And they\nhad huge shortage of manpower by the end of the year.",
        "Q: There were German families living in Gora Kalwaria?",
        "A: Yes, but they were all implants. There were few German families who are native and they,\nmost often they were, cooperation. They knew German language and they are cooperating with\nauthorities and, but Polish underground movement\u2019s task was to watch, monitor and eventually\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nexecute these traitors. And one of these Germans, his name was Miller and he was killed by\nunderground movement. And there was one incident when in the school where I was attending,\none boy came and he was crying, saying that Germans killed his older brother. There was quite\nan age difference. I knew it from my person who was temporarily living in my house and they\nhad this conferences and training sessions after curfew.",
        "Q: In your house?",
        "A: In my house. So it was part of the activities of my mother. She allowed her house to be place\nwhere fighters, underground movement you know fighters were training, exchanging\ninformation, getting commands to do and there was execution squad came and it was reporting to\nthis gentleman. His name was Jan Savada. It\u2019s written in that book. His pseudonym was. And\nhe was prewar officer which lived under pseudonym Jan Savada but his name was Batachevsky,\nreal name. And they were reporting that they killed two traitors and they left a short note on the\nchest. This is a traitor, was warned twice and by underground court decisions he was executed by\nAK, which was underground army.\nSo this boy was crying, telling his colleagues that his younger, older brother was killed by\nGermans and that was not true. I knew the truth. He was killed because he was traitor, but\nobviously was not interest of the boy to tell the truth. So a lot of stories which you hear and you\nread not always were true because for whatever reasons, people were hiding the real reasons.\nAnd I saw it again and again and again and there was in all the villages, doesn\u2019t matter age. For\ndifferent reasons people are having second mask, second face to survive and there were different\nmotives but there was a fight for survival. First was life to save and second was to get food.",
        "Q: The trainings that were hosted at your mother\u2019s house, do you remember that and do you\nremember what kind of training?",
        "A: Quite often doors was close and my bed was literally one yard from the door. Door was thin\nand they were talking 1n regular voice. Besides there was a key hole which I could see through\nand many of the voices I recognized because they happened to be parents of my colleagues or\nfriends. They come into my house and they were trained including this execution team.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "Q: Do you remember any of their names?",
        "A: Of the -- oh I remember all of them. All of them because they died you know all of them,\nthere were tons of names I could, I could. And I remember many of them because I knew their\nvoices because I was in their houses and they were parents. Or they were just acquaintances so if\nI didn\u2019t hear the first time when I couldn\u2019t recognize the voice through the keyhole I could see\nwho was there and I knew . And so I knew where the, all the places where the hidden maps were\nfor the manual training officers.",
        "Q: So they hid things in your house as well?",
        "A: In my house. There was at least one dozen of the places. Usually we have two small attics on\nour level which was like roof coming down and there were doors and frame and then was main\nattic and there was entrance from the kitchen. You have to have ladder enter them up in the attic.\nIn the attic and this is related to this radio transmission, there was a metal wire spread between\nthe rafters. One to another one, very dense. And they were wrapped with the fabric where they\npretending to be for drying clothing. The ropes for drying clothing. However they were not used\nfor that purpose. They were used as antenna. So that end of that wire went into the wall, down to\nmy kitchen. And then came out in the form of power socket. But if you plugged the, your\nwhatever, hair brush or you know you couldn\u2019t get any power in there, because there was no\npower. There was, this transmitter was connected when this crew was coming. They had the plug\nand they were plugging in that one outlet entire house which they only knew and I knew is not\nfor power. That was the, that was one of the reasons why coming to our house, because antenna\nthey didn\u2019t have to spread antenna outside. Antenna was already in the house, heated, ready to be\nused, whenever somebody came in and knew that one outlet is the entry to the antenna. So you\ncan plug in and be connected and transmit to London. Or receive from London.",
        "Q: It seems like such a risk for your mother --",
        "A: Huge, huge risk.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "Q: Did she ever give you any explanation of why she saw the risk as worth it?",
        "A: My mother, from as far as I can recall and then reflection of 30 years was what you would\ncall today human rights activist. She very strongly believed in social justice, fairness and she was\na real patriot. She wanted to help the country. Already had huge sacrifice by having our father\nnot to be supporting family anymore, being tortured. And certain point we stop to get letters from\nhim. We believe that he died. So when he showed up in 1945 was a huge surprise for us because\nthere was no communication, no letters. We didn\u2019t expect at all. Basically everybody we buried\nhim and say you know end. And then when he show up we are shocked.",
        "Q: Did you have an actual funeral for him at one point?",
        "A: No, no but it was kind of you know since we didn\u2019t know anything was nobody knocking\ndown but it\u2019s, it was like everybody and our friends and there were at that time we are talking a\nlittle more about that. But still til today, I talked to several of my friends who survive obviously.\nThey didn\u2019t know that my father was arrested and in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Back to the training that they did. What kind of training activities were they doing in the\nhouse?",
        "A: So the training was to pass exams for the officers. How to set up traps, how to put dynamite\non the railroad tracks to explode at the time when German train with German soldiers or tanks or\nwhatever, going east towards eastern front. Trains in our town were very, were narrow gauge.\nAnd it was going to Warsaw and then to another town, Gruyets. So was relatively, 20 miles in\none direction, 20 miles other direction and it was very local, not connected with the regular\ngauge normal trains. But there were trains not far from us and this unit which was training them,\nthey were going different places, having different tasks, including I was witnessing the report\nwhich they had a task, a nearby forest. There was a big opening which could have been turned\ninto the grass field, runway for planes with the big tires which they were able to land and take off\nin the middle of the night so that task was on the, it was a big forest on the outskirts of the forest.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nThese units were guarding whether Germans are nearby here. The other units were starting the\nbonfires on two ends, beginning and end of the runway and they, these planes coming from\neither Italy or some other bases of western \u2014",
        "Q: The allies.",
        "A: Allies. And they were bringing goods, money and people and taking off also, people. This\nway I\u2019m not sure whether it was that airfield. A gentleman whose name was Jan Karsky who\nvisited two concentration camps and then was sent as emissary to England and he visited\nPresident Roosevelt. And he gave eyewitness testimonials, what\u2019s happening in the\nconcentration camps and Polish government in exile was begging both leaders, Churchill and\nRoosevelt to bomb the tracks leading, railroad tracks leading to concentration camps.\nUnfortunately didn\u2019t happen. And this 1s history, there are people who are studying the subject.\nI have my own opinion but this is my own opinion and doesn\u2019t count. But the historians should\nexplain why this information was ignored by both leaders.",
        "Q: So the people who were training in your house and were part of this underground movement,\ncan you go ahead and tell me some of those names?",
        "A: Yes, yes there was father of my friend Wittold Gatt. His name was (thinking). No, I cannot\nrecall it now. You know it\u2019s 75 years.",
        "Q: Who else?",
        "A: But I knew them very, very well. They were, you know I was in their houses all of them\nmany times. And I absolutely knew them. I knew their voices. I could recognize their, when they\nwere other side of the door. And so not every night obviously. I had to sleep but at least one\nhour to two hours, sometime I was just not right to not make noise on the other side of the door\nand I was listening fascinating stories. And I knew so much and I couldn\u2019t talk about that to\nanybody. I couldn\u2019t tell my mother that I knew because she would be terrified. However, just\nbefore end of the war, my -- the gentleman who was doing this training in conversation with my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nmother, they were talking about something about gun and I said yes, I know this was hidden\nthere. They didn\u2019t know that I knew all these hiding places. And I knew how to load the gun,\nthis gun and how to unload it. I knew how to, apart, how to clean it. I knew everything because\nout of boredom nobody was at home. I went to that hiding place what they are talking about to\ncheck whether this gun is still there. I was I self-trained myself.\nSo after the war when German army left certain amount of arms. Whenever you went there were\nall these mines in the fields were a lot of arms here and there. Me and my friends were taking\nthe arms and ammunition. We went into the trenches and there were nobody else there and we\nwere doing full, full shooting like on the shooting range and we knew safely we could manage\nand nobody train us. We were self-trained.",
        "Q: So this was after the war.",
        "A: After the war immediately. And a lot of young people died because farmers needed the fields\nbefore so that army came. The people who are disarming mines in the fields, they wanted to\nplow the fields. And the mines here there and there and you never know where so they were\ntraining mine young people who they were training, paying young people who were foolish\nenough to go and dismember. And a friend of mine, two years, three years older than me, a\nbrother of good friend of mine. I just stopped to think a couple days ago. He was learning how\nto disarm that, these mines. And similar, his friends and their friends were hired by farmers\nwhich was I think cruel to let young people go into the fields.\nAnd they were many of them successful. Some, many of them survived, but some unfortunately\nmade mistakes somewhere or they didn\u2019t know they stepped on a mine which were all hidden\nunder the ground and they didn\u2019t have electronic equipment to detect it.",
        "Q: So your friend\u2019s brother died?",
        "A: Died, died and there was on the day where I was had appointment to see him and his brother\nwere going together. And my mother locked me and I didn\u2019t have key to open. We were living\non the second floor. I didn\u2019t want to jump so when my mother returned I was very angry that she\ndidn\u2019t love me because I lost my ability to play and my mother says yes, yes, I saw Yasho, they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\ncarried him in the bedsheet. I saw him and he was killed and I was shocked, but I could have\nbeen one of them. So I was lucky during the war because every day when we are leaving home in\nthe morning, we were not hundred percent sure that we were going to be back that evening.\nThreat of being killed was very real and so many, many incidences where people were killed,\neither because they didn\u2019t stop when they told to stop. They had something hiding on their body\nor something and they want to be discovered or simply Gestapo didn\u2019t like or they already knew\nthis person or whatever and they were looking for him. Gestapo was in my house many times\nand it somehow happens that I cannot recall one instance where they, my mother was at home\nand Gestapo came.",
        "Q: And you were always alone.",
        "A: Each time I was alone. I don\u2019t know how it happened. They coming during the day. My\nmother was in school. But you know several times they came afternoon when my mother was not\nin school or obviously she didn\u2019t know about that. They never announced obviously. What I\nheard obviously boh, boh, on the steps. Bang,,bang to the door. Gestapo open. So I have the door\nopen and they were walking around ransacking from all the drawers in the middle of the room\nand knocking the walls here and there and they were asking me tell us where these things are\nhidden. Because they had some suspicion but until they found, they couldn\u2019t do anything about\nthat. And I knew where things are hidden. However, I never you know blink my eye and \u2014",
        "Q: Were they speaking to you in Polish or \u2014",
        "A: M, sometimes in German, exclusively and I knew German to that extent. No, I learned from\nGerman soldiers in the streets of Gora Kalwaria. And my mother knew some German so she\ntaught me some basics. It was a survival game. You need to knew how to communicate and they\nknew a little Polish, including, some of them especially the regular soldiers of the Wehrmacht.\nThey were from Silesian region of Poland. They signed so called Folkslist which is they had\nsome ancestors of German origin. They spoke German at home. That\u2019s and it is, how do you call\nit \u2014 they some of them very, I wouldn\u2019t say what\u2019s the proportion. I don\u2019t know but there were\nvolunteers, but most of them they were how do you call it inscripts.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "Q: Oh, they were drafted into it?",
        "A: They were drafted.",
        "Q: Forced, well not forced but \u2014",
        "A: I mean they were obligated and they really didn\u2019t have a choice. So they spoke quite good\nPolish. Some of them they are fluent in Polish and those would communicate with us. So first\nwords which I learned were mostly curses. I could say what, to curse in German for several\nminutes. That\u2019s my first encounter with German.",
        "Q: So after the Gestapo left and your mother came home, I imagine you told her. about it. What\nwas, how would she react, what was --?",
        "A: No, she was shocked each time, but what she was able to do. I mean there\u2019s no, several\npeople asked me how come that your mother was not arrested. And I tell you why. Under their\nmovement which I think it\u2019s the main explanation. A lot of institutions which were, had German\nnames and had to do with the Polish population who had to do with rations. We had, food was\navailable with coupons. You were getting coupons. So many kilograms of sugar per month or per\nweek and one loaf of bread per week per head. These organizations were, had employees which\nare Polish origin and many -- I wouldn\u2019t say majority but some of these positions were infiltrated\nby Polish underground movement. People who secretly worked for Polish underground\nmovement. And they will bring information and early enough my mother was informed there is\nan opportunity to get a document to do the function which was collecting weather, like rain,\nsnow, the amount observation of the sky when the clouds, how low, when sun and she was, she\ngot a book written in German called and every day at certain hours you had to fill. Sometimes in\nGerman, simple words. I don\u2019t remember now but and the numbers. Hours and the amount,\nhow many centimeters of rain that night was and so on. And this information was collected by\nmeteorological service, German, which were used by German Luftwaffe. German military\nefforts.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nThat gave my mother an Auswise, the document which we call it IDcav today was the picture or\nin German and that whenever she was traveling between Gora Kalwaria and Warsaw and she\nwas traveling sometimes to take big round yellow cheese, which she was getting at a very low\nprice and she was selling it in Warsaw in certain place. Sometime that cheese had inside\nunderground documents. And my mother was having in a suitcase. She was very fashionably\ndressed, had perfumes. She knew quite well German. And she was traveling and she recalls one\nspecific case when she was standing on the tramway stop. Tramway came. One section of the\ntramway nor fila Deutsche, was German officer seeing a lady who 1s trying to lift the suitcase.\nSo he helped her to enter Polish section, put her luggage on the shelf above the head and then it\nwent to Deutsche section. He didn\u2019t realize that he is lifting underground army\u2019s literature,\nhidden in the cheese inside.",
        "Q: I bet that made your mother very nervous.",
        "A: That\u2019s the life. Oh yes, but she \u2014 when it happens to you once, twice, and you become\nconditioned and you become less sensitive which doesn\u2019t mean that in my time, although as I\nmentioned in the beginning, children are maturing during the war much faster than you ever\nimagined. And adults don\u2019t\u2019 realize how capable and knowledgeable children are like sponge.\nThey listen. They might not have answers, but they know what\u2019s going on beyond their expected\nmaturity level. So I was nine and ten, ten at the end of the war. But I was like 15, 16 it comes to\nthe survival skills and association, judging what was happening, whether it\u2019s dangerous situation\nor not. Whether my life is in jeopardy or how to read what eyes don\u2019t see, so to speak. There\nwere no newspapers, no radio. Germans were communicating with Polish population by hanging\ntwo language posters explaining you know such and such a day new regulations. You were\nallowed to do that but mostly was not what you were, what is forbidden. And that was the way \u2014\nand there was no excuse of not knowing. You had to know it so you had to read it because your\nlife depended on that, what\u2019s on the poster.",
        "Q: We haven\u2019t talked about the deportation of the Jews from your town yet. Do you have any\nmemories of that?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "A: On the day with de, deportation was taking place, I saw the pictures taken by father of my\nfriend and his name is Adam Marchocki and if possible I would like him to be, I would\nrecommend him to be interviewed by somebody from Holocaust Museum because he is very\nknowledgeable. His father about this period, his house was also facing the wall. He is the same\nage as I am. His father was arrested in Gora Kalwaria. His father was a teacher and was sent to\nAuschwitz also and as well as another teacher, Mr. Piekarniak who was arrested in Gora\nKalwaria and sent to Auschwitz. So those are people whom I knew well. And they were both\nteachers.",
        "Q: Do you know what they were arrested for?",

        "A: Edward. And these pictures are in the book which I couldn\u2019t find just before, I wanted to\nbring that book to show you but I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I have it home, definitely hundred percent. I didn\u2019t\nlend it to anybody. And \u2014",
        "Q: You saw the pictures but you weren\u2019t present for, you didn\u2019t actually see it.",
        "A: Not on the day because there was like two days. I \u2014 a lot of people went to the station because\nthey knew somebody or there was some relationship. People, you know, but most of the\npopulation, although there was Chasidic Judaism mostly but not all there were Chasidic Jews in\nPoland. There were some like his father\u2019s, Mr. Price\u2019s father, parents they were part of the \u2014 they\nwent to synagogue few times a year. They were you know kind of assimilated partially. Some\npeople one leg in one world, another leg in other world and it was for them it was easier to\nsurvive because they knew how hide. This one didn\u2019t have Semitic teachers. He could, you\nknow, got false documents. He could mingle and nobody would know it until some Germans,\nGerman would do what they were doing. Taking a man on the side and asking him to drop his\npants. You know there was a \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "Q: Being circumcised.",
        "A: Yeah, because non-Jews were not circumcised in Poland. There was like exception and there\nwas like a rule. And that Germans, it was for them most last test. But sometime was not\nsufficient. They had you know they all kind of relationships. German to survive in Poland\nlocally, they had to somehow relate. They couldn\u2019t be just suiting left and right. They needed\nfood, they needed labor. The ghetto itself had assignments. The Jewish authorities, Judenrat\nauthorities had assignments. So many people they need for work. Every day different people.\nSometimes people worked two, three times a week. Sometimes were paid a little bit, others were\nnot paid. They all varied but assignment was they needed. So for road work, for some other\nrepairs, for some help with bringing food, here or there. Last was food because with food, people\nwould be stealing food so they tried to separate food from people. But they didn\u2019t have enough\npeople of their own. Soldiers had tasks in the army or they went to the front, eastern front. They\nhad to coexist somehow. So they tried to bribe people by promises. But as you know all the \u2014\nmost of the people who cooperated openly or the Jewish police which was guarding ghetto in\nGora Kalwaria. They were the last one to be packed in the last cart and they were sent to Warsaw\nghetto and then to Treblinka and you know other -- to gas chambers. Germans didn\u2019t feel loyal\ntowards those who were cooperating with them. But at the time when they need it, they found all\nthese people who were willing to cooperate. Those were the times. It was interesting. Let me tell\nyou just one thing. My mother had the observation that in war time is the time when you have\nthe opportunity to recognize who are good people, who are bad people. That among our\nacquaintances, friends, acquaintance of the acquaintances, people who would expect to be honest\nto be fair, to be real human beings, with empathy were surprised. Those were expected, they\npassed the exam so to speak and people whom we treated with thoughts that they are not worse\nto have respect, they became real heroes. Really honest people who so to speak passed the exam\nof humanity. And that was one of the major lessons which my mother and I learned, that the real\npeople you recognize when real test, real need comes in life. That people have different\nrecaniam, different layers and you have really to know the essence of a human person is to\nremove all these layers first. And the war is the time when real test on the characters of the\npeople.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "Q: All right. So",
        "A: So in 1943, during the Warsaw ghetto, before the Warsaw ghetto uprising, I was in Warsaw\nseveral times. My mother was coming, doing some trading and visiting friends. We had some\nfriends in Warsaw and on several occasions my mother took me and we walked along the walls\nof the ghetto. There was a section, I forgot the name of the street, but I could reconstruct it\nwhere the cobblestone pavement of the street, sidewalk on outside street paved, and then the wall\nof the ghetto was almost on the edge of the street, or very narrow sidewalk.\nThe wall on that section was, had no windows and you can see the signs where windows were\nremoved and the holes were filled with the brick. The walls were I would say about 8 meters,\neight yards, about tall. I didn\u2019t see anybody on the top. There were barbed wires on the top, but\nat the bottom where once in a while there were small narrow windows, which had iron bars\ndensely installed that a person, no maybe cat could sneak in but a person couldn\u2019t. But often\nwhen we are in the same area, we saw children\u2019s heads sticking out, outside through that window\nand they were either, they would see quite often people walking on the other side and they were\nshowing that give me something, give me something.\nAnd not far from there was a stand with vegetables, where you can buy carrots, onions, celery,\nsomething which you can you know person can eat raw and on several occasions my mother with\nas little money as we had, were buying couple carrots and I exclusively, my mother was\nobserving when the gendarmes were walking their backs towards, back another one. So it means\nthey walking away and they were not opposite direction and they were not looking at us on the\nsidewalk on the other side of the street. And we are throwing these carrots and these kids were\ngrabbing them and eating them. You can see them. They were very hungry and every piece of\ncarrot was consumed almost on spot.\nYou can see how was appreciated. So my mother, I think she did it for, that she could throw it\nour self, but she was giving it to me to teach me be empathetic and help other children. Children\nhelping children.\nThere was, on several occasions I remember that we are doing. And also my being was our\nstanding on the tram stop. It was like a raised area and in one particular place there was Ulitsa\nPuovska [ph] and there was like tramway place where they were, hangar where there were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nseveral trains were ready to, they were stored there temporarily. And they were before they got\non their routine trip.\nAnd this particular day afternoon, sunny day, a truck comes and there were soldiers come from\nthe cabin and truck is covered and full of the prisoners. And they commanding them to get out.\nThey putting them against the wall and one with the machine gun, kills the entire row. And other\nprisoners are asked, another truck comes and asked to take these bodies with hands and legs. You\nknow one person holding legs and \u2014 to throw them on that truck and they were taking them\naway. After they left, we couldn\u2019t, we\u2019re encircled by the police so we couldn\u2019t go. Some I\nremember some women were putting their hands on children\u2019s eyes not to letting them to see it.\nBut you know kids, even if they always between the fingers or they managed to see it. There is\nno way.",
        "Q: Did you mother try to do that? Did she \u2014",
        "A: She didn\u2019t encourage me, but she was explaining that and strange enough that these people as\nsometime would happening, they were not raising, they were not shouting. They knew they were\nbeing killed but they didn\u2019t shout. Yegshia Polskavoy derolna [ph] let\u2019s leave Poland free or\nsomething like that. They were shouting in Polish. These people, that particular group and there\nwere like a couple trucks came and I don\u2019t, I didn\u2019t count them but there must have been several\ndozen people killed this way. Mostly men that were killed.",
        "Q: Do you think they were, were they non-Jewish or Jewish?",
        "A: I have no idea. I have no idea because nobody to ask, nobody to tell. Who knows? I didn\u2019t\nsee David\u2019s you know stars. I would suspect they were non-Jews rather. But I have no idea.\nAnd after all of that show which was done purposely by Germans to scare people to make\ndemonstration because they could take these people and kill them next to cemetery and bury\nthem. They did it in public places, purposely to spread a fear. To spread the, to tell people watch\nit because if you don\u2019t behave you will be killed as they are.\nThat was the message that they wanted to send and so it was interesting reaction of the people.\nOnce, of the people who were watching that, once -- because we are very close. We are I would\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nsay less than hundred yards from that. Not always every of these prisoners who were killed on\nspot. Sometimes they were moving so Germans were still walking around and they were\nshooting in their head here and there. From the, you know hand gun. Once that show ended the\ntrucks went and police freed us to proceed. Trams were not moving, traffic was stopped for that\nexecution time. There was, I don\u2019t know, maybe 20 minutes, something like that, lasted. Then\nthey restored the traffic and then people were going to the execution place and the walls were\nfull of blood. Blood was in the street, curb where the rain normally goes, how do you call it?",
        "Q: Drains.",
        "A: Drain. So and their behavior, the people who were watching were behaving. Some people\nwere laying down, some people crying, some people were kind of you know touching and\nkissing these places. It\u2019s like holy places. It was amazing that I remember scenes like that in\nspite of being eight, nine, ten years old. Basically nine because ten years old it was already war is\nover.",
        "Q: Do you remember talking about it with your mother and did she have any \u2014",
        "A: It was so shocking for her. You know she saw it. She didn\u2019t ask me what I saw because I was\nnext to her and she tried to kind screen me but I saw, I saw everything and I was like hypnotized.\nI was, I didn\u2019t know when it started and when it ended. I don\u2019t know what hour it was. I was just\nlike \u2014",
        "Q: In shock.",
        "A: Shock you know so the concept of PTSD we didn\u2019t know that acronym. Nobody knew about\nthis, what does it mean at that time, but for young people like myself this takes, you cannot\nforget it. And to the extent that I think it\u2019s not enough of study and knowledge what tragic\nsituations like the war like the memories of human beings treated worse than animals are treated,\nquite often, have impact on the psyche of young people. And I would like to be advocate for\nsome studies to be done. What impact war makes on young people. And I know myself that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nafter, when I go, like I went today with my memories back to this awful, awful times, I am\nshaken. I am shaken now and I feel worn out. And I feel disturbed so much that crying wouldn\u2019t\nrelease that tension. Will not be enough. That\u2019s why I not so easily return to this times and talk\nabout that because it just disturbs me so deeply and that takes me longer time then to get back to\nmy normal mental and psychic so to speak.",
        "Q: Do you have ways of coping with it and getting back to kind of \u2014",
        "A: No, I did a lot in my life. I never been at psychiatrist\u2019s office, not for that purpose. No need,\nbut I did practice a lot meditation, transcendental meditation, Zen meditation. Came today here.\nWe have Zen meditation, here once a week. but I did it every day, twice a day sometimes, just to\nrestore my senses because it\u2019s deeply, deeply disturbing experience just to talk about that. This\nis not somebody\u2019s else story. It\u2019s not a movie which one saw. This is, was my life. My\nchildhood which I basically didn\u2019t have because I didn\u2019t have normal play. I, yes, we did try\nduring the war sports. I was very achieved, hundred meter dash, runner. Javelin champion and\ntriple jump and long jump and high jump and -- were my specialties. Yes, sports helped a lot but\nstill didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know what would be if was not that sport. I don\u2019t know if I had to be just with\nmy thoughts. So yes I did, I recognized the importance of physical movement, being in the\nnature and so on and today I am struggling with my memories. So it\u2019s not easy experience. Not\neasy to talk about that but I think it\u2019s important that other people my age and even younger who\nstill remember what similar experiences they had in their life that it\u2019s passed to the next\ngenerations so wars will be forbidden by law.\nI\u2019m smiling at this point, but people will fully realize the consequences of the war. This is not\nthat only people die on spot, that people were buried, that people lose their members of their\nfamilies. They are injured physically but the injury, the mental injury so to speak which stays\nperhaps even more than one generation.",
        "Q: Do you think it\u2019s affected your son?",
        "A: Somewhat. Somewhat, but I didn\u2019t tell him the details and I hope that when he watches that\nhe will, he will understand me better. Because a lot of things are difficult to express with words.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nThose are the personal experiences which people underwent. And others who didn\u2019t haven\u2019t\nbeen in my shoes, haven\u2019t been there. They didn\u2019t have a fear of losing their lives or their\nmothers or fathers or their cousins or their -- you know friends. They, I can see it\u2019s impossible to\nvisualize. You can be empathetic but it\u2019s a degree to which you can be empathetic. It\u2019s still\nsomebody\u2019s else life. It\u2019s not your life. It\u2019s his life, her life. I think it\u2019s what Holocaust Museum\nis doing, saving for generations is so important. So important because other places there is some\ncentral archives here and there but that needs to be made available for as much as possible,\nespecially younger generations. That\u2019s my hope. That\u2019s my hope.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nNancy Cooey: All right. This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nWes Orlowski. We are meeting today on May 23\", 2019. This is a second interview with Wes.\nThe other interview was conducted in October 2018.\nWes, we ended our last conversation talking about the end of the war but we want to back up a\nlittle bit to talk about your father\u2019s experiences when he was deported to Auschwitz and then\nspent time in different camps.\nWes Orlowski: Yes, so my father was outside of our home about 25 kilometers from us in center\nof Warsaw when he was arrested by Germans, taken to the temporary headquarters where he was\ntortured. They didn\u2019t extract much from him because he didn\u2019t know what they were expecting\nhim to know. And then he was transported to Auschwitz and \u2014",
        "Q: Do you know when that was?",
        "A: Yes. I found the exact date when he was registered in Auschwitz. That was on sixth of July\n1943 so a few weeks earlier he was arrested in Warsaw. In Auschwitz, depending on the period\nof time by, but by the end of war, Germans were more lenient, when it comes to the, allowing\nfamilies, prisoners and prisoners them self to communicate between them self. So we are allowed\nthat by the end of war to send some short letters, written in German and small packages.\nPackages had to be limited in size and weight and mostly vegetables which he had to share with\nhis inmates, that were in the same room where \u2014 the particular one which I visited years, many\nyears later, he was, they had bunk beds in one room. Eleven of them and so when he received\nthe parcel he, as well as if they did, they had to share it with the inmates.",
        "Q: Do you know which barracks he was in?",
        "A: Yes. I have all of that. It\u2019s written on the, I have two letters from my father, authentic of\noriginal letters, written in German -- one from Auschwitz and one from Mauthausen. And they\nare in span of two months. It means shortly before he was deported to Mauthausen and then\nshortly after he arrived in Mauthausen. So my father survived both camps, through several,\nbecause of several factors. One of them he knew some German but he was learning very fast due\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nto the presence -- he befriended some people there who knew German and they were kind of\nself, teaching themselves, so my father was participating in this informal classes. Second, he\nwas relatively healthy. He was entrepreneurial because in files I found that he was listed as a\ngardener. I never knew that my father had any talent for gardening, but he was gardener in\nAuschwitz. And then what I knew was that he had skills as an accountant and they employed him\nin the office for keeping some records, probably you know suitcases, shoes and whatever. They,\nas we know, Germans are very systematic and they were keeping records of everything. So my\nfather survived and they were also, he had some access to the kitchen as a help. And then\neverybody in the kitchen you try to steal as much as possible so you can have food later.\nEverybody was doing that.\nThere are some reports. My father didn\u2019t do that but people who were wearing, carrying bread in\ntheir pockets til the end of their life, long time after the liberation. And they were, you know 50\nyears later but they are still carrying bread in their pockets. You can imagine what kind of the\ninsecurity these people were going and what kind of fears they went through.",
        "Q: What information did your father tell you about his experiences there?",
        "A: My father was telling me how they, he participated in the death march so there were hundreds\nof prisoners organized in groups and they were, with guards, they were chased by foot from\nAuschwitz camp to many, many miles along the streets and roads to the railroad station which\nhad connection with Austria. And then they were packed into the cars and then unloaded in\nVienna in Austria on the -- near the camp Mauthausen. And so I received, I still preserved one\nletter from before leaving the Auschwitz and then I have one letter which was sent to sister of my\nmother. She lives, she lived in Silesian region which was southern Poland, much closer to\nAustria. And that was written obviously in German with both cases there are his numbers which\nhe had engraved on his hand, he mentioned. Also in exact place where he was located at that\ntime, which block, which how they call it here. Block and shtuber, for example. So-\u2014",
        "Q: So he left on the death march in \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "A: And he survived it because many, many \u2014 no it was before the end of 1944. Thanks god he\nsurvived this march because if anybody become weaker, became weaker and neighboring\nprisoners walked with him couldn\u2019t carry him, you know holding his elbows, now he had to be\nleft on the, on the side of the road and last German guard who was passing, he would shoot him\nand then they would leave the body for the rock hole.",
        "Q: But he was strong enough to survive the march.",
        "A: But my father was strong enough and apparently he took care of himself. And one of the\naspects which I didn\u2019t mention was that he became very strong believer in God and was praying\na lot. And he claims that kept his sanity more or less stable and because there were many cases\nthe people couldn\u2019t take it anymore so they were throwing their bodies on the electrical fences\nand electrocuting them self to death.\nMy father somehow was able to survive all these atrocities and later he told me and I\ncomplemented my knowledge by reading more about that. The conditions for, in, for prisoners in\nMauthausen were much, much worse than in Auschwitz. Mauthausen was considered one of the\nmost severe German camps where first prisoners and the camp was set already after the, on the\nAnschluss but Austria invaded 38 I believe. They started this camp in the quarry. They digging\nhuge, huge area of quarries in the side of the mountain to prevent this place to be bombed by the\nenemies\u2019 bombers. And there were the entire parties. The planes they were built there. The\nammunition was put together from the parts. There were, they worked into shifts. Sometimes\nthree shifts, taking turns. The prisoners were very poor. The average life span for the prisoner in\nMauthausen was two months. And my father survived seven months and was liberated in 1945\non May fifth by a unit of US Army.",
        "Q: Do you know what kind of work he was doing in the camp?",
        "A: All kinds of it. They were shifting them so that he was working with the ammunition for\nsome time. Some time he was in the office, bookkeeping again which fortunately the knowledge\nof German by my father, his German was quite good, to the extent that they were employing him\nin the less physically strenuous situations. The worst was for the people who had to push heavy\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\ncarts filled of you know stones or, or where there were not enough people to, to \u2014 So they were\nover extended physically and, and lucky for my father, he didn\u2019t, he hasn\u2019t had to do a lot of\nmenial work. Consequently, he worked, he walked from Mauthausen in Austria to Gora\nKalwaria in Poland. Very early he was able to get on some freight where he was nearby of the\nrailroad station and the freight was stopped and so he could climb the train but was not regular\ntransportation but in 1945.",
        "Q: Did he talk about liberation and his emotions at liberation?",
        "A: Well they are all ecstatic but they were in such a poor physical conditions. They, their joy\nwas limited to the food which they could eat and the stomach problems they had. Because when\nthey started to eat they didn\u2019t know where to end. Then their stomachs were not accustomed to\nhave normal food and plenty of food. So they were really suffering. Many of them, they had\ndigestive problems and so they quickly learning how both the prisoners and the people who were\ngiving them food to be very careful how they transitioned to the normal life.",
        "Q: When your father got back home, do you remember seeing him for the first time after the\nwar?",
        "A: Yes, obviously I remember that. When he came he was dressed in very funny \u2014 because as he\nwalked from Austria, they were able to enter the empty houses which were abandoned by\nGerman population in western Polish territory and so they take some time and the clothing which\ndidn\u2019t fit them or they were you know partially broken or something so he was very funny\ndressed, first struck me. And second his behavior was considerably changed. And to the extent\nthat my mother had made a conversation with him and he went to live with his mother and his\nsister. And eventually my parents divorced because it was very difficult for my mother to raise\nme as a child. I was ten and a half at the time. And \u2014",
        "Q: What kind of personality changes did he have?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "A: Nightmares, short temper. Sometime he can talk illogical statements and there was no, one\ncould not have a longer conversation with him quietly because he is very, the level of anxiety\nwhen he recovered physically, the level of anxiety apparently was increasing. And on the one\nhand he was happy that he was liberated obviously. But on the other hand this life style which\nthey had is -- changed their every person obviously, every prisoner was reacting in different way.\nBut they, they out, their outlook of the world outside changed so radically that they didn\u2019t know\nquite often how to express it.\nThey didn\u2019t understand what was going with them. There were a lot of what you would call\ntoday PTSD, was not known at the time. But all forms of that kind of trauma was engraved\ndeeply. It was, it was not enough time to really rest and recover for them. So they were still\nliving so to speak, awaking in the morning. And they were surprised that they are, don\u2019t have to\ngo to work for example.",
        "Q: Do you think later in his life he found ways of dealing with it or coping with it?",
        "A: He must have because he started another family and eventually had two children. But I\nhaven\u2019t been in the close contact with him at that time, at the end of his life. He lived til the age,\nhe was 79 when he died. He was born 1905 and died in 1983. And I\u2019ve been to his grave but I\nhaven\u2019t seen him the last many years before his death. I was in United States already then\nbesides, for many years.\nSo to return to my, to our life in 1944 we became refugees. And \u2014",
        "Q: What does it mean, you were kicked out of your home or \u2014",
        "A: We are told to leave our home, in the short notice. Entire town and neighboring villages and\nthe whole street along the Vistula river. And the reason was that we live on western shore of the\nVistula river and on eastern shore Soviet army approached chasing Germans. And Vistula river\nbecame the border line, between two armies, German army and Soviet army. And our house was\non high shore of Vistula River, easily visible from the other shore of the river. And the snipers,\nhow do you call them. Sharp snipers with their lunette they could see any moving object and\nthey were shooting. So we were for a short time we are living in our house, but we had to go\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nwith our head down and almost crawl because we could easily be you know shot like that still in\nthe home. And --",
        "Q: Where did you go?",
        "A: So we went with two suitcases and my cat coming in a bag on my neck. We walked and then\nwe, for about several miles. And then eventually we hired for a small fee a farmer with his cart\nand horse and several families to share that vehicle. And we went to one of the villages where\nwe rented a small place in the barn. And then we rented one room in the house. And then we\nwanted, went to another village. And that were where Polish underground fighters from Warsaw\nuprising. Was 1944.\nWe kept them from helping them to change dressings on their wounds. And they after a few\nweeks they left. They were taken by other units of underground movement during the night. But\nnearby there was a big artillery unit, German. And there was aiming obviously towards east\nagainst Soviets. Then certain day in the morning we see they are turning their guns aiming to the\nwest, 180 degrees reversal and we were completely shocked. Well what\u2019s -- they will be\nshooting their own units. Then we realized that they were ready to defend against the encircling,\nwhich took place. The Russians broke the front. At the beginning of January. Eventually the\nliberation of Warsaw took place on January the 17\", 1945.\nBut before that these German units which were in our neighborhood in the countryside, they\nwere aiming towards west. They are not shooting at that time, but they were aiming towards\nwest. Because Russian army already encircled them from the, from the west. The only open\narea where they had is towards Warsaw, towards north. So they eventually put the stuff together.\nThey hooked their artillery units to the trucks and they left towards north. I don\u2019t know what\nhappened to them.\nWhether they were caught in, in encirclement or they were able to successfully to go west.",
        "Q: Did you return home at that point?",
        "A: At this point we were free to go home and we, around the time of liberation of the Warsaw,\nwe came with our two suitcases to our home and our home was really plundered and whatever\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nwas able, people who were stealing the items and they did a good job.\nI have to admit and they were barely found any belongings. Including the front door where we\nare approaching our house, we saw a gentleman or gentleman, there was you know, who my\nmother knew. He was carrying on his back front door of our house so my mother told him you\nbetter leave it here. And, and he dropped the door, apologized because he didn\u2019t know whose\nhouse was it and he didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t put it back on?",
        "A: And my mother was his teacher so he recognized my mother as a teacher and anyhow. After\nthe war, life, we were all ecstatic obviously but there were huge shortages of everything and\nfood was the most important. The farmers which were all around did their best and to feed their\nfamilies and have something to sell and feed us, you know people living in this small town. We\nquickly started to grow food in a small garden. I was one of the main providers there. I learned\na lot of skills at that time.",
        "Q: What were you growing?",
        "A: Well all basic vegetable root, root vegetables. Which we have good soil because chemicals\nunknown were getting manure from farmers. My mother was coping herself and helping\nchildren. A lot of children were behind the regular program in Polish language, math, biology,\ngeography \u2014 all the basic subjects in the grammar school. But my mom was_ doing tutorials at\nhome. After the classes, regular school classes. So these children on the way home they were\nstopping by and you know not many, two, three, one sometime. But quite often there was\nsomebody in my house where my mother was teaching. And these children were, most of them,\nthey were children of farmers and there was a voluntary agreement. And they were bringing\neggs, a small can of milk and homemade cheese. A chicken sometimes live, sometime killed but\nfreshly. So we are trying to survive because stores were empty at the beginning.\nAnd, and also there was shortage of cash. I mean whole organization of the life you know it\ntook many months. People could function in their normal so to speak normally.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "Q: How did her job change with the communists in power?",
        "A: It\u2019s a very interesting question because my mother and, and all her colleagues they were\nprewar teachers. So they knew the program and they had, some of them they saved the books or\nmade copies of the books of prewar. They were not accepted officially by the communist\nauthorities because they were specially history books you know. In math or biology you cannot\nchange much, but history books they were no, no for the communist times. The communist\nauthorities. So a lot of teaching was based either from these fragments of the books which were\nleft by, saved by the teachers.\nOr from their memories. Or teachers were teaching one another Some of that, depending who\nwas behind the pack, who was unofficial and they were kind of the -- between the real facts and\nphantom history which communists wanted to teach.\nAnd the history as the older people knew. History is not only what is in the books but what\u2019s in\npeople\u2019s memory, especially older people\u2019s memory. So there were very difficult times. My\nmother was very involved in the teachers union. Before war she was participating in\ndemonstrations in Warsaw. But after the war there was obviously the teachers union, labor union\nwas penetrated by communists. They were open or secret agents. So we need to learn quickly\nwho to speak to what extent. We had to learn how to read between the lines what\u2019s in\nnewspapers. We had to learn quickly not to believe official propaganda. We have to learn\nquickly how to, man or woman, a radio receiver and how to listen to radio Free Europe or BBC\nfrom England. Radio Free Europe stations were located just over the border in west, in eastern\nGermany. Several transmitters on different frequencies and to learn that the Polish authorities\nare having radio stations on the same frequency located in Poland which does, were sending\nhuge noise garbled up and noise mechanical noise which the purpose of that was just to squash\nthe regular signals coming from Radio Free Europe from Germany.",
        "Q: What programs do you remember listening to?",
        "A: Oh there were all publicity programs. They were interviewing interesting people and they\nwere you know \u2014 we, at the beginning we believed whatever was said then because it was so\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\ndifferent and refreshing what was the official propaganda. Gradually we started to learn how to\nread and listen with some criticism and \u2014",
        "Q: To the BBC and Radio Free Europe.",
        "A: To the BBC and Radio Free Europe. They were a different type of propaganda as we learned.\nAfter some time.",
        "Q: Was that in English?",
        "A: No, in Polish. Everything was in Polish. No, no it was directed to Polish population.",
        "Q: The BBC was also.",
        "A: But, but authorities were chasing it so people were doing very secretly in the evening. Not too\nloud so neighbors wouldn\u2019t hear but a lot of people were doing. Even those who claimed to be\ncommunists and believing in theory of communism, we learned later they were listening to these\nradio stations as well. So \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019m sure you had neighbors that you could trust and neighbors you couldn\u2019t trust.",
        "A: Yes, yes. During the war, from the very beginning my mother had a saying that real friends\nyou recognize and distinguish from so called friends where the people have to do the sacrifices\nand people have to go beyond the comfort zone. So the people are \u2014 many of our neighbors\nwhich we had thought was not, were not very highly about them, they appeared full of\nsacrifices, ready to take their last shirt and give you if you need it. So to speak, symbolically.\nAnd people who we had high esteem appeared not worse you know opinion so to speak because\nthey became either selfish or they became agents you know and they were ready to spy on you\nand report to authorities. So learning whom you could trust and to what extent was one of the\nmajor skills, human skills that one had to learn.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "Q: Did those neighbors change at all after the communists came to power? Were certain\nneighbors who you could trust during the war, could you no longer trust them after the war?",
        "A: This was an interesting process. There was a dynamic process. And to the extent that these\nthings are written and I witness the situations like that. People who were discovered by the\nPolish underground movement during the war, that they were cooperating with Germans and\nthey were caught and proven, they were taken on the side somewhere in the, outside of\neverybody\u2019s view and they were shot and killed by the special units of Polish underground\nmovement and it was very obvious reason. To give a lesson to rest of the society that it\u2019s not the\napproved way of behaving.\nPlus they had to be removed because they are doing so much damage and so many people lost\nlives because of the people like that. So yes, they were, there are all kinds of the behaviors. There\nare people who were indecisive that then became very cooperative. People who were cooperative\nand they change their mind and they became selfish. There were trial periods for everybody.\nEverybody was certain way exposed and tested. And there was nobody basically who could stay\nin their comfort zone and stay unengaged in any way.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s switch topics and talk about your education.",
        "A: Yeah, so my education started from self-education. So when my mother was giving tutorials, I\nwas sitting playing with my toys in the other room. Doors were open. I was on the floor and my\nmother didn\u2019t know that I am absorbing everything what she was teaching there like a sponge.\nTo the extent when I was ready to go to the first grade, teachers who were examining me, they\nsaid no you can go to second grade and you are, you know more about that. So my mother\nherself was surprised but I went to the second grade and from the, from that second grade to the\nend of my high school, I was always to the last class, I was always a best student. I had the best\ngrades.\nHowever, in the last two years of my high school there was an older than all of us, young man\ncame and he was studying in the seminary for priest. And he knew Latin like nobody else. He\nknew French like nobody else. And he was good but not as good as I was. But I had quite a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nproblem because I was accustomed to be the best. There were all kids who were coming to me\nwith you know problems to solve or something. I was helping. I was not selfish. I was very\nhelpful to other students.\nHowever in that last just before graduation I had problem with competing with this young man.\nAs I said he was four, four or five years older than us and he had so much schooling in that\nseminary so anyhow. To get, I graduated from high school in 1952, the same year I applied to\nWarsaw Polytech to the department of electronics which was a direction, well 1f young men ask\nolder men where he should go and the movie Graduate I believe you would say plastics. At that\ntime it was electronics was a popular direction everybody wanted to learn about electronics. And\nwe had competitive exams. I went through that. I started studying in, 1t was 11 semester\nprogram. There was an experimental program where we couldn\u2019t get a BS, bachelor of science.\nWe had to go for a masters. So in one chunk without interrupting there was the first course of\nthat entire college.\nI had to go and for master\u2019s degree. So after almost ten semesters, when I was done with my\nregular study at the class, where it was the time to write dissertation, myself and two of my\nclosest friends, we started to work in industrial institute for telecommunications. And was semi\nmilitary institution but was a lot of work there for civilians. In our case we are doing parts for\nradars which were later installed on commercial ships and ocean going ships.\nSo they were, when I was writing my dissertation, I had to do a lot of translations from literature,\nnot only in English but in French and I was fluent in French at that time. In Russian, in Italian,\nand obviously in Polish so I had to be in, from the technical translation point of view, fluent in\nfive languages.",
        "Q: Did you learn all these languages in school?",
        "A: Some of them in school but like French I was learning, we started \u2014 my first exposure with\nFrench was in a two workers working for Germans in the shop which was repairing, it was 1943,\n44 my father was at the beginning of \u2014 they were still visiting us from Warsaw. But then he\nwas taken to Auschwitz. That didn\u2019t prevent two contractual workers from France. One was of\nRussian origin and the other was of Polish origin. I remember even names. Stanislaw\nMalinowski and Nissinger. Mr. Nissinger was a, had a background. His ancestors were white\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nRussians, those who were murdered mostly during the 1917 revolution in Soviet Union. So he\nand his family escaped to Paris. And he was educated there so he was fluent in Russian and I\nremember he was talking a little bit of Russian to me, both of them talking French and Mr.\nStanislaw Malinowski was knowing Polish but kind of the broken Polish. So an interesting\nconversation at the table. They were bringing me some food with them. They were cooking\ntogether. And they were for example first time I ate frog, the frog legs. Fried on butter and so\non. And they were delicious but I wouldn\u2019t eat them today.",
        "Q: Did they make you catch the frogs?",
        "A: They, I went with them, I show them where they are and they were catching them. I knew\nwhere they were, where the frogs were. So that was my first exposure with French. Then my\nmother\u2019s colleague, teacher of the French. It was 1944, 45 and 46. I was coming to her home\nand helping her to, with the chores, household chores and she was speaking French exclusively\nto me. She wouldn\u2019t allow me to speak Polish. So I was quite fluent. I didn\u2019t know much\ngrammar but I was fluent in everyday talk. I, you know, simple sentences. And eventually I was\nlearning in school grammar. So when I graduated high school I was good in Latin, four years of\nLatin, four years of formal schooling, high school in French. And the learning Russian caught\nwith me only in college. First time I had to go which was unusual. My times, most of the high\nschools and regular schools had to have Russian. Somehow my school, my high school omitted\nor they were able to avoid teaching that. They didn\u2019t have teacher and it was not popular,\nRussian.\nThat was very helpful for me. French, but English I started to learn preparing my dissertation\nbut it was very, my master\u2019s degree dissertation was 56, 57, 58, 59 I graduated. Officially 59\nwith master\u2019s degree from Warsaw Poly Tech.",
        "Q: Did you have any mentors at that time?",
        "A: Yes. I had one of my colleagues and we happened to live in dorms in the same room. Oris\nLati and I asked him a lot of questions. He had dictionaries to I got informal tutorial. Cause my\nfirst English self-taught words were the pronunciation of them, I found it in dictionaries. I didn\u2019t\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nknow how to pronounce the words so I knew what they meant but I had to see them first before\nor basically I could comprehend.\nThere was everything helpful until the -- all my life foreign languages were saviors and I was\nmany time in my life, I was lucky. I would say. Among other things I was in right place, right\ntime. That was part of the luck. But I developed the skills for languages and also human skills. I\nthink coming from the training during the war and after the war and balancing acts which we had\nto all of the time, whom to trust, to what extent and how to build relationships and friendships\nand how to value real relationships, the real friendships. Those are the skills and you cannot\neasily learn or cannot learn at all in school.",
        "Q: Tell me what life was like going from a relatively small town to Warsaw which 1s a very \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s a very good question because this is a big \u2014 I would assume that this country would be\nsomething of similar nature. Small cities, small towns are in the kind of the dream certain way.\nEverybody knows everybody. They have set of expectations you have to follow. In big cities\npeople disappear. They don\u2019t really care for neighbors anymore. They can be on same corridor,\nhave doors and they don\u2019t say good morning to one another. They pretend that they don\u2019t, they\navoid other people. This is not the case.\nWarsaw at that time had a lot of population coming from smaller cities and from countryside. So\nthese people brought a culture of small town, plus the experience the older generations you know\nof the war. People were much more friendlier, helpful, paying attention one to another, not being\nafraid to look into other people\u2019s eyes.\nWhen I came to this country one of the first warnings I was told not to look into the eyes of\nyoung men especially. Being a young man because that\u2019s considered as a challenge. And can\nend up in being beaten up.",
        "Q: Do you think you were misled by that?",
        "A: I never experienced a beating in this country but I, observing other people I think that this,\nthat was not bad advice. To be on cautious side, not to be too trustful and direct with people, too\nfriendly.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "Q: What advice did your mother give you when you moved to Warsaw?",
        "A: My mother being born in the countryside and then living more years in small city, didn\u2019t have\nmuch to offer in the sense of practical how to behave. More helpful was to have some friends,\nacquaintance of the acquaintances or have pupils or her coworkers who moved to Warsaw so I\ncould not to live with them, but I could come sometimes for advice for some \u2014 these times there\nwere huge problems with supply of basic goods. So having friends, acquaintances, always allow\npeople to ask for favors and give favors. For example if I was walking in the streets and I see the\nline of people in the front of the store because there\u2019s not enough room in the store so people are\noutside, long line for enter ____._:- Forty people stand in line. Most of the people what they do\nwithout asking, they will first stand up and take the place in line. And then they started to ask.\nWhat do they give here? If notice that. Not because you are paying with money obviously but\ndelivery was just coming. Truck came and was delivery of toilet paper let\u2019s say. So you\nwouldn\u2019t buy two or three or a small block of paper. You bought 20 or 30 toilet papers. And you\ntook a string. You put them through this string and you make like a \u2014",
        "Q: A necklace? A garland?",
        "A: Like garland and you are hanging them let\u2019s say three times around or four times around your\nhead and you are walking in the street like that which looks funny. Right, but you are not alone\nin the street. And then you came home and to your good friends you sold them half or whatever\nyour supply. So everybody was trading with everybody else and life was full of activity. Nobody\nwas bored because to survive you had to be industrious, active, working with others, helping one\nanother. Not to be afraid to ask for help but also be ready to give a hand or to share your goods\nwhich you received and you consider yourself lucky.",
        "Q: Did you have any interaction with the Jewish community in Warsaw after the war?",
        "A: No\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "Q: Or did you have classmates who were Jewish?",
        "A: Only in Gora Kalwaria. And those are the people who incidentally are recorded already for\nthe US Memorial Museum cause I was listening to their testimonials. One is Mr. Henrik Price.\nAnother one is Mr. Kartman. Another one is Mr. Mayevsky.",
        "Q: And did you know them?",
        "A: Yes, I knew them quite well. One of Mr., especially Mr. Price was working some social\norganizations which together with my mom in Gora Kalwaria, in 50s, 60s so I knew him. I knew\nhis family. And he had one daughter from Gosha and she\u2019s one of the three people I am going\nto recommend for the museum to interview. Mr. Price and the others are, died. Mr. Price was\n101 years when he died. It\u2019s amazing.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t have any classmates who were Jewish when you were going through college\nor your master\u2019s program?",
        "A: Several.",
        "Q: There were several?",
        "A: Yeah there were several but as it happens, many of them, they had Polish names and they\nwere not either they were converts or they were coming from mixed family where the mother\nwas Jewish or father was Jewish but had Polish name. So several of them I was friendly and\ncertainly only after I became friendly I learned that they were Jewish. Or had some Jewish\nbackground. Poland was the country where there were all kinds of the experiences and this is not\nthe place now to tour. This is a longer story but people of Jewish origin were involved whole\nspectrum of activities. Some of them they were part of the communist establishment. Some of\nthem they were against. They work in underground army. It, the origin, ethnic origin was not\nenough to make any judgement depending on how these people were behaving. What they were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\ndoing. What they are doing some good for the environment for where they live, where the\npeople were living. Or they were involved in arrests you know and other not popular causes.\nSo it\u2019s, 1t was a judgmental call each time. Yes, but I have several friends, good friends who\norigin, Jewish origin, including the other friend of mine who came from France and where he\nwere part of the French underground movement. His brother became the owner of the major\ncircles in Warsaw and this friend of mine taught me how to make coq au vin. It means chicken\nin wine, how to cook. Chicken, chicken.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: His name was, it just escaped me at this moment. I will recall it.",
        "Q: When did you finish your master\u2019s program?",
        "A: In, I got the diploma which is dated 1959. But the program itself most of, I would say\nmajority of my colleagues graduated. It was not a one day of graduation. We are doing when we\nhave done with our masters. Most of us were already working because we are strip of money.\nWe couldn\u2019t support ourselves so we were looking for jobs, working as young engineers and the\nsalaries were poor but if they allow you to survive and that\u2019s what counted. I didn\u2019t have my\napartment. I stayed in Warsaw. I couldn\u2019t travel to my work in Warsaw from Gora Kalwaria\nbecause there was narrow gauge train which took almost one hour and a half, like one hour and\n20 minutes one way. So I had to live in Warsaw. And \u2014",
        "Q: What was your first job out of school?",
        "A: My, after the college. My first job was in that industrial institute where I was doing research\nwork, experimental research work with the behavior of semi-conductor devices in high\nfrequency electromagnetic fields. In, there were big dimensional rectangular in cross section\ntubes in which the electromagnetic signals were sent and this semiconductor devices were put\ninside and they were you know measurements you know how they were detecting that and all\nkinds of \u2014 it\u2019s based on the really cutting edge science. One of the funny things is which\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nprobably many people in the west didn\u2019t know that there was an embargo on the communist\ncountries and normally you couldn\u2019t get most modern equipment and for electronic engineers,\nhaving good like today you have a computer. At that time in 50s you had to have an oscillator.\nAnd one of the best oscillators in the world was American Techtronic\u2019s and we had the most\nmodern electronics which were embargoed by US. How it happened.\nThere were go between in Switzerland which for cash they would sell you this equipment but\nwhat they would do, they would mechanically remove the serial number on that so that nobody\ncould trace it back who sold to whom. So it was a lot of equipment which we had in our labs\nthrough the purchasing agents which were having cash with them, they went to Switzerland,\npurchased them and brought them to, behind the Iron Curtain and we have the most modern\nequipment.",
        "Q: What brought you to the US?",
        "A: Fulbright Fellowship.",
        "Q: When did you receive that?",
        "A: In 1970. I applied in 19 -- I was working then at the Polish Academy of Sciences in one of\nthe institutes, two institutes I worked for Polish Academy of Sciences. One is in a short time was\ninstitute of basic technical -- I don\u2019t know how to translate it. Another one of the, was called\nelectronic institute of technology and \u2014 electronic technology. What I am doing support research\nbecause I did not have the PhD and unofficially I have advanced work towards PhD,\nexperimentally but I didn\u2019t start the course work yet at that time\nSo there was the work in that institute. Then I worked for a company which was managing\ncommunication in air corridors. So we are in charge of radio beacons in the corridors,\ninstrumental landing system. I was in charge in several responsible positions. One of them was I\nwas in charge of installation of the first instrumental landing system in Okenche international\nairport in Warsaw. There was 1962 I believe. It was one of the first instrumental landing system\nestablished in eastern Europe. And it was a British equipment pipe. That\u2019s where knowledge of\nBritish English was helpful.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nLater when I was working and had a little bit of time, my work day was ending usually at 3. For\nanother hour or two I was working another job with the same institution which was paid\nseparately. And there was a research for some companies and I had another job which was a\ntranslation of the aircraft manuals, civilian aircraft, from English into Polish. And I have to you\nknow, I hand written then. I have a typist who was typing it. My conventional type all electric,\nmaybe she had.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a lot of pressure to have to \u2014",
        "A: Yeah and I was doing it the evenings and the weekends and weekends and it requires a lot of\ntechnical knowledge. It is not just your regular English. It was not an easy text and so I have to\nconsult with the engineer and aircraft engineers sometime and that it was, it allowed me to save\nenough money to buy apartment in Warsaw. Finally I made enough money to buy and I got a\nbank loan, obviously the mortgage for that. When I left for United States in 1970 my mother\nmoved from her apartment to this apartment and I was sending her some money to finish paying\nthat mortgage and then I paid it to the end and became the owner.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll take a break.\nNancy Cooey: Ok, we\u2019re back. So you were going to tell me about the youth organization that\nyou were part of.\nWes Orlowski: Yes. In 1952 where I, when I entered college literally everybody with the\nexception of one or two students and they had very strong reasons why they didn\u2019t have to be\nmembers of this youth organization which in the name was like union of Polish youth. That was\nthe official name in Polish, but what it meant is it was a communist organization. It stayed, over\nthe years the communist party which again was not called in Poland communist party. They were\ncalled party of Polish workers. That\u2019s what was the official name. Everything was camouflaged\nand what not called by name. But the youth organization was like preparation for the activity in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nadults party which was elite of people who had responsibility but also access to the special\nprivileges, which involved purchase of the 1tems which were not available for common people.\nBehind so called yellow curtains and because they had yellow curtains in the windows. From the\nstreet you couldn\u2019t see if there was a street level, what\u2019s inside, but you have special ID and you\nentered. For very nominal prices you can get, almost like in the west full variety of goods.\nSome of these younger activists were members of the communist party and member as well of\nthe youth organization. And I had several of those on the, at my first year of college. They were\nsons usually or daughters of communist activists.\nIn my case I had several colleagues who were children of the communists expelled from\nBelgium and France and they were sent to Poland. For their activities, communist activities.\nThey wound up in Poland. They had children and these children got without the exam special\nexemption. They became the students at the elite best of the best schools. One could get. And\nthey were my colleagues so to speak. And we had ROTC exercises like every Saturday, had to\nwalk to the field and pretend that you are shooting or whatever. Not every ROTC. Again for\nboys only. Girls were excluded. But anybody who had two legs and two hands and two eyes\nwas, had to be a member. And there were no exceptions. In that communist organization during -\n- there was in March I remember of second semester in the college and a studying diet. And there\nwas a huge demonstration of solidarity and memorial in the front. There was a big podium and\nall the officials, first secretary of the workers party. You know and all of them, they were on a\nbig podium. And we had to walk, the long walk and there was borders on this sidewalks. There\nwere activists with the bands on their arms, marking they are activists of the youth organization\nand they were boarding so nobody could run away from that march.\nSo we had concentration places where we gathered. The lists were checked. Everybody had to\nmark you know with his name with red. And there was marking if he\u2019s present. No school whole\nday wasfora ____.. It was snowing. And there was not good weather. Anyhow we gathered\nthat and then in orderly manner we had to walk in the front of these officials, waving to them\ncheerfully.\nAnd then in the somber kind of the mood because we are all in --",
        "Q: Mourning\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "A: Mourning death of our leader so to speak you know. The leader of the communist world.\nThere were over even one, actually make small digression. One of my colleagues was close to be\nexpelled from the college because privately he said to another colleague in dorms that oh this old\nman finally kicked the bucket or something. You know a relatively pejoratively he said\nsomething about Stalin. Somebody was listening to it, one of the -- reported to communist party.\nThey made like a judgement, big court case almost. Professors were sitting, students and he was\ncalled you know and had to testify and there were you know like and finally few professors\nbecause he was good student and good human being, he was not, he was not fired. Last result\nbut I remember all this show, all this drama and that was so ugly that, that but it shows incredible\npower of communist party on everyday living at this times you know, 1950s in Poland. In\nWarsaw.\nSo when I was participating in that march, the beginning of March 1953, we had our work to do,\nyou know classes to prepare and we didn\u2019t have time to walk. I mean we hated that. So I walk,\nwalk, walk and there was first opportunity that there was staircase from the elevated road going\ndown. Myself and 20 other colleagues tried to escape that.\nBut we wanted to do it all of us at the same time and we blocked the entrance to that staircase.\nMeanwhile this activist they -- several of them, they pulling out people who were trying to\nescape that. And one of them was a big guy bigger than me and I couldn\u2019t beat him because there\nwere, he had a lot of friends there. I would have been beaten there. So he requested my ID card.\nAn ID card was from the youth organization so I gave it to him and he didn\u2019t return it to me. He\ntook it with him. And he said you will come to our headquarters in the district and you will find\nit there. I didn\u2019t go there at all. I learned shortly after from a friend of mine who was activist he\nchecked. They couldn\u2019t find this, my ID and then later I learned that I was expelled for, from the\norganization. For misbehavior. So I was very, very happy. I couldn\u2019t publicly show my joy. I\nonly from the best friends, I shared. But nobody knew that I was expelled or the officials or the\nother members of that, they were \u2014 I still had to come to the meetings but I couldn\u2019t show my ID\ncard. So I said to them, my ID card 1s in the headquarters so they ok, ok. But then I stopped to\ncome to the meetings. I don\u2019t have ID card. Nobody cared and I was liberated from any official\nparticipation in, in the communist organization.",
        "Q: Did it negatively affect you in any way?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "A: No it has no impact. Just my satisfaction, my satisfaction. Yes, and I was expelled because I\ntried to escape from the funeral so to speak of Stalin and you know they caught up with me and\nthey took my ID card. I was you know penalized so to speak but I didn\u2019t cry. I was very joyful.",
        "Q: It gives you a little bit of pride maybe.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So do you want to go back to leaving Poland in 1970 and arriving in the US.",
        "A: Yes, as it happens because of my age. I was 19. I was 35 years old, 34 when I interviewed in\nAmerican embassy. Very rigorous interview, in our language obviously. And what I was doing,\nresearch and I was not member of any organization since that when I was expelled from the \u2014\nusually I never was member of the communist party, of this workers thing. I was not involved so\nthat was probably helpful and they were interested what I was doing in my research. I had to\ndocument everything and, from my supervisors and all of it. And I was sent home and they told\nme they will notify me soon and there was no word for many, many months. I went on vacation\nnext year.\nI returned from vacation. That was August 1970 and I was told that I was approved and I should\nleave in two weeks. So I had two weeks\u2019 time to put my ducks in a row. Make order in my desk\nand leave the work which I was doing with somebody else and for one year I was traveling from\nmonetary \u2014 for one year I was allowed to buy the ticket. I believe I bought the ticket or was\noffer. I don\u2019t remember at this moment. But the Fulbright fellowship was extremely low. When I\narrived in United States, I barely had enough money to pay one room in dorm like situation. But\nit was private house where I shared the house with ten other students, one kitchen, one\nrefrigerator. Maybe one or two bath, two bathrooms for 11 people. Walking distance to the\ncollege and I had to skip some meals in cafeteria because I didn\u2019t have enough money. There\nwas like 300 something dollars per month, for to pay my dorms. Tuition was paid obviously.\nCause I couldn\u2019t pay tuition from that. But I remember going to McDonald\u2019s was a luxury for\nme. I couldn\u2019t have afford. I had to buy bread, simple foods. Do my own sandwiches for lunch.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nEat very simple breakfast. And for dinner was big treat to go cafeteria and have a simple meal.\nSo it was really, really you, you hear that somebody 1s on Fulbright fellowship, maybe now they\nare paying them. But for us, when I arrived in 1970 was so discriminatory and, and awful my\nfellowship. I learned later from boys from India, from other countries who came, it was\nunbelievable simple life style. What I had to endure.",
        "Q: So you arrive in Wisconsin.",
        "A: Wisconsin, Madison and engineering department. I had a, I had an advisor, professor in the\nelectronics department who was of German origin and I had interesting conversation with him\nand he invited me to his house. His mother was a real German, old class of German and she\nasked me the questions which were, I am ashamed to repeat because she asked me what, from\nwhat Poles I come. From these German Poles or the Russian Poles. She didn\u2019t know that Poland\nwas independent country and there are Poles, Poles. Not German Poles.",
        "Q: Was he in Germany during the war or was he in the US?",
        "A: No, she was. Yeah, I think he was completely educated in this country and born in this\ncountry probably but his mother was you know old lady in her 70s, 80s in 1950 so you can\nimagine she was born at the end of the century and Poland didn\u2019t exist at that time. But she\nacknowledged it and that was one of the curious points.\nAnyhow, by mistake I learned it later. I was put on the regime which was very unusual. There is\nthis science, this gentleman, the professor who was my guide so to speak. And then there was\none like student advisor for the entire university. They applied a wrong paragraph from some\nregulation book. I was treated as Soviet diplomat. I was not a diplomat. I had passport which I,\nyes, there was not my private passport. Passport was the property of the government. When I was\ngoing to return to Poland, I had to, next day to return the passport because passport at that time\nwas not my document. It was official document of the government. Although it\u2019s my\nphotograph, my \u2014 but anyhow, they applied this new rule by mistake. I learned later. So what I\nwas told that I cannot leave the town, Madison, Wisconsin. Unless I report two weeks in\nadvance and I have distant cousin in Chicago. So I was not able to go to Chicago from Madison,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nWisconsin. Unless two weeks in advance, I present a plan, whom I am going, when I am going\nto leave, whom I going to see, what\u2019s the phone number. The name, data of the person I am\ngoing to see. Very detailed plan to supervise me basically. And I couldn\u2019t go anywhere else.\nKind of the prisoner in Madison, Wisconsin.",
        "Q: So you would have to submit these documents to your supervisor",
        "A: In advance to the supervisor for the entire university. And then get approval and after getting\napproval I would be able to go and also report after I came that I came on time and all of it.",
        "Q: Even if you wanted to go just outside of Madison city limits?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t test that. I didn\u2019t because I was told not to move so I didn\u2019t move. Although I have to\nadmit, I yes, I was invite by two girls with birthday party and their parents live outside of\nMadison, but not far. And I kind of you know bending my back and hiding and almost I got into\nthe car and nobody knew about that. So I am not sure whether I committed crime at the time or\nnot. But mostly likely not. But, but I was afraid. I was afraid so I was trying to fulfill the \u2014",
        "Q: How long did you have that restriction?",
        "A: The restriction was to the very end. At the very end was another professor there of Polish\norigin. And he privately told me when I asked him why this is sanction. He checked with that\nand he being the professor they told the truth. That they realized that they applied wrong\napplication but they you know what they can do. I mean they couldn\u2019t restore my full freedom\nbecause it was all over. I stayed another year because meanwhile I met interesting girl who\neventually became my wife and we became friendly. In the library. Of, of the college, of the\nuniversity and so I applied to my employer in Warsaw, the Polish Academy of Sciences through\nthe institute which I was employed for a leave without pay for a year. And they granted this\nthing. After some delays they granted, so I stayed for another year. I was able to \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s your second year in \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "A: It was my second year and I did some research. But mostly I was working because I, I was\npoor and I didn\u2019t, and I couldn\u2019t pay my apartment. I couldn\u2019t pay you know food. So I was\nworking through the mutual acquaintance I working in some of the institutes of the, the\nuniversity. So I was able to stay with my fianc\u00e9e at that time. And when I returned to Poland in\n1970. It was 70, 71, 72, in summer sometime, my fianc\u00e9e joined me few months later. She came\nfor a month and we got married in Warsaw in Warsaw royal castle which was during the war\ndestroyed, but one small wing was left and there was a civil marriage cert -- there was an office\nwhere you could have civil marriage conducted by officials and get the document. And we had\nsmall reception there. I invited friends and family. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have to have a second marriage in the US?",
        "A: No I didn\u2019t because my wife received a document which we took to the American embassy in\nWarsaw and the stamp, had new name in some end of the passport, an addition. And that allow\nme, allowed her to use the different name because at the beginning she was using hyphenated\nname. Her maiden name and her married name and then eventually she dropped them. She 1s\nusing for many years now only this. Because it\u2019s more convenient.\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that because of the agreement between the governments, US and other\ncountries signed an agreement that if US is going to grant Fulbright fellowship, these grantees\ncannot apply for US citizenship or even for green card. And I was only you know I did time was\nstarted to be counted from the day of the departure of this guarantee from the US. So when I\ndeparted what counted on me that\u2019s several months I was in Poland and there were supposed to\nbe 24 months period. So in spite of being married to the US citizen, I was not able to be with my\nwife. So they recommended what they, that I will go to Canada, let\u2019s say. And she will come to\nCanada or, stupid restriction. Henry Kissinger was Secretary of State at that time. So this was\nrestriction by State Department which was the one which was issued the Fulbright Fellowship.\nObviously I had to write the report, the Fulbright center report for Fulbright Fellowship\ninstitution and then write report for my institution in Poland.",
        "Q: So how long were you in Poland?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "A: Several months. And I had to you know I had to apply again to get without pay and I was\nhoping to come and return to work on my PhD and so on but things after arrival to United States\nand joining my wife, I, I came to visit her on a tourist visa. I couldn\u2019t get another visa and I was\nrestricted to six months. So after six months I had to go back. So we applied, applied to our local\ncongressman for an exception and then waiting several months, I was were granted, I was\ngranted an exception and I could apply for green card first. I waited for that and then for\ncitizenship which I became quickly. US citizen.",
        "Q: So did you get your PhD eventually.",
        "A: No, eventually no. On my interests were changing gradually. And I became, I realized that the\nresult of my research 1s not used for the purposes I believe. I became more, the equipment which\nwas used for civilian purposes but also for military purposes. And that was becoming difficult for\nme. I became more thinking a line of Quakers which I met a lot of Quakers and I became Quaker\nabout 30 years ago. And that changed my life in many ways. My wife and my son are Quakers.\nWe are very active in Great Barrington.\nSo you know views change and I was changing to. I was as I call it going forward. Instead\nlooking back. But my past is very colorful and you had a lot of difficult times which I had to\novercome in many ways. And enjoy every day as it comes instead looking too much in the past.\nThere was too many things in my childhood and in my early age, including as I often say I was\nable to survive two totalitarian systems. One German occupation when police had to pay\nattention. We in Poland we didn\u2019t use the word Nazi occupation as it\u2019s used over in this country.\nWe were saying German occupation because it was Germany was occupying, not Nazis. Nazis\nwas a party that took control of Germany, but there was Germans. Germany couldn\u2019t conduct the\nwar without support of majority of the country. And the sons and daughters were dying on\nbehalf of Germany, not Nazis.\nAnd I wanted to emphasize it again and again because it\u2019s a very strong falsification of the\nhistory. This is not the way history 1s being seen in Eastern Europe. When I hear there was a\nNazi occupation of Poland I am getting kind of the goose skin, because when I was leaving home\nI would have been killed by a German soldiers or you know Gestapo. I didn\u2019t care whether he\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nwas Nazi or not Nazi. Nobody in Poland was really paying attention to whether it as Nazi or not\nNazi. My father was tortured and taken concentration camp was not important for him whether\nNazis or not Nazis. He was beaten, kicked and, and was losing teeth because of beating and not\nbecause you know Nazis or not Nazis. He was beaten by Germans. That\u2019s a very strong\npowerful point for me but I wanted to make it because there is so much of distortion of the\nhistory. Only eyewitnesses can tell the truth. And all historians who didn\u2019t experience that they\ncan have all kinds of the fantasies, they can write all kind of the things, but we in Eastern Europe\nwe learned how to read between the lines and what\u2019s the truth and what\u2019s the falsification\nafterwards.\nOne of the reasons I am giving this interview 1s I want to present the facts as they were at the\ntime, not as they are being seen from the perspective of 50, 60, 70 or 80 years. Because there is\nno substitute of living facts. Experiencing on your own body. And there 1s no, there is no\nsubstitute for oral histories. I think what the museum 1s doing is extremely, extremely important.\nTo have eyewitnesses. Yes, they might be sometimes colored by individuals but, but they are\ngiving a sense of the times.\nYou cannot publicate what I am saying here. Those are all my personal experiences, or they were\nthrough my friends, my family, whom I trust. They were not told to me by somebody,\noccasionally at the -- you know bar drinking beer or whatever. So they could be colored by\nsomebody being tipsy you know or purposely distorting the truth. No, those are the facts you\nknow. They are part of my life in living memory.",
        "Q: Did you and your mother talk about the war afterwards, in the years afterward? Did she \u2014",
        "A: No we never had like sit down and try memorize. It was a lot of conversations where we\nreminiscencing or trying to figure out why things took the turn where they did because there\nwere mysteries, quite often. I mean there was things happening, people were disappearing.\nPeople were behaving the way we didn\u2019t expect. You know the conspiracy of the underground\narmy and other -- there were other anti-German organizations in Poland which were not only\nlinked to the Polish government in exile in London which was really we considered the one\nwhich represented Poland and having rights to say something on behalf of Polish nation. There\nwere other organizations. They were you know millions of Poles who were in hush and they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\ncreated the whole army. This an agreement between Stalin and Polish general. The name\nescapes me now. It\u2019s Anders, was general who was commandant of the Polish army in Russia,\nin Soviet Union. But \u2014 Sikorski, General Sikorski whose plane disappeared near Gibraltar\nshortly after taking off. Very mysterious situations. A lot of things indicate that his plane was\nsabotaged and he was downed and so were basically you know attempt, not only attempt,\nsuccessful attempt to kill him because he became inconvenient. There\u2019s no proof who did it.\nWho did it either. British or Russians. He became inconvenient.",
        "Q: Do you think you would have returned to Poland had you not met your wife?",
        "A: We had, we were married in Poland and then we lived in \u2014 we both worked for Yale\nUniversity. We had different plans than life dictated to us. We were both kind of because when\nPaula returned, my wife just returned from the research in Latin America. She was working\ntowards her PhD dissertation. We had different interests and most likely inclining to live in\nEurope. I had some contacts. There were two possibilities. I have relationship with organization\nin Canada where I would work and we had connections with my family and acquaintances in\nBelgium, possibility was France. We were both you know fluent in French. We were open to\ntravel, working different places. We were, you know world citizens. We are not necessarily. But\nthen my wife\u2019s parents both became ill in different way and her father died in the 70s. Her\nmother died in our house in Great Barrington in 90s. So we had to take care of them and we just\ncouldn\u2019t afford that. And my, our son was born in 1982 and so there was you know work,\nstability. We had to, needed and we had to put our roots so to speak in some place. Our son was\nborn in New Haven. As I said 1982, but 1989 we moved from New Haven to Great Barrington\nwhere we purchased a piece of land, built house. By you know craftsman and to house three of\nus, my wife and my son plus his mother. And we took her. she eventually not eventually, before\nwe moved to Great Barrington we are taking care of her mother who lived next door almost to\nus. She had the beginning of Alzheimer and then we were taking care of her in Great Barrington\nand she died in 90s.",
        "Q: What were you doing at Yale? What was your employment there?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "A: I was doing the, I was head of the electronic design lab. Was reporting to the deputy provost\nfor science, sciences and doing custom made measurement equipment for different departments,\nlike astronomy, physics, coming and placing orders with us. And we were doing, it was the\nbeginning of the chips and, and computers. There were mini computers, small computers because\nthere were PDF 11 already at that time which was like a big refrigerator, big refrigerator really.\nAnd those are many of them in NVA department at Yale. However, people needed custom made\nlike you would call it laptop with special features today, much more primitive than today\u2019s\nlaptops you can imagine.\nBut anyhow there was 70s and we are pioneering the work of custom made. I remember the\nCPU units the heart of the computer coming in the book where was it was cellophane. It was\nkind of glued to the page, the rigid page and you had to cut it out and you know find the\nappropriate sockets for it and then build everything from with the resistors, capacitors and there\nwas iron, hot iron you know and solder. You were building it on the printed board. Those are the\nelectronics, basic electronics at that time. So there were interesting times. My interest gradually\nwas shifting, when I was already at Yale, towards the use of the alternative sources of energy, I\nwas interested in solar wind and micro, micro, hydro small hydro which you can install in\nstreams you know you don\u2019t need big river for that.\nSo I started with a friend of mine who was graduate of Yale School of Architecture, we started\nan organization called ATAG, appropriate technology assistance group and we are giving\nconsulting to the individuals and organizations which were interested in using like windmill or\nhaving solar collectors which were very expensive at the time, not like today.",
        "Q: When did you start that group?",
        "A: That was beginning 80s. We were in 89 when we moved from Branford, Connecticut to\nGreat Barrington, I was already doing several projects from utilities like United Hluminating,\nthose east utilities, doing commercial energy audits for industrial facilities and the residential\nunits, specially those which were exclusively heated and air conditioned, using electricity almost\nno gas, no oil. Just electricity. Because they were huge hogs of electricity so this is the, utilities\nstarted with these houses and, and buildings which were exclusively supplied with electricity.\nThat was huge, huge savings and make a big indent in the consumption of electricity.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nWith the benefits for the facility users as well as utilities because they didn\u2019t have to generate\nnew power which was consumed by these customers. So happily we have lived here for 30 years,\nalmost 29 and no 30 years already. This year is passing 30\" year and we have a lot of projects.\nHopefully health would allow us to continue them. And just a few days ago turned 84.",
        "Q: Happy birthday.",
        "A: Thank you. My wife is much younger than me, almost ten years and we are full, our son is in\nBoston doing a lot of interesting things and hopefully we will be useful for society as we are\nnow. We are very involved in the local organizations. And we are active in town. We are active\nin our Quaker meeting here. We are volunteering. Sometimes small projects. We are being paid\nbut mostly we are volunteering. Before because taxes are very high in our town. Probably we\nwill have to soon get involved in organizations where we will be reimbursed for our time\nbecause we cannot afford any more to be exclusively volunteers I mean without getting paid so\nwe will volunteer somewhere to get our taxes lower cause in spite of discounts and some rebates\nand whatever, this town is offering, our taxes are huge for a property like this.",
        "Q: But overall you feel like you\u2019ve led a good life.",
        "A: I felt that I did a lot of my life interesting things. I don\u2019t mind to share my experiences with\npublic at large so to speak. And it\u2019s a lot of things to be learned from other people. One of the\nmost shocking things for me to find when I arrived here in the United States in 1970 was the lack\nof the appreciation by younger, appreciation of the other generation and their experience by\nyounger generations. The gap between certain age groups is I think very damaging for society\nand culture as it is. And societies as they are, are losing a lot without consulting what they are\ndoing with the older generations. And I think it\u2019s a huge mistake, culturally. I think huge mistake\nin educational system that schools are not encouraging older people to come be tutors. The, you\nknow younger generation, they think they know everything and they know better and they have\nno respect of older people.\nSo they gap between grandparents, children and especially grandparents and their grandchildren\nis in my opinion unacceptable. That needs to change because it\u2019s a question of survival of, of the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nnations, of people as they are and not to speak about environment which needs to be respected.\nBut I would start with the restoring the bridges, crossing the bridges which are huge, huge gaps\nbetween the generations. It just I\u2019m sure it change in Poland as well, but this was not my youth\nand not my middle age but I was growing up. The respect for older people was much higher in\nEurope. In general in Poland. The family links were much stronger and friendships and\nintergenerational communications and the respect and just spending time together and talking,\ntalking about how was it. To learn something from that. Not to repeat the same mistakes. Again\nand again. And I am observing that too many there are many things would be, could be avoided\nif younger generations were more open learning from older generations. That\u2019s my main\nmessage which I would like to convey to younger people.",

        "A: My father was born in year 1905 and my mother was born in 1910. So and they were, my\nmother came to town as I said from southern Poland which used to be called, before 1918, before\nPoland regained its independence was called Galicia which was part of the Austro-Hungarian\nempire. Those who know history will know that Poland didn\u2019t exist on the maps for about 125\nyears. And when it regained independence in 1918 was made up of three previously partitioned\nparts \u2014 Prussian on the west, Russia on the east, and Austro-Hungarian Empire on the south,\nwhich included Galicia.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "A: My parents met most likely if I can recall it well, in the post office of Gora Kalwaria. My\nmother was a teacher in nearby village. And my father at that time was working in the post\noffice. My father was a bachelor at that time and he had great ease of communication with\npeople so I am not surprised that they met. They married in 1931. I have beautiful picture\nshowing their wedding and I was born four years later. My father was an accountant. He worked\nin the bank for some time and also in post office. And my mother was grammar school teacher.\nShe was really gifted and praised by many parents for her exceptional human skills and ability to\ncommunicate with children and motivate children.\nSo my first memories were started with the age about three. When my father was assigned a job,\ntemporary job outside of our town and I was sent to the store and I already at that time had a\ngood sense of humor. I was kind of the cracking jokes which I believe were told to me and then I\nthink I remembered, but I\u2019m not sure which 1s it. My first major shocking experiences were\nrelated to the war because in 1939 at the beginning of September, when Germans were bombing\nPolish cities and they attacking Poland from the west, Warsaw was attacked relatively early by\nbombers. And although there was only 20 miles between Warsaw and Gora Kalwaria, German\nbombers apparently made mistake and they were looking for military objects. They bombed the\nresidential part of our town, although there were military barracks on the other end of the town.\nThey were all made of bricks, covered with the yellow shingles made of clay. And from the air\nthey could have looked identical to the big hospital area which was next to my house. So they\nmade a mistake and they dropped several bombs and one of them landed very near of my house\nwhere family of 11 people, escapees from Warsaw were hiding in. The escapees from Warsaw\nwhen they thought, they saved their lives by running from Warsaw. However, German bomb\ndropped on that house killed all of them, ten of them were killed. Only one person was saved.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",

And then was\ntraveling mostly by foot. Sometimes working as a handyman on the way to earn some money for\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nfood. But it took him 11 and a half months by foot to get from Siberia back to the area which he\nlived near Warsaw. Meanwhile, all his property including quite an amount of land was\nconfiscated by Russians so he had to start his life from square one.\nHe managed to have two children, a boy and girl which were raised by somebody else because\nhe became ill and he died very shortly afterwards.

        "A: Just returning to my father, to my grandfathers. They came from an impoverished nobility of\nmedium kind of the level they had their own coat of arms and everything was recorded and my\nuncle was keeping these records which unfortunately were destroyed.\nOn my mother\u2019s side. My mother came \u2014 my mother was raised on a small farm in the\nmountains. She I would call it, she was a mountaineer. I was visiting this area many times after\nthe war and I met all her cousins. Family was rather big and when my father was born he was\nthe oldest. He had three sisters. My mother had one sister and four brothers. And there were two\nor three who died because of the illnesses of the time and bad medical care obviously. So it was\nI would say strange combination of the history of these two families and I have to admit that my\nparents were not the best matched couple, as I see it, especially from the distance of time.\nHowever, I loved my both parents and when my father was arrested in 1943 in Warsaw, he was\ntraveling between Warsaw and Gora Kalwaria often, and trading with different items. One of the\nmost important items he was trading was golden coins because those who know life in Poland,\nduring the occupation they would know that everybody was trading, even children. There was\neither barter or cash. Everybody knew value of everything else. All was illegal. Germans\nabsolutely didn\u2019t allow trading unless it was sanctioned by them, by stores which they would\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\napprove and you have to be either confident or some other, doing some other functions, useful\nfor Germans. Or the trades was illegal. And, but everybody was really smuggling to survive.\nJobs were very scarce. Food was difficult to obtain. Even if you had money, you couldn\u2019t enter\nthe store and buy what you wanted. So my mother was an early \u2014 when my father was traveling\nbetween Warsaw and Gora Kalwaria, my mother was very involved in social movements. My\nmother was involved in the trade union, the labor union, teachers labor union. She was\ndemonstrating in 1937, 8, I know from her memories. I was too small to remember that. There\nwere demonstrations for higher salaries, for better working conditions and so on. Partially\nsuccessful. During the war my mother relatively quickly joined underground movement which\nwas led by Polish government in exile in London. It was pro-western, it was called Armia\nKrajowa [ph] in English. Actually 1t was AK in English was national army. Yes.",
        "A: Before war, my mother was teaching grades one to five, I believe, four or five. And she was\nteaching all basic things. Usually teachers on that level they didn\u2019t have specialty so she was\nteaching history, geography, Polish language, less sciences. However, during the war, Germans\n-- it was very lucky that in our town there were somehow more liberal. And we had two schools\nand each was \u2014 had classes one to seven. However, what I heard at the same time in different\nparts of Poland, they were allow, the classes were only from one to four. And obviously they\nwould allow teaching history, geography, anything which would enlighten people. They wanted\nPoles to just read and write and do the basic calculus. They didn\u2019t, the all middle schools, all\nuniversities were all forbidden.\nHowever, there was a lot of underground schooling. There were regular classes in people\u2019s\nhouses. Some of them denounced, people were arrested. Torture sometimes. There were all kind\nof sanctions, but many, many of the schools because of the solidarity between the people.\nEverybody was interested having the children educated in spite of German restrictions.\nMost of the schools I would say survived and there were all different levels. Diplomas were\ngiven. Exams were passed. It was just very normal and popular for -- and people were chipping\nin, in different ways.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nFor example, the parents of this \u2014 for example my mother was giving tutorials after the regular\nschool hours. There were, different kids are coming different days, different hours to my house\nand my mom was teaching them, helping them to catch up to the level which was expected and\nthere were either less talented or they had harder conditions at home. Parents which are\nuneducated and they couldn\u2019t help them with homework. So my mother was fulfilling that role.\nAnd well she was paid with real goods, usually food. Like farmers cheese, homemade bread,\neggs, carrots, onions, chickens sometime which was already plucked and ready to cook for soup\nor whatever.\nSo we are relatively, relatively and there were periods of time when there was shortage of food,\nwhere there were no tutorials and they depended on detention and what was happening outside\nwhere, especially at the beginning of the war and just before the end of war, when they were first\nuprising in Warsaw ghetto and then Warsaw uprising of 1944 which were major upheaval for the\nWarsaw and the near surroundings where we lived.",

        "A: Before war, yes. Oh you\u2019re talking about before war.",
        "A: Yes and no. There was some talks but most of the population were kept in the belief and that\nincluded Jewish population. I mean all citizens were kept under belief that 1f Germans attack. It\nwas considered a, such a possibility, French and English are going to attack from the west\nbecause there were international agreements signed between the governments who were the\nwestern powers declare that if the Poland is attacked they are going to attack as well.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nHowever, what we learned later and obviously Hitler and his intelligence services had very good\nrecognition of the mood and plans which French and German had and that\u2019s what I learned was\nlater obviously when I was four, five, six years old I didn\u2019t know that. But I knew it shortly after\nthe war. Germans kept 92 percent of their armies in the eastern front and there were absolutely\nvulnerable from the west. And Poles, Polish army and civilians were defending Warsaw for\nseveral weeks. Warsaw was encircled by German army but there were organized resistance.\nThere was some w, ammunition and arms to protect Warsaw against the German army and it was\nvery harrowing defense. However Germans had superiority in the air. They were bombing and\nthey had superior tanks so in spite of the barricades and all these fortifications which were built\naround the outskirts, on the outskirts of, of center of the city, was conquered after several weeks.",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s very good question because what happened here. After the first bombs were dropped\non Gora Kalwaria, there was real -- start to be just somewhere else. Germans are attacking them.\nThey come here eventually or maybe Polish army would defend them. Maybe French and\nGermans would attack from the west. The whole resistance was hinging on that promise cause\notherwise Poland realized it, its population realized that they didn\u2019t have any chance because the\nGermans who had huge amount of the very well, well trained, well equipped, quite modern arms,\nartillery, airplanes and so on.\nAnd so what happens here that my parents at the very beginning, after the first bombing,\norganized a group of families, perhaps was six, seven people in that group, plus the owner of the\nbig truck, Mr. Victor Balitzky was his name. We packed our belongings within hours. Packed\nour belongings on the top of the truck and we are running towards Russia to escape Germans.\nOn the roads and roads were narrow, whole traffic was mostly towards east. And there were\ncolumns and columns. Sometime trucks which were rarity. Small cars also rarity. Mostly was\ncarts pulled by horses and people loading their belongings and there were columns as long as you\ncan reach by eyesight. What German fire, the planes were doing. They were running along,\nflying along these roads and from the machine guns and also small bombs they were dropping on\nthese convoys. So whatever it would have and we could distinguish between Polish aircraft and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nGerman aircraft. There was something different. And my task on the top of the truck was to look\nto the west and watch and listen for the sounds and I was the one who was bringing attention of\nthe adults and then what people were doing, they running quickly to the left and the right side\nleaving truck in the center of the road. And they were hiding in between the potato or rye or\nwheat you know whatever we could \u2014 or trees if it was nearby. And we\u2019re sitting there waiting\nuntil they go away because they came for a couple of minutes and they were gone and then\nmaybe next time, whether it will be the same day or maybe three times next day. It was nothing\nregular or they are not \u2014 unpredictable. This way we reached Russian borders which was Soviet\nUnion at that time but we called it Russian. And since Russians enter Poland from the east on\nSeptember 17, we were at that time in Russia already, not deep.\nAnd we are ordered to go back towards west, towards Poland itself which was still Poland but it\nwas already occupied by Russians that territory. And not many people know that the Russia took\nmore territory in 1939 or September than Germans took before that. However the population\ndensity was much higher in the western territories which were eastern territories. Also eastern\nterritories had much more minorities and so and Russia started to resettle Poles to Siberia, or to\nwest, Kazakhstan, towards Siberia. They had to, were less organized than German but they had\ntrains which were equipped with pig, with cars adapted to transport pigs. There were no\npassenger cars.

        "A: How, you know what\u2019s a child\u2019s reaction when he sees front of the plane going towards you\nand kind of the almost aiming at you and they were coming very low sometime so when they\u2019re\ncoming low we are definitely out of truck already, but was very, very scary experience and one\nwhich you cannot forget til the end of your life.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "A: They were scared by themselves so you know this is the time when children mature much\nfaster than their chronological calendars. During the war my father was already in Auschwitz.\nMy mother was part of this underground movement and during the day quite often when she was\nat work, my house looked normal. There was nothing unusual but on occasion, once every week,\nevery two weeks on an irregular basis, we have a crew coming to our house. Crew, and those are\nthe members of the same underground movement which my mother belonged and they were\ncoming with the radio transmitter, receiver in pieces.\nSome of the pieces were hidden in our house. Some of -- they were bringing and putting\ntogether in minutes literally and they are starting communication by Morse code with radio base\nwhich was located on the outskirts of London.\nAnd they are communicating forth and back, sending information which 1s coded also besides\nthe Morse code. They were also using some coded, so it was not easy. However, Germans knew\nabout these stations, that they exist. However, they couldn\u2019t easily find them because they are\nvillages, small towns. They couldn\u2019t be everywhere all the time so my task was that as soon as\nthe station was ready to go, I was told to go outside, although I remember some time the Morse\ncode I can hear it today (sound effects) are the key. My task was to go outside and I had friends\nwho were fulfilling similar role, although some time they were, didn\u2019t know all the details,\nbecause we didn\u2019t talk among our self, all the details for obvious reasons. And was to look for\nthe German, they look like a pick-up truck today, but it was a low truck, small truck, which\ndipole antenna which, the antenna which allows to determine from which direction signal is\ncoming, from that station. So to determine where is exact location of that station, of the\ntransmitter, they had to have two measurements from different angles. And then on the map they\ncould identify very exactly which, almost which house, that this transmitter was located.\nSo my task and my friends\u2019 task was to detect existence of this German trucks nearby and notify\nmy mother one to another one were standing on the corners of the streets. So within seconds my\nmother knew there is a truck nearby. And my mother was running inside of our house and telling\nthe crew. They were taking apart that radio station, hiding whatever they could, take the rest of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nthem and they obviously they are not running around the streets. They are going in the back of\nour house, through the orchards. Orchard to orchard. Orchard to orchard, never going through\nthe town itself, but on the outskirts, through the dense whatever the forest and usually there were\nno Germans in this area. Besides they knew exactly where the concentration German where\npolice headquarters. When they come into town they knew exactly where to go and not to go.",
        "A: Fortunately, not even once we detected this truck at the time when a radio station \u2014 yeah, I\nsaw these trucks but at that time there was never that station in my house. So we were lucky.\nThis same crew which came to us several times, we learned they were shot when they were\njumping through, were escaping and they were machine gunned. They were decimated, all of\nthem, two or three were coming to our house when another crew was coming. But they were\ndetected and killed in some neighboring small town.",
        "A: Yes, they were going from town to town through different places on irregular basis,\nunpredictable for anybody else but they have their own system will allow them to coordinate\nwith the house owner and having this system of people who were protecting them from. In this\none case the system failed obviously and they were killed.",
        "A: Yes there was, my mom was very friendly with the principal of the school at which she was\nteaching and his wife was teacher as well. And this lady, she was the head of that women\u2019s\ndivision in support of other girl fighters cause my mom didn\u2019t have, she didn\u2019t train. She knew\nhow to shoot but she was not really specially trained. And there was not a role for the women.\nThere was mostly role for men. The women had a lot of supportive roles. One of them, for\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nexample was, and there was, as a part of underground movement, but also as the interest of my\nmother. Because as a teacher she had a lot of Jewish kids as her pupils. By average, her classes\nwas around 50 percent of the kids were Jewish, before ghetto was created in 1940. For, and it\nexisted for about half a year. So my mom had a lot of good acquaintances, I wouldn\u2019t say closest\nfriends. But a lot of people who respected her and from both religions and including Orthodox\nJews who, many of them they were sending their kids not only to cheder, Jewish school, but\nthey sent them to the public schools, to the Polish because they were doing business.\nMost of the stores in our town were Jewish owned. There were excellent relationship between\nboth religions and as I mentioned no accidents. So my mom was involved and at the very\nbeginning there was a lot of smuggling going between Warsaw which was the biggest center\nwhere you could get food. Or from countryside farms, to the ghetto in Gora Kalwaria. Ghetto in\nGora Kalwaria was very unusual because it did have sections with the barbed wire fences.\nHowever specially during the night, the traffic was unbelievable. That somehow people were\nable to bribe the guards which were part of Judenrat organization which was set up to\ncommunicate between Germans and the Jewish population.",
        "A: Jewish with the bands on the arm, civilian or semi-civilian dressed but during the night was\nlike a shift and I had a friend who had the, his house windows were looking at the ghetto fence.\nAnd I had to pass, my house was located less than half a mile from border of the ghetto.",
        "A: Piarska, Pewsitskago [ph]. They are descriptions of that. For example, I \u2014 a good friend of\nmy mother is a gentleman who died recently. His name was Henrik Price. Here is article about\nhim. And I was admiring him. He ran away from ghetto. And there is one recording in\nHolocaust Museum which you sent to me, the -- you are there, and his, the general\u2019s name is\nFelix Kartman. He describes in much better, in greater detail than which I wouldn\u2019t be able to\ndescribe what was going on inside because I was not inside Polish of non-Jewish, non-Jews were\nnot allowed to enter.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "A: So one of the tasks my mother took and also she was assigned later officially by the\nunderground movement was to find people who would be actively involved in smuggling food to\nghetto, either from country side by her knowledge of the farmers who were parents of the\nchildren which she was teaching at the school. Or people who were traveling regularly or\nwilling to travel to Warsaw and bring some items which were not regularly available locally.\nAnd there is too many names to mention here, but they are people still alive, my peers or people\nwho are already recorded in the archives of Holocaust Museum, like Mr. Felix Kartman and Mr.\nAvram Henrik Price. There are You Tubes, they are very detailed interviews with him. He, I\nwas -- my mother was on very good terms with him. Last time I visited him about ten years ago,\nand I spoke to his sister a couple weeks ago by phone. This gentleman died in the age of 101 and\na half. Unbelievably strong physically and mentally. He describes his life in great details and\nthere is so much to be learned about his life and the life of other people.",
        "A: My mother worked with him after the war in different organizations. But my mother knew\nhim and he knew both my parents because I talked to him about my father especially from before\nwar. He knew my father quite well. So \u2014",
        "A: As I mentioned, the non-Jews were restricted. They couldn\u2019t, they were not allowed to enter.\nSo but, through mutual friends and mutual acquaintances there was quite good communication\nand again, in spite of German regulations, people tried to conduct normal life. By normal life I\nmean people are working in ghetto. People are trying to preserve food, to sell items. Everybody\nbelieved in the ghetto that this just, just temporary solution, that they would be resettled in a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\ndifferent place. They would be saved from \u2014 people didn\u2019t want to admit that this is any of kind\nof the organized massacre and they are going to be killed. Everybody had hope and as you well\nknown that kept people going and living because once you remove the hope from human beings,\nthe whole life doesn\u2019t make sense.\nSo obviously there were moments when people becoming depressed or they stop to be positive\nand optimistic, but there was role of others to keep the spirit alive and so there were all kind of\npreoccupations, including small theater, singing groups, educational aspects, organizations were\ngetting together and having discussions.",
        "A: Inside, everything inside the ghetto and unbelievable overcrowding. People were living\nsometimes eight, six, eight up to ten people in one room. Incredible. And but this gentleman like\nthe three people whom I am well familiar and I knew them, was Henrik Price, Felix Kartman and\nHeinrich Mayevsky.",
        "A: Those are the people who were able to escape, hide and they were able to survive and they\nreturned to Gora Kalwaria after. Out of three, around three and a half thousand Jewish people\nwho lived in prewar Poland, that\u2019s were people who were able to \u2014",
        "A: Not in my age and not my classmates. But they were like friends of my friends. A lot of\npeople who I knew because of my parents\u2019 acquaintance being there. Or there\u2019s very interesting\nstory. My, one of my three or four best friends -- they live in this, closer to center of town. And\nthey had a house with several rooms. My friends and his last name is Ptak, Witold Ptak.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",

        "A: His name is Witold, W-I-T-O-L-D. Witold. I was quite often visiting him.And one of the\nreasons was that his grandma was doing excellent white barsht which is like made of it\u2019s like a\nsour dough soup, kind of, I don\u2019t know how to translate it even in English. It\u2019s made of the\nsourdough bread which is added some aging, you know like you make kefir. Ferment. Went\nthrough the process of fermentation. So to get the essence of that I was coming to their house and\nbringing empty bottle, like one liter bottle. I was paying for it, whatever was asked. And then it\nwas like a broth for making a soup. Potato was added and one of my (part of our?) when my\nmother was in school I was doing the cooking. I was preparing dinner. And my mother and \u2014 I\nwas six, seven, eight year old but I was preparing dinner. My mother came from school quite\noften and either dinner was ready or not much left to finish the dinner.\nSo this, my friend\u2019s uncle which was brother of his mother\u2019s, mother\u2019s brother. He fell in love\nwith a Jewish girl. At the beginning of ghetto when she was surrounded and she was forced to\nresettle and live in that ghetto, she escaped, like a lot of people did. But not high percentage.\nAnd she, and it was interesting that people who were escaping from ghetto, they either tried to be\nin countryside which was easier to hide. Living with a farmer like this gentleman, Henrik Price.\nHe was adopted. He got the false document and he was adopted by a family of farmers who had\nson of similar age who didn\u2019t return from war. He was part of the Polish army and he didn\u2019t\nreturn. And this family adopted Mr. Price. And \u2014",
        "A: She, when she escaped from Gora Kalwaria, she went to another ghetto in a small town on the\nother side of the Vistula river. There was no bridge so you have to be, there was some special\npeople who for a fee they took you in a small boat, one p, two persons, three people that could fit\non that ferry so it was just basically like a major canoe. And a long stick and that\u2019s the way they\ngot on the other side of the river. The river was quite substantial and you could get in troubles if\nyou tried to swim across. Anyhow so she went to another ghetto which was much more liberal so\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nto speak, much easy to get in and out and so on. And then again she escaped from there because\nhe was able, he was working at the cemeteries of smaller towns and he found on the grave a\nname of the Polish woman and her name was Yanina, fitting the age. He went to the priest and\nhe got falsified document for the name of Yanina, I forgot the name.\nAnd she was under that name til they got married, this couple but meanwhile there was not the\nend of this story.\nMeanwhile she was sent under the falsified name and there was Jews, not as much as non-Jews.\nThey were sent to Germany to work on the farms because Germans were short of manual, menial\nworkers. And so a lot of Poles, depending on the historian, but their calculation at least one\nmillion Poles worked on the farms in Germany during the war and were obviously all forced.\nThey were paid a little bit, tiny bit, given food and shelter and many of them survive. And to the\nextent that the family of bakers who owned the bakery, German in the small town, they loved her\nso much that they were being ordered. They wanted to give the bakery to her. However she\ndidn\u2019t want to stay in Germany. She returned after the war to Gora Kalwaria and she married my\nfriend\u2019s uncle. Her name is Salome, or Solika they called her, her real name and again I forgot\nher real last name. But they had two children. They have children again and my friend was\nbaptizing.

He was\nof Polish descent. She was of Polish descent from Poland. They married and they settled in\nBelgium and they have two daughters and I visited them after the war several times in Belgium.\nNot from our town. Somehow if they were, I was not familiar with them, a small percentage but\nI heard there were many, many others who went and they return. A lot of people in our town\nwere in hiding. I wouldn\u2019t say majority, definitely not. But in my family one of my cousins was,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nmost of the German occupation he was just hiding.

        "A: It was Warsaw itself. So when he was arrested barely anybody in our small town knew. Only\nthat he was arrested, only because he was not often coming to Gora Kalwaria.

And yes, she did and so after\nthe removal of the ghetto from Gora Kalwaria, as you can imagine a lot of real estate left there.\nThree thousand people were crowded but it was a lot of empty housing, which Germans didn\u2019t\ncare because they were not specially high quality housing. They are not office buildings. They\ndid confiscate my school and they keeping their hospital, they keeping for certain time school for\nGerman children, families. German officials who were in town. And then there was in a hospital\nfor German prisoners who were returning from eastern front and I vividly remember they were\ngetting off the train and they walked through the town and how they were wrapped around up to\nsometimes barely their noses that were sticking from the bandages around. There were people\nwho were the soldiers who were returning from Stalingrad when Germans were, Russians\ndefended them self and then was part of the \u2014 from the defense mode they started to press. And\nthere was full winter. Germans absolutely unprepared to survive Russian, Siberian type of the\nweather. And many of them they lost parts of the body, noses, ears. They were all wrapped\naround when they were coming for reconvalison [ph], for recovery.

And one of these Germans, his name was Miller and he was killed by\nunderground movement. And there was one incident when in the school where I was attending,\none boy came and he was crying, saying that Germans killed his older brother. There was quite\nan age difference.

His name was Jan Savada. It\u2019s written in that book. His pseudonym was. And\nhe was prewar officer which lived under pseudonym Jan Savada but his name was Batachevsky,\nreal name. And they were reporting that they killed two traitors and they left a short note on the\nchest. This is a traitor, was warned twice and by underground court decisions he was executed by\nAK, which was underground army.\nSo this boy was crying, telling his colleagues that his younger, older brother was killed by\nGermans and that was not true. I knew the truth. He was killed because he was traitor, but\nobviously was not interest of the boy to tell the truth. So a lot of stories which you hear and you\nread not always were true because for whatever reasons, people were hiding the real reasons.\nAnd I saw it again and again and again and there was in all the villages, doesn\u2019t matter age.

        "A: In my house. There was at least one dozen of the places. Usually we have two small attics on\nour level which was like roof coming down and there were doors and frame and then was main\nattic and there was entrance from the kitchen. You have to have ladder enter them up in the attic.\nIn the attic and this is related to this radio transmission, there was a metal wire spread between\nthe rafters. One to another one, very dense. And they were wrapped with the fabric where they\npretending to be for drying clothing. The ropes for drying clothing. However they were not used\nfor that purpose. They were used as antenna. So that end of that wire went into the wall, down to\nmy kitchen. And then came out in the form of power socket. But if you plugged the, your\nwhatever, hair brush or you know you couldn\u2019t get any power in there, because there was no\npower. There was, this transmitter was connected when this crew was coming. They had the plug\nand they were plugging in that one outlet entire house which they only knew and I knew is not\nfor power. That was the, that was one of the reasons why coming to our house, because antenna\nthey didn\u2019t have to spread antenna outside. Antenna was already in the house, heated, ready to be\nused, whenever somebody came in and knew that one outlet is the entry to the antenna.

So when he showed up in 1945 was a huge surprise for us because\nthere was no communication, no letters. We didn\u2019t expect at all. Basically everybody we buried\nhim and say you know end.

But there were trains not far from us and this unit which was training them,\nthey were going different places, having different tasks, including I was witnessing the report\nwhich they had a task, a nearby forest. There was a big opening which could have been turned\ninto the grass field, runway for planes with the big tires which they were able to land and take off\nin the middle of the night so that task was on the, it was a big forest on the outskirts of the forest.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nThese units were guarding whether Germans are nearby here. The other units were starting the\nbonfires on two ends, beginning and end of the runway and they, these planes coming from\neither Italy or some other bases of western \u2014",
        "A: Allies. And they were bringing goods, money and people and taking off also, people. This\nway I\u2019m not sure whether it was that airfield. A gentleman whose name was Jan Karsky who\nvisited two concentration camps and then was sent as emissary to England and he visited\nPresident Roosevelt. And he gave eyewitness testimonials, what\u2019s happening in the\nconcentration camps and Polish government in exile was begging both leaders, Churchill and\nRoosevelt to bomb the tracks leading, railroad tracks leading to concentration camps.\nUnfortunately didn\u2019t happen. And this 1s history, there are people who are studying the subject.\nI have my own opinion but this is my own opinion and doesn\u2019t count. But the historians should\nexplain why this information was ignored by both leaders.",
        "A: Yes, yes there was father of my friend Wittold Gatt. His name was (thinking). No, I cannot\nrecall it now. You know it\u2019s 75 years.",
        "A: But I knew them very, very well. They were, you know I was in their houses all of them\nmany times. And I absolutely knew them. I knew their voices. I could recognize their, when they\nwere other side of the door. And so not every night obviously. I had to sleep but at least one\nhour to two hours, sometime I was just not right to not make noise on the other side of the door\nand I was listening fascinating stories. And I knew so much and I couldn\u2019t talk about that to\nanybody. I couldn\u2019t tell my mother that I knew because she would be terrified. However, just\nbefore end of the war, my -- the gentleman who was doing this training in conversation with my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nmother, they were talking about something about gun and I said yes, I know this was hidden\nthere. They didn\u2019t know that I knew all these hiding places. And I knew how to load the gun,\nthis gun and how to unload it. I knew how to, apart, how to clean it. I knew everything because\nout of boredom nobody was at home. I went to that hiding place what they are talking about to\ncheck whether this gun is still there. I was I self-trained myself.\nSo after the war when German army left certain amount of arms. Whenever you went there were\nall these mines in the fields were a lot of arms here and there. Me and my friends were taking\nthe arms and ammunition. We went into the trenches and there were nobody else there and we\nwere doing full, full shooting like on the shooting range and we knew safely we could manage\nand nobody train us. We were self-trained.",
        "A: After the war immediately. And a lot of young people died because farmers needed the fields\nbefore so that army came. The people who are disarming mines in the fields, they wanted to\nplow the fields. And the mines here there and there and you never know where so they were\ntraining mine young people who they were training, paying young people who were foolish\nenough to go and dismember. And a friend of mine, two years, three years older than me, a\nbrother of good friend of mine. I just stopped to think a couple days ago. He was learning how\nto disarm that, these mines. And similar, his friends and their friends were hired by farmers\nwhich was I think cruel to let young people go into the fields.\nAnd they were many of them successful. Some, many of them survived, but some unfortunately\nmade mistakes somewhere or they didn\u2019t know they stepped on a mine which were all hidden\nunder the ground and they didn\u2019t have electronic equipment to detect it.",
        "A: Died, died and there was on the day where I was had appointment to see him and his brother\nwere going together. And my mother locked me and I didn\u2019t have key to open. We were living\non the second floor. I didn\u2019t want to jump so when my mother returned I was very angry that she\ndidn\u2019t love me because I lost my ability to play and my mother says yes, yes, I saw Yasho, they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\ncarried him in the bedsheet. I saw him and he was killed and I was shocked, but I could have\nbeen one of them. So I was lucky during the war because every day when we are leaving home in\nthe morning, we were not hundred percent sure that we were going to be back that evening.\nThreat of being killed was very real and so many, many incidences where people were killed,\neither because they didn\u2019t stop when they told to stop. They had something hiding on their body\nor something and they want to be discovered or simply Gestapo didn\u2019t like or they already knew\nthis person or whatever and they were looking for him. Gestapo was in my house many times\nand it somehow happens that I cannot recall one instance where they, my mother was at home\nand Gestapo came.",
        "A: Each time I was alone. I don\u2019t know how it happened. They coming during the day. My\nmother was in school. But you know several times they came afternoon when my mother was not\nin school or obviously she didn\u2019t know about that. They never announced obviously. What I\nheard obviously boh, boh, on the steps. Bang,,bang to the door. Gestapo open. So I have the door\nopen and they were walking around ransacking from all the drawers in the middle of the room\nand knocking the walls here and there and they were asking me tell us where these things are\nhidden. Because they had some suspicion but until they found, they couldn\u2019t do anything about\nthat. And I knew where things are hidden. However, I never you know blink my eye and \u2014",
        "A: M, sometimes in German, exclusively and I knew German to that extent. No, I learned from\nGerman soldiers in the streets of Gora Kalwaria. And my mother knew some German so she\ntaught me some basics. It was a survival game. You need to knew how to communicate and they\nknew a little Polish, including, some of them especially the regular soldiers of the Wehrmacht.\nThey were from Silesian region of Poland. They signed so called Folkslist which is they had\nsome ancestors of German origin. They spoke German at home. That\u2019s and it is, how do you call\nit \u2014 they some of them very, I wouldn\u2019t say what\u2019s the proportion. I don\u2019t know but there were\nvolunteers, but most of them they were how do you call it inscripts.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "A: They were drafted.",
        "A: I mean they were obligated and they really didn\u2019t have a choice. So they spoke quite good\nPolish. Some of them they are fluent in Polish and those would communicate with us. So first\nwords which I learned were mostly curses. I could say what, to curse in German for several\nminutes. That\u2019s my first encounter with German.",
        "A: No, she was shocked each time, but what she was able to do. I mean there\u2019s no, several\npeople asked me how come that your mother was not arrested. And I tell you why. Under their\nmovement which I think it\u2019s the main explanation. A lot of institutions which were, had German\nnames and had to do with the Polish population who had to do with rations. We had, food was\navailable with coupons. You were getting coupons. So many kilograms of sugar per month or per\nweek and one loaf of bread per week per head. These organizations were, had employees which\nare Polish origin and many -- I wouldn\u2019t say majority but some of these positions were infiltrated\nby Polish underground movement. People who secretly worked for Polish underground\nmovement. And they will bring information and early enough my mother was informed there is\nan opportunity to get a document to do the function which was collecting weather, like rain,\nsnow, the amount observation of the sky when the clouds, how low, when sun and she was, she\ngot a book written in German called and every day at certain hours you had to fill. Sometimes in\nGerman, simple words. I don\u2019t remember now but and the numbers. Hours and the amount,\nhow many centimeters of rain that night was and so on. And this information was collected by\nmeteorological service, German, which were used by German Luftwaffe. German military\nefforts.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nThat gave my mother an Auswise, the document which we call it IDcav today was the picture or\nin German and that whenever she was traveling between Gora Kalwaria and Warsaw and she\nwas traveling sometimes to take big round yellow cheese, which she was getting at a very low\nprice and she was selling it in Warsaw in certain place. Sometime that cheese had inside\nunderground documents. And my mother was having in a suitcase. She was very fashionably\ndressed, had perfumes. She knew quite well German. And she was traveling and she recalls one\nspecific case when she was standing on the tramway stop. Tramway came. One section of the\ntramway nor fila Deutsche, was German officer seeing a lady who 1s trying to lift the suitcase.\nSo he helped her to enter Polish section, put her luggage on the shelf above the head and then it\nwent to Deutsche section. He didn\u2019t realize that he is lifting underground army\u2019s literature,\nhidden in the cheese inside.",
        "A: That\u2019s the life. Oh yes, but she \u2014 when it happens to you once, twice, and you become\nconditioned and you become less sensitive which doesn\u2019t mean that in my time, although as I\nmentioned in the beginning, children are maturing during the war much faster than you ever\nimagined. And adults don\u2019t\u2019 realize how capable and knowledgeable children are like sponge.\nThey listen. They might not have answers, but they know what\u2019s going on beyond their expected\nmaturity level. So I was nine and ten, ten at the end of the war. But I was like 15, 16 it comes to\nthe survival skills and association, judging what was happening, whether it\u2019s dangerous situation\nor not. Whether my life is in jeopardy or how to read what eyes don\u2019t see, so to speak. There\nwere no newspapers, no radio. Germans were communicating with Polish population by hanging\ntwo language posters explaining you know such and such a day new regulations. You were\nallowed to do that but mostly was not what you were, what is forbidden. And that was the way \u2014\nand there was no excuse of not knowing.

His father about this period, his house was also facing the wall. He is the same\nage as I am. His father was arrested in Gora Kalwaria.

        "A: Not on the day because there was like two days. I \u2014 a lot of people went to the station because\nthey knew somebody or there was some relationship. People, you know, but most of the\npopulation, although there was Chasidic Judaism mostly but not all there were Chasidic Jews in\nPoland. There were some like his father\u2019s, Mr. Price\u2019s father, parents they were part of the \u2014 they\nwent to synagogue few times a year. They were you know kind of assimilated partially. Some\npeople one leg in one world, another leg in other world and it was for them it was easier to\nsurvive because they knew how hide. This one didn\u2019t have Semitic teachers. He could, you\nknow, got false documents. He could mingle and nobody would know it until some Germans,\nGerman would do what they were doing. Taking a man on the side and asking him to drop his\npants. You know there was a \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "A: Yeah, because non-Jews were not circumcised in Poland. There was like exception and there\nwas like a rule. And that Germans, it was for them most last test. But sometime was not\nsufficient. They had you know they all kind of relationships. German to survive in Poland\nlocally, they had to somehow relate. They couldn\u2019t be just suiting left and right. They needed\nfood, they needed labor. The ghetto itself had assignments. The Jewish authorities, Judenrat\nauthorities had assignments. So many people they need for work. Every day different people.\nSometimes people worked two, three times a week. Sometimes were paid a little bit, others were\nnot paid. They all varied but assignment was they needed. So for road work, for some other\nrepairs, for some help with bringing food, here or there. Last was food because with food, people\nwould be stealing food so they tried to separate food from people. But they didn\u2019t have enough\npeople of their own. Soldiers had tasks in the army or they went to the front, eastern front. They\nhad to coexist somehow. So they tried to bribe people by promises. But as you know all the \u2014\nmost of the people who cooperated openly or the Jewish police which was guarding ghetto in\nGora Kalwaria. They were the last one to be packed in the last cart and they were sent to Warsaw\nghetto and then to Treblinka and you know other -- to gas chambers. Germans didn\u2019t feel loyal\ntowards those who were cooperating with them. But at the time when they need it, they found all\nthese people who were willing to cooperate. Those were the times. It was interesting. Let me tell\nyou just one thing. My mother had the observation that in war time is the time when you have\nthe opportunity to recognize who are good people, who are bad people. That among our\nacquaintances, friends, acquaintance of the acquaintances, people who would expect to be honest\nto be fair, to be real human beings, with empathy were surprised. Those were expected, they\npassed the exam so to speak and people whom we treated with thoughts that they are not worse\nto have respect, they became real heroes. Really honest people who so to speak passed the exam\nof humanity. And that was one of the major lessons which my mother and I learned, that the real\npeople you recognize when real test, real need comes in life. That people have different\nrecaniam, different layers and you have really to know the essence of a human person is to\nremove all these layers first. And the war is the time when real test on the characters of the\npeople.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018",
        "A: So in 1943, during the Warsaw ghetto, before the Warsaw ghetto uprising, I was in Warsaw\nseveral times. My mother was coming, doing some trading and visiting friends. We had some\nfriends in Warsaw and on several occasions my mother took me and we walked along the walls\nof the ghetto. There was a section, I forgot the name of the street, but I could reconstruct it\nwhere the cobblestone pavement of the street, sidewalk on outside street paved, and then the wall\nof the ghetto was almost on the edge of the street, or very narrow sidewalk.\nThe wall on that section was, had no windows and you can see the signs where windows were\nremoved and the holes were filled with the brick. The walls were I would say about 8 meters,\neight yards, about tall. I didn\u2019t see anybody on the top. There were barbed wires on the top, but\nat the bottom where once in a while there were small narrow windows, which had iron bars\ndensely installed that a person, no maybe cat could sneak in but a person couldn\u2019t. But often\nwhen we are in the same area, we saw children\u2019s heads sticking out, outside through that window\nand they were either, they would see quite often people walking on the other side and they were\nshowing that give me something, give me something.\nAnd not far from there was a stand with vegetables, where you can buy carrots, onions, celery,\nsomething which you can you know person can eat raw and on several occasions my mother with\nas little money as we had, were buying couple carrots and I exclusively, my mother was\nobserving when the gendarmes were walking their backs towards, back another one. So it means\nthey walking away and they were not opposite direction and they were not looking at us on the\nsidewalk on the other side of the street. And we are throwing these carrots and these kids were\ngrabbing them and eating them. You can see them. They were very hungry and every piece of\ncarrot was consumed almost on spot.\nYou can see how was appreciated. So my mother, I think she did it for, that she could throw it\nour self, but she was giving it to me to teach me be empathetic and help other children. Children\nhelping children.\nThere was, on several occasions I remember that we are doing. And also my being was our\nstanding on the tram stop. It was like a raised area and in one particular place there was Ulitsa\nPuovska [ph] and there was like tramway place where they were, hangar where there were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nseveral trains were ready to, they were stored there temporarily. And they were before they got\non their routine trip.\nAnd this particular day afternoon, sunny day, a truck comes and there were soldiers come from\nthe cabin and truck is covered and full of the prisoners. And they commanding them to get out.\nThey putting them against the wall and one with the machine gun, kills the entire row. And other\nprisoners are asked, another truck comes and asked to take these bodies with hands and legs. You\nknow one person holding legs and \u2014 to throw them on that truck and they were taking them\naway. After they left, we couldn\u2019t, we\u2019re encircled by the police so we couldn\u2019t go. Some I\nremember some women were putting their hands on children\u2019s eyes not to letting them to see it.\nBut you know kids, even if they always between the fingers or they managed to see it. There is\nno way.",
        "A: She didn\u2019t encourage me, but she was explaining that and strange enough that these people as\nsometime would happening, they were not raising, they were not shouting. They knew they were\nbeing killed but they didn\u2019t shout. Yegshia Polskavoy derolna [ph] let\u2019s leave Poland free or\nsomething like that. They were shouting in Polish. These people, that particular group and there\nwere like a couple trucks came and I don\u2019t, I didn\u2019t count them but there must have been several\ndozen people killed this way. Mostly men that were killed.",
        "A: I have no idea. I have no idea because nobody to ask, nobody to tell. Who knows? I didn\u2019t\nsee David\u2019s you know stars. I would suspect they were non-Jews rather. But I have no idea.\nAnd after all of that show which was done purposely by Germans to scare people to make\ndemonstration because they could take these people and kill them next to cemetery and bury\nthem. They did it in public places, purposely to spread a fear. To spread the, to tell people watch\nit because if you don\u2019t behave you will be killed as they are.\nThat was the message that they wanted to send and so it was interesting reaction of the people.\nOnce, of the people who were watching that, once -- because we are very close. We are I would\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nsay less than hundred yards from that. Not always every of these prisoners who were killed on\nspot. Sometimes they were moving so Germans were still walking around and they were\nshooting in their head here and there. From the, you know hand gun. Once that show ended the\ntrucks went and police freed us to proceed. Trams were not moving, traffic was stopped for that\nexecution time. There was, I don\u2019t know, maybe 20 minutes, something like that, lasted. Then\nthey restored the traffic and then people were going to the execution place and the walls were\nfull of blood. Blood was in the street, curb where the rain normally goes, how do you call it?",
        "A: Drain. So and their behavior, the people who were watching were behaving. Some people\nwere laying down, some people crying, some people were kind of you know touching and\nkissing these places. It\u2019s like holy places. It was amazing that I remember scenes like that in\nspite of being eight, nine, ten years old. Basically nine because ten years old it was already war is\nover.",
        "A: It was so shocking for her. You know she saw it. She didn\u2019t ask me what I saw because I was\nnext to her and she tried to kind screen me but I saw, I saw everything and I was like hypnotized.\nI was, I didn\u2019t know when it started and when it ended.

And I would like to be advocate for\nsome studies to be done. What impact war makes on young people. And I know myself that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nafter, when I go, like I went today with my memories back to this awful, awful times, I am\nshaken. I am shaken now and I feel worn out. And I feel disturbed so much that crying wouldn\u2019t\nrelease that tension. Will not be enough. That\u2019s why I not so easily return to this times and talk\nabout that because it just disturbs me so deeply and that takes me longer time then to get back to\nmy normal mental and psychic so to speak.",
        "A: No, I did a lot in my life. I never been at psychiatrist\u2019s office, not for that purpose. No need,\nbut I did practice a lot meditation, transcendental meditation, Zen meditation. Came today here.\nWe have Zen meditation, here once a week. but I did it every day, twice a day sometimes, just to\nrestore my senses because it\u2019s deeply, deeply disturbing experience just to talk about that. This\nis not somebody\u2019s else story. It\u2019s not a movie which one saw. This is, was my life. My\nchildhood which I basically didn\u2019t have because I didn\u2019t have normal play. I, yes, we did try\nduring the war sports. I was very achieved, hundred meter dash, runner. Javelin champion and\ntriple jump and long jump and high jump and -- were my specialties. Yes, sports helped a lot but\nstill didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know what would be if was not that sport. I don\u2019t know if I had to be just with\nmy thoughts. So yes I did, I recognized the importance of physical movement, being in the\nnature and so on and today I am struggling with my memories. So it\u2019s not easy experience. Not\neasy to talk about that but I think it\u2019s important that other people my age and even younger who\nstill remember what similar experiences they had in their life that it\u2019s passed to the next\ngenerations so wars will be forbidden by law.\nI\u2019m smiling at this point, but people will fully realize the consequences of the war. This is not\nthat only people die on spot, that people were buried, that people lose their members of their\nfamilies. They are injured physically but the injury, the mental injury so to speak which stays\nperhaps even more than one generation.",
        "A: Somewhat. Somewhat, but I didn\u2019t tell him the details and I hope that when he watches that\nhe will, he will understand me better. Because a lot of things are difficult to express with words.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 15, 2018\nThose are the personal experiences which people underwent. And others who didn\u2019t haven\u2019t\nbeen in my shoes, haven\u2019t been there.

You can be empathetic but it\u2019s a degree to which you can be empathetic. It\u2019s still\nsomebody\u2019s else life. It\u2019s not your life. It\u2019s his life, her life. I think it\u2019s what Holocaust Museum\nis doing, saving for generations is so important. So important because other places there is some\ncentral archives here and there but that needs to be made available for as much as possible,\nespecially younger generations. That\u2019s my hope. That\u2019s my hope.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nNancy Cooey: All right. This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nWes Orlowski. We are meeting today on May 23\", 2019. This is a second interview with Wes.\nThe other interview was conducted in October 2018.\nWes, we ended our last conversation talking about the end of the war but we want to back up a\nlittle bit to talk about your father\u2019s experiences when he was deported to Auschwitz and then\nspent time in different camps.\nWes Orlowski: Yes, so my father was outside of our home about 25 kilometers from us in center\nof Warsaw when he was arrested by Germans, taken to the temporary headquarters where he was\ntortured. They didn\u2019t extract much from him because he didn\u2019t know what they were expecting\nhim to know. And then he was transported to Auschwitz and \u2014",
        "A: Yes. I found the exact date when he was registered in Auschwitz. That was on sixth of July\n1943 so a few weeks earlier he was arrested in Warsaw. In Auschwitz, depending on the period\nof time by, but by the end of war, Germans were more lenient, when it comes to the, allowing\nfamilies, prisoners and prisoners them self to communicate between them self. So we are allowed\nthat by the end of war to send some short letters, written in German and small packages.\nPackages had to be limited in size and weight and mostly vegetables which he had to share with\nhis inmates, that were in the same room where \u2014 the particular one which I visited years, many\nyears later, he was, they had bunk beds in one room. Eleven of them and so when he received\nthe parcel he, as well as if they did, they had to share it with the inmates.",
        "A: Yes. I have all of that. It\u2019s written on the, I have two letters from my father, authentic of\noriginal letters, written in German -- one from Auschwitz and one from Mauthausen. And they\nare in span of two months. It means shortly before he was deported to Mauthausen and then\nshortly after he arrived in Mauthausen. So my father survived both camps, through several,\nbecause of several factors. One of them he knew some German but he was learning very fast due\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nto the presence -- he befriended some people there who knew German and they were kind of\nself, teaching themselves, so my father was participating in this informal classes. Second, he\nwas relatively healthy. He was entrepreneurial because in files I found that he was listed as a\ngardener. I never knew that my father had any talent for gardening, but he was gardener in\nAuschwitz. And then what I knew was that he had skills as an accountant and they employed him\nin the office for keeping some records, probably you know suitcases, shoes and whatever. They,\nas we know, Germans are very systematic and they were keeping records of everything. So my\nfather survived and they were also, he had some access to the kitchen as a help. And then\neverybody in the kitchen you try to steal as much as possible so you can have food later.\nEverybody was doing that.\nThere are some reports. My father didn\u2019t do that but people who were wearing, carrying bread in\ntheir pockets til the end of their life, long time after the liberation. And they were, you know 50\nyears later but they are still carrying bread in their pockets. You can imagine what kind of the\ninsecurity these people were going and what kind of fears they went through.",
        "A: My father was telling me how they, he participated in the death march so there were hundreds\nof prisoners organized in groups and they were, with guards, they were chased by foot from\nAuschwitz camp to many, many miles along the streets and roads to the railroad station which\nhad connection with Austria. And then they were packed into the cars and then unloaded in\nVienna in Austria on the -- near the camp Mauthausen. And so I received, I still preserved one\nletter from before leaving the Auschwitz and then I have one letter which was sent to sister of my\nmother. She lives, she lived in Silesian region which was southern Poland, much closer to\nAustria. And that was written obviously in German with both cases there are his numbers which\nhe had engraved on his hand, he mentioned. Also in exact place where he was located at that\ntime, which block, which how they call it here. Block and shtuber, for example. So-\u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "A: And he survived it because many, many \u2014 no it was before the end of 1944. Thanks god he\nsurvived this march because if anybody become weaker, became weaker and neighboring\nprisoners walked with him couldn\u2019t carry him, you know holding his elbows, now he had to be\nleft on the, on the side of the road and last German guard who was passing, he would shoot him\nand then they would leave the body for the rock hole.",
        "A: But my father was strong enough and apparently he took care of himself. And one of the\naspects which I didn\u2019t mention was that he became very strong believer in God and was praying\na lot. And he claims that kept his sanity more or less stable and because there were many cases\nthe people couldn\u2019t take it anymore so they were throwing their bodies on the electrical fences\nand electrocuting them self to death.\nMy father somehow was able to survive all these atrocities and later he told me and I\ncomplemented my knowledge by reading more about that. The conditions for, in, for prisoners in\nMauthausen were much, much worse than in Auschwitz. Mauthausen was considered one of the\nmost severe German camps where first prisoners and the camp was set already after the, on the\nAnschluss but Austria invaded 38 I believe. They started this camp in the quarry. They digging\nhuge, huge area of quarries in the side of the mountain to prevent this place to be bombed by the\nenemies\u2019 bombers. And there were the entire parties. The planes they were built there. The\nammunition was put together from the parts. There were, they worked into shifts. Sometimes\nthree shifts, taking turns. The prisoners were very poor. The average life span for the prisoner in\nMauthausen was two months. And my father survived seven months and was liberated in 1945\non May fifth by a unit of US Army.",
        "A: All kinds of it. They were shifting them so that he was working with the ammunition for\nsome time. Some time he was in the office, bookkeeping again which fortunately the knowledge\nof German by my father, his German was quite good, to the extent that they were employing him\nin the less physically strenuous situations. The worst was for the people who had to push heavy\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\ncarts filled of you know stones or, or where there were not enough people to, to \u2014 So they were\nover extended physically and, and lucky for my father, he didn\u2019t, he hasn\u2019t had to do a lot of\nmenial work. Consequently, he worked, he walked from Mauthausen in Austria to Gora\nKalwaria in Poland. Very early he was able to get on some freight where he was nearby of the\nrailroad station and the freight was stopped and so he could climb the train but was not regular\ntransportation but in 1945.",
        "A: Well they are all ecstatic but they were in such a poor physical conditions. They, their joy\nwas limited to the food which they could eat and the stomach problems they had. Because when\nthey started to eat they didn\u2019t know where to end. Then their stomachs were not accustomed to\nhave normal food and plenty of food. So they were really suffering. Many of them, they had\ndigestive problems and so they quickly learning how both the prisoners and the people who were\ngiving them food to be very careful how they transitioned to the normal life.",
        "A: Yes, obviously I remember that. When he came he was dressed in very funny \u2014 because as he\nwalked from Austria, they were able to enter the empty houses which were abandoned by\nGerman population in western Polish territory and so they take some time and the clothing which\ndidn\u2019t fit them or they were you know partially broken or something so he was very funny\ndressed, first struck me. And second his behavior was considerably changed. And to the extent\nthat my mother had made a conversation with him and he went to live with his mother and his\nsister. And eventually my parents divorced because it was very difficult for my mother to raise\nme as a child. I was ten and a half at the time. And \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "A: Nightmares, short temper. Sometime he can talk illogical statements and there was no, one\ncould not have a longer conversation with him quietly because he is very, the level of anxiety\nwhen he recovered physically, the level of anxiety apparently was increasing. And on the one\nhand he was happy that he was liberated obviously. But on the other hand this life style which\nthey had is -- changed their every person obviously, every prisoner was reacting in different way.\nBut they, they out, their outlook of the world outside changed so radically that they didn\u2019t know\nquite often how to express it.\nThey didn\u2019t understand what was going with them. There were a lot of what you would call\ntoday PTSD, was not known at the time. But all forms of that kind of trauma was engraved\ndeeply. It was, it was not enough time to really rest and recover for them. So they were still\nliving so to speak, awaking in the morning. And they were surprised that they are, don\u2019t have to\ngo to work for example.",
        "A: He must have because he started another family and eventually had two children. But I\nhaven\u2019t been in the close contact with him at that time, at the end of his life. He lived til the age,\nhe was 79 when he died. He was born 1905 and died in 1983. And I\u2019ve been to his grave but I\nhaven\u2019t seen him the last many years before his death. I was in United States already then\nbesides, for many years.\nSo to return to my, to our life in 1944 we became refugees. And \u2014",
        "A: We are told to leave our home, in the short notice. Entire town and neighboring villages and\nthe whole street along the Vistula river. And the reason was that we live on western shore of the\nVistula river and on eastern shore Soviet army approached chasing Germans. And Vistula river\nbecame the border line, between two armies, German army and Soviet army. And our house was\non high shore of Vistula River, easily visible from the other shore of the river. And the snipers,\nhow do you call them. Sharp snipers with their lunette they could see any moving object and\nthey were shooting. So we were for a short time we are living in our house, but we had to go\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nwith our head down and almost crawl because we could easily be you know shot like that still in\nthe home. And --",
        "A: So we went with two suitcases and my cat coming in a bag on my neck. We walked and then\nwe, for about several miles. And then eventually we hired for a small fee a farmer with his cart\nand horse and several families to share that vehicle. And we went to one of the villages where\nwe rented a small place in the barn. And then we rented one room in the house. And then we\nwanted, went to another village. And that were where Polish underground fighters from Warsaw\nuprising. Was 1944.\nWe kept them from helping them to change dressings on their wounds. And they after a few\nweeks they left. They were taken by other units of underground movement during the night. But\nnearby there was a big artillery unit, German. And there was aiming obviously towards east\nagainst Soviets. Then certain day in the morning we see they are turning their guns aiming to the\nwest, 180 degrees reversal and we were completely shocked. Well what\u2019s -- they will be\nshooting their own units. Then we realized that they were ready to defend against the encircling,\nwhich took place. The Russians broke the front. At the beginning of January. Eventually the\nliberation of Warsaw took place on January the 17\", 1945.\nBut before that these German units which were in our neighborhood in the countryside, they\nwere aiming towards west. They are not shooting at that time, but they were aiming towards\nwest. Because Russian army already encircled them from the, from the west. The only open\narea where they had is towards Warsaw, towards north. So they eventually put the stuff together.\nThey hooked their artillery units to the trucks and they left towards north. I don\u2019t know what\nhappened to them.\nWhether they were caught in, in encirclement or they were able to successfully to go west.",
        "A: At this point we were free to go home and we, around the time of liberation of the Warsaw,\nwe came with our two suitcases to our home and our home was really plundered and whatever\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nwas able, people who were stealing the items and they did a good job.\nI have to admit and they were barely found any belongings. Including the front door where we\nare approaching our house, we saw a gentleman or gentleman, there was you know, who my\nmother knew. He was carrying on his back front door of our house so my mother told him you\nbetter leave it here. And, and he dropped the door, apologized because he didn\u2019t know whose\nhouse was it and he didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: And my mother was his teacher so he recognized my mother as a teacher and anyhow. After\nthe war, life, we were all ecstatic obviously but there were huge shortages of everything and\nfood was the most important. The farmers which were all around did their best and to feed their\nfamilies and have something to sell and feed us, you know people living in this small town. We\nquickly started to grow food in a small garden. I was one of the main providers there. I learned\na lot of skills at that time.",
        "A: Well all basic vegetable root, root vegetables. Which we have good soil because chemicals\nunknown were getting manure from farmers. My mother was coping herself and helping\nchildren. A lot of children were behind the regular program in Polish language, math, biology,\ngeography \u2014 all the basic subjects in the grammar school. But my mom was_ doing tutorials at\nhome. After the classes, regular school classes. So these children on the way home they were\nstopping by and you know not many, two, three, one sometime. But quite often there was\nsomebody in my house where my mother was teaching. And these children were, most of them,\nthey were children of farmers and there was a voluntary agreement. And they were bringing\neggs, a small can of milk and homemade cheese. A chicken sometimes live, sometime killed but\nfreshly. So we are trying to survive because stores were empty at the beginning.\nAnd, and also there was shortage of cash. I mean whole organization of the life you know it\ntook many months. People could function in their normal so to speak normally.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "A: It\u2019s a very interesting question because my mother and, and all her colleagues they were\nprewar teachers. So they knew the program and they had, some of them they saved the books or\nmade copies of the books of prewar. They were not accepted officially by the communist\nauthorities because they were specially history books you know. In math or biology you cannot\nchange much, but history books they were no, no for the communist times. The communist\nauthorities. So a lot of teaching was based either from these fragments of the books which were\nleft by, saved by the teachers.\nOr from their memories. Or teachers were teaching one another Some of that, depending who\nwas behind the pack, who was unofficial and they were kind of the -- between the real facts and\nphantom history which communists wanted to teach.\nAnd the history as the older people knew. History is not only what is in the books but what\u2019s in\npeople\u2019s memory, especially older people\u2019s memory. So there were very difficult times. My\nmother was very involved in the teachers union. Before war she was participating in\ndemonstrations in Warsaw. But after the war there was obviously the teachers union, labor union\nwas penetrated by communists. They were open or secret agents. So we need to learn quickly\nwho to speak to what extent. We had to learn how to read between the lines what\u2019s in\nnewspapers. We had to learn quickly not to believe official propaganda. We have to learn\nquickly how to, man or woman, a radio receiver and how to listen to radio Free Europe or BBC\nfrom England. Radio Free Europe stations were located just over the border in west, in eastern\nGermany. Several transmitters on different frequencies and to learn that the Polish authorities\nare having radio stations on the same frequency located in Poland which does, were sending\nhuge noise garbled up and noise mechanical noise which the purpose of that was just to squash\nthe regular signals coming from Radio Free Europe from Germany.",
        "A: Oh there were all publicity programs. They were interviewing interesting people and they\nwere you know \u2014 we, at the beginning we believed whatever was said then because it was so\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\ndifferent and refreshing what was the official propaganda. Gradually we started to learn how to\nread and listen with some criticism and \u2014",
        "A: To the BBC and Radio Free Europe. They were a different type of propaganda as we learned.\nAfter some time.",
        "A: No, in Polish. Everything was in Polish. No, no it was directed to Polish population.",
        "A: But, but authorities were chasing it so people were doing very secretly in the evening. Not too\nloud so neighbors wouldn\u2019t hear but a lot of people were doing. Even those who claimed to be\ncommunists and believing in theory of communism, we learned later they were listening to these\nradio stations as well. So \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes. During the war, from the very beginning my mother had a saying that real friends\nyou recognize and distinguish from so called friends where the people have to do the sacrifices\nand people have to go beyond the comfort zone. So the people are \u2014 many of our neighbors\nwhich we had thought was not, were not very highly about them, they appeared full of\nsacrifices, ready to take their last shirt and give you if you need it. So to speak, symbolically.\nAnd people who we had high esteem appeared not worse you know opinion so to speak because\nthey became either selfish or they became agents you know and they were ready to spy on you\nand report to authorities. So learning whom you could trust and to what extent was one of the\nmajor skills, human skills that one had to learn.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "A: This was an interesting process. There was a dynamic process. And to the extent that these\nthings are written and I witness the situations like that. People who were discovered by the\nPolish underground movement during the war, that they were cooperating with Germans and\nthey were caught and proven, they were taken on the side somewhere in the, outside of\neverybody\u2019s view and they were shot and killed by the special units of Polish underground\nmovement and it was very obvious reason. To give a lesson to rest of the society that it\u2019s not the\napproved way of behaving.\nPlus they had to be removed because they are doing so much damage and so many people lost\nlives because of the people like that. So yes, they were, there are all kinds of the behaviors. There\nare people who were indecisive that then became very cooperative. People who were cooperative\nand they change their mind and they became selfish. There were trial periods for everybody.\nEverybody was certain way exposed and tested. And there was nobody basically who could stay\nin their comfort zone and stay unengaged in any way.",
        "A: Yeah, so my education started from self-education. So when my mother was giving tutorials, I\nwas sitting playing with my toys in the other room. Doors were open. I was on the floor and my\nmother didn\u2019t know that I am absorbing everything what she was teaching there like a sponge.\nTo the extent when I was ready to go to the first grade, teachers who were examining me, they\nsaid no you can go to second grade and you are, you know more about that. So my mother\nherself was surprised but I went to the second grade and from the, from that second grade to the\nend of my high school, I was always to the last class, I was always a best student. I had the best\ngrades.\nHowever, in the last two years of my high school there was an older than all of us, young man\ncame and he was studying in the seminary for priest. And he knew Latin like nobody else. He\nknew French like nobody else. And he was good but not as good as I was. But I had quite a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nproblem because I was accustomed to be the best. There were all kids who were coming to me\nwith you know problems to solve or something. I was helping. I was not selfish. I was very\nhelpful to other students.\nHowever in that last just before graduation I had problem with competing with this young man.\nAs I said he was four, four or five years older than us and he had so much schooling in that\nseminary so anyhow. To get, I graduated from high school in 1952, the same year I applied to\nWarsaw Polytech to the department of electronics which was a direction, well 1f young men ask\nolder men where he should go and the movie Graduate I believe you would say plastics. At that\ntime it was electronics was a popular direction everybody wanted to learn about electronics. And\nwe had competitive exams. I went through that. I started studying in, 1t was 11 semester\nprogram. There was an experimental program where we couldn\u2019t get a BS, bachelor of science.\nWe had to go for a masters. So in one chunk without interrupting there was the first course of\nthat entire college.\nI had to go and for master\u2019s degree. So after almost ten semesters, when I was done with my\nregular study at the class, where it was the time to write dissertation, myself and two of my\nclosest friends, we started to work in industrial institute for telecommunications. And was semi\nmilitary institution but was a lot of work there for civilians. In our case we are doing parts for\nradars which were later installed on commercial ships and ocean going ships.\nSo they were, when I was writing my dissertation, I had to do a lot of translations from literature,\nnot only in English but in French and I was fluent in French at that time. In Russian, in Italian,\nand obviously in Polish so I had to be in, from the technical translation point of view, fluent in\nfive languages.",
        "A: Some of them in school but like French I was learning, we started \u2014 my first exposure with\nFrench was in a two workers working for Germans in the shop which was repairing, it was 1943,\n44 my father was at the beginning of \u2014 they were still visiting us from Warsaw. But then he\nwas taken to Auschwitz. That didn\u2019t prevent two contractual workers from France. One was of\nRussian origin and the other was of Polish origin. I remember even names. Stanislaw\nMalinowski and Nissinger. Mr. Nissinger was a, had a background. His ancestors were white\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nRussians, those who were murdered mostly during the 1917 revolution in Soviet Union. So he\nand his family escaped to Paris. And he was educated there so he was fluent in Russian and I\nremember he was talking a little bit of Russian to me, both of them talking French and Mr.\nStanislaw Malinowski was knowing Polish but kind of the broken Polish. So an interesting\nconversation at the table. They were bringing me some food with them. They were cooking\ntogether. And they were for example first time I ate frog, the frog legs. Fried on butter and so\non. And they were delicious but I wouldn\u2019t eat them today.",
        "A: They, I went with them, I show them where they are and they were catching them. I knew\nwhere they were, where the frogs were. So that was my first exposure with French. Then my\nmother\u2019s colleague, teacher of the French. It was 1944, 45 and 46. I was coming to her home\nand helping her to, with the chores, household chores and she was speaking French exclusively\nto me. She wouldn\u2019t allow me to speak Polish. So I was quite fluent. I didn\u2019t know much\ngrammar but I was fluent in everyday talk. I, you know, simple sentences. And eventually I was\nlearning in school grammar. So when I graduated high school I was good in Latin, four years of\nLatin, four years of formal schooling, high school in French. And the learning Russian caught\nwith me only in college. First time I had to go which was unusual. My times, most of the high\nschools and regular schools had to have Russian. Somehow my school, my high school omitted\nor they were able to avoid teaching that. They didn\u2019t have teacher and it was not popular,\nRussian.\nThat was very helpful for me. French, but English I started to learn preparing my dissertation\nbut it was very, my master\u2019s degree dissertation was 56, 57, 58, 59 I graduated. Officially 59\nwith master\u2019s degree from Warsaw Poly Tech.",
        "A: Yes. I had one of my colleagues and we happened to live in dorms in the same room. Oris\nLati and I asked him a lot of questions. He had dictionaries to I got informal tutorial. Cause my\nfirst English self-taught words were the pronunciation of them, I found it in dictionaries. I didn\u2019t\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nknow how to pronounce the words so I knew what they meant but I had to see them first before\nor basically I could comprehend.\nThere was everything helpful until the -- all my life foreign languages were saviors and I was\nmany time in my life, I was lucky. I would say. Among other things I was in right place, right\ntime. That was part of the luck. But I developed the skills for languages and also human skills. I\nthink coming from the training during the war and after the war and balancing acts which we had\nto all of the time, whom to trust, to what extent and how to build relationships and friendships\nand how to value real relationships, the real friendships. Those are the skills and you cannot\neasily learn or cannot learn at all in school.",
        "A: That\u2019s a very good question because this is a big \u2014 I would assume that this country would be\nsomething of similar nature. Small cities, small towns are in the kind of the dream certain way.\nEverybody knows everybody. They have set of expectations you have to follow. In big cities\npeople disappear. They don\u2019t really care for neighbors anymore. They can be on same corridor,\nhave doors and they don\u2019t say good morning to one another. They pretend that they don\u2019t, they\navoid other people. This is not the case.\nWarsaw at that time had a lot of population coming from smaller cities and from countryside. So\nthese people brought a culture of small town, plus the experience the older generations you know\nof the war. People were much more friendlier, helpful, paying attention one to another, not being\nafraid to look into other people\u2019s eyes.\nWhen I came to this country one of the first warnings I was told not to look into the eyes of\nyoung men especially. Being a young man because that\u2019s considered as a challenge. And can\nend up in being beaten up.",
        "A: I never experienced a beating in this country but I, observing other people I think that this,\nthat was not bad advice. To be on cautious side, not to be too trustful and direct with people, too\nfriendly.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "A: My mother being born in the countryside and then living more years in small city, didn\u2019t have\nmuch to offer in the sense of practical how to behave. More helpful was to have some friends,\nacquaintance of the acquaintances or have pupils or her coworkers who moved to Warsaw so I\ncould not to live with them, but I could come sometimes for advice for some \u2014 these times there\nwere huge problems with supply of basic goods. So having friends, acquaintances, always allow\npeople to ask for favors and give favors. For example if I was walking in the streets and I see the\nline of people in the front of the store because there\u2019s not enough room in the store so people are\noutside, long line for enter ____._:- Forty people stand in line. Most of the people what they do\nwithout asking, they will first stand up and take the place in line. And then they started to ask.\nWhat do they give here? If notice that. Not because you are paying with money obviously but\ndelivery was just coming. Truck came and was delivery of toilet paper let\u2019s say. So you\nwouldn\u2019t buy two or three or a small block of paper. You bought 20 or 30 toilet papers. And you\ntook a string. You put them through this string and you make like a \u2014",
        "A: Like garland and you are hanging them let\u2019s say three times around or four times around your\nhead and you are walking in the street like that which looks funny. Right, but you are not alone\nin the street. And then you came home and to your good friends you sold them half or whatever\nyour supply. So everybody was trading with everybody else and life was full of activity. Nobody\nwas bored because to survive you had to be industrious, active, working with others, helping one\nanother. Not to be afraid to ask for help but also be ready to give a hand or to share your goods\nwhich you received and you consider yourself lucky.",

Mr. Price was\n101 years when he died. It\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: Several.",
        "A: Yeah there were several but as it happens, many of them, they had Polish names and they\nwere not either they were converts or they were coming from mixed family where the mother\nwas Jewish or father was Jewish but had Polish name. So several of them I was friendly and\ncertainly only after I became friendly I learned that they were Jewish. Or had some Jewish\nbackground. Poland was the country where there were all kinds of the experiences and this is not\nthe place now to tour. This is a longer story but people of Jewish origin were involved whole\nspectrum of activities. Some of them they were part of the communist establishment. Some of\nthem they were against. They work in underground army. It, the origin, ethnic origin was not\nenough to make any judgement depending on how these people were behaving. What they were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\ndoing. What they are doing some good for the environment for where they live, where the\npeople were living. Or they were involved in arrests you know and other not popular causes.\nSo it\u2019s, 1t was a judgmental call each time. Yes, but I have several friends, good friends who\norigin, Jewish origin, including the other friend of mine who came from France and where he\nwere part of the French underground movement. His brother became the owner of the major\ncircles in Warsaw and this friend of mine taught me how to make coq au vin. It means chicken\nin wine, how to cook. Chicken, chicken.",

We are doing when we\nhave done with our masters. Most of us were already working because we are strip of money.\nWe couldn\u2019t support ourselves so we were looking for jobs, working as young engineers and the\nsalaries were poor but if they allow you to survive and that\u2019s what counted. I didn\u2019t have my\napartment. I stayed in Warsaw. I couldn\u2019t travel to my work in Warsaw from Gora Kalwaria\nbecause there was narrow gauge train which took almost one hour and a half, like one hour and\n20 minutes one way.

In, there were big dimensional rectangular in cross section\ntubes in which the electromagnetic signals were sent and this semiconductor devices were put\ninside and they were you know measurements you know how they were detecting that and all\nkinds of \u2014 it\u2019s based on the really cutting edge science. One of the funny things is which\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nprobably many people in the west didn\u2019t know that there was an embargo on the communist\ncountries and normally you couldn\u2019t get most modern equipment and for electronic engineers,\nhaving good like today you have a computer. At that time in 50s you had to have an oscillator.\nAnd one of the best oscillators in the world was American Techtronic\u2019s and we had the most\nmodern electronics which were embargoed by US. How it happened.\nThere were go between in Switzerland which for cash they would sell you this equipment but\nwhat they would do, they would mechanically remove the serial number on that so that nobody\ncould trace it back who sold to whom. So it was a lot of equipment which we had in our labs\nthrough the purchasing agents which were having cash with them, they went to Switzerland,\npurchased them and brought them to, behind the Iron Curtain and we have the most modern\nequipment.",
        "A: Fulbright Fellowship.",
        "A: In 1970. I applied in 19 -- I was working then at the Polish Academy of Sciences in one of\nthe institutes, two institutes I worked for Polish Academy of Sciences. One is in a short time was\ninstitute of basic technical -- I don\u2019t know how to translate it. Another one of the, was called\nelectronic institute of technology and \u2014 electronic technology. What I am doing support research\nbecause I did not have the PhD and unofficially I have advanced work towards PhD,\nexperimentally but I didn\u2019t start the course work yet at that time\nSo there was the work in that institute. Then I worked for a company which was managing\ncommunication in air corridors. So we are in charge of radio beacons in the corridors,\ninstrumental landing system. I was in charge in several responsible positions. One of them was I\nwas in charge of installation of the first instrumental landing system in Okenche international\nairport in Warsaw. There was 1962 I believe. It was one of the first instrumental landing system\nestablished in eastern Europe. And it was a British equipment pipe. That\u2019s where knowledge of\nBritish English was helpful.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nLater when I was working and had a little bit of time, my work day was ending usually at 3. For\nanother hour or two I was working another job with the same institution which was paid\nseparately. And there was a research for some companies and I had another job which was a\ntranslation of the aircraft manuals, civilian aircraft, from English into Polish. And I have to you\nknow, I hand written then. I have a typist who was typing it. My conventional type all electric,\nmaybe she had.",
        "A: Yeah and I was doing it the evenings and the weekends and weekends and it requires a lot of\ntechnical knowledge. It is not just your regular English. It was not an easy text and so I have to\nconsult with the engineer and aircraft engineers sometime and that it was, it allowed me to save\nenough money to buy apartment in Warsaw. Finally I made enough money to buy and I got a\nbank loan, obviously the mortgage for that. When I left for United States in 1970 my mother\nmoved from her apartment to this apartment and I was sending her some money to finish paying\nthat mortgage and then I paid it to the end and became the owner.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nadults party which was elite of people who had responsibility but also access to the special\nprivileges, which involved purchase of the 1tems which were not available for common people.\nBehind so called yellow curtains and because they had yellow curtains in the windows. From the\nstreet you couldn\u2019t see if there was a street level, what\u2019s inside, but you have special ID and you\nentered. For very nominal prices you can get, almost like in the west full variety of goods.\nSome of these younger activists were members of the communist party and member as well of\nthe youth organization. And I had several of those on the, at my first year of college. They were\nsons usually or daughters of communist activists.\nIn my case I had several colleagues who were children of the communists expelled from\nBelgium and France and they were sent to Poland. For their activities, communist activities.\nThey wound up in Poland. They had children and these children got without the exam special\nexemption. They became the students at the elite best of the best schools. One could get. And\nthey were my colleagues so to speak. And we had ROTC exercises like every Saturday, had to\nwalk to the field and pretend that you are shooting or whatever. Not every ROTC. Again for\nboys only. Girls were excluded. But anybody who had two legs and two hands and two eyes\nwas, had to be a member. And there were no exceptions. In that communist organization during -\n- there was in March I remember of second semester in the college and a studying diet. And there\nwas a huge demonstration of solidarity and memorial in the front. There was a big podium and\nall the officials, first secretary of the workers party. You know and all of them, they were on a\nbig podium. And we had to walk, the long walk and there was borders on this sidewalks. There\nwere activists with the bands on their arms, marking they are activists of the youth organization\nand they were boarding so nobody could run away from that march.\nSo we had concentration places where we gathered. The lists were checked. Everybody had to\nmark you know with his name with red. And there was marking if he\u2019s present. No school whole\nday wasfora ____.. It was snowing. And there was not good weather. Anyhow we gathered\nthat and then in orderly manner we had to walk in the front of these officials, waving to them\ncheerfully.\nAnd then in the somber kind of the mood because we are all in --\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "A: Mourning death of our leader so to speak you know. The leader of the communist world.\nThere were over even one, actually make small digression. One of my colleagues was close to be\nexpelled from the college because privately he said to another colleague in dorms that oh this old\nman finally kicked the bucket or something. You know a relatively pejoratively he said\nsomething about Stalin. Somebody was listening to it, one of the -- reported to communist party.\nThey made like a judgement, big court case almost. Professors were sitting, students and he was\ncalled you know and had to testify and there were you know like and finally few professors\nbecause he was good student and good human being, he was not, he was not fired. Last result\nbut I remember all this show, all this drama and that was so ugly that, that but it shows incredible\npower of communist party on everyday living at this times you know, 1950s in Poland. In\nWarsaw.\nSo when I was participating in that march, the beginning of March 1953, we had our work to do,\nyou know classes to prepare and we didn\u2019t have time to walk. I mean we hated that. So I walk,\nwalk, walk and there was first opportunity that there was staircase from the elevated road going\ndown. Myself and 20 other colleagues tried to escape that.\nBut we wanted to do it all of us at the same time and we blocked the entrance to that staircase.\nMeanwhile this activist they -- several of them, they pulling out people who were trying to\nescape that. And one of them was a big guy bigger than me and I couldn\u2019t beat him because there\nwere, he had a lot of friends there. I would have been beaten there. So he requested my ID card.\nAn ID card was from the youth organization so I gave it to him and he didn\u2019t return it to me. He\ntook it with him. And he said you will come to our headquarters in the district and you will find\nit there. I didn\u2019t go there at all. I learned shortly after from a friend of mine who was activist he\nchecked. They couldn\u2019t find this, my ID and then later I learned that I was expelled for, from the\norganization. For misbehavior. So I was very, very happy. I couldn\u2019t publicly show my joy. I\nonly from the best friends, I shared. But nobody knew that I was expelled or the officials or the\nother members of that, they were \u2014 I still had to come to the meetings but I couldn\u2019t show my ID\ncard. So I said to them, my ID card 1s in the headquarters so they ok, ok. But then I stopped to\ncome to the meetings. I don\u2019t have ID card. Nobody cared and I was liberated from any official\nparticipation in, in the communist organization.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "A: No it has no impact. Just my satisfaction, my satisfaction. Yes, and I was expelled because I\ntried to escape from the funeral so to speak of Stalin and you know they caught up with me and\nthey took my ID card. I was you know penalized so to speak but I didn\u2019t cry. I was very joyful.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, as it happens because of my age. I was 19. I was 35 years old, 34 when I interviewed in\nAmerican embassy. Very rigorous interview, in our language obviously. And what I was doing,\nresearch and I was not member of any organization since that when I was expelled from the \u2014\nusually I never was member of the communist party, of this workers thing. I was not involved so\nthat was probably helpful and they were interested what I was doing in my research. I had to\ndocument everything and, from my supervisors and all of it. And I was sent home and they told\nme they will notify me soon and there was no word for many, many months. I went on vacation\nnext year.\nI returned from vacation. That was August 1970 and I was told that I was approved and I should\nleave in two weeks. So I had two weeks\u2019 time to put my ducks in a row. Make order in my desk\nand leave the work which I was doing with somebody else and for one year I was traveling from\nmonetary \u2014 for one year I was allowed to buy the ticket. I believe I bought the ticket or was\noffer. I don\u2019t remember at this moment. But the Fulbright fellowship was extremely low. When I\narrived in United States, I barely had enough money to pay one room in dorm like situation. But\nit was private house where I shared the house with ten other students, one kitchen, one\nrefrigerator. Maybe one or two bath, two bathrooms for 11 people. Walking distance to the\ncollege and I had to skip some meals in cafeteria because I didn\u2019t have enough money. There\nwas like 300 something dollars per month, for to pay my dorms. Tuition was paid obviously.\nCause I couldn\u2019t pay tuition from that. But I remember going to McDonald\u2019s was a luxury for\nme. I couldn\u2019t have afford. I had to buy bread, simple foods. Do my own sandwiches for lunch.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nEat very simple breakfast. And for dinner was big treat to go cafeteria and have a simple meal.\nSo it was really, really you, you hear that somebody 1s on Fulbright fellowship, maybe now they\nare paying them. But for us, when I arrived in 1970 was so discriminatory and, and awful my\nfellowship. I learned later from boys from India, from other countries who came, it was\nunbelievable simple life style. What I had to endure.",
        "A: Wisconsin, Madison and engineering department. I had a, I had an advisor, professor in the\nelectronics department who was of German origin and I had interesting conversation with him\nand he invited me to his house. His mother was a real German, old class of German and she\nasked me the questions which were, I am ashamed to repeat because she asked me what, from\nwhat Poles I come. From these German Poles or the Russian Poles. She didn\u2019t know that Poland\nwas independent country and there are Poles, Poles. Not German Poles.",
        "A: No, she was. Yeah, I think he was completely educated in this country and born in this\ncountry probably but his mother was you know old lady in her 70s, 80s in 1950 so you can\nimagine she was born at the end of the century and Poland didn\u2019t exist at that time. But she\nacknowledged it and that was one of the curious points.\nAnyhow, by mistake I learned it later. I was put on the regime which was very unusual. There is\nthis science, this gentleman, the professor who was my guide so to speak. And then there was\none like student advisor for the entire university. They applied a wrong paragraph from some\nregulation book. I was treated as Soviet diplomat. I was not a diplomat. I had passport which I,\nyes, there was not my private passport. Passport was the property of the government. When I was\ngoing to return to Poland, I had to, next day to return the passport because passport at that time\nwas not my document. It was official document of the government. Although it\u2019s my\nphotograph, my \u2014 but anyhow, they applied this new rule by mistake. I learned later. So what I\nwas told that I cannot leave the town, Madison, Wisconsin. Unless I report two weeks in\nadvance and I have distant cousin in Chicago. So I was not able to go to Chicago from Madison,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nWisconsin. Unless two weeks in advance, I present a plan, whom I am going, when I am going\nto leave, whom I going to see, what\u2019s the phone number. The name, data of the person I am\ngoing to see. Very detailed plan to supervise me basically. And I couldn\u2019t go anywhere else.\nKind of the prisoner in Madison, Wisconsin.",
        "A: In advance to the supervisor for the entire university. And then get approval and after getting\napproval I would be able to go and also report after I came that I came on time and all of it.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t test that. I didn\u2019t because I was told not to move so I didn\u2019t move. Although I have to\nadmit, I yes, I was invite by two girls with birthday party and their parents live outside of\nMadison, but not far. And I kind of you know bending my back and hiding and almost I got into\nthe car and nobody knew about that. So I am not sure whether I committed crime at the time or\nnot. But mostly likely not. But, but I was afraid. I was afraid so I was trying to fulfill the \u2014",
        "A: The restriction was to the very end. At the very end was another professor there of Polish\norigin. And he privately told me when I asked him why this is sanction. He checked with that\nand he being the professor they told the truth. That they realized that they applied wrong\napplication but they you know what they can do. I mean they couldn\u2019t restore my full freedom\nbecause it was all over. I stayed another year because meanwhile I met interesting girl who\neventually became my wife and we became friendly. In the library. Of, of the college, of the\nuniversity and so I applied to my employer in Warsaw, the Polish Academy of Sciences through\nthe institute which I was employed for a leave without pay for a year. And they granted this\nthing. After some delays they granted, so I stayed for another year. I was able to \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "A: It was my second year and I did some research. But mostly I was working because I, I was\npoor and I didn\u2019t, and I couldn\u2019t pay my apartment. I couldn\u2019t pay you know food. So I was\nworking through the mutual acquaintance I working in some of the institutes of the, the\nuniversity. So I was able to stay with my fianc\u00e9e at that time. And when I returned to Poland in\n1970. It was 70, 71, 72, in summer sometime, my fianc\u00e9e joined me few months later. She came\nfor a month and we got married in Warsaw in Warsaw royal castle which was during the war\ndestroyed, but one small wing was left and there was a civil marriage cert -- there was an office\nwhere you could have civil marriage conducted by officials and get the document. And we had\nsmall reception there. I invited friends and family. And \u2014",
        "A: No I didn\u2019t because my wife received a document which we took to the American embassy in\nWarsaw and the stamp, had new name in some end of the passport, an addition. And that allow\nme, allowed her to use the different name because at the beginning she was using hyphenated\nname. Her maiden name and her married name and then eventually she dropped them. She 1s\nusing for many years now only this. Because it\u2019s more convenient.\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that because of the agreement between the governments, US and other\ncountries signed an agreement that if US is going to grant Fulbright fellowship, these grantees\ncannot apply for US citizenship or even for green card. And I was only you know I did time was\nstarted to be counted from the day of the departure of this guarantee from the US. So when I\ndeparted what counted on me that\u2019s several months I was in Poland and there were supposed to\nbe 24 months period. So in spite of being married to the US citizen, I was not able to be with my\nwife. So they recommended what they, that I will go to Canada, let\u2019s say. And she will come to\nCanada or, stupid restriction. Henry Kissinger was Secretary of State at that time. So this was\nrestriction by State Department which was the one which was issued the Fulbright Fellowship.\nObviously I had to write the report, the Fulbright center report for Fulbright Fellowship\ninstitution and then write report for my institution in Poland.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019",
        "A: Several months. And I had to you know I had to apply again to get without pay and I was\nhoping to come and return to work on my PhD and so on but things after arrival to United States\nand joining my wife, I, I came to visit her on a tourist visa. I couldn\u2019t get another visa and I was\nrestricted to six months. So after six months I had to go back. So we applied, applied to our local\ncongressman for an exception and then waiting several months, I was were granted, I was\ngranted an exception and I could apply for green card first. I waited for that and then for\ncitizenship which I became quickly. US citizen.",
        "A: No, eventually no. On my interests were changing gradually. And I became, I realized that the\nresult of my research 1s not used for the purposes I believe. I became more, the equipment which\nwas used for civilian purposes but also for military purposes. And that was becoming difficult for\nme. I became more thinking a line of Quakers which I met a lot of Quakers and I became Quaker\nabout 30 years ago. And that changed my life in many ways. My wife and my son are Quakers.\nWe are very active in Great Barrington.\nSo you know views change and I was changing to. I was as I call it going forward. Instead\nlooking back. But my past is very colorful and you had a lot of difficult times which I had to\novercome in many ways. And enjoy every day as it comes instead looking too much in the past.\nThere was too many things in my childhood and in my early age, including as I often say I was\nable to survive two totalitarian systems. One German occupation when police had to pay\nattention. We in Poland we didn\u2019t use the word Nazi occupation as it\u2019s used over in this country.\nWe were saying German occupation because it was Germany was occupying, not Nazis. Nazis\nwas a party that took control of Germany, but there was Germans. Germany couldn\u2019t conduct the\nwar without support of majority of the country. And the sons and daughters were dying on\nbehalf of Germany, not Nazis.\nAnd I wanted to emphasize it again and again because it\u2019s a very strong falsification of the\nhistory. This is not the way history 1s being seen in Eastern Europe. When I hear there was a\nNazi occupation of Poland I am getting kind of the goose skin, because when I was leaving home\nI would have been killed by a German soldiers or you know Gestapo. I didn\u2019t care whether he\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nwas Nazi or not Nazi. Nobody in Poland was really paying attention to whether it as Nazi or not\nNazi. My father was tortured and taken concentration camp was not important for him whether\nNazis or not Nazis. He was beaten, kicked and, and was losing teeth because of beating and not\nbecause you know Nazis or not Nazis. He was beaten by Germans. That\u2019s a very strong\npowerful point for me but I wanted to make it because there is so much of distortion of the\nhistory. Only eyewitnesses can tell the truth. And all historians who didn\u2019t experience that they\ncan have all kinds of the fantasies, they can write all kind of the things, but we in Eastern Europe\nwe learned how to read between the lines and what\u2019s the truth and what\u2019s the falsification\nafterwards.\nOne of the reasons I am giving this interview 1s I want to present the facts as they were at the\ntime, not as they are being seen from the perspective of 50, 60, 70 or 80 years. Because there is\nno substitute of living facts. Experiencing on your own body. And there 1s no, there is no\nsubstitute for oral histories. I think what the museum 1s doing is extremely, extremely important.\nTo have eyewitnesses. Yes, they might be sometimes colored by individuals but, but they are\ngiving a sense of the times.\nYou cannot publicate what I am saying here. Those are all my personal experiences, or they were\nthrough my friends, my family, whom I trust. They were not told to me by somebody,\noccasionally at the -- you know bar drinking beer or whatever. So they could be colored by\nsomebody being tipsy you know or purposely distorting the truth. No, those are the facts you\nknow. They are part of my life in living memory.",
        "A: No we never had like sit down and try memorize. It was a lot of conversations where we\nreminiscencing or trying to figure out why things took the turn where they did because there\nwere mysteries, quite often. I mean there was things happening, people were disappearing.\nPeople were behaving the way we didn\u2019t expect. You know the conspiracy of the underground\narmy and other -- there were other anti-German organizations in Poland which were not only\nlinked to the Polish government in exile in London which was really we considered the one\nwhich represented Poland and having rights to say something on behalf of Polish nation. There\nwere other organizations. They were you know millions of Poles who were in hush and they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\ncreated the whole army.

We were both kind of because when\nPaula returned, my wife just returned from the research in Latin America. She was working\ntowards her PhD dissertation. We had different interests and most likely inclining to live in\nEurope. I had some contacts. There were two possibilities. I have relationship with organization\nin Canada where I would work and we had connections with my family and acquaintances in\nBelgium, possibility was France. We were both you know fluent in French. We were open to\ntravel, working different places. We were, you know world citizens. We are not necessarily.

Was reporting to the deputy provost\nfor science, sciences and doing custom made measurement equipment for different departments,\nlike astronomy, physics, coming and placing orders with us. And we were doing, it was the\nbeginning of the chips and, and computers. There were mini computers, small computers because\nthere were PDF 11 already at that time which was like a big refrigerator, big refrigerator really.\nAnd those are many of them in NVA department at Yale. However, people needed custom made\nlike you would call it laptop with special features today, much more primitive than today\u2019s\nlaptops you can imagine.\nBut anyhow there was 70s and we are pioneering the work of custom made. I remember the\nCPU units the heart of the computer coming in the book where was it was cellophane. It was\nkind of glued to the page, the rigid page and you had to cut it out and you know find the\nappropriate sockets for it and then build everything from with the resistors, capacitors and there\nwas iron, hot iron you know and solder. You were building it on the printed board. Those are the\nelectronics, basic electronics at that time. So there were interesting times. My interest gradually\nwas shifting, when I was already at Yale, towards the use of the alternative sources of energy, I\nwas interested in solar wind and micro, micro, hydro small hydro which you can install in\nstreams you know you don\u2019t need big river for that.\nSo I started with a friend of mine who was graduate of Yale School of Architecture, we started\nan organization called ATAG, appropriate technology assistance group and we are giving\nconsulting to the individuals and organizations which were interested in using like windmill or\nhaving solar collectors which were very expensive at the time, not like today.",

Just electricity. Because they were huge hogs of electricity so this is the, utilities\nstarted with these houses and, and buildings which were exclusively supplied with electricity.\nThat was huge, huge savings and make a big indent in the consumption of electricity.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nWith the benefits for the facility users as well as utilities because they didn\u2019t have to generate\nnew power which was consumed by these customers.

        "A: I felt that I did a lot of my life interesting things. I don\u2019t mind to share my experiences with\npublic at large so to speak. And it\u2019s a lot of things to be learned from other people. One of the\nmost shocking things for me to find when I arrived here in the United States in 1970 was the lack\nof the appreciation by younger, appreciation of the other generation and their experience by\nyounger generations. The gap between certain age groups is I think very damaging for society\nand culture as it is. And societies as they are, are losing a lot without consulting what they are\ndoing with the older generations. And I think it\u2019s a huge mistake, culturally. I think huge mistake\nin educational system that schools are not encouraging older people to come be tutors. The, you\nknow younger generation, they think they know everything and they know better and they have\nno respect of older people.\nSo they gap between grandparents, children and especially grandparents and their grandchildren\nis in my opinion unacceptable. That needs to change because it\u2019s a question of survival of, of the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 23, 2019\nnations, of people as they are and not to speak about environment which needs to be respected.\nBut I would start with the restoring the bridges, crossing the bridges which are huge, huge gaps\nbetween the generations. It just I\u2019m sure it change in Poland as well, but this was not my youth\nand not my middle age but I was growing up. The respect for older people was much higher in\nEurope. In general in Poland. The family links were much stronger and friendships and\nintergenerational communications and the respect and just spending time together and talking,\ntalking about how was it. To learn something from that. Not to repeat the same mistakes. Again\nand again. And I am observing that too many there are many things would be, could be avoided\nif younger generations were more open learning from older generations. That\u2019s my main\nmessage which I would like to convey to younger people.",

        "WIESLAW (WES) ORLOWSKI\nAugust 15, 2018 & May 23, 2019\nNancy Cooey: This is United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Wes Orlowski\nbeing conducted by Nancy Cooey on August 15, 2018. Wes, can you start off by telling me your\nname at birth.\nWiestaw Orlowski: I was born, my original first name and last name sounded and it still does,\nWiestaw Orlowski. My middle name 1s Josef. In about 45 years ago when I was already in this\ncountry, I acquired a nickname Wes, because it was easier for Americans to remember. So\nreturning to my date of birth, I was born on May 17, 1935. Iam 83 years old now. I was born\nobviously before World War Two in a small Polish town which was about half and half, Polish\nCatholics and Jews, mostly Orthodox. The, one of the most important things to know about this\ntown that was a very historic town which these two religions coexisted with the best harmony\none can imagine. There are no recorded incidents of any conflicts between these two religions in\nthat small town. And the town was located about 20 miles southeast of Warsaw. My mother\ncame to this town in 1929 or 1930. My father was born in nearby and lived most of his adult life\nin that, in town, or in concentration camps or in western Poland where he resettled."
