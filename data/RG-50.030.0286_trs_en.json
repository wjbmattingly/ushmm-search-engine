        "Q: Will you just begin by telling me your name during the war and date of birth and where\nyou were born?",
        "A: Okay, well my name during the war was -- I had several names, but the name I was born\nto was Annaliza and I was born in Antwerp Belgium in December 1936.",
        "Q: So you were very young at the time before the war. You probably don't have too much\nmemory about what was happening prior to the war?",
        "A: No, only very sporadic memories of my father and memories that perhaps are based on\nstories more than memories but I do think I have very clear pictures of going to the park\nwith my dad and playing with him and doing things that normally you would expect a\nboy to do with a father rather than a little girl and I thought that people usually ask me\nwhy I chose a profession that I chose and although my father was a very orthodox Jewish\nman and certainly would have never admitted to that feeling I think that I was his first\nborn and I think he considered me in some ways his son. I remember the feeling of going\nto the park and playing with him and him being perhaps more involved with a child,\nparticularly a man of his generation than you'd expect him to be particularly with a girl.\nThat's what I remember.",
        "Q: You had a comfortable family life?",
        "A: Yes. I remember having two dear little friends who lived with us in the same house, and\nmy grandfather and just pictures mostly not -- I remember I had a little friend who's\nexactly my age a few months older and his sister who was two years younger and we\nlived in the same house and we were constantly fighting cats and dogs. We couldn't be\nwithout one another. So, we almost really always be together and I also remember that I\ndidn't like dolls and I used to get dolls and I used to give them to my little girlfriend. She\nloved the dolls. That's what I remember. I remember being very comfortable. I'm sure\nwe were not comfortable I mean financially but I had a very nice feeling about the\nfamily. I mean just my grandfather was a very sweet old man. He used to tell me stories.\nThat's basically all I remember.",
        "Q: Now what kind of business was your father in?",
        "A: I'm not sure. I think he started out delivering milk and learning how to be a diamond\ncutter or something of the sort. He was very, very religious. I remember that. He was\nalways going to synagogue, coming from synagogue and praying an awful lot. In my\nhead it seemed like too much. It seemed like not a very tense life. He was going to work\nand coming home and we observed the Sabbath. We would always go for walks in the\npark and things of that sort.",
        "Q: Did you have non-Jewish friends as well, or were you mostly in a Jewish community?",
        "A: I was strictly Jewish community before the war and to my knowledge, I don't think my\nparents knew anyone that wasn't Jewish except in an official capacity. I don't know,\npostman, policeman, -- no social interaction with non-Jews at all.",
        "Q: Your neighbors were Jewish as well?",
        "A: Yes. The ones I knew. I mean I was a kid so I don't remember everybody who lived\nthere but I would say the majority were Jewish.",
        "Q: Now, your mother spoke of a lot anti-semitism in Belgium before the war. Do you have\nany images of that?",
        "A: The only one is a story that my mom told me and that sort of became an indication of my\nearly rebellion and that was at some point during these --right either at the beginning of\nthe war or the pre-war period my grandfather was beaten up on the way back from\nsynagogue or threatened or harassed and he I think people were pulling at his beard and\nhe hid his beard in his coat. When he came home, he looked really terrible and very\nupset and he had told me that this was a Friday night that Friday night when men used to\ngo to the synagogue they had a couple of angels who were watching over them and\nwalking with them to and from synagogue. So, when he came back beaten and so on, I\nasked him Grandfather where were your angels then. So, that picture remained with me,\nhis frightened look and the statement that I made then, I don't remember having made it,\nbut it fits with the way I think. So, and several people that I have met, in fact recently,\nvery recently just about three months ago when I was last in Belgium said you are this\nlittle girl who said that. They remember that statement. That's the only evidence I have\nof anti-semitism that touched us directly but before I really don't know.",
        "Q: Do you remember what your grandfather's response was to that?",
        "A: I don't think he said anything. He didn't say anything.",
        "Q: Did you ever have to wear the Star of David?",
        "A: Yes, I did. Both my mother and I wore it I think after the men, -- the husband of this\nneighbor and my dad were taken I think to go to a work camp, and we had to wear the\nstar. One picture I have of that is that she used to always carry me over her should to\nhide her star so that we would travel in the trolley or something and she would carry me\nso that her star and mine were essentially hidden to avoid being harassed 1n the streets.\nShe'd always do that, carry me.",
        "Q: Do you remember, and I assume we'll be getting into things that I think you probably\nhave a very clear memory of -- do you remember when Belgium was occupied by\nGermany? Do you remember seeing troops or hearing noise?",
        "A: I remember having to leave in the middle of the night and walking through woods and\nbeing petrified and having German shepherds, hearing German shepherds barking in the\ndistance and dragging and running through woods. I remember that, so I remember the\nGerman voices and the dogs, particularly the dogs and until maybe ten years ago I had to\nrun if I saw any dog or heard a dog. So, I've overcome that too, but I really was very\nshaken by a dog. I couldn't go in a room -- and particularly a German shepherd, I would\njust freeze. I would completely decompensate so I remember that. I don't remember the\nstreets of Belgium per se. I remember the terror of what appeared -- I saw my mother\nbeing frightened and I became completely petrified. I remember that march through the\nwoods and ending up in some abandoned home somewhere and being there with a lot, a\nlot of people. I don't remember who these people were except for those friends that we\nwere living with basically.",
        "Q: So you were running to hide from the Germans?",
        "A: Yes, we were running to try and escape because at some point after the two husbands had\ngone to work, during that period some people came into the house and they weren't really\nNazis, but they pretended to be Gestapo and they beat up everyone in the house. My\nmother and my grandfather and me and they were really beating us and I remember\nscreaming and my mother screaming. They finally left. They ransacked the place and\nthey were looking for money and so on. They got in on the pretense of being Gestapo\nand --",
        "Q: These were just Belgium police?",
        "A: Yes, they were just Belgium police or Belgium hoodlums, not necessarily in any kind of\nofficial capacity. They might have just done that. This was a good time to do that. I\nmean it was perfectly acceptable. So, at that time my mother I think and her friend\ndecided to leave and try to join the husbands and I think that this is when we went to\nFrance with the idea of trying to get to Switzerland because Switzerland was a safe place.\nIf I remember when we got to the rondeveax essentially of where we were supposed to\nmeet our fathers and someone to take us across the border, someone had betrayed and so\nthat's when my parents went to the camps, the French camps , was\none of the camps that they went to. I'm not exactly sure how we got out of there and they\nwent to another camp and that period my friends and I went to that home that we were\nhidden in.",
        "Q: I just want to backtrack a second so I don't get confused. Now you had mentioned that\nyour father and his friend your neighbor were sent to a work camp?",
        "A: In France.",
        "Q: This was before you went out into hiding into the woods? I'm trying to get the sequence\nhere. If you remember, through researching any dates, maybe that would help me too. I\nmean that I know that you --",
        "A: I think the first time we left, because we left twice. The first time we might have gone all\nof us together to in France, and that must have been '40, '41 somewhere\naround there. And then we came back to Belgium. I think subsequently the men went to\nwork again to that place in France.",
        "Q: Which was called?",
        "A: or something like that.",
        "Q: This was near I think?",
        "A: Yes, in the north of France somewhere. And during the period that they were away that's\nwhen we had the incident of people breaking into our home and then we left I think that's\nwhen we went through the woods and were supposed to meet up with the fathers and then\nsupposed to meet up with someone who was going to take us across the border to\nSwitzerland, but we didn't make it. So, and we got caught that time. The first time we\nwere simply sent back home. The second time we got caught by the French police who\nthen put us into these sort of transient camps which are really deportation but I certainly\ndidn't know. I don't know how much my parents knew of what these places were going\nto lead to. I'm not sure they really knew. At some point they heard that people who left\nthere never got back. I mean that through the grapevine that sort of information started to\nfilter through and so they found that out and that's when I was in the children's home they\nwere at a camp and that's when they decided to run out of the camp before they were sent\nto Germany.",
        "Q: Now, as I understand it, the second camp they went to was ?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Were you in that at all with them?",
        "A: No, I think that when they were transferred to they had made some\narrangements to take the children away and try to hide them, and that's when we were,\nmy friends and I in that camp in that home near ;",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about the home, who was there, what was it like?",
        "A: Well, the children ranged from about four of five years of age, somewhere around there\nuntil they looked very big to me, but actually they were 16. I think the oldest were 16 to\n17. There was a mixture. They were all refugee children. Many of them were not\nJewish and many were actually refugees from the Spanish civil war because this place\nwas very close to Spain. It's in the part of France that borders on Spain almost so the\ncatholic archdiocese of that area had taken in some children from that war and kept all of\nthem together in that home.",
        "Q: So, this was a catholic home?",
        "A: It was a catholic run home but it ha connection to Jewish organization who was able to\nchannel some of their kids into that particular home.",
        "Q: Now you were about how old then?",
        "A: At that time I must have been about seven, six or seven because I was born 1n '36 and that\nmust have been '42, '43 somewhere around there.",
        "Q: How long were you in this home?",
        "A: In this home I was approximately eight to nine months and that part I remember quite\nwell.",
        "Q: Tell me about it.",
        "A: Well, things that stand out hunger, real, real hunger. Nothing to eat, but that didn't bother\nme because I really didn't like to eat but I remember my little girlfriend, food was her\nthing. She was this plump little thing and you could always shut her up by giving her\nfood. So, I used to run to the kitchen at night and steal whatever I could find and feed her\nbecause she was crying all night. She was crying because she was hungry, and I was\ncrying because I wanted my mother. So, we were quite a pair. So, hunger -- and I knew\nthere was nothing to eat and whatever there was I couldn't swallow. I just couldn't\nswallow any food there. The other thing I remember is lice and the worst incident which\nmay look ridiculous now but was when you had lice they shaved your head, and I was\nvery proud of my hair. I had really beautiful long hair and when I found out that I had lice\nand I could tell, because I was really itching. I hid in the outhouse. There was no indoor\nplumbing. There was indoor cold water to wash but no toilet. I hid in the outhouse for a\ncouple of days and nobody could get me out of there because I knew as soon as they\nfound out they would shave my head. So, but they eventually did. I had to get out. They\nshaved my head, and it was absolutely horrible, just horrible. Now, it looks kind of silly\nbut and it wasn't just lice it was scabies, you know the things that crawl under your skin,\nSO we were not really in very good shape. And there was always a feeling of fear and just\nterrible -- feeling terrible. First of all, not understanding at all why you were there what\nwas happening, missing your family and just the terror basically. I think I acted\nirrationally on many occasions where I would just run out of the window in the middle of\nthe night in the nightgown and just try to run away and being caught. You know, brought\nback to this, so we had songs but I don't know if they made them up or the older children\nprobably did which referred to us having to wake up at 7:00 in the morning and having to\nwash with cold water and the son reflected that there was no food only some kind of\nvegetable, something like a sweet potatoes. That's why when people serve me sweet\npotato at Thanksgiving I say thanks but no thanks. I can't even look at the stuff. I don't\nknow if it's the same, but it's so similar that it's enough to turn me off. That's all we had.\nSO, there was a song that reflected the realities of the time.",
        "Q: What was a normal day like in this home? What did you do?",
        "A: As little as possible. I mean I'm not a psychologist but if I look at myself back then I\nmust have been -- I would qualify myself as a really depressed child, entirely depressed.\nI couldn't do much of anything. We were very regimented so we had to get up at 7:00\nand we lined up. I don't know if you saw the several films about children's homes,\ncatholic homes I think is one of them where children just line up\nand they wash and then they go to breakfast and then they go to prayer. They used to\npray but we sort of didn't pray along. I believe that there were some kind of organized\ngames, like playing ball or something like that and there were various levels of\ninstructions, but I don't think I learned a tremendous amount. I just don't remember\nanything that was organized. There was some instruction but I'm sure the way I feel\nwhen I think about it I was just there, but I wasn't there basically. That was that. We had\nto make our rooms and we had to help in the kitchen. We had to peel the few potatoes\nthere were, the sweet potatoes, whatever this vegetable was. We had to help clean up and\nthat was it. There was nothing else going on.",
        "Q: Was it crowded? Did you sleep in the same area with a lot of other kids?",
        "A: Yes. There were two areas, there as a female area and there was a male area, boys and\ngirls. We were lined up like in the old hospital wards, a number of beds together one\nnext to another. We had essentially no possessions. We didn't have anything. We just\nhad our beds and I don't remember if I had any change of clothes. I mean I don't think I\nhad anything. Maybe they provided us with some old clothes, but we didn't have -- I\ndon't remember having a cubicle I could call my own you know with my stuff. I had\nnothing.",
        "Q: How many kids were there?",
        "A: I really don't know. I'd say 100 or so, not more than that.",
        "Q: Were the people who took care of you nice?",
        "A: No, I don't think so, but it's hard to tell. I was just so unhappy. I don't have good\nfeelings about anybody there, but it may not be them. I don't remember-- for instance,\nthis incident with the hair, I thought they were barbarians when they did this. I felt that\nthis was a middle age torture but in retrospect maybe that was the only way to deal with\nthe lice. SO, I Thought they were mean, but maybe they weren't. I don't remember\nanybody being particularly kind to me or particularly paying attention to me but then they\nprobably were understaffed and lots of kids and all of us were miserable and unhappy. I\nknow for a fact that I was extremely rebellious and did exactly the opposite of what I was\ntold. It didn't matter what it was, I would just fight it. I would continuously argue and\nfight scream run a way. So, you really would have to be a very well trained professional\nto handle a child of that condition and they weren't. I assume they were volunteers from\nthe church or from other relief organizations and I guess they did the best they could but I\ncan't say that there was somebody there that was nice.",
        "Q: You said you were there about eight or nine months, how did you get out of there? What\nwere the circumstances?",
        "A: Well, the circumstances are a little bit muddled but apparently my parents send someone\nto pick us up from there because they were escaping to Nice to the part of France that was\noccupied by the Italians as to the Germans.",
        "Q: How did your parents get out of ?",
        "A: From what they told me is that they were told that they were going to be sent somewhere\nelse and they sort of smelled a rat and they asked for one day off to come in and say\ngoodbye to their children or visit their children and then of course they ran away to Nice\nduring that supposed trip, but they didn't come to pick us up because they were afraid.\nSo, they apparently sent some lady to pick us up, but my friend whom I spoke to\nyesterday, said that this person was afraid to travel with three children, so she gave us the\nmoney and left and told us how to get there.",
        "Q: Were you the oldest?",
        "A: He and I were the oldest.",
        "Q: At age seven or eight?",
        "A: Yes. And I do remember parts of that trip like getting on trains and getting off trains and\nsomehow getting to Nice, but I cannot recall the details of that but I know we made tt.\nMy recollection is that there was no adult with us and he confirmed that that this lady had\nat least given us the money, she didn't take it and run, but she was afraid to travel with\nthree children. She thought -- the way we looked with our shaven heads and with the lice\nand the scabs. We really looked awful so she decided to just tell us how to get there. We\nhad grown up pretty quickly, and we got there. We simply made the rondevoux with our\nparents in Nice. That was --that's why I say it sounds like it's not true and just like a\ndream, but it is true. We did get there and we did find our parents. But I then in Nice it\nactually was a very happy period. It sounds also crazy but we were living in a hotel and\nin the same hotel we had Italian soldiers and they were very, very nice. They were not\ntoo interested in what the directives were from the Nazi government. I remember them\ngiving me chocolate and I used to go up with them and play with them. I mean they were\njust very lovely people. And we were together but the remnants of that previous\nexperience were there with me and so by that time I was eight or so and I was wetting my\nbed and I was screaming, having nightmares every night and waking up and screaming\neven though the days were fairly happy, the nights were just terrible, really terrible. But\nthat stands out as a nice time in Nice because we were all together and we would go to\nthe beach and I wasn't at the time fully realizing -- we lived pretty much for the present.\nAs a child in general you don't anticipate much in the future, you know, at that age. We\nwere together and we were having a good time. I could not imagine that first of all things\nwould get worse again and that was not a temporary arrangement, that it wasn't a full\ntime solution to the problem.",
        "Q: I don't understand Nice was under Italian occupation, Italian German occupation?",
        "A: Right. But Italian, not German. The Germans came in later, so it really was strictly\nItalian.",
        "Q: Did you have total freedom as Jews at this time?",
        "A: Officially no because the official party line of the Italian Nazi government with\nMussolini was also that Jews had to be deported and rounded up, but the orders were not\nquite as effective and there was very little discipline in the Italian army, and those people\nwho were in the army just couldn't care less whether we were Jews or something else.\nThey simply couldn't care less so we were supposed to officially hide that we were Jews,\nbut they knew fully well we were and I think we were fairly free to go and do as we\npleased. I'm not sure, I think that the order of deportation sort of depended on your\nnationality and so my parents at the time might have become Czechoslovakian or\nsomething like that and giving me a different name and that name I don't remember. If\nyou had Czechoslovakian papers it really didn't matter at the time whether you were\nJewish or not. For a short period of time the authorities respected the nationality versus\nyour ethnic background. That didn't last, but for a short period of time it was that way and\nthe soldiers who were supposed to execute the orders couldn't care less. I mean they just\ndid not round up people.",
        "Q: So, you were in Nice leading what you felt was a pretty nice life in the daytime anyway\u2019?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember about how long you were there?",
        "A: I would say also about ten months or so approximately and then when Italy capitulated\nand the Germans came marching in through the part of France that had previously been\noccupied by the Italians.",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: The end of --must have been the beginning of '44 or somewhere around there, I think.\nThe war was over in '45 and we were in for perhaps a year, so I'd say'44\nor so, but maybe you can check the accuracy of that. At that point the news spread rather\nquickly that -- well they already knew what the Germans were doing to various people in\nvarious other places, so when they heard that Germans were coming they decided to run\nand again try to get to Switzerland the second time around. Things moved very quickly\nso 1t also became known that entire families were subject to being arrested and they\nwould be preferable for women and children were still sort of led through without being\nbothered or had a better chance. So, my mother and her friend and neighbor and my two\nlittle friends, we decided to leave from these to a border town Switzerland and to leave\nthe men behind and they were going to try and find someway to get there, not by public\ntransportation but try to arrange some kind of private way to join us. From there we were\ngoing to try and get through to Switzerland together. So, the train trip was uneventful, I\nmean my mother and myself and her friend and her two little children went along and we\ngot to a place where I don't know if we stayed in a hotel or I don't know where we stayed\nexactly. In the meantime my father and his friend was going to come by ambulance.\nThey had found someone who was going to drive an ambulance and take them as being\nill. So, they established a point of meeting which was a block from the hotel where we\nhad stayed. My father for some really stupid reason decided to go back to his hotel room\nbecause he had forgotten his prayer shawl and his , and when he got to\nthe hotel the Germans were there. So, he didn't make it. They arrested him. Apparently\nMr. waited until the evening and then the ambulance driver says I'm\nnot going to stay any longer because we're going to get picked up. So, they left and they\ncame and dropped off Mr. Shimmer wherever we were. And then I remember this most\nhorrendous scene of my mother collapsing when she saw him come in alone. She\nimmediately knew that something was very, very wrong. I just remember her just totally\ngoing completely hysterical and screaming and pulling out her hair and to me this was\njust the most frightening because I just came out from something that was relatively safe,\nand it just was everything fell apart. We stayed together for a while with those people\nand the family had their parents at least. The woman had her parents in Switzerland and\nso they decided to really push on and try to get to Switzerland and my mother at that\npoint said she didn't care anymore. She just didn't care, and she decided to stay put in\n, which was the town where we were at. At that point we got papers\nfrom people who proceeded us and who we paid a lot of money to get those fake papers.\nSo, we changed our name again.",
        "Q: To a French name?",
        "A: A French name so my name was . I had one or two names in\nbetween but I just don't remember and that was a terrible thing because they tell you you\nare no longer such and such but you are such and such, and you keep repeating it to\nyourself until you actually believe that you are this other person. It gets extremely\nconfusing. At that point, I must have been around eight or so, eight and half, and I mean\nI was very angry. At that point I just became very, very angry about everything and we\nmoved into an apartment in a private house where they were -- actually 1t was owned by\nthe people who lived downstairs and there were two floors above. The first floor was\ninhabited by a Jewish family who were German Jews. They had become French, but they\nwere German Jews originally, and then we had an apartment which was not really a real\napartment but just under the roof where the roof actually meets the floor. It's called\n, like an attic apartment essentially. I don't know if we had three or\nfour rooms there, but really two rooms maybe, just two room, one which was an\neverything room and one which was a bedroom. We stayed there pretty much to the end\nof the war with the false identity and at that time, my mother became involved with the\nresistance not officially part of it but harboring people who were in the resistance and\nalso harboring a lot of people who were in transient trying to get to Switzerland. She\nwould provide them with hiding place and with food and when they left they left their\npapers behind and we'd get their ration cards for food. So, at that point, we were really\nwealthy in terms of food availability. It was a time for me where I was pretty much like a\nstreet child. I did whatever I wanted. I was supposed to go to school but I never did. I\nmean I said I was going but I played hookey and I was hanging out with sort of the worst\ncharacters of the town, but compared to what worst characters are now, I guess they were\npretty mild. But we just would go and hide and play. We'd play three musketeers and\nwe'd play all these fighting games. I didn't go to school, I just never showed up, and\nwhen I was there I was so disruptive that they used to throw me out, so it really didn't\nmatter. But I learned how to read by myself. Two things I was doing. I was reading\nvoraciously. I didn't understand a thing of what I was reading. I just simply didn't\nunderstand. I was just reading books and books. Whatever it was, it didn't matter what it\nwas. It could have been the phone book. It didn't matter. It was an escape, you know,\nand I could just not be in the present. It was away from everything. I had another friend\nthen who lived nearby. I was friends with all the village kids, basically. Then, the people\nwho were renting us the place were very, very nice. They were French, but they\npretended not to know, but they knew of course that we were Jewish. They never\nquestioned anything, but they knew and I used to go to church with them on Sundays\nbecause it was kind of accepted and would be better that I would show up. And my\nmother's French was not great. It still has a very foreign accent, whereas I as a child had\nreally become completely fluent from that time in Nice and in that home I was perfectly\nfluent so I could pass for French kid easily. They thought it would be a good idea for me\nto go to church, so at least the child goes even if the mother doesn't show up. I was quite\ntaken by that service. As much as I had been anti-religious to my own religion, there was\nsomething very comforting about the church and the priests and there was a very safe\nfeeling in that big building and the way the voices resounded. That I remember that\nfeeling for the church. Now, I hate the catholic church, but I really felt very comforted\nby that whole atmosphere. The daughter of the people who were renting the place to us\nhad her solemn communion as they call it, and I was very envious. They wore this white\ndress and this white veil and to me this was like I don't know, utopia, to be able to do all\nthese things.",
        "Q: Do you think unconsciously anyway that you knew these people were not being\nannihilated the way Jews were.",
        "A: Oh, I knew that going to church was a safe thing that once you belonged to that group\nyou were Okay. So, I guess it was wanting to be safe and wanting to be part of another\ngroup. I mean I knew that I couldn't tell who I was. And, as I said, I was really very\nangry and I was very nasty. One of the people that my mother had taken in in the\nmeantime until they got someone to take them to Switzerland was extremely fearful for\ngood reasons and was not leaving the apartment at all. I mean it was just really\nsequestered and would not go out. My mother was circulating freely with her fake\npapers. I mean if they would really look into it they would have found that her French\nwas not great and she would have been picked up, but she braved it so to speak. I\ncertainly could pass for a French kid, but this man and his wife were there and they were\nabsolutely petrified. He, in particular was just I mean, he wouldn't leave and we had\ncurfews where we had all the windows and so on, and I used to come home supposedly\nfrom school, but from wherever I was hanging out and I would scream at the top of my\nlungs for him to come down and I used to tell him that he had to carry my bookcase up. I\nhad this little thing, and if he didn't I was going to give him away to the Germans. You\ncould see the warped feelings that in some way I could pass for not being Jewish. I\nconvinced myself that I was catholic and I was going to be find. I also knew this wasn't\ntrue, but somehow I took it out on this poor guy who was really terribly frightened. I\nmean I can still see myself standing at the foot of those stairs and screaming, you come\nthere and pick up my bag and if you don't I'm going to tell on you. He would come, you\nknow, he would just come. He didn't know what to say.",
        "Q: You were trying to exercise some sort of control?",
        "A: Yes, like I could go out and he couldn't. But deep inside I knew this was just really not\ntrue, but somehow we managed to fake him out a little longer and he didn't have papers\nand he did nothing and he didn't know French, and he looked real Jewish. He would have\nbeen picked up very quickly. In incidents like that where I was just doing really nasty,\nvery nasty things. They were really a way of saying, you know, I can do what I want\nbasically. I'm not going to school. I can just do whatever. Nobody can tell me what to\ndo. There were some terrible moments for me because my mother was frequently gone,\nand I never knew if she was going to come back, and there were nights where there were\nalarms for bomb raids, and those were really horrible. They were just just horrible. I\nwould be totally, totally petrified and I had to run to the shelter by myself. I was afraid to\nget out of bed let alone -- it was all in the dark-- let alone go down the stairs and go to the\nshelter by myself. I usually managed to somehow make it to the people below and we'd\ngo together. So, when she wasn't home, but then to go back to my place. I mean she\ndidn't want to always say that she was leaving, you know, to the other people. You don't\nknow. They could put a trace on her. She was going to Switzerland. She was getting\nwatches and she was then going to Paris and she was selling them. She was doing all\nsorts of weird things just to get some money to survive, and she was helping people get\nacross the border, so she really never wanted to say what she was doing and she didn't tell\nme either. She would just tell me I'll be back as soon as I can, but to an eight year old,\nthat's not that reassuring particularly having been separation where I didn't know if I ever\nwas going to see her again having seen her reaction to my father's disappearance and\nknowing that that certainly was not really good. I was really scared, I mean really, really\nscared.",
        "Q: Was the bomb shelter in your building or in the town?",
        "A: It was not in the building, 1t was somewhere further away. I don't exactly know where it\nwas, but we had to go walk in the dark, run basically and to this day I must say that I'm\nstill afraid of the dark. If I'm in the house alone, I'll have every light on. I just won't be --\nI really have to talk to myself to be able to turn off all the lights and say nothing will\nhappen. We were in the dark because of curfew to begin with and then you weren't going\nto start taking flashlights going to a shelter. That was really better.",
        "Q: The Jewish family on the first floor, did people know they were Jewish?",
        "A: Well, they looked awfully Jewish, but they were French citizens and so they thought -- I\ndon't remember, or I don't think that papers in France said that you were Jewish. The\nFrench documents, I don't think that they mentioned religion but I'm not sure. They\nlooked awfully Jewish, because she had a wig, but he was a lawyer and he was a very\ndistinguished gentleman, German origin, and perhaps he thought that was going to save\nthem. It turned out that he was picked up a day or two before the liberation and he never\nmade it back.",
        "Q: Did you help your mom with any of these activities in small ways or --?",
        "A: Well, I'm sure I helped just with housekeeping things. I'm sure I did some of the\nshopping where she'd send me to buy food. I remember going to the grocery store and\ndoing all of that stuff. In a more concrete way in terms of I mean I remember seeing all\nthese people, being upset because sometimes we had ten twelve people sleeping in one\nroom. We had five or six people in one bed, so I was not thrilled and I did sort of\nthreaten some of these people, but for the most part I was probably helping her as much\nas I could. I know that as I said I'm sure I did the shopping and I brought food home and\nI helped her with cleaning up and that sort of thing. I didn't go to Paris with her to sell\nwatches.",
        "Q: It's interesting that your mother, as you described it, really fell apart when she didn't see\nyour father, and yet it sounds like she was pretty courageous.",
        "A: She was extremely courageous but she was courageous throughout but that first impact,\nthat first shock and this is what I remember. Now, I think there's nothing worse for a\nchild than to see the mother fall apart. As long as the mother is still in tact then they\nknow they have somebody to lean on. I realize at that moment that something terrible\nhad happened to my father but I didn't realize exactly what but when I saw her, it just hit\nme like a sledge hammer. She was really gone. I mean she was just not -- I don't know\nthat it lasted a few hours and maybe the next day she sort of composed herself and she\ncertainly picked up the pieces and went on and survived, and not only survived but\nhelped me survive. There is no question about it, I would not survive without her.",
        "Q: When you think back on the kind of person your mother is, do you think it was\npredictable that she would get so involved in illicit activities like this?",
        "A: No, not at all. But one thing about her is that even though she came from this small\nvillage from this very orthodox background, she was quite somewhat of a maverick\nwithin her generation. She was orphaned very early, I don't know if she told you that, but\nshe was about six years old when her mother passed away, mother and one brother went\nwith the Russian flu, so she was very young at the time. She became really the\nhousekeeper for her father for a short period of time, his mother came and took care of\nthe household, and then she got killed in some stupid accident. She got kicked in the\nbelly by a horse. She went to market, so she lost her grandmother maybe a year after\nthat. So, she really became the woman of the house at age eight or nine or something, so\nshe was quite independent. She had to be. She's a really intelligent person and she was\nalways interested in a lot of things so she became interested in zionism, and so she took\nHebrew lessons secretly because it certainly was considered inappropriate for a girl to do\nthat. So let's say that it's not totally out of character to do things which one would not\nhave expected of a woman of that generation and that background. She adapted. She\nlearned Hebrew, she learned French. She even learned English at that point on her own.\nShe didn't have any formal schooling, and she's really a very educated person and it's all\nself made. I think that she had no inclinations to be a delinquent let's say but certainly to\ntake charge of herself when needed, and so she did. This was the only thing that was\nopened to her, so she did that. I mean the smuggling of the watches with the resistance\nthat was really self preservation. I think to some extent she I don't know that she really\ncared that much about herself at that point. I think she just forgot about herself. She just\ndid things for the wider picture if you wish, but she was no longer afraid for herself. She\nsort of thought well, you know the worst has happened as far as her husband 1s\nconcerned. She had to leave her father behind in Belgium. She couldn't take him\nbecause he wouldn't come. He had to cut his beard off and he wouldn't do that so he\nstayed behind. She already had lost her mother and a brother so somehow she felt it\ndoesn't matter anymore. There was her child, and so I think she did a lot for me, for my\nsake.",
        "Q: Even though the people like your landlord who probably looked the other way and knew\nyou were Jewish and was very kind, he must have had some concerns about all the people\ncoming in and out of your attic apartment.",
        "A: He might have, but I wasn't aware of any frictions. That she could tell you much better.\nI was very welcome in their household. These people were -- he had been a fighter in\nWorld War I and he had actually lost a leg or suffered a severe injury so he was limping\nor had a wooden leg. I just remember him limping rather heavily, and she was just a very\nsweet lady and they could not have children. In fact their daughter was a adopted one.\nShe was one of 14. The woman's sister had 14 children so she adopted her youngest.\nThen I was sort of a welcome addition in a sense because she had hoped to have a large\nhousehold with a lot of children, and she didn't. I felt so good in that household. It was\nvery warm and just normal. Basically it was just normal. So, that I really always felt\nvery good there, and my mother still writes to them every Christmas. Every Christmas\nshe sends them a box of chocolates. The older couple is now gone, but the one girl, the\none whose communion I envied so much is now a grandmother. She's in her 60s. I don't\nthink there could have been too much antagonism. Like I said, he fought in World War I\nand he was not very fond of the Germans at all, and he was a really strong French patriot\nand this invasion did not sit too well with him, and he was sort of in a way sorry that he\nwas too old to fight. So, I think in that sense, he knew we were Jewish, but he wasn't\nquite too sure and all that activity to him sort of looked like a good thing in the sense of\nbeing resisting the occupation. Although he wasn't personally involved in my\nknowledge, he sort of turned away. They were in their 60s at the time I think. They\nlooked very old to me, but again, now that I'm going to 58, it doesn't look that old.",
        "Q: How did you hear about the liberation?",
        "A: I'm not sure how, but I remember that we all were dancing in the streets of\n. The entire town was there and there was really a jubilation and I didn't\nfully -- so I guess it came over the radio and all the people from the resistance knew that\nthe end was near.",
        "Q: Do you remember when this was?",
        "A: It was May 8 of '45, I think.",
        "Q: This area wasn't liberated until then?",
        "A: No, I don't think so. It was the final -- 1t was when they gave up. There was no liberation\nthere in France. I mean they were there until the very last, because they picked up this\ngentleman, my neighbor, a few days before, literally a few days before. She had a baby\nright then after he was gone and something really very moving. My mother went to the\nmaternity with her, for the delivery, and he turned 50, this young man just recently and\nhis mother lives in Israel and so does he and the mother called up my mother from Israel\nto remind her of the night when she gave birth that she had been present at that time.\nThat was 40 years ago, so that '44, the end of '44 beginning of '45. I don't think it was\nliberated before that.\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2",
        "A: When we went back to Belgium on that final trip back, we stopped again, me and my\ncomplete negative and angry nasty self, we stopped several times on the road to drink and\nat one point the only thing that was available was beer and I said I would rather die than\ndrink beer.",
        "Q: Which might have been the choice.",
        "A: A person told me well, maybe you're just going to have to do that. Maybe you're just\ngoing to have to die because that's all we had. Telling me, a nasty kid.",
        "Q: Okay, just to backtrack a bit from where we stopped the tape, upon liberation your first\nmemory 1s everyone dancing in the streets.",
        "A: Yes. I remember just elation. That's the feeling for everybody and sadness. My\nneighbor because she had no trace of her husband, and I remember that and I remember\nmy mother leaving and going back to Belgium and telling me that she was going to find\nmy father.",
        "Q: You were all alone then?",
        "A: At that point I remained with the landlords. I was in the apartment, but in the same\nhouse. I had been pretty much alone for a long time, so at that point I wasn't even all that\nscared because it sounded good. So, as I said my mother came back. I don't know how\nlong she was gone, whether it was a week or a month. I don't know. She said we are\ngoing back. She had found my dad and that was that. So, we went back and finding him\nwas the real disappointment, because he had changed from the memories. I mean I had\nthis illusion you know as a four year old child your father and the way he was involved\nwith me and he was really -- he was not the same person and by then I was nine years old\nand I could see things very differently. He came back. I saw him, he had no hair. His\nteeth were shaking. He looked like a skeleton. He just looked frightening to me, very\nfrightening.",
        "Q: Where had he been?",
        "A: He had been in Auschwitz mostly. And, he was extremely -- he had become very\nimpatient and irritable and I just wanted to cling to him and it was broken. It just wasn't\nthere anymore. We were just coming from different places all together, and he had\nbecome even more religious and rigid about it. I had at that point completely rejected. I\nmean I just couldn't deal with that at all. I was doing whatever I wanted during the war.\nCertainly not observing the Sabbath, and all of a sudden we're back to not turning on\nlights, and not going to the movies on Saturday and all that sort of stuff. I yust couldn't\ndeal with that at all. I mean I just couldn't deal with that. So, we had lots of fights, really\na big arguments and right after we came back we lived in a place that belonged to one of\nthe people that we had met in , a Jewish lady whose husband did not come\nback and who had owned a house with her husband and so we lived in that place and I\nremember the three of us, my mom, my dad, and I sleeping in the bed and he was having\nthe worse nightmares and he would scream int he middle of the night and of course I\nwould just relive all my terrors. It was just not what I had hoped for or what my fantasies\nhad about how it was going to be when my dad came back. The reality was very, very\ndifferent. Not only that, we pretty much had no money so we had very cheap bed and the\nbed would collapse every so often so between the screaming and the collapsing bed I\nmean it was really terrible and we didn't have any warm water. We just had a pump in\nthe kitchen. It really was very primitive. And then in my view what really made things\ncompletely disastrous was when my father found out about his surviving relatives in\nRussia. He sent for them, and where I was really craving just my mom and my dad, all of\na sudden these people descended upon us. There were two brothers, a sister and a\ngrandfather, and we all lived together. There were ten people every day, all the time\nwithout any space for anybody. It was literally a nightmare. To me, this was a\nnightmare. I resented them for a long time. I mean there was nothing else to do but I\nreally couldn't say I was very thrilled with that whole set up and then to top it off, my\nbrother was born. My mother couldn't handle it. She simply couldn't handle the food for\nall these people, so I essentially was trusted as the permanent babysitter for my brother. I\nwas in charge of him basically. I had nothing to say about it. I had to feed him and dress\nhim and just take care of him, except for going to school. Things were just not great.\nThen, at that point, all my fears came through. I could not stay alone. I tried, I remember\nthat my parents wanted to go for a walk on a Friday night after dinner and I would say\nsure I'll stay, and as soon as they walked out I was just overcome by such fear that I\nwould just scream by myself in the house and my neighbor upstairs would come and get\nme. I was trying. I always said, sure you can go. I'm fine. I'm great, no problem. As\nsoon as maybe five minutes after they walked it would just come and engulf me and I\ncouldn't really function very well. Then school was another nightmare because we were\npeople of all ages put into the same class. Now, I was put in the right grade for my age,\nbut I really knew nothing. I just knew how to read because I had read -- and I spoke\nFrench beautifully because finally I began to understand what I was reading and I\ndeveloped a very nice vocabulary. So, on account of that they decided to put me in the\nproper grade for my age. I knew nothing, so I was in school feeling like I was among --\njust what am I doing here. I don't know, but I made it. I don't know how I made it. I just\npicked up whatever had to picked up and there were people there who were speaking\nPolish and there were people speaking Yiddish and there were those who were speaking\nGerman and I was speaking French. The teachers were themselves, they came from\nconcentration camps or other places. They didn't know anything about anything except\nthey had sticks and when they misbehaved they hit us.",
        "Q: This was the Jewish school?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: They just rounded up whom they could find as teachers and there were no one that you\ncould really call a teacher. But I don't know, I just somehow started to click and I\nbecame their prize student, so that was another thing that I always had this thing of taking\nout this anger in some way, so they had these donors, these potential donors and they\nwere trying to raise funds. It was a private school, so they would parade the bright kids\naround and they didn't have that many. This was like an ape in the circus, do this trick\nand do this trick. I would recite, they would ask me a question and I would always know\nthe answers. Then, after that, there was nothing in terms of discipline that I would obey.\nWe had these individual benches you know, and I would just run across on top of the\nbenches and teachers would run after me with a ruler. I mean some of these teachers are\nstill alive and when they see me they say all this grey hair is from you. I mean, I was just\nimpossible. When I think about it now, really I under normal circumstances would have\ngone to a reform school or something. It sort of calmed down and at that point,\nsomewhere around the age of nine or so or ten I said I'm going to do something with me\nlife. I'm not just going to be a housewife and sit here passively and have some guy tell\nme what to do.",
        "Q: At age 10?",
        "A: Yes. I had a big argument with my mother's friends who told me I should think of getting\nmarried when I'm 18. I said no way, not ever, and I decided to get there I had to get to a\nbetter school, and so I was in that school for two years. This time in Belgium it's divided\ninto six and six. Elementary and then high school is six years, and I decided to go to the\npublic high school. The public high school which was at the time considered the top high\nschool because from that one you could go straight to university without having to take\nspecial entrance examinations. So, after two years I applied to that high school which\nwas unfortunately in Flemish and that was a language I didn't know at all. So, the only\nFlemish I knew was from talking to the cleaning woman who used to come once a week\nand that was the extent of it. But I made it. I mean I got in somehow. I guess I faked it.\nWhenever I think about it objectively I should have never gotten in there because my\nknowledge of everything was completely sporadic and having big gaps in various places.\nI never learned how to do multiplication, things like that. Big, big gaps, but I got into\nhigh school, because it wasn't automatic. You had to apply to get into that particular\nschool. So, but there was anti-semitism in the high school.",
        "Q: After the war?",
        "A: After the war, quite a bit, and there was only two Jewish girls in that whole school,\nanother one and myself. We really had a tough time. It took us years to be accepted and\nto make friends only a few friends we made on the whole the atmosphere was not\nwelcoming at all, not at all.",
        "Q: Were you blamed for the war?",
        "A: No, but for instance my dad was religious at the time there was school on Saturdays, and\nhe didn't allow me to go. It was a horror show. I already had missed so much school\nthroughout my life and of course they put Latin and Greek and math and whatnot on\nSaturday. This really is not easy, and the teachers refused to help. I mean I would have\nto go every Saturday night -- I mean that's why I became even less attracted to the\nreligion. I had to go and beg from some girl who really didn't want to give me her notes\nfor all the lectures that had been given that day and then try to work it out on my own\nbecause my father didn't know anything and my mother didn't know anything about that\nstuff. The teachers just said, her statement was, \"Well, you Jewish girls don't want to\ncome to school on Saturday, you just work it out. It's not my problem.\" It makes you\nfeel that after all that hearing this business about Jewish girls -- 1t was a secular school, it\nwasn't a school that was under any kind of religious aegis or directives. That's what the\npublic school was. It was a secular school where there was religion given according to\nwhat you wanted so there was one hour you could choose either religion or ethics so you\ndidn't have to attend -- because there was a catholic school system just as there is one\nhere an official catholic school system. So, the people who were there, weren't even\nobservant, but they still had a feeling that we were foreigners. Essentially the feeling was\nthat we were foreigners. We were different and foreign. We did not feel very well there,\nreally not, and then later they opened a Jewish high school and most Jewish kids now go\nto the Jewish high school, which is now fully accepted.",
        "Q: Still?",
        "A: Yes, oh yes. They go to a Jewish high school, which the Jewish high school is accepted.\nIt's a completely official school and they can get from there to the university, again\nwithout entrance examinations, so and that's what I had wanted but there wasn't anything\nat the time. We were, as I said, in fifth grade, everybody was together, all ages, all\nlanguages. This high school developed just a few years after I started high school.",
        "Q: What happened to your grandfather?",
        "A: My grandfather I think was essentially beaten to death. My mother's father, the one\nwho's picture is there. He refused his son, my mother's brother, left I believe it was the\nlast boat that left Antwerp and they went to Brazil and then somehow got to the states,\nand he didn't want to go because you had to cut your beard to get on that boat. I think\nwhen we fled, he refused to come for the same reason and so apparently my mother had\nasked a neighbor, a non Jewish neighbor to take care of him and she said she would but\nshe heard when she came back to Belgium that he had essentially been beaten to death on\nthe streets.",
        "Q: What other aspects to your life during these years do you think are real important to\nremember?",
        "A: You mean during the war years?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: In what sense.",
        "Q: I don't know if I have all the right questions. I think that we covered the areas that I had\nsome idea about, and if there's anything else that you think would be useful to record that\nI haven't asked you, I want you to feel free to say it.",
        "A: In terms of who I am today, I would have liked all this activity around survivors of the\nwar whatever events took part in their own lives to happen earlier because even as I tell\nthese things and some of these things bring tears to my eyes so that 1 know that I still feel\nthem, but they're not -- I think I'm now perhaps able and it hasn't been that long -- able to\nassociate my reactions to trauma and whatever from the past. So, it's hard for me to say\nnow. The worst part of it was the fear, you know the absolute terror that I can still invoke\ncertain times thinking back particularly --the salient points were in that home where I just\ndidn't know where anybody was. And then when my dad was taken. These were just\nterrible, terrible moments. I know that until he died, my father -- I had many, many\nnightmares about anticipating his death that they were just really terrible and I was acting\nirrationally during many years in relation to him in terms of being so afraid that he would\ndie that I could not even enjoy when I was near him. He wasn't a well man, although he\npulled together and rebuilt a life for himself and helped his brothers build their own lives,\nso he did a tremendous job. I couldn't even appreciate any of this. I was just always\nafraid of losing him so that was sort of something that marred my life for a long time. In\nfact, I think I was liberated from that feeling only when he died. When he finally died, I\nsort of gained some peace which seems sort of crazy, but that's what happened. When he\ndied, I said okay that's over. He's really gone and he's not coming back. That's it.",
        "Q: Are you at all religious today?",
        "A: No, I'm not, but I observe the traditions because I think they're pretty and perhaps only\nrecently I have trouble with dogma in general. I have trouble with authority, but there is\nsort of a deeper philosophy which guides the lives of those who are truly religious and I\nreally don't refer to people who are shut off from the outside world like or\nthat type of think. I'm thinking of my brother who is really an exceptional human being\nin that he lives his religion. This is who he is in terms of his interaction with his wife and\nhis children, his family. He lives in Jerusalem because that's the only place where he can\nbe the full Jew in his view, but he's politically left wing so -- and when I see him, there's\na deep meaning to the rituals that is not the superficial type of thing that many people see\nand rebel against which is the things that I rebel against. You can't go here, things that\nlook totally idiotic to me. It's a lot easier to take an elevator let's say for a person my\nmother's age and condition than to walk upstairs. That kind of thing, but when you go\ndeeper and you make it part of an entire frame work and what it means, then I'm\nbeginning to appreciate it although I think I live my life in a certain way in that sense, in\nterms of how I relate to my mother and to my family and I'm really a very good friend.\nPeople know that I'm really a loyal friend, that you couldn't have a more loyal friend. But\nI have no inclination to do the ritual, but I do like to go to synagogue on high holidays\nonly because I identify with the group, because I like to be identified with the Jewish\npeople. I'm proud of them. But not in terms of observing the things that I consider\ninterfering with the conduct of modern life.",
        "Q: The obvious reason I asked that was clearly during the war years you appeared to be a\nlittle bit resentful of it and sort of embraced the security of the catholic church and all\nthese other things and I think people certain people after the Holocaust felt stronger about\ntheir Judaism, some felt irrelevant.",
        "A: I don't want any part of it.",
        "Q: Or they had been abandoned by it.",
        "A: I think those that felt abandoned by it I felt abandoned by it, but as I said the story about\nmy grandfather and the angels, I was maybe four years old when I asked him that, which\nI mean this is a logical question to ask. Where are your angels, and there's no logical\nanswer to that. So, then of course there was no time to practice the religion after that\nwhole incident because we weren't supposed to be Jews anymore. That's one of the\nthings I resented when my dad came back. I embraced catholicism only because it\nrepresented a safe haven and not because of anything that had to do with Jesus or\nanything like that, didn't appeal to me very much. What appealed to me really was the\nritual and not the content. What appeals to me in Judaism really is more the content and\nnot the ritual. The ethics behind it and so I think I'm a very Jewish person and I don't\nhide that anywhere. Perhaps if I were in a place where nobody observed anything I\nwould do it just to express my Judaism to the rest of the world that way, but I don't feel\nthat I have to do that. But as I said, I do identify with the group, so --my mother says that\nafter the war my little girlfriend, the one that I had spent all this time with in the home\nand so on and we stayed friends for a while after. She became religious and I wasn't, but\na certain point in time we were going to synagogue for the high holidays and our mothers\nwould try and make us pray and we would just giggle. I mean that's all we'd do, we'd\ngiggle. We could just not do pray or do anything. Then when I went to study, I left\nhome and I went to Switzerland and the very first Rosh Hoshana Eve I went to\nsynagogue. I didn't even go inside. I stayed outside the entire time, but I was there. You\nknow, I just felt that I had to express that I was part of that group but I wasn't going to\npray because the prayers meant nothing to me. The prayers are sometimes very pretty if\nyou look at them in terms of poetry, but I really don't believe in God. I really don't\nbelieve in that at all. So, my religion would be expressed in terms of how people should\nrelate to one another and nothing to do with some superior being. I'm a scientist and I\ndon't believe in that at all.",
        "Q: Anything else you want to add?",
        "A: Well, the only thing is that you can overcome anything. You at some point have to take\nresponsibility for your own life, no matter how bad. If you do that, you won't be alone.\nIf you persist in living in the past and saying that you can't do anything and nothing is\ngoing to work out because you went through this terrible thing, then you will remain\nstagnate and people will shy away from you and you'll just be a very lonely person. I like\nto be with people. I don't like to be alone. That's all I have to say.",

        "A: This is my mom and dad's wedding picture and I think that occurred in 1934 something\nlike that, in Antwerp. These are my fraternal grandparents, grandfather, grandmother,\nuncles, aunts. That was taken in Poland. It must have been around '34 or '35 because my\nfather is no longer on that picture. He had moved to Belgium by then. This is my\nmaternal grandfather, my mom and dad, my mom's brother and his wife. The baby on the\nold man's lap is myself and the three children that are standing are my cousins. They are\nmy mother's brother's children. I assume, I was born in '36, it had to be, I was close to six\nmonths to a year. That's the town in France where we stayed when we didn't make it to\nSwitzerland. That was the place.",

The one on the right is in which is a town where my mother and\nI spent the last year of the war approximately. This picture is the center 1s my\ngrandfather and it's essentially many of the same people that appeared in that previous\npicture.

        "Q: This was the Jewish school?",
        "Q: They just rounded up whom they could find as teachers and there were no one that you\ncould really call a teacher. But I don't know, I just somehow started to click and I\nbecame their prize student, so that was another thing that I always had this thing of taking\nout this anger in some way, so they had these donors, these potential donors and they\nwere trying to raise funds. It was a private school, so they would parade the bright kids\naround and they didn't have that many. This was like an ape in the circus, do this trick\nand do this trick. I would recite, they would ask me a question and I would always know\nthe answers. Then, after that, there was nothing in terms of discipline that I would obey.\nWe had these individual benches you know, and I would just run across on top of the\nbenches and teachers would run after me with a ruler. I mean some of these teachers are\nstill alive and when they see me they say all this grey hair is from you. I mean, I was just\nimpossible. When I think about it now, really I under normal circumstances would have\ngone to a reform school or something. It sort of calmed down and at that point,\nsomewhere around the age of nine or so or ten I said I'm going to do something with me\nlife. I'm not just going to be a housewife and sit here passively and have some guy tell\nme what to do.",

    "answers": [
        "A: Okay, well my name during the war was -- I had several names, but the name I was born\nto was Annaliza and I was born in Antwerp Belgium in December 1936.",
        "A: No, only very sporadic memories of my father and memories that perhaps are based on\nstories more than memories but I do think I have very clear pictures of going to the park\nwith my dad and playing with him and doing things that normally you would expect a\nboy to do with a father rather than a little girl and I thought that people usually ask me\nwhy I chose a profession that I chose and although my father was a very orthodox Jewish\nman and certainly would have never admitted to that feeling I think that I was his first\nborn and I think he considered me in some ways his son. I remember the feeling of going\nto the park and playing with him and him being perhaps more involved with a child,\nparticularly a man of his generation than you'd expect him to be particularly with a girl.\nThat's what I remember.",
        "A: Yes. I remember having two dear little friends who lived with us in the same house, and\nmy grandfather and just pictures mostly not -- I remember I had a little friend who's\nexactly my age a few months older and his sister who was two years younger and we\nlived in the same house and we were constantly fighting cats and dogs. We couldn't be\nwithout one another. So, we almost really always be together and I also remember that I\ndidn't like dolls and I used to get dolls and I used to give them to my little girlfriend. She\nloved the dolls. That's what I remember. I remember being very comfortable. I'm sure\nwe were not comfortable I mean financially but I had a very nice feeling about the\nfamily. I mean just my grandfather was a very sweet old man. He used to tell me stories.\nThat's basically all I remember.",
        "A: I'm not sure. I think he started out delivering milk and learning how to be a diamond\ncutter or something of the sort. He was very, very religious. I remember that. He was\nalways going to synagogue, coming from synagogue and praying an awful lot. In my\nhead it seemed like too much. It seemed like not a very tense life. He was going to work\nand coming home and we observed the Sabbath. We would always go for walks in the\npark and things of that sort.",
        "A: I was strictly Jewish community before the war and to my knowledge, I don't think my\nparents knew anyone that wasn't Jewish except in an official capacity. I don't know,\npostman, policeman, -- no social interaction with non-Jews at all.",
        "A: Yes. The ones I knew. I mean I was a kid so I don't remember everybody who lived\nthere but I would say the majority were Jewish.",
        "A: The only one is a story that my mom told me and that sort of became an indication of my\nearly rebellion and that was at some point during these --right either at the beginning of\nthe war or the pre-war period my grandfather was beaten up on the way back from\nsynagogue or threatened or harassed and he I think people were pulling at his beard and\nhe hid his beard in his coat. When he came home, he looked really terrible and very\nupset and he had told me that this was a Friday night that Friday night when men used to\ngo to the synagogue they had a couple of angels who were watching over them and\nwalking with them to and from synagogue. So, when he came back beaten and so on, I\nasked him Grandfather where were your angels then. So, that picture remained with me,\nhis frightened look and the statement that I made then, I don't remember having made it,\nbut it fits with the way I think. So, and several people that I have met, in fact recently,\nvery recently just about three months ago when I was last in Belgium said you are this\nlittle girl who said that. They remember that statement. That's the only evidence I have\nof anti-semitism that touched us directly but before I really don't know.",
        "A: I don't think he said anything. He didn't say anything.",
        "A: Yes, I did. Both my mother and I wore it I think after the men, -- the husband of this\nneighbor and my dad were taken I think to go to a work camp, and we had to wear the\nstar. One picture I have of that is that she used to always carry me over her should to\nhide her star so that we would travel in the trolley or something and she would carry me\nso that her star and mine were essentially hidden to avoid being harassed 1n the streets.\nShe'd always do that, carry me.",
        "A: I remember having to leave in the middle of the night and walking through woods and\nbeing petrified and having German shepherds, hearing German shepherds barking in the\ndistance and dragging and running through woods. I remember that, so I remember the\nGerman voices and the dogs, particularly the dogs and until maybe ten years ago I had to\nrun if I saw any dog or heard a dog. So, I've overcome that too, but I really was very\nshaken by a dog. I couldn't go in a room -- and particularly a German shepherd, I would\njust freeze. I would completely decompensate so I remember that. I don't remember the\nstreets of Belgium per se. I remember the terror of what appeared -- I saw my mother\nbeing frightened and I became completely petrified. I remember that march through the\nwoods and ending up in some abandoned home somewhere and being there with a lot, a\nlot of people. I don't remember who these people were except for those friends that we\nwere living with basically.",
        "A: Yes, we were running to try and escape because at some point after the two husbands had\ngone to work, during that period some people came into the house and they weren't really\nNazis, but they pretended to be Gestapo and they beat up everyone in the house. My\nmother and my grandfather and me and they were really beating us and I remember\nscreaming and my mother screaming. They finally left. They ransacked the place and\nthey were looking for money and so on. They got in on the pretense of being Gestapo\nand --",
        "A: Yes, they were just Belgium police or Belgium hoodlums, not necessarily in any kind of\nofficial capacity. They might have just done that. This was a good time to do that. I\nmean it was perfectly acceptable. So, at that time my mother I think and her friend\ndecided to leave and try to join the husbands and I think that this is when we went to\nFrance with the idea of trying to get to Switzerland because Switzerland was a safe place.\nIf I remember when we got to the rondeveax essentially of where we were supposed to\nmeet our fathers and someone to take us across the border, someone had betrayed and so\nthat's when my parents went to the camps, the French camps , was\none of the camps that they went to. I'm not exactly sure how we got out of there and they\nwent to another camp and that period my friends and I went to that home that we were\nhidden in.",
        "A: In France.",
        "A: I think the first time we left, because we left twice. The first time we might have gone all\nof us together to in France, and that must have been '40, '41 somewhere\naround there. And then we came back to Belgium. I think subsequently the men went to\nwork again to that place in France.",
        "A: or something like that.",
        "A: Yes, in the north of France somewhere. And during the period that they were away that's\nwhen we had the incident of people breaking into our home and then we left I think that's\nwhen we went through the woods and were supposed to meet up with the fathers and then\nsupposed to meet up with someone who was going to take us across the border to\nSwitzerland, but we didn't make it. So, and we got caught that time. The first time we\nwere simply sent back home. The second time we got caught by the French police who\nthen put us into these sort of transient camps which are really deportation but I certainly\ndidn't know. I don't know how much my parents knew of what these places were going\nto lead to. I'm not sure they really knew. At some point they heard that people who left\nthere never got back. I mean that through the grapevine that sort of information started to\nfilter through and so they found that out and that's when I was in the children's home they\nwere at a camp and that's when they decided to run out of the camp before they were sent\nto Germany.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, I think that when they were transferred to they had made some\narrangements to take the children away and try to hide them, and that's when we were,\nmy friends and I in that camp in that home near ;",
        "A: Well, the children ranged from about four of five years of age, somewhere around there\nuntil they looked very big to me, but actually they were 16. I think the oldest were 16 to\n17. There was a mixture. They were all refugee children. Many of them were not\nJewish and many were actually refugees from the Spanish civil war because this place\nwas very close to Spain. It's in the part of France that borders on Spain almost so the\ncatholic archdiocese of that area had taken in some children from that war and kept all of\nthem together in that home.",
        "A: It was a catholic run home but it ha connection to Jewish organization who was able to\nchannel some of their kids into that particular home.",
        "A: At that time I must have been about seven, six or seven because I was born 1n '36 and that\nmust have been '42, '43 somewhere around there.",
        "A: In this home I was approximately eight to nine months and that part I remember quite\nwell.",
        "A: Well, things that stand out hunger, real, real hunger. Nothing to eat, but that didn't bother\nme because I really didn't like to eat but I remember my little girlfriend, food was her\nthing. She was this plump little thing and you could always shut her up by giving her\nfood. So, I used to run to the kitchen at night and steal whatever I could find and feed her\nbecause she was crying all night. She was crying because she was hungry, and I was\ncrying because I wanted my mother. So, we were quite a pair. So, hunger -- and I knew\nthere was nothing to eat and whatever there was I couldn't swallow. I just couldn't\nswallow any food there. The other thing I remember is lice and the worst incident which\nmay look ridiculous now but was when you had lice they shaved your head, and I was\nvery proud of my hair. I had really beautiful long hair and when I found out that I had lice\nand I could tell, because I was really itching. I hid in the outhouse. There was no indoor\nplumbing. There was indoor cold water to wash but no toilet. I hid in the outhouse for a\ncouple of days and nobody could get me out of there because I knew as soon as they\nfound out they would shave my head. So, but they eventually did. I had to get out. They\nshaved my head, and it was absolutely horrible, just horrible. Now, it looks kind of silly\nbut and it wasn't just lice it was scabies, you know the things that crawl under your skin,\nSO we were not really in very good shape. And there was always a feeling of fear and just\nterrible -- feeling terrible. First of all, not understanding at all why you were there what\nwas happening, missing your family and just the terror basically. I think I acted\nirrationally on many occasions where I would just run out of the window in the middle of\nthe night in the nightgown and just try to run away and being caught. You know, brought\nback to this, so we had songs but I don't know if they made them up or the older children\nprobably did which referred to us having to wake up at 7:00 in the morning and having to\nwash with cold water and the son reflected that there was no food only some kind of\nvegetable, something like a sweet potatoes. That's why when people serve me sweet\npotato at Thanksgiving I say thanks but no thanks. I can't even look at the stuff. I don't\nknow if it's the same, but it's so similar that it's enough to turn me off. That's all we had.\nSO, there was a song that reflected the realities of the time.",
        "A: As little as possible. I mean I'm not a psychologist but if I look at myself back then I\nmust have been -- I would qualify myself as a really depressed child, entirely depressed.\nI couldn't do much of anything. We were very regimented so we had to get up at 7:00\nand we lined up. I don't know if you saw the several films about children's homes,\ncatholic homes I think is one of them where children just line up\nand they wash and then they go to breakfast and then they go to prayer. They used to\npray but we sort of didn't pray along. I believe that there were some kind of organized\ngames, like playing ball or something like that and there were various levels of\ninstructions, but I don't think I learned a tremendous amount. I just don't remember\nanything that was organized. There was some instruction but I'm sure the way I feel\nwhen I think about it I was just there, but I wasn't there basically. That was that. We had\nto make our rooms and we had to help in the kitchen. We had to peel the few potatoes\nthere were, the sweet potatoes, whatever this vegetable was. We had to help clean up and\nthat was it. There was nothing else going on.",
        "A: Yes. There were two areas, there as a female area and there was a male area, boys and\ngirls. We were lined up like in the old hospital wards, a number of beds together one\nnext to another. We had essentially no possessions. We didn't have anything. We just\nhad our beds and I don't remember if I had any change of clothes. I mean I don't think I\nhad anything. Maybe they provided us with some old clothes, but we didn't have -- I\ndon't remember having a cubicle I could call my own you know with my stuff. I had\nnothing.",
        "A: I really don't know. I'd say 100 or so, not more than that.",
        "A: No, I don't think so, but it's hard to tell. I was just so unhappy. I don't have good\nfeelings about anybody there, but it may not be them. I don't remember-- for instance,\nthis incident with the hair, I thought they were barbarians when they did this. I felt that\nthis was a middle age torture but in retrospect maybe that was the only way to deal with\nthe lice. SO, I Thought they were mean, but maybe they weren't. I don't remember\nanybody being particularly kind to me or particularly paying attention to me but then they\nprobably were understaffed and lots of kids and all of us were miserable and unhappy. I\nknow for a fact that I was extremely rebellious and did exactly the opposite of what I was\ntold. It didn't matter what it was, I would just fight it. I would continuously argue and\nfight scream run a way. So, you really would have to be a very well trained professional\nto handle a child of that condition and they weren't. I assume they were volunteers from\nthe church or from other relief organizations and I guess they did the best they could but I\ncan't say that there was somebody there that was nice.",
        "A: Well, the circumstances are a little bit muddled but apparently my parents send someone\nto pick us up from there because they were escaping to Nice to the part of France that was\noccupied by the Italians as to the Germans.",
        "A: From what they told me is that they were told that they were going to be sent somewhere\nelse and they sort of smelled a rat and they asked for one day off to come in and say\ngoodbye to their children or visit their children and then of course they ran away to Nice\nduring that supposed trip, but they didn't come to pick us up because they were afraid.\nSo, they apparently sent some lady to pick us up, but my friend whom I spoke to\nyesterday, said that this person was afraid to travel with three children, so she gave us the\nmoney and left and told us how to get there.",
        "A: He and I were the oldest.",
        "A: Yes. And I do remember parts of that trip like getting on trains and getting off trains and\nsomehow getting to Nice, but I cannot recall the details of that but I know we made tt.\nMy recollection is that there was no adult with us and he confirmed that that this lady had\nat least given us the money, she didn't take it and run, but she was afraid to travel with\nthree children. She thought -- the way we looked with our shaven heads and with the lice\nand the scabs. We really looked awful so she decided to just tell us how to get there. We\nhad grown up pretty quickly, and we got there. We simply made the rondevoux with our\nparents in Nice. That was --that's why I say it sounds like it's not true and just like a\ndream, but it is true. We did get there and we did find our parents. But I then in Nice it\nactually was a very happy period. It sounds also crazy but we were living in a hotel and\nin the same hotel we had Italian soldiers and they were very, very nice. They were not\ntoo interested in what the directives were from the Nazi government. I remember them\ngiving me chocolate and I used to go up with them and play with them. I mean they were\njust very lovely people. And we were together but the remnants of that previous\nexperience were there with me and so by that time I was eight or so and I was wetting my\nbed and I was screaming, having nightmares every night and waking up and screaming\neven though the days were fairly happy, the nights were just terrible, really terrible. But\nthat stands out as a nice time in Nice because we were all together and we would go to\nthe beach and I wasn't at the time fully realizing -- we lived pretty much for the present.\nAs a child in general you don't anticipate much in the future, you know, at that age. We\nwere together and we were having a good time. I could not imagine that first of all things\nwould get worse again and that was not a temporary arrangement, that it wasn't a full\ntime solution to the problem.",
        "A: Right. But Italian, not German. The Germans came in later, so it really was strictly\nItalian.",
        "A: Officially no because the official party line of the Italian Nazi government with\nMussolini was also that Jews had to be deported and rounded up, but the orders were not\nquite as effective and there was very little discipline in the Italian army, and those people\nwho were in the army just couldn't care less whether we were Jews or something else.\nThey simply couldn't care less so we were supposed to officially hide that we were Jews,\nbut they knew fully well we were and I think we were fairly free to go and do as we\npleased. I'm not sure, I think that the order of deportation sort of depended on your\nnationality and so my parents at the time might have become Czechoslovakian or\nsomething like that and giving me a different name and that name I don't remember. If\nyou had Czechoslovakian papers it really didn't matter at the time whether you were\nJewish or not. For a short period of time the authorities respected the nationality versus\nyour ethnic background. That didn't last, but for a short period of time it was that way and\nthe soldiers who were supposed to execute the orders couldn't care less. I mean they just\ndid not round up people.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I would say also about ten months or so approximately and then when Italy capitulated\nand the Germans came marching in through the part of France that had previously been\noccupied by the Italians.",
        "A: The end of --must have been the beginning of '44 or somewhere around there, I think.\nThe war was over in '45 and we were in for perhaps a year, so I'd say'44\nor so, but maybe you can check the accuracy of that. At that point the news spread rather\nquickly that -- well they already knew what the Germans were doing to various people in\nvarious other places, so when they heard that Germans were coming they decided to run\nand again try to get to Switzerland the second time around. Things moved very quickly\nso 1t also became known that entire families were subject to being arrested and they\nwould be preferable for women and children were still sort of led through without being\nbothered or had a better chance. So, my mother and her friend and neighbor and my two\nlittle friends, we decided to leave from these to a border town Switzerland and to leave\nthe men behind and they were going to try and find someway to get there, not by public\ntransportation but try to arrange some kind of private way to join us. From there we were\ngoing to try and get through to Switzerland together. So, the train trip was uneventful, I\nmean my mother and myself and her friend and her two little children went along and we\ngot to a place where I don't know if we stayed in a hotel or I don't know where we stayed\nexactly. In the meantime my father and his friend was going to come by ambulance.\nThey had found someone who was going to drive an ambulance and take them as being\nill. So, they established a point of meeting which was a block from the hotel where we\nhad stayed. My father for some really stupid reason decided to go back to his hotel room\nbecause he had forgotten his prayer shawl and his , and when he got to\nthe hotel the Germans were there. So, he didn't make it. They arrested him. Apparently\nMr. waited until the evening and then the ambulance driver says I'm\nnot going to stay any longer because we're going to get picked up. So, they left and they\ncame and dropped off Mr. Shimmer wherever we were. And then I remember this most\nhorrendous scene of my mother collapsing when she saw him come in alone. She\nimmediately knew that something was very, very wrong. I just remember her just totally\ngoing completely hysterical and screaming and pulling out her hair and to me this was\njust the most frightening because I just came out from something that was relatively safe,\nand it just was everything fell apart. We stayed together for a while with those people\nand the family had their parents at least. The woman had her parents in Switzerland and\nso they decided to really push on and try to get to Switzerland and my mother at that\npoint said she didn't care anymore. She just didn't care, and she decided to stay put in\n, which was the town where we were at. At that point we got papers\nfrom people who proceeded us and who we paid a lot of money to get those fake papers.\nSo, we changed our name again.",
        "A: A French name so my name was . I had one or two names in\nbetween but I just don't remember and that was a terrible thing because they tell you you\nare no longer such and such but you are such and such, and you keep repeating it to\nyourself until you actually believe that you are this other person. It gets extremely\nconfusing. At that point, I must have been around eight or so, eight and half, and I mean\nI was very angry. At that point I just became very, very angry about everything and we\nmoved into an apartment in a private house where they were -- actually 1t was owned by\nthe people who lived downstairs and there were two floors above. The first floor was\ninhabited by a Jewish family who were German Jews. They had become French, but they\nwere German Jews originally, and then we had an apartment which was not really a real\napartment but just under the roof where the roof actually meets the floor. It's called\n, like an attic apartment essentially. I don't know if we had three or\nfour rooms there, but really two rooms maybe, just two room, one which was an\neverything room and one which was a bedroom. We stayed there pretty much to the end\nof the war with the false identity and at that time, my mother became involved with the\nresistance not officially part of it but harboring people who were in the resistance and\nalso harboring a lot of people who were in transient trying to get to Switzerland. She\nwould provide them with hiding place and with food and when they left they left their\npapers behind and we'd get their ration cards for food. So, at that point, we were really\nwealthy in terms of food availability. It was a time for me where I was pretty much like a\nstreet child. I did whatever I wanted. I was supposed to go to school but I never did. I\nmean I said I was going but I played hookey and I was hanging out with sort of the worst\ncharacters of the town, but compared to what worst characters are now, I guess they were\npretty mild. But we just would go and hide and play. We'd play three musketeers and\nwe'd play all these fighting games. I didn't go to school, I just never showed up, and\nwhen I was there I was so disruptive that they used to throw me out, so it really didn't\nmatter. But I learned how to read by myself. Two things I was doing. I was reading\nvoraciously. I didn't understand a thing of what I was reading. I just simply didn't\nunderstand. I was just reading books and books. Whatever it was, it didn't matter what it\nwas. It could have been the phone book. It didn't matter. It was an escape, you know,\nand I could just not be in the present. It was away from everything. I had another friend\nthen who lived nearby. I was friends with all the village kids, basically. Then, the people\nwho were renting us the place were very, very nice. They were French, but they\npretended not to know, but they knew of course that we were Jewish. They never\nquestioned anything, but they knew and I used to go to church with them on Sundays\nbecause it was kind of accepted and would be better that I would show up. And my\nmother's French was not great. It still has a very foreign accent, whereas I as a child had\nreally become completely fluent from that time in Nice and in that home I was perfectly\nfluent so I could pass for French kid easily. They thought it would be a good idea for me\nto go to church, so at least the child goes even if the mother doesn't show up. I was quite\ntaken by that service. As much as I had been anti-religious to my own religion, there was\nsomething very comforting about the church and the priests and there was a very safe\nfeeling in that big building and the way the voices resounded. That I remember that\nfeeling for the church. Now, I hate the catholic church, but I really felt very comforted\nby that whole atmosphere. The daughter of the people who were renting the place to us\nhad her solemn communion as they call it, and I was very envious. They wore this white\ndress and this white veil and to me this was like I don't know, utopia, to be able to do all\nthese things.",
        "A: Oh, I knew that going to church was a safe thing that once you belonged to that group\nyou were Okay. So, I guess it was wanting to be safe and wanting to be part of another\ngroup. I mean I knew that I couldn't tell who I was. And, as I said, I was really very\nangry and I was very nasty. One of the people that my mother had taken in in the\nmeantime until they got someone to take them to Switzerland was extremely fearful for\ngood reasons and was not leaving the apartment at all. I mean it was just really\nsequestered and would not go out. My mother was circulating freely with her fake\npapers. I mean if they would really look into it they would have found that her French\nwas not great and she would have been picked up, but she braved it so to speak. I\ncertainly could pass for a French kid, but this man and his wife were there and they were\nabsolutely petrified. He, in particular was just I mean, he wouldn't leave and we had\ncurfews where we had all the windows and so on, and I used to come home supposedly\nfrom school, but from wherever I was hanging out and I would scream at the top of my\nlungs for him to come down and I used to tell him that he had to carry my bookcase up. I\nhad this little thing, and if he didn't I was going to give him away to the Germans. You\ncould see the warped feelings that in some way I could pass for not being Jewish. I\nconvinced myself that I was catholic and I was going to be find. I also knew this wasn't\ntrue, but somehow I took it out on this poor guy who was really terribly frightened. I\nmean I can still see myself standing at the foot of those stairs and screaming, you come\nthere and pick up my bag and if you don't I'm going to tell on you. He would come, you\nknow, he would just come. He didn't know what to say.",
        "A: Yes, like I could go out and he couldn't. But deep inside I knew this was just really not\ntrue, but somehow we managed to fake him out a little longer and he didn't have papers\nand he did nothing and he didn't know French, and he looked real Jewish. He would have\nbeen picked up very quickly. In incidents like that where I was just doing really nasty,\nvery nasty things. They were really a way of saying, you know, I can do what I want\nbasically. I'm not going to school. I can just do whatever. Nobody can tell me what to\ndo. There were some terrible moments for me because my mother was frequently gone,\nand I never knew if she was going to come back, and there were nights where there were\nalarms for bomb raids, and those were really horrible. They were just just horrible. I\nwould be totally, totally petrified and I had to run to the shelter by myself. I was afraid to\nget out of bed let alone -- it was all in the dark-- let alone go down the stairs and go to the\nshelter by myself. I usually managed to somehow make it to the people below and we'd\ngo together. So, when she wasn't home, but then to go back to my place. I mean she\ndidn't want to always say that she was leaving, you know, to the other people. You don't\nknow. They could put a trace on her. She was going to Switzerland. She was getting\nwatches and she was then going to Paris and she was selling them. She was doing all\nsorts of weird things just to get some money to survive, and she was helping people get\nacross the border, so she really never wanted to say what she was doing and she didn't tell\nme either. She would just tell me I'll be back as soon as I can, but to an eight year old,\nthat's not that reassuring particularly having been separation where I didn't know if I ever\nwas going to see her again having seen her reaction to my father's disappearance and\nknowing that that certainly was not really good. I was really scared, I mean really, really\nscared.",
        "A: It was not in the building, 1t was somewhere further away. I don't exactly know where it\nwas, but we had to go walk in the dark, run basically and to this day I must say that I'm\nstill afraid of the dark. If I'm in the house alone, I'll have every light on. I just won't be --\nI really have to talk to myself to be able to turn off all the lights and say nothing will\nhappen. We were in the dark because of curfew to begin with and then you weren't going\nto start taking flashlights going to a shelter. That was really better.",
        "A: Well, they looked awfully Jewish, but they were French citizens and so they thought -- I\ndon't remember, or I don't think that papers in France said that you were Jewish. The\nFrench documents, I don't think that they mentioned religion but I'm not sure. They\nlooked awfully Jewish, because she had a wig, but he was a lawyer and he was a very\ndistinguished gentleman, German origin, and perhaps he thought that was going to save\nthem. It turned out that he was picked up a day or two before the liberation and he never\nmade it back.",
        "A: Well, I'm sure I helped just with housekeeping things. I'm sure I did some of the\nshopping where she'd send me to buy food. I remember going to the grocery store and\ndoing all of that stuff. In a more concrete way in terms of I mean I remember seeing all\nthese people, being upset because sometimes we had ten twelve people sleeping in one\nroom. We had five or six people in one bed, so I was not thrilled and I did sort of\nthreaten some of these people, but for the most part I was probably helping her as much\nas I could. I know that as I said I'm sure I did the shopping and I brought food home and\nI helped her with cleaning up and that sort of thing. I didn't go to Paris with her to sell\nwatches.",
        "A: She was extremely courageous but she was courageous throughout but that first impact,\nthat first shock and this is what I remember. Now, I think there's nothing worse for a\nchild than to see the mother fall apart. As long as the mother is still in tact then they\nknow they have somebody to lean on. I realize at that moment that something terrible\nhad happened to my father but I didn't realize exactly what but when I saw her, it just hit\nme like a sledge hammer. She was really gone. I mean she was just not -- I don't know\nthat it lasted a few hours and maybe the next day she sort of composed herself and she\ncertainly picked up the pieces and went on and survived, and not only survived but\nhelped me survive. There is no question about it, I would not survive without her.",
        "A: No, not at all. But one thing about her is that even though she came from this small\nvillage from this very orthodox background, she was quite somewhat of a maverick\nwithin her generation. She was orphaned very early, I don't know if she told you that, but\nshe was about six years old when her mother passed away, mother and one brother went\nwith the Russian flu, so she was very young at the time. She became really the\nhousekeeper for her father for a short period of time, his mother came and took care of\nthe household, and then she got killed in some stupid accident. She got kicked in the\nbelly by a horse. She went to market, so she lost her grandmother maybe a year after\nthat. So, she really became the woman of the house at age eight or nine or something, so\nshe was quite independent. She had to be. She's a really intelligent person and she was\nalways interested in a lot of things so she became interested in zionism, and so she took\nHebrew lessons secretly because it certainly was considered inappropriate for a girl to do\nthat. So let's say that it's not totally out of character to do things which one would not\nhave expected of a woman of that generation and that background. She adapted. She\nlearned Hebrew, she learned French. She even learned English at that point on her own.\nShe didn't have any formal schooling, and she's really a very educated person and it's all\nself made. I think that she had no inclinations to be a delinquent let's say but certainly to\ntake charge of herself when needed, and so she did. This was the only thing that was\nopened to her, so she did that. I mean the smuggling of the watches with the resistance\nthat was really self preservation. I think to some extent she I don't know that she really\ncared that much about herself at that point. I think she just forgot about herself. She just\ndid things for the wider picture if you wish, but she was no longer afraid for herself. She\nsort of thought well, you know the worst has happened as far as her husband 1s\nconcerned. She had to leave her father behind in Belgium. She couldn't take him\nbecause he wouldn't come. He had to cut his beard off and he wouldn't do that so he\nstayed behind. She already had lost her mother and a brother so somehow she felt it\ndoesn't matter anymore. There was her child, and so I think she did a lot for me, for my\nsake.",
        "A: He might have, but I wasn't aware of any frictions. That she could tell you much better.\nI was very welcome in their household. These people were -- he had been a fighter in\nWorld War I and he had actually lost a leg or suffered a severe injury so he was limping\nor had a wooden leg. I just remember him limping rather heavily, and she was just a very\nsweet lady and they could not have children. In fact their daughter was a adopted one.\nShe was one of 14. The woman's sister had 14 children so she adopted her youngest.\nThen I was sort of a welcome addition in a sense because she had hoped to have a large\nhousehold with a lot of children, and she didn't. I felt so good in that household. It was\nvery warm and just normal. Basically it was just normal. So, that I really always felt\nvery good there, and my mother still writes to them every Christmas. Every Christmas\nshe sends them a box of chocolates. The older couple is now gone, but the one girl, the\none whose communion I envied so much is now a grandmother. She's in her 60s. I don't\nthink there could have been too much antagonism. Like I said, he fought in World War I\nand he was not very fond of the Germans at all, and he was a really strong French patriot\nand this invasion did not sit too well with him, and he was sort of in a way sorry that he\nwas too old to fight. So, I think in that sense, he knew we were Jewish, but he wasn't\nquite too sure and all that activity to him sort of looked like a good thing in the sense of\nbeing resisting the occupation. Although he wasn't personally involved in my\nknowledge, he sort of turned away. They were in their 60s at the time I think. They\nlooked very old to me, but again, now that I'm going to 58, it doesn't look that old.",
        "A: I'm not sure how, but I remember that we all were dancing in the streets of\n. The entire town was there and there was really a jubilation and I didn't\nfully -- so I guess it came over the radio and all the people from the resistance knew that\nthe end was near.",
        "A: It was May 8 of '45, I think.",
        "A: No, I don't think so. It was the final -- 1t was when they gave up. There was no liberation\nthere in France. I mean they were there until the very last, because they picked up this\ngentleman, my neighbor, a few days before, literally a few days before. She had a baby\nright then after he was gone and something really very moving. My mother went to the\nmaternity with her, for the delivery, and he turned 50, this young man just recently and\nhis mother lives in Israel and so does he and the mother called up my mother from Israel\nto remind her of the night when she gave birth that she had been present at that time.\nThat was 40 years ago, so that '44, the end of '44 beginning of '45. I don't think it was\nliberated before that.\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2",
        "A: When we went back to Belgium on that final trip back, we stopped again, me and my\ncomplete negative and angry nasty self, we stopped several times on the road to drink and\nat one point the only thing that was available was beer and I said I would rather die than\ndrink beer.",
        "A: A person told me well, maybe you're just going to have to do that. Maybe you're just\ngoing to have to die because that's all we had. Telling me, a nasty kid.",
        "A: Yes. I remember just elation. That's the feeling for everybody and sadness. My\nneighbor because she had no trace of her husband, and I remember that and I remember\nmy mother leaving and going back to Belgium and telling me that she was going to find\nmy father.",
        "A: At that point I remained with the landlords. I was in the apartment, but in the same\nhouse. I had been pretty much alone for a long time, so at that point I wasn't even all that\nscared because it sounded good. So, as I said my mother came back. I don't know how\nlong she was gone, whether it was a week or a month. I don't know. She said we are\ngoing back. She had found my dad and that was that. So, we went back and finding him\nwas the real disappointment, because he had changed from the memories. I mean I had\nthis illusion you know as a four year old child your father and the way he was involved\nwith me and he was really -- he was not the same person and by then I was nine years old\nand I could see things very differently. He came back. I saw him, he had no hair. His\nteeth were shaking. He looked like a skeleton. He just looked frightening to me, very\nfrightening.",
        "A: He had been in Auschwitz mostly. And, he was extremely -- he had become very\nimpatient and irritable and I just wanted to cling to him and it was broken. It just wasn't\nthere anymore. We were just coming from different places all together, and he had\nbecome even more religious and rigid about it. I had at that point completely rejected. I\nmean I just couldn't deal with that at all. I was doing whatever I wanted during the war.\nCertainly not observing the Sabbath, and all of a sudden we're back to not turning on\nlights, and not going to the movies on Saturday and all that sort of stuff. I yust couldn't\ndeal with that at all. I mean I just couldn't deal with that. So, we had lots of fights, really\na big arguments and right after we came back we lived in a place that belonged to one of\nthe people that we had met in , a Jewish lady whose husband did not come\nback and who had owned a house with her husband and so we lived in that place and I\nremember the three of us, my mom, my dad, and I sleeping in the bed and he was having\nthe worse nightmares and he would scream int he middle of the night and of course I\nwould just relive all my terrors. It was just not what I had hoped for or what my fantasies\nhad about how it was going to be when my dad came back. The reality was very, very\ndifferent. Not only that, we pretty much had no money so we had very cheap bed and the\nbed would collapse every so often so between the screaming and the collapsing bed I\nmean it was really terrible and we didn't have any warm water. We just had a pump in\nthe kitchen. It really was very primitive. And then in my view what really made things\ncompletely disastrous was when my father found out about his surviving relatives in\nRussia. He sent for them, and where I was really craving just my mom and my dad, all of\na sudden these people descended upon us. There were two brothers, a sister and a\ngrandfather, and we all lived together. There were ten people every day, all the time\nwithout any space for anybody. It was literally a nightmare. To me, this was a\nnightmare. I resented them for a long time. I mean there was nothing else to do but I\nreally couldn't say I was very thrilled with that whole set up and then to top it off, my\nbrother was born. My mother couldn't handle it. She simply couldn't handle the food for\nall these people, so I essentially was trusted as the permanent babysitter for my brother. I\nwas in charge of him basically. I had nothing to say about it. I had to feed him and dress\nhim and just take care of him, except for going to school. Things were just not great.\nThen, at that point, all my fears came through. I could not stay alone. I tried, I remember\nthat my parents wanted to go for a walk on a Friday night after dinner and I would say\nsure I'll stay, and as soon as they walked out I was just overcome by such fear that I\nwould just scream by myself in the house and my neighbor upstairs would come and get\nme. I was trying. I always said, sure you can go. I'm fine. I'm great, no problem. As\nsoon as maybe five minutes after they walked it would just come and engulf me and I\ncouldn't really function very well. Then school was another nightmare because we were\npeople of all ages put into the same class. Now, I was put in the right grade for my age,\nbut I really knew nothing. I just knew how to read because I had read -- and I spoke\nFrench beautifully because finally I began to understand what I was reading and I\ndeveloped a very nice vocabulary. So, on account of that they decided to put me in the\nproper grade for my age. I knew nothing, so I was in school feeling like I was among --\njust what am I doing here. I don't know, but I made it. I don't know how I made it. I just\npicked up whatever had to picked up and there were people there who were speaking\nPolish and there were people speaking Yiddish and there were those who were speaking\nGerman and I was speaking French. The teachers were themselves, they came from\nconcentration camps or other places. They didn't know anything about anything except\nthey had sticks and when they misbehaved they hit us.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. I had a big argument with my mother's friends who told me I should think of getting\nmarried when I'm 18. I said no way, not ever, and I decided to get there I had to get to a\nbetter school, and so I was in that school for two years. This time in Belgium it's divided\ninto six and six. Elementary and then high school is six years, and I decided to go to the\npublic high school. The public high school which was at the time considered the top high\nschool because from that one you could go straight to university without having to take\nspecial entrance examinations. So, after two years I applied to that high school which\nwas unfortunately in Flemish and that was a language I didn't know at all. So, the only\nFlemish I knew was from talking to the cleaning woman who used to come once a week\nand that was the extent of it. But I made it. I mean I got in somehow. I guess I faked it.\nWhenever I think about it objectively I should have never gotten in there because my\nknowledge of everything was completely sporadic and having big gaps in various places.\nI never learned how to do multiplication, things like that. Big, big gaps, but I got into\nhigh school, because it wasn't automatic. You had to apply to get into that particular\nschool. So, but there was anti-semitism in the high school.",
        "A: After the war, quite a bit, and there was only two Jewish girls in that whole school,\nanother one and myself. We really had a tough time. It took us years to be accepted and\nto make friends only a few friends we made on the whole the atmosphere was not\nwelcoming at all, not at all.",
        "A: No, but for instance my dad was religious at the time there was school on Saturdays, and\nhe didn't allow me to go. It was a horror show. I already had missed so much school\nthroughout my life and of course they put Latin and Greek and math and whatnot on\nSaturday. This really is not easy, and the teachers refused to help. I mean I would have\nto go every Saturday night -- I mean that's why I became even less attracted to the\nreligion. I had to go and beg from some girl who really didn't want to give me her notes\nfor all the lectures that had been given that day and then try to work it out on my own\nbecause my father didn't know anything and my mother didn't know anything about that\nstuff. The teachers just said, her statement was, \"Well, you Jewish girls don't want to\ncome to school on Saturday, you just work it out. It's not my problem.\" It makes you\nfeel that after all that hearing this business about Jewish girls -- 1t was a secular school, it\nwasn't a school that was under any kind of religious aegis or directives. That's what the\npublic school was. It was a secular school where there was religion given according to\nwhat you wanted so there was one hour you could choose either religion or ethics so you\ndidn't have to attend -- because there was a catholic school system just as there is one\nhere an official catholic school system. So, the people who were there, weren't even\nobservant, but they still had a feeling that we were foreigners. Essentially the feeling was\nthat we were foreigners. We were different and foreign. We did not feel very well there,\nreally not, and then later they opened a Jewish high school and most Jewish kids now go\nto the Jewish high school, which is now fully accepted.",
        "A: Yes, oh yes. They go to a Jewish high school, which the Jewish high school is accepted.\nIt's a completely official school and they can get from there to the university, again\nwithout entrance examinations, so and that's what I had wanted but there wasn't anything\nat the time. We were, as I said, in fifth grade, everybody was together, all ages, all\nlanguages. This high school developed just a few years after I started high school.",
        "A: My grandfather I think was essentially beaten to death. My mother's father, the one\nwho's picture is there. He refused his son, my mother's brother, left I believe it was the\nlast boat that left Antwerp and they went to Brazil and then somehow got to the states,\nand he didn't want to go because you had to cut your beard to get on that boat. I think\nwhen we fled, he refused to come for the same reason and so apparently my mother had\nasked a neighbor, a non Jewish neighbor to take care of him and she said she would but\nshe heard when she came back to Belgium that he had essentially been beaten to death on\nthe streets.",
        "A: You mean during the war years?",
        "A: In what sense.",
        "A: In terms of who I am today, I would have liked all this activity around survivors of the\nwar whatever events took part in their own lives to happen earlier because even as I tell\nthese things and some of these things bring tears to my eyes so that 1 know that I still feel\nthem, but they're not -- I think I'm now perhaps able and it hasn't been that long -- able to\nassociate my reactions to trauma and whatever from the past. So, it's hard for me to say\nnow. The worst part of it was the fear, you know the absolute terror that I can still invoke\ncertain times thinking back particularly --the salient points were in that home where I just\ndidn't know where anybody was. And then when my dad was taken. These were just\nterrible, terrible moments. I know that until he died, my father -- I had many, many\nnightmares about anticipating his death that they were just really terrible and I was acting\nirrationally during many years in relation to him in terms of being so afraid that he would\ndie that I could not even enjoy when I was near him. He wasn't a well man, although he\npulled together and rebuilt a life for himself and helped his brothers build their own lives,\nso he did a tremendous job. I couldn't even appreciate any of this. I was just always\nafraid of losing him so that was sort of something that marred my life for a long time. In\nfact, I think I was liberated from that feeling only when he died. When he finally died, I\nsort of gained some peace which seems sort of crazy, but that's what happened. When he\ndied, I said okay that's over. He's really gone and he's not coming back. That's it.",
        "A: No, I'm not, but I observe the traditions because I think they're pretty and perhaps only\nrecently I have trouble with dogma in general. I have trouble with authority, but there is\nsort of a deeper philosophy which guides the lives of those who are truly religious and I\nreally don't refer to people who are shut off from the outside world like or\nthat type of think. I'm thinking of my brother who is really an exceptional human being\nin that he lives his religion. This is who he is in terms of his interaction with his wife and\nhis children, his family. He lives in Jerusalem because that's the only place where he can\nbe the full Jew in his view, but he's politically left wing so -- and when I see him, there's\na deep meaning to the rituals that is not the superficial type of thing that many people see\nand rebel against which is the things that I rebel against. You can't go here, things that\nlook totally idiotic to me. It's a lot easier to take an elevator let's say for a person my\nmother's age and condition than to walk upstairs. That kind of thing, but when you go\ndeeper and you make it part of an entire frame work and what it means, then I'm\nbeginning to appreciate it although I think I live my life in a certain way in that sense, in\nterms of how I relate to my mother and to my family and I'm really a very good friend.\nPeople know that I'm really a loyal friend, that you couldn't have a more loyal friend. But\nI have no inclination to do the ritual, but I do like to go to synagogue on high holidays\nonly because I identify with the group, because I like to be identified with the Jewish\npeople. I'm proud of them. But not in terms of observing the things that I consider\ninterfering with the conduct of modern life.",
        "A: I don't want any part of it.",
        "A: I think those that felt abandoned by it I felt abandoned by it, but as I said the story about\nmy grandfather and the angels, I was maybe four years old when I asked him that, which\nI mean this is a logical question to ask. Where are your angels, and there's no logical\nanswer to that. So, then of course there was no time to practice the religion after that\nwhole incident because we weren't supposed to be Jews anymore. That's one of the\nthings I resented when my dad came back. I embraced catholicism only because it\nrepresented a safe haven and not because of anything that had to do with Jesus or\nanything like that, didn't appeal to me very much. What appealed to me really was the\nritual and not the content. What appeals to me in Judaism really is more the content and\nnot the ritual. The ethics behind it and so I think I'm a very Jewish person and I don't\nhide that anywhere. Perhaps if I were in a place where nobody observed anything I\nwould do it just to express my Judaism to the rest of the world that way, but I don't feel\nthat I have to do that. But as I said, I do identify with the group, so --my mother says that\nafter the war my little girlfriend, the one that I had spent all this time with in the home\nand so on and we stayed friends for a while after. She became religious and I wasn't, but\na certain point in time we were going to synagogue for the high holidays and our mothers\nwould try and make us pray and we would just giggle. I mean that's all we'd do, we'd\ngiggle. We could just not do pray or do anything. Then when I went to study, I left\nhome and I went to Switzerland and the very first Rosh Hoshana Eve I went to\nsynagogue. I didn't even go inside. I stayed outside the entire time, but I was there. You\nknow, I just felt that I had to express that I was part of that group but I wasn't going to\npray because the prayers meant nothing to me. The prayers are sometimes very pretty if\nyou look at them in terms of poetry, but I really don't believe in God. I really don't\nbelieve in that at all. So, my religion would be expressed in terms of how people should\nrelate to one another and nothing to do with some superior being. I'm a scientist and I\ndon't believe in that at all.",
        "A: Well, the only thing is that you can overcome anything. You at some point have to take\nresponsibility for your own life, no matter how bad. If you do that, you won't be alone.\nIf you persist in living in the past and saying that you can't do anything and nothing is\ngoing to work out because you went through this terrible thing, then you will remain\nstagnate and people will shy away from you and you'll just be a very lonely person. I like\nto be with people. I don't like to be alone. That's all I have to say.",
        "A: Thank you.\n(Viewing pictures)",
        "A: This is my mom and dad's wedding picture and I think that occurred in 1934 something\nlike that, in Antwerp. These are my fraternal grandparents, grandfather, grandmother,\nuncles, aunts. That was taken in Poland. It must have been around '34 or '35 because my\nfather is no longer on that picture. He had moved to Belgium by then. This is my\nmaternal grandfather, my mom and dad, my mom's brother and his wife. The baby on the\nold man's lap is myself and the three children that are standing are my cousins. They are\nmy mother's brother's children. I assume, I was born in '36, it had to be, I was close to six\nmonths to a year. That's the town in France where we stayed when we didn't make it to\nSwitzerland. That was the place.",
        "A: This is which is on the Belgium coast and it must have been very shortly\nbefore. The one on the right is in which is a town where my mother and\nI spent the last year of the war approximately. This picture is the center 1s my\ngrandfather and it's essentially many of the same people that appeared in that previous\npicture. So, it's my dad's brothers and sisters after the war after they got married and had\nchildren.\nConclusion of Interview.\n"
