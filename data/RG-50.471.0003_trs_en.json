It was on the northern most port of the last\nGerman empire.

Well I do remember that the house\nwe were living in and we only had a small room that we\nwere renting at the time, in the a part of Kovno that\nwas called Jalya kolnis, meaning the Green Mountain.\nAnd it was an apartment house.

And they told\nme the day before the occupation that they had planned\non escaping with the Russians who were in retreat. And\nso there was, actually it was a very, very, it was a\npanic stricken Jewish population trying to decide\nwhether it was better to run or to stay. And during\nthis mad rush to get out, with the Russians, I think at\nthat point already the Lithuanian partisans went into\nactions and fell upon some innocent victims who were\ntrying to escape. But I think the real partisan mass\nmurders came after the Russians had finally retreated.\nAnd life resumed some normalcy for those who had stayed\nbehind. But not for long.\nSB: What do you mean by not for long.\nBA: Well at that point rumors, before the, before\nthere even was talk of the ghetto we heard about people\nin the city who had been abducted from their homes, by\nwilling Lithuanian so called partisans who also ran-\nsacked the homes. Who would round up mostly men and\neither taunt and torture them or, or shoot them. I\ndidn't see any of this though with my own eyes because\nI have no idea whether the suburb that we lived in was\nmore protected than the rest of the city.

In our case there, we were a family of\nthree. I am an only child. And my mother was suffering\nthe consequences of a recent stroke. And was, was quite\nincapacitated. I can't say that she was totally inca-\npacitated but she had to be cared for. So even if we\nhad wanted to escape, it would not have been\nfeasible at the, would not have been practical. So we\nstayed in this little room and consulted with all the\nother neighbors and everybody was panic stricken. But\nnot really knowing what to do.",

The racial laws that, the\nNuremberg laws that had already been implemented in\nGermany and other occupied countries. And I can be more\nspecific.

Even though there were some more\nsubstantial farm houses to be found also, as well as\nsome newly constructed apartment, referred to as\nblocks, which had been constructed for the industrial\nworkers, Lithuanian workers. The date that was set as\nthe um well the date was the 15th of August. Now the\nreason I remember that is because it fell on my birth-\nday. And I forgot whether it was 1940 or 1941. I think\nit was 1941. We had about 2 months to relocate. The\nway this relocation was handled was that first one had\nto secure a place to stay in the ghetto. And the\ninhabitants, I mean the Jews of Kovno, some of whom had\nbeen quite well to do had owned either their homes,\napartments, or houses. So they were in a position to\ntrade their well established comfortable homes for a\npeasant's home in the newly formed ghetto. Naturally it\nwas not an equitable trade but at least they had a\nplace to stay. The three of us were at a disadvantage\nbecause we had nothing to trade. So we depended on the\nkindness of strangers to give us a space. And after a\nlong search, my father was able to find a pharmacist,\nan elderly pharmacist, friend of my mother's who had\nowned a pharmacy in my mother's village, where she had\ngrown up. So Mr. Mesahovich and his wife told my father\nthat they had a small attic space that they could\nSpare, that everything else had already been spoken\nfor.

I think we may have owned a bedroom suit.\nUm we had a sewing machine for some reasons which I til\nthis day don't understand or remember how or why we\nkept the sewing machine from our original household.\nBut it came in very handy later.

I am very bad at dimensions but it was\na long narrow space that, that held my parents!\u2019 bed, on\nthe one long wall and my cot and the sewing machine\nopposite my cot. And there was a window next to my cot.\nI could look out. And I saw many brutal and memorable\nunforgettable scenes from that window. And just a very\nprimitive door that led from one attic space to our\nsmaller attic space because on the other side of the\nwall, another family um was living. And that family\nconsisted of four people--a mother, father, adult\ndaughter who was a medical student and her young broth-\ner who was maybe 12 years old at the time. These people\nbecame our very good and trusted friends and I would\nlike to mention that the older son Ted Pace is going to\nbe interviewed tomorrow and I hope to have a chance to\nmeet up with him after 50 years.\nVideo Tape No. Camera Roll No. | Sound Roll No.",

To report for\nwork on a certain day at a certain time. It was early\non. I don't remember the date, it may have been August\nor maybe early September.

Again posters must have been nailed to\npublic buildings and verbal commands had gone out that\non the morning of Tuesday, I forgot the date, October\nmaybe it was 28th, I'm was it. Every person in the,\nevery Jewish person in the ghetto had to report at, it\nmay have been 6:00 in the morning, very, very early.\nAt the public square which was called democracy square.\nUm, everybody was able to walk, regardless of age. The\nhouses had to be left, the doors had to be left open.\nEverybody who was found in the home would be executed,\nexecuted on the spot. And ostensibly this was done for\nthe taking of a census. It didn't look good. I'm not\nin our case, my mother could barely walk. But I do\nremember that the house where we were living was very\nclose to the square. So it we had a very short dis-\ntance to walk. We may have had a five or ten minute\nwalk at the most. And we had planned to leave our\nhouse around 5:30. Well around 4:00 on that morning, I\ncould hear footsteps, never ending footsteps. It was\nstill, there was still total darkness. It was a cold\nuh damp foggy uh kind of late fall early winter day.\nThere may have been some snow on the ground, there may\nhave been some wet snow falling. And the three of us\nmy mother, father and 1 started getting ready for our\ntrip down the steps and out the door.

And\nmade it to the square. At the square there was, there\nwas total chaos. Um, family units didn't know where to\nstand. Everybody of course at that point already had a\nwork pass and was affiliated with a work group. And my\nfather was, as head of, as head of the family we joined\nhis work outfit. And he was working at the military\nairport doing just manual labor, construction work,\ndigging, hauling rocks, that sort of, of thing. So we\nlooked for the larger contingent of air, air field\nworkers and we stood with them. And stood and waited.\nAs we were waiting um and at that point I think there\nwere about 28,000 Jews in the ghetto, so all of them or\nmost of them were assembled on the square. And um so\nwe noticed that several German officers, I don't know\nwhat unit they belonged to, whether they were SS or\nsome other unit. I suspect they were members of the SS\nand one of them was greatly feared. His name was\nRauca, R-A-U-C-A. And he was, I had never seen him\nbefore but he was pointed out to me and I think he was\nstanding behind some sort of table and there may have\nbeen a chair. There were some papers on that table and\nhe was not alone, there were other Germans with him. I\ndon't know whether there were dogs or not. I don't\nremember that. But they all had their pistols in their\nholster and possibly whips. Well as soon as a family\nunit had found their work groups, there was a little\nmore order in the square.

He\nwas assigning family units to the left and to the\nright. And already it was very obvious that the people\nwho had been assigned to the right were the healthy ad\nthe able bodied. And the younger looking ones. And\ncertainly no children among that group.

That's where we're picking up.\nBA: Perhaps I should not say that the able bodied were\nassigned to the right side because there are times when\nI'm not sure as to which the good side was. But what\nwas happening before our eyes was the human tragedy\nthat was unfolding, families that were torn apart, were\nperhaps elderly parents were separated from their\nyounger adult children. Or sometimes the even mothers\nwith children were separated from their husbands. And\nthe crying and despair was, it was just devastating. Of\ncourse our worry was how to get by, get past the in-\nspection table, how would we get my mother through. I\ndon't know if it was the hand of God but we passed uh\nthe table and Rauca must have perhaps was looking the\nother way. I know at one time he was eating his\nsandwich for lunch. And calmly eating his sandwich\nholding it in one hand and with the other hand direct-\ning people to, to life or to death. And it may have\nbeen that during one of those moments while he was not\nlooking the three of us were able to slip past the\nreviewing stand. And once we were on the other side, we\nwere so relieved. We knew it wasn't over yet but at\nleast we had reached a safety point, a safe haven.

They were led away and pardon me for backtracking\nbut we, we came home we had to take a count who was\nstill in the house and who had been taken away.

It didn't look good. I'm not\nin our case, my mother could barely walk. But I do\nremember that the house where we were living was very\nclose to the square. So it we had a very short dis-\ntance to walk. We may have had a five or ten minute\nwalk at the most. And we had planned to leave our\nhouse around 5:30. Well around 4:00 on that morning, I\ncould hear footsteps, never ending footsteps. It was\nstill, there was still total darkness. It was a cold\nuh damp foggy uh kind of late fall early winter day.\nThere may have been some snow on the ground, there may\nhave been some wet snow falling.

And\nmade it to the square. At the square there was, there\nwas total chaos. Um, family units didn't know where to\nstand. Everybody of course at that point already had a\nwork pass and was affiliated with a work group. And my\nfather was, as head of, as head of the family we joined\nhis work outfit. And he was working at the military\nairport doing just manual labor, construction work,\ndigging, hauling rocks, that sort of, of thing. So we\nlooked for the larger contingent of air, air field\nworkers and we stood with them. And stood and waited.\nAs we were waiting um and at that point I think there\nwere about 28,000 Jews in the ghetto, so all of them or\nmost of them were assembled on the square. And um so\nwe noticed that several German officers, I don't know\nwhat unit they belonged to, whether they were SS or\nsome other unit. I suspect they were members of the SS\nand one of them was greatly feared. His name was\nRauca, R-A-U-C-A. And he was, I had never seen him\nbefore but he was pointed out to me and I think he was\nstanding behind some sort of table and there may have\nbeen a chair. There were some papers on that table and\nhe was not alone, there were other Germans with him. I\ndon't know whether there were dogs or not. I don't\nremember that.

But what\nwas happening before our eyes was the human tragedy\nthat was unfolding, families that were torn apart, were\nperhaps elderly parents were separated from their\nyounger adult children. Or sometimes the even mothers\nwith children were separated from their husbands. And\nthe crying and despair was, it was just devastating. Of\ncourse our worry was how to get by, get past the in-\nspection table, how would we get my mother through. I\ndon't know if it was the hand of God but we passed uh\nthe table and Rauca must have perhaps was looking the\nother way. I know at one time he was eating his\nsandwich for lunch.

And it may have\nbeen that during one of those moments while he was not\nlooking the three of us were able to slip past the\nreviewing stand. And once we were on the other side, we\nwere so relieved.

Um. And it was just a very, very\ngray existence of hardship. It was so cold there was\nno, and the winters where temperatures dropped to 30\nand 40 degrees below zero and people have no firewood\nto heat the premises.

But\num, yes, um the young people still were able to see,\nhad the energy or interest in seeing their school\nfriends on the only day they didn't have to work.

That was easier said\nthan done. It was very hard to find a family, a Lithua-\nnian family who would provide shelter, for good reason.\nThey would put their own lives into grave danger.\nHarboring a Jew was almost a, what is it, well a death\nsentence. And so that was one hurdle to",
        "find a place, to find a person willing to provide\nshelter. The other hurdle was to get out of the ghetto.\nAll gates were guarded. It was difficult to slip\nthrough the fence, there were guard towers, that were\nmanned at all times. And there were ways to slip out\nwhere the work group or work brigade as they were\ncalled that worked outside, outside of the ghetto and\nwith the knowledge, it was usually best that with the\nknowledge of the group leader, one could slip away\neither to do some trading, bartering, get food.

        "were to establish contact with a former bookkeeper from\nwho had worked for my dad in our, in my home town.\nPerhaps it's somewhat reminiscent of the Frank family's\nbookkeeper. This was a very devoted former emp, em-\nployee who had known me since, practically since I was\nborn and had always allowed me to have the run of the\noffice and type on every, and play on every\ntypewriter that I could find. She had married a Lithua-\nnian, she was herself a, a German. Of RusSian German\ndescent, who had married a Lithuanian, had moved to\nKovno after her marriage, after Memel had been retaken\nby the Germans in 1939 and my dad had found out that\nher husband occasionally came to the ghetto on some\nbusiness. Not quite sure what it was but there was\nsome work. What is it. I can think of the German word,\nwerkstatt like.\nSB: Workshops.\nBA: Yes, workshops, exactly. Where uniforms, German\nuniforms were repaired and perhaps other repair work\nwas done. And the bookkeeper's husband, Maita's hus-\nband, occasionally came to the ghetto. My father could\nnot contact him personally because my father did not\nwork inside the ghetto. He worked at the air field. But\nI believe that he passed on written messages to be\ndelivered to Maita's husband, asking him if there was a\nway, if they knew of anybody who would take me in.

Bradley\nWentworth Films, Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd, Potomac, MD 20854\nTIMECODE NOTES:\nthe reply came back a short while later that if i could\nfind a way out, a safe way out of the ghetto that I\ncould stay with Maita and her husband in Kovno in their\nvery own apartment, at least for a while. Maybe later\nthey would find a, a safer place for me, in the country\nperhaps. But that happened April or May, I think it\nwas in April. So um very hasty arrangements were made,\nnone by me, all done by my father to whom I really owe\nmy life. That he found a work brigade that worked\noutside the ghetto. The group leader was willing to let\nme join his group a certain day. He, his group was\nguarded by several German guards, some of whom had\nshown a shred of humanity in the past and had let\npeople not connected with the group either leave the\ngroup before they got to their work place and so um I\nleft with, I went to the place of assembly. It was a\nsmall group. Unfortunately I don't remember the lead,\nthe group leader's name. But I do know that they had to\ncross a small river from the ghetto to get to their\nwork place. So all of us, it must have been the river\nNaris. The group 10 or 15 people at the most all sat\ndown and in a rowboat and the boat crossed the river.\nI don't know if tho guard had been bribed or not. I\ndon't know that. Some guards would take a bribe and\nwould look the other way. Some would take a bribe and\nwould not look the other way. Also had to have some-\nbody help me to take off the yellow star. Both of them\nfront and back had been pinned on. I could certainly\nhandle the one in front, needed somebody to\nhelp me with the star in back and I didn't know that a\nVideo Tape No. Camera Roll No. | Sound Roll No.\nKOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BRIGITTE ALTMAN\npage 28\nInterviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W.

And she sat behind\nme so I asked her would she remove the, the pins from\nthe star. She did. She wished me good luck, embraced\nme. We, she survived. She was in Israel. I don't know\nif she's still alive. Her name was Shayna Lusuvalsky.\nShe has been one of my mother's nurses. Well we reached\nthe other side of the river. Yes. Everybody got out\nand regrouped. And I stayed behind and hid beside, hid\nbehind some bushes. Waited until everybody had left\nand the, our meeting place had been previously dis-\ncussed and designated. It was on the major highway just\na few feet from the small river, where Maita would be\nwaiting in a carriage. And as soon as we saw each\nother we had to just get on with our journey. There was\na, I guess a coachman who that was the only transporta-\ntion available. Very few civilian cars were, were\navailable in the city. So she was sitting there waiting\nfor me. I jumped in. We didn't say a word. Both of us\nmust have been very, very tense and very, very scared.\nAnd she signaled that we were ready to get to our\ndestination and not one word was exchanged during the\nwhole trip until we got to her place. And incidentally\nshe had a very, very nice place. And once we got there\nwe, we regrouped. And she gave me some\ncoffee and revived my spirits. I think both of us were\ntrembling when we made it up the stairs. And many\nthings happened in that apartment also. Ostensibly I\nwas going to be the maid there. I had my own room.\nAnd I certainly was not treated like a maid but for\nanybody who visited, I had to play the role of a maid.\nVideo Tape No. Camera Roll No. | Sound Roll No.\nKOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BRIGITTE ALTMAN\npage 29\nInterviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W.

Yes, she told me that because the apartment was\nso large, it really was a luxury apartment on the main\nstreet in Kovno they had to give up one room to, to an\nSS woman who worked in the civilian administration.\nAnd of course she told me to be very careful and not to\nlet on that I understood a syllable of German, that I\nwas there as the newly hired Lithuanian maid. I think\nshe gave me a kerchief. Kerchief to tie around me head\nand apron. And some coarse clothes. Because I certain-\nly didn't bring any clothes. I didn't have any clothes.\nSo yes, I had to be very careful around this, very arro-\ngant. I think SS woman. And I helped in the kitchen.\nIt was very pleasant. I stayed out of, out of sight\nwhen somebody visited. Went to my room. Until one day\nMaita had a visitor. A trusted friend, a German woman,\nactually a very nice German woman.
