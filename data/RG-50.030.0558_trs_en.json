        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nHelena Swierczynska, in Arlington \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, in Alexandria, VA on November\n8\", 2008. And the interview is conducted by Stephanie Blyskal. Good evening,\nthank you for letting us interview you. Can you start out telling me your name at\nbirth, and where you were born?",
        "Answer: My name is Helena Swierezynska. I was born on the April 2\u2122, 1943, in\nPoland, in the place called Mielitz(ph). I\u2019m not positive, I\u2019m not sure hundred\npercent that this is exactly where th \u2014 I was born, but that\u2019s what is in my birth\ncertificate. My family was in hiding. Year 1943 was the worst year for Jews, ever,\nin Poland. Until today I don\u2019t understand how my mom could afford to get\npregnant, you know, during such a horrible time. But anyhow, she had the baby in\nhiding. Most of my family was hiding in the \u2014 the \u2014 in the barn. The family lived in\na small village. We had a little bit of land, couple houses, nothing big. But enough,\nbig enough to be hated by all Polish neighbors. So my family, which means my\ngrandmother, my grandpa, and bunch of cousins, they were hiding in the barn \u2014\npaying, of course, huge money for it. And my mom had me that summer, I don\u2019t\nknow where, and with help of midwife. Well, the midwife, she was Polish, and she\ndidn't want to have a Jew \u2014 Jewish baby, you know, for longer than few hours. So\nshe kept me actually one day after I was born. And then my mom, you know, after\ndelivery, she was sick, not able to \u2014 to do nothing. So my two uncles, my mom\u2019s\nbrothers, they came to pick me up. It is very important to understand that I was one\nday \u2014 one day old. My \u2014 my mom was the only daughter, and she had four brothers.\nTwo of them, they took me from that midwife, to the place that the family was\nhiding. And I was crying and crying and crying. By the way, I just learned this all\nfew years ago. I had no idea what happened to me. But my uncle who \u2014 who was\nabout to die, finally he felt that he needs to tell me something. So that\u2019s how I\nlearned, you know. Today I am 65, and I was probably about 60 when the \u2014 you\nknow, I learned what happened to me. So anyhow, I was crying, I was screaming.\nProbably I was hungry, I was wet. And all those people hiding there were scared\nthat, you know, they gonna be killed because of me. So my grandma, according to\nmy uncle, my grandma decided that I cannot be with them. She came up with an\nidea that she\u2019Il \u2014 they will put me on \u2014 on the ground where people walk by a lot,\nand somebody will see a crying baby and will take the baby. That\u2019s what she was\nhoping. Well, nothing like this happened. They put me on that frozen ground. It \u2014\nyou know, the beginning of April in Poland \u2014 I don\u2019t even think it was April, cause\nthe \u2014 there is no certain date, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 probably it was in March, because\nit was very, bitterly cold. So they put me, you know, on that cold ground, you know,\nand they were looking through, you know, sort of the hole in the wall, looking at me\nwhat\u2019s gonna happen. And people were walking \u2014 were walking by, and nobody\nstopped. Nobody stopped. I was screaming like crazy, they were crying. Finally,\nafter I don\u2019t know how many hours, my grandma said no, I \u2014 I cannot do this. She\ndecided, you know, to take me back and when night came, my two uncles took me \u2014\nstill, you know, screaming, to the house of the lady, very simple woman, who was\napparently mentally sick and nobody talked with her. People were scared of her. So\nshe was without of contact with \u2014 with anybody. And her house was on the \u2014 on the\nskirt of that village. They took me there, cause they thought, she\u2019s alone, maybe she\nwill take the baby. So one year old baby \u2014 I mean, one day old baby \u2014 this is very\nimportant and that\u2019s why I repeat it, you know, they put me on her steps. I was\nscreaming. She opened the door, she saw the baby, she took me in. So this was \u00b043.\nI was in her house until \u201945. No idea how \u2014 how \u2014 what happened during this time. I\nmight suspect that when I was crying, she was beating me up, because, you know,\nshe was scared, too. So, actually \u2014 okay, of course, there was no milk. I was\nfeeding, you know, with potatoes and water. I don\u2019t know how this happened that I\nsurvived. It\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019ve talked to the doctors, they say they never heard about such a\nthing. But anyhow, what happened during these two years, my mom, of course \u2014 my\nfather was in a forest, hiding there. And my mom was very depressed. She was 19.\nShe lost her baby, which she never touched. She didn\u2019t have parents and family. So\nshe, one day she decided to go where they were hiding to see her mom and her dad.\nAnd the people who in the meantime took over our houses, our land, these people\nsaw d-\u2014her going there. And they let know to the police \u2014 Polish police, which was\nworking very close with Gestapo, and th-the Germans came, killed almost\neverybody immediately. My two uncles, they were not there, they were hiding in\nthe fields. So my mom, apparently that they \u2014 they didn\u2019t kill her at once, but she\nwas hurt badly. And a few years ago, I went there. I was told not to by many people,\nbecause the people living there, they remember the family. They stole everything\nwhich belongs to us, and I was told it\u2019s dangerous to \u2014 even to be around, especially\nthat I look hundred percent like my dad, so I am very easy to recognize. But I did, I\ngo, I did go there. And I saw \u2014 I met li \u2014 a lady who was \u2014 I was just asking million\nquestions, you know, and just between one sentence and the other, she told me\nabout my family. I couldn't believe my ears, but I \u2014 I didn\u2019t even ask about the\nfamily. But she started to say, oh, we\u2019ve had the Jews, you know, here. There were\nparents and five kids, you know. There was one \u2014 one girl and four brothers. And\nthat girl, she had a baby that\u2019s \u2014 the lady 1s telling me, you know, I am standing in\nfront of her. And \u2014 and she says, but that baby for sure didn\u2019t survive, she says. And\nshe says, I will never forget the scene the day they killed all \u2014 all that family, you\nknow, hiding there. And she was not killed immediately, but she was hurt badly.\nAnd she had the long hair. They grabbed her, you know, for the hair, and they were\ndragging her through the main street of that village to the nearest forest. And they\nthen \u2014 she was killed there. And that woman tells me, you know, I \u2014 this \u2014 I \u2014I can\nsee like today, you know, that blood, you know, behind this woman. She had no\nidea who she talking to, and I had a dilemma, you know. I \u2014 I wasn\u2019t sure \u2014 I mean,\nthat was no time to think it over, but I \u2014 you know, I wanted to do something with\nthis, so before I left, you know \u2014 I was with my husband, by the way, he is Polish,\nand he was shocked even more than I was. And my husband says, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go,\ndon\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t stay here. But before I left, you know, I ask her, do you know whom\nyou're talking to? And she says no. I said, I am that baby, and I survived.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And you have my houses, my land and everything. You will never, ever be with\n\u2014 1n peace with this. That\u2019s how I left. So, you know. But going back, okay, so \u2014 so\nI left. I mean, I lost everybody. I had only my father and two uncles. My father\nsurvived the war, he was in hiding in the forest. And he, right \u2014 you know, when \u2014\nwhen war \u2014 you know, was over, the Russians came in, because I\u2019m talking about\neastern \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 Poland. So first, you know, they didn\u2019t see Americans, they \u2014 they saw\nRussians, and the Russians, you know, came in and my father somehow was able to\nget in touch with my \u2014 one of my uncles, and he knew where I was, you know, in\nwhich house you know, I was, you know. He knew I survived. So, it was \u2014 he came\nin the evening. So, he decided to wait until the morning to pick me up, you know,\ntake me from there. And one of those Polish people, you know, who \u2014 I can say it,\nthey killed my family, okay, saw him, and they got scared. So, what they did, they\nkilled him, just from outside of the house through the window. He was shot and\nkilled immediately. My uncle who was with him, he saw it, he run to the street, and\nthe \u2014 the Russian tanks, you know, were coming, you know. He stops one of the\ntanks and he says, oh, th-th-th-the Pol \u2014 Polish guy just killed a Jew, you know?\nAnd that guy, the Russian guy says, do you know who, exactly? My uncle says,\nyeah. My uncle, the one who told me this story, which I was waiting, you know, 50\nyear \u2014 60 years to hear. And he said, yes, I know. Show me. Well, Russians killed\nthe guy, you know.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Just like this. So, okay. So I had two uncles, young men. Because you know,\nfour kids, my mom was the oldest. So my mom was like \u2014 more like a mother to\nthem, okay? They \u2014 they came to pick me up \u2014 well, actually, they \u2014 he told me\nwith this \u2014 I\u2019m gonna tell you a lot of bitter words about Jews. I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, it\u2019s fine.",
        "A: But my uncles, you know, they didn\u2019t take care of me. He told me that when he\ncame, you know, to see me, you know, I was behaving like \u2014 like a little animal. I\nwas hiding everywhere, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t let anybody to come close to me. I was \u2014 you\nknow, sick. Later, you know, I \u2014 I\u2014 you know, the doctors discovered I had\ntuberculosis, I am surprised only tuberculosis, you know. And I didn\u2019t speak. I \u2014 I\nha \u2014 hardly walk. I was \u2014 I was just like, you know, like animal. So he was not even\nable to \u2014 to come close to me and touch me. So they left me. They left me and this\nwoman, she didn\u2019t want me. I don\u2019t thinks she ever liked me, but you know, it was\nsomething human in her that she took me in. But anyway, as soon as it was\npossible, she put me in the orphanage home. It was \u201945 -\u201946, a lot of anti-Semitism\nin Poland til today. So, I started my second holocaust, which I am very\ndisappointed, you know, like [indecipherable] you know, you talk a lot about, you\nknow, what happened, how was the war, this and that. Nobody talks about people\nafter the Holocaust. People \u2014 especially about the people who were still in Poland.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And had to face, you know, another holocaust, another hatred, another anti-\nSemitism.",
        "Q: Can I just stop you for one minute \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 and ask you one question. What di \u2014 you have no memories of being in this\nhouse with this woman \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 who was taking care of you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What \u2014 and we\u2019re probably going to get to this, but what do you think your first\nmemory was? What\u2019s the first thing that you remember as a \u2014 as a child?",
        "A: The \u2014 the orphanage home.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And where \u2014 where was that?",
        "A: Hoo. How many, you should ask.",
        "Q: How many were there?",
        "A: Seven.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So where did you start out?",
        "A: So, I was in orphanage home in Krakow, in Zheshuv, in Kielce and Radom.",
        "Q: Right. So \u2014 so when s \u2014",
        "A: They seventh \u2014 you know, the thing was, nobody wanted to adopt me. Ah. And\nmy uncle, my beautiful family, they just escaped Poland. Poland was a dangerous\nplace to live, so they just escaped, they left me. Like piece of nothing, garbage.",
        "Q: How \u2014",
        "A: Little girl, completely unprotected, with nobody.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they \u2014 first they went to Breslau, [indecipherable] then from there to\nGermany. From Germany to America. And I was still alive, one orphanage home,\nsecond, third, fourth, fifth. Many, many kids were adopted. And I remember nobody\nwanted me. I was ugly. I know I am \u2014 I am good looking now. I am like a, you\nknow, wine, which you know, ge \u2014 as more 1s \u2014 older it 1s, is better, yeah. I am\nsomehow \u2014 yeah, I am kind of attractive woman comparing my age, of course. But,\nas a\u2014asachild, I was ugly, and I didn\u2019t speak. I hardly walk. I peed in my pants,\nyou know, until I was probably 11 or 12. Scared to death, and physically sick. So, it\nwas \u2014 it was very difficult, and this I remember. Seeing, you know, a lot of kids,\nyou know, going with the other families, and I was still there. And because, you\nknow, it was after war, you know, lack of money and this and that. So they were\nclosing one home and open another one, and they were transferring, you know,\nkids.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So that\u2019s how, you know, I was traveling. And one day, I was seven years old,\nlook how many years I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2014I was there, came the man, by himself. He was\nlooking for somebody to adopt. He was by himself, without a wife, which was\nstupid, because that kind of decision should be, you know, taken by both parents.\nBut, you know, she probably told him, well, whatever you do, you know, I agree.\nSo he saw me, he was very good man, and he said, her. So to \u2014 they adopted me.\nUnfortunately, she disliked me from the first moment she saw me. Actually, you\nknow, now, looking you know to the back from the perspective, all the years of\nexperience and, you know, knowledge, I got about life, about people, I think she\nwas mentally sick. And her behavior, you know, is really difficult to explain. But I\nknow it now. As a little kid, you know, I just felt, not only not loved, but just \u2014 you\nknow, being hated, you know. Very scary thing to somebody like me, who hardly\nsurvived.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Anyhow, he was wonderful guy, but he was weak man, and she was the one with\n\u2014 with the pants, you know, so they both were communists and she was, as I say,\nmore red than the red flag. So maybe that\u2019s why I never enrolled in communist\nparty, and everything which goes with communists, you know, is, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Right, mm-hm.",
        "A: \u2014 against what I believe in. Because I dislike her with all my heart. So this was\nmy third holocaust. And she hated me that much, that finally it came to the point\nthat I had a choice, to get married with whoever and then get out, or just to go on\nthe street.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, you know, I got married.",
        "Q: How old were you?",
        "A: 19. And the guy, he knew I was a Jew. I knew nothing about my family. What I\ntold you now, I learned few years ago. I knew nothing, zero. I knew I am a Jew.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That\u2019s all.",
        "Q: Did you have \u2014 still have your birth certificate with you, did you have paper \u2014",
        "A: I never \u2014 I ne \u2014",
        "Q: Like, how did they know your name, how did they know \u2014",
        "A: [had zero documents. All I have is one picture of my dad, that my uncle gave\nme, nothing about my mom. And my birth certificate was written after the war,\nwher \u2014 and th-there \u2014 there is, you know, a note, parents un \u2014 unknown, you know.\nSo actually, I\u2019m not certain of the day, I\u2019m not certain on the place, you know. It\u2019s\njust \u2014 it just a\u2014 a document \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 means nothing to me.",
        "Q: Did your uncles \u2014 when \u2014 your uncle when he dropped you off at the orphanage,\nor however you got there, he gave you your information?",
        "A: No, no \u2014",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: \u2014no, no. What happened with them, th-they f\u2014 they came to America, and\nbefore they came to America they \u2014 they started to make money in Poland selling\nthis and that, you know, it was popular then. Popular way to make money. But\nanyhow, no, actually they like crossed me out. And I didn\u2019t know \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 about them. I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know nothing, until one day \u2014 one day. My oldest\nuncle, he was about to be called to Korea in \u201953. And he was afraid that he might\nnot come back. So he decided to look for me. I mean, it was something, you know,\nhe was, I guess, afraid to face the God. He started to look for me through Red\nCross, because they \u2014 first, you know, they contact the \u2014 the orphanage ho-home\nthey know I was \u2014 that \u2014 that address changed and changed. They went through Red\nCross, and finally he was able to find me being adopted to those people. The name\nwas Zyro, z-y-r-0. But I just got married. So, sort of like he wanted to do\nsomething for me. Actually, 1t was too late. And \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2014I guess I\u2019m wondering how the people at the orphanage knew who you were.\nLike, how they knew your name, how they knew when you were supposedly born.",
        "A: They probably called \u2014 they \u2014 they gave me the name, and you know, it was\nfollowing \u2014 following me from one place to another.",
        "Q: So, they si\u2014 they probably knew your last name.",
        "A: No, no, no \u2014",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: \u2014 no, no, no.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: Because you know, that uncle I\u2019m talking about, he\u2019s the one who told me \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 this whole story a few years ago, before he died. And he didn\u2019t know my\nname, and nothing. You know, I was just born.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know. They w \u2014 they all \u2014 I mean, th \u2014 th \u2014 my uncles, they were young\nmen. And I am surprised that \u2014 which I told him, cause I am very open person, you\nknow, and if I have something to say, I do say, no matter what. And I told him once,\nI asked him, how could you leave such a little baby after this all, and just escape,\nyou know, to \u2014 how can you, you know, leave like this, with this knowledge? He\nsaid oh, you know, we were so young, we \u2014 we win \u2014 we knew we had \u2014 we have to\nescape. What do we do a do \u2014 what do we \u2014 we do with such a baby, you know, we\n\u2014 we \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t even know what to do. And I said, hey, people you know, go to\nconcentrate camp, you know, go t \u2014 you know, to air \u2014 anything and everything, the\nfamily is together. We \u2014 the \u2014 people were dying because they wanted to be\ntogether. So there is no way, never ever, that I can understand and forgive. And I\ntold him this. I told him this. So \u2014 but anyway, so I \u2014 I knew I have a family in\nAmerica, okay? Well, I thought they, maybe they \u2014 they can help me, or whatever.\nWell, the life in Poland was not easy. One thing I have to say positive about my\nstep-mom. As bad as she was to me as a mom, she was very demanding in terms of\neducation. She pushed me hard, so I had to go, you know, higher and higher and\nhigher. And this is something that, I have to admit it, I have because of her. How\nmuch I need it, I don\u2019t know. Well, definitely it\u2019s useful, but anyhow, with my first\nhusband, I \u2014 I had the first son who died shortly after was born. It was sort of\npathology you know, probably, it doesn\u2019t matter. But it still hurt, you know. Then, I\nhad another son, and my son, Robert, he\u2019s gonna be 40 in few days. He\u2019s\neverything I have. So one day, I, before he graduated from the high school, I send\nhim to America for a vacation, to see the friends, and \u2014 and he fell in love with\nAmerica. He got crazy about America, you know, he loved everything here. He\nbegged me, Mom, I love this country. Do whatever you can, come here and we will\nstay here. Well, you know, I have only one son, and as I say, nothing else matters in\nmy life. So I said okay, Pll try, Pll see. Took me three years to get Polish passport,\nbecause it still \u2014 we had the communist.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Communist there, and ma \u2014 I was constantly told by \u2014 by the authorities that I\u2019m\ntoo high educated, I\u2019m needed in Poland.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So they didn\u2019t want me \u2014 they didn\u2019t want me to \u2014 to \u2014 to leave Poland. So my\nson was here for three years by himself, calling me constantly, spending all the\nmoney, you know, he was able to make, you know, on the phone, see, it costs\nfortune then. And he said, Mom, if you don\u2019t come, I\u2019Il come back. So I, you know,\nput myself, you know, on \u2014 on my \u2014 you know, almost upside-down, you know, and\nfinally I got the passport, and I came here. I was hoping that my family, my two\nuncles, they will help me, if not for myself, maybe for their parents, or maybe for\ntheir only one sister. Stupid me. Nothing. And because I came, you know, for a\nvisit, I had no papers, no green card, no driver\u2019s license, nothing. So, I had to start\nfrom the scratch. My son, he is a genius. It\u2019s out of question. It\u2019s not because he 1s\nmy son, and you will understand why, I'll tell you. I know when mom talks about\nown child, mom thinks it\u2019s \u2014 his child \u2014 her child is the best in the world. I\u2019m not\neasy to \u2014 to praise anything and anybody, I am very difficult, you know. But my son\nsurprises me every single day of my life. He never went to college. He doesn\u2019t have\nany degree, all he\u2019s got is high school. Because when I came ho \u2014 here, he was\nworking in a factory as, you know, it was a\u2014a\u2014I don\u2019t know how to call it, steel,\nyou know? Steel, they \u2014 they, you know, were \u2014 were processing, you know, out all\nyou know, like iron and everything. So, he had to work physically, you know. They\ndidn\u2019t have proper equipment, so mostly he had to, you know \u2014",

Not for young people. For my son, he loves America. He\u2019s\nactually American. He speaks like American you know, no accent, nothing. He just\nabsorbed everything easily, immediately. For me, I was 45, between 45 - 46\nactually. Start from scratch, learn English, go so much down from where I was, was\nalmost impossible. My so \u2014 my \u2014 my husband followed me \u2014 my second husband,\nbecause the first one, I, you know, divorce after 11 years.

It was very difficult, he didn\u2019t\nwant to give me divorce. He fight it. Maybe he loved me, but in the way, you know,\nI could not accept. My son was four years old. And remembering the background,\nyou know, where I\u2019m coming from, it was so dif \u2014 so \u2014 so important for me to be f\u2014\nfor my son, you know, no matter what.

        "A: You know, I live in a neighborhood, there are no Jews. No synagogues, nothing,\nand not that I care, you know, but that\u2019s how it is. So, my second husband, he \u2014 he\nis a good man, but America was too much for him. He followed me, he followed\nme up here, and he couldn\u2019t stand America. First of all, he was not able to learn\nEnglish, so for him, very good engineer, somebody really important, V.LP. in\nPoland, and suddenly here, nobody. And it\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t try. I know he was\ntrying hard to learn English, he just was not able. So, one day, it was 10 years ago,\nhe told me, Helena, I can\u2019t stay here. I want to go back. And he said, you should go\nback with me, because Robert, my son, you know, he\u2019s gonna hav \u2014 have own\nfamily, and you know, besides, you work too hard in America. And in Poland you\ngonna be a lady. You may do nothing, or a little. What I was doing here, you know,\nafter cleaning, I was taking care of old people. Then I, when I got green card, my\nfirst job, nursing home, I was cleaning after dead people. That was my job. For\nalmost two years. And one day, my supervisor \u2014 I wa \u2014 I was part of housekeeping\ndepartment, my supervisor realized that, you know, I am worth much more, and I\u2019m\nable to be in charge of people, and this and that. And he might get some cash, you\nknow, for me, if he finds me a job. Which I had no idea, at the moment. He asked\nme if I want to be a supervisor. And I said, I\u2019m too old. I was like 48, you know. He\nsays no, that\u2019s the perfect time, you know. So, I was a supervisor, it was next step.\nThen, account manager, then manager. So working hard and hard and hard, I got\nsomewhere. With pretty mo \u2014 pretty good money. But I lost my marriage, and my\nhusband, I divorce him, because I told him, you know, you have to be here or there,\nyou cannot be little bit here, little bit there, you know. And he said, I can\u2019t.\nAmerica is not for me. And I said, look, I cannot, you know, leave my son alone.\nHe\u2019s got nobody. And \u2014 and that\u2019s how it ended up. My son, when he was 20, that\nplace he worked, you know, at, a couple American guys, they offered him, they \u2014\nyou know, they realized that he \u2014 he is very talented [indecipherable] I mean, I \u2014\nit\u2019s \u2014 you know, I have no answer for this, because the guy, whatever he touches,\nit\u2019s superb. If he cooks, it\u2019s, you know, superb cooking, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow. I\u2014I-\u2014TI didn\u2019t teach him, you know. Whatever he does, he just \u2014 he does\nexcellent job. And he\u2019s very handy in terms of electronic, and cell phones. So they,\ntogether they started cellular phone dealership, 20 years ago. He was 20 years then.\nIn the meantime, one guy got killed in motorcycle accident. The other one,\nsomething happened, so in the meantime he just \u2014 he is alone, he is the only one.\nAnd this company is still alive. This company goes through, you know, hard time,\nlike \u2014 like whole \u2014 whole economy, you know, but we\u2019re still in business.",

They both \u2014 they were Jews, but they never talked about this, and it\nwas like a \u2014 something to be ashamed of, you know. They never admitted to\nanything from this area, you know. Just \u2014 they were very much involved in what\nhappened in Poland they \u2014 those years, and I am not proud of it, because my step-\nmom, she was teaching \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to say in English, but you know,\nprobably Marx, Lenin \u2014",

His wife\nis American Italian, and she\u2019s not religion too, but \u2014 but still, you know, it\u2019s far.

He \u2014 he recognize this, and he is very thankful. And I can tell you one\nthing, okay, which might make you think. When I had that interview with Shoah,\nyou know, they told me to turn off the phones. It was in my house, and my son, he\ncalls me hundred times a day, Mom, what are you doing? Wh-Wh-Why you doing\nthis, where you going? Whom you\u2019re going with? Do you have to go? You know,\nyou \u2014 it\u2019s that kind of \u2014 I \u2014 he \u2014 he thinks that because I never had a family, he\nthinks that he is my \u2014 my both parents together. He feels that he has to take care of\nme. He \u2014 you know, he\u2019s now okay with this, you know, Washington stuff,\nbecause she\u2019s with me, and \u2014 and he \u2014 and he trusts her.",

I understand it\u2019s not good, and I\u2019m not\nhappy about this. But that\u2019s the point, you know, that we both came to, you know.\nBut anyhow, this was the mo \u2014 he knew that I h \u2014I have this interview at home, he\nknew. And my both phones were disconnected. He was nervous, you know;; it took\nfew hours.",

I didn\u2019t want him to be involved in this \u2014 in this interview, you\nknow. I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not that kind of mother, that I don\u2019t think that \u2014 that kids have\nto take your \u2014 all the burden, you know. I mean, everybody has own life, own\nresponsibilities. I didn\u2019t want him to be part of it. He\u2019s got enough. But he walked\nin, so she said, oh, as you\u2019re here, maybe you want to say something, because we\nare very happy when we can talk to second generation, and maybe you \u2014 you have\nsomething to add to what your mom said. And I can see my son, you know, walking\nup the stairs, I had a townhouse, you know, on \u2014 on the upper floor. And he was\nwalking up the stairs, he \u2014 he said \u2014 he \u2014 you know, jeans, and not dressed up,\nnothing, completely, you know, out of the blue. And he said, okay. And he \u2014 in the\nend of everything, he just said few words. And he said \u2014 you don\u2019t even know Ida,\nbecause I didn\u2019t tell you. He said, this is my mom. And he said, this is \u2014 that I am\nhere, as you can see me, it\u2019s only in hundred percent because of her. He says, this is\nthe best thing ever happened in my life, that\u2019s my mom. That\u2019s what \u2014 how it was, I\nmean. So he knows, and you know, he \u2014 he understands.

So, my son, my son, as I mentioned to you, he\u2019s gonna be 40 in few days.\nAnd I am very proud of him, I really am. Without a college degree, he managed,\nyou know, to \u2014 you know, get to the point that not many people in America are able\nto get. And I was able to not only survive, but take care of myself. The \u2014 the bad\npart is that I am alone.

        "Answer: My name is Helena Swierezynska. I was born on the April 2\u2122, 1943, in\nPoland, in the place called Mielitz(ph). I\u2019m not positive, I\u2019m not sure hundred\npercent that this is exactly where th \u2014 I was born, but that\u2019s what is in my birth\ncertificate. My family was in hiding. Year 1943 was the worst year for Jews, ever,\nin Poland. Until today I don\u2019t understand how my mom could afford to get\npregnant, you know, during such a horrible time. But anyhow, she had the baby in\nhiding. Most of my family was hiding in the \u2014 the \u2014 in the barn. The family lived in\na small village. We had a little bit of land, couple houses, nothing big. But enough,\nbig enough to be hated by all Polish neighbors. So my family, which means my\ngrandmother, my grandpa, and bunch of cousins, they were hiding in the barn \u2014\npaying, of course, huge money for it. And my mom had me that summer, I don\u2019t\nknow where, and with help of midwife. Well, the midwife, she was Polish, and she\ndidn't want to have a Jew \u2014 Jewish baby, you know, for longer than few hours. So\nshe kept me actually one day after I was born. And then my mom, you know, after\ndelivery, she was sick, not able to \u2014 to do nothing. So my two uncles, my mom\u2019s\nbrothers, they came to pick me up. It is very important to understand that I was one\nday \u2014 one day old. My \u2014 my mom was the only daughter, and she had four brothers.\nTwo of them, they took me from that midwife, to the place that the family was\nhiding. And I was crying and crying and crying. By the way, I just learned this all\nfew years ago. I had no idea what happened to me. But my uncle who \u2014 who was\nabout to die, finally he felt that he needs to tell me something. So that\u2019s how I\nlearned, you know. Today I am 65, and I was probably about 60 when the \u2014 you\nknow, I learned what happened to me. So anyhow, I was crying, I was screaming.\nProbably I was hungry, I was wet. And all those people hiding there were scared\nthat, you know, they gonna be killed because of me. So my grandma, according to\nmy uncle, my grandma decided that I cannot be with them. She came up with an\nidea that she\u2019Il \u2014 they will put me on \u2014 on the ground where people walk by a lot,\nand somebody will see a crying baby and will take the baby. That\u2019s what she was\nhoping. Well, nothing like this happened. They put me on that frozen ground. It \u2014\nyou know, the beginning of April in Poland \u2014 I don\u2019t even think it was April, cause\nthe \u2014 there is no certain date, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 probably it was in March, because\nit was very, bitterly cold. So they put me, you know, on that cold ground, you know,\nand they were looking through, you know, sort of the hole in the wall, looking at me\nwhat\u2019s gonna happen. And people were walking \u2014 were walking by, and nobody\nstopped. Nobody stopped. I was screaming like crazy, they were crying. Finally,\nafter I don\u2019t know how many hours, my grandma said no, I \u2014 I cannot do this. She\ndecided, you know, to take me back and when night came, my two uncles took me \u2014\nstill, you know, screaming, to the house of the lady, very simple woman, who was\napparently mentally sick and nobody talked with her. People were scared of her. So\nshe was without of contact with \u2014 with anybody. And her house was on the \u2014 on the\nskirt of that village. They took me there, cause they thought, she\u2019s alone, maybe she\nwill take the baby. So one year old baby \u2014 I mean, one day old baby \u2014 this is very\nimportant and that\u2019s why I repeat it, you know, they put me on her steps. I was\nscreaming. She opened the door, she saw the baby, she took me in. So this was \u00b043.\nI was in her house until \u201945. No idea how \u2014 how \u2014 what happened during this time. I\nmight suspect that when I was crying, she was beating me up, because, you know,\nshe was scared, too. So, actually \u2014 okay, of course, there was no milk. I was\nfeeding, you know, with potatoes and water. I don\u2019t know how this happened that I\nsurvived. It\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019ve talked to the doctors, they say they never heard about such a\nthing. But anyhow, what happened during these two years, my mom, of course \u2014 my\nfather was in a forest, hiding there. And my mom was very depressed. She was 19.\nShe lost her baby, which she never touched. She didn\u2019t have parents and family. So\nshe, one day she decided to go where they were hiding to see her mom and her dad.\nAnd the people who in the meantime took over our houses, our land, these people\nsaw d-\u2014her going there. And they let know to the police \u2014 Polish police, which was\nworking very close with Gestapo, and th-the Germans came, killed almost\neverybody immediately. My two uncles, they were not there, they were hiding in\nthe fields. So my mom, apparently that they \u2014 they didn\u2019t kill her at once, but she\nwas hurt badly. And a few years ago, I went there. I was told not to by many people,\nbecause the people living there, they remember the family. They stole everything\nwhich belongs to us, and I was told it\u2019s dangerous to \u2014 even to be around, especially\nthat I look hundred percent like my dad, so I am very easy to recognize. But I did, I\ngo, I did go there. And I saw \u2014 I met li \u2014 a lady who was \u2014 I was just asking million\nquestions, you know, and just between one sentence and the other, she told me\nabout my family. I couldn't believe my ears, but I \u2014 I didn\u2019t even ask about the\nfamily. But she started to say, oh, we\u2019ve had the Jews, you know, here. There were\nparents and five kids, you know. There was one \u2014 one girl and four brothers. And\nthat girl, she had a baby that\u2019s \u2014 the lady 1s telling me, you know, I am standing in\nfront of her. And \u2014 and she says, but that baby for sure didn\u2019t survive, she says. And\nshe says, I will never forget the scene the day they killed all \u2014 all that family, you\nknow, hiding there. And she was not killed immediately, but she was hurt badly.\nAnd she had the long hair. They grabbed her, you know, for the hair, and they were\ndragging her through the main street of that village to the nearest forest. And they\nthen \u2014 she was killed there. And that woman tells me, you know, I \u2014 this \u2014 I \u2014I can\nsee like today, you know, that blood, you know, behind this woman. She had no\nidea who she talking to, and I had a dilemma, you know. I \u2014 I wasn\u2019t sure \u2014 I mean,\nthat was no time to think it over, but I \u2014 you know, I wanted to do something with\nthis, so before I left, you know \u2014 I was with my husband, by the way, he is Polish,\nand he was shocked even more than I was. And my husband says, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go,\ndon\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t stay here. But before I left, you know, I ask her, do you know whom\nyou're talking to? And she says no. I said, I am that baby, and I survived.",
        "A: And you have my houses, my land and everything. You will never, ever be with\n\u2014 1n peace with this. That\u2019s how I left. So, you know. But going back, okay, so \u2014 so\nI left. I mean, I lost everybody. I had only my father and two uncles. My father\nsurvived the war, he was in hiding in the forest. And he, right \u2014 you know, when \u2014\nwhen war \u2014 you know, was over, the Russians came in, because I\u2019m talking about\neastern \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Poland. So first, you know, they didn\u2019t see Americans, they \u2014 they saw\nRussians, and the Russians, you know, came in and my father somehow was able to\nget in touch with my \u2014 one of my uncles, and he knew where I was, you know, in\nwhich house you know, I was, you know. He knew I survived. So, it was \u2014 he came\nin the evening. So, he decided to wait until the morning to pick me up, you know,\ntake me from there. And one of those Polish people, you know, who \u2014 I can say it,\nthey killed my family, okay, saw him, and they got scared. So, what they did, they\nkilled him, just from outside of the house through the window. He was shot and\nkilled immediately. My uncle who was with him, he saw it, he run to the street, and\nthe \u2014 the Russian tanks, you know, were coming, you know. He stops one of the\ntanks and he says, oh, th-th-th-the Pol \u2014 Polish guy just killed a Jew, you know?\nAnd that guy, the Russian guy says, do you know who, exactly? My uncle says,\nyeah. My uncle, the one who told me this story, which I was waiting, you know, 50\nyear \u2014 60 years to hear. And he said, yes, I know. Show me. Well, Russians killed\nthe guy, you know.",
        "A: Just like this. So, okay. So I had two uncles, young men. Because you know,\nfour kids, my mom was the oldest. So my mom was like \u2014 more like a mother to\nthem, okay? They \u2014 they came to pick me up \u2014 well, actually, they \u2014 he told me\nwith this \u2014 I\u2019m gonna tell you a lot of bitter words about Jews. I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: But my uncles, you know, they didn\u2019t take care of me. He told me that when he\ncame, you know, to see me, you know, I was behaving like \u2014 like a little animal. I\nwas hiding everywhere, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t let anybody to come close to me. I was \u2014 you\nknow, sick. Later, you know, I \u2014 I\u2014 you know, the doctors discovered I had\ntuberculosis, I am surprised only tuberculosis, you know. And I didn\u2019t speak. I \u2014 I\nha \u2014 hardly walk. I was \u2014 I was just like, you know, like animal. So he was not even\nable to \u2014 to come close to me and touch me. So they left me. They left me and this\nwoman, she didn\u2019t want me. I don\u2019t thinks she ever liked me, but you know, it was\nsomething human in her that she took me in. But anyway, as soon as it was\npossible, she put me in the orphanage home. It was \u201945 -\u201946, a lot of anti-Semitism\nin Poland til today. So, I started my second holocaust, which I am very\ndisappointed, you know, like [indecipherable] you know, you talk a lot about, you\nknow, what happened, how was the war, this and that. Nobody talks about people\nafter the Holocaust. People \u2014 especially about the people who were still in Poland.",
        "A: And had to face, you know, another holocaust, another hatred, another anti-\nSemitism.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: The \u2014 the orphanage home.",
        "A: Hoo. How many, you should ask.",
        "A: Seven.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: So, I was in orphanage home in Krakow, in Zheshuv, in Kielce and Radom.",
        "A: They seventh \u2014 you know, the thing was, nobody wanted to adopt me. Ah. And\nmy uncle, my beautiful family, they just escaped Poland. Poland was a dangerous\nplace to live, so they just escaped, they left me. Like piece of nothing, garbage.",
        "A: Little girl, completely unprotected, with nobody.",
        "A: And they \u2014 first they went to Breslau, [indecipherable] then from there to\nGermany. From Germany to America. And I was still alive, one orphanage home,\nsecond, third, fourth, fifth. Many, many kids were adopted. And I remember nobody\nwanted me. I was ugly. I know I am \u2014 I am good looking now. I am like a, you\nknow, wine, which you know, ge \u2014 as more 1s \u2014 older it 1s, is better, yeah. I am\nsomehow \u2014 yeah, I am kind of attractive woman comparing my age, of course. But,\nas a\u2014asachild, I was ugly, and I didn\u2019t speak. I hardly walk. I peed in my pants,\nyou know, until I was probably 11 or 12. Scared to death, and physically sick. So, it\nwas \u2014 it was very difficult, and this I remember. Seeing, you know, a lot of kids,\nyou know, going with the other families, and I was still there. And because, you\nknow, it was after war, you know, lack of money and this and that. So they were\nclosing one home and open another one, and they were transferring, you know,\nkids.",
        "A: So that\u2019s how, you know, I was traveling. And one day, I was seven years old,\nlook how many years I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2014I was there, came the man, by himself. He was\nlooking for somebody to adopt. He was by himself, without a wife, which was\nstupid, because that kind of decision should be, you know, taken by both parents.\nBut, you know, she probably told him, well, whatever you do, you know, I agree.\nSo he saw me, he was very good man, and he said, her. So to \u2014 they adopted me.\nUnfortunately, she disliked me from the first moment she saw me. Actually, you\nknow, now, looking you know to the back from the perspective, all the years of\nexperience and, you know, knowledge, I got about life, about people, I think she\nwas mentally sick. And her behavior, you know, is really difficult to explain. But I\nknow it now. As a little kid, you know, I just felt, not only not loved, but just \u2014 you\nknow, being hated, you know. Very scary thing to somebody like me, who hardly\nsurvived.",
        "A: Anyhow, he was wonderful guy, but he was weak man, and she was the one with\n\u2014 with the pants, you know, so they both were communists and she was, as I say,\nmore red than the red flag. So maybe that\u2019s why I never enrolled in communist\nparty, and everything which goes with communists, you know, is, you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 against what I believe in. Because I dislike her with all my heart. So this was\nmy third holocaust. And she hated me that much, that finally it came to the point\nthat I had a choice, to get married with whoever and then get out, or just to go on\nthe street.",
        "A: So, you know, I got married.",
        "A: 19. And the guy, he knew I was a Jew. I knew nothing about my family. What I\ntold you now, I learned few years ago. I knew nothing, zero. I knew I am a Jew.",
        "A: That\u2019s all.",
        "A: I never \u2014 I ne \u2014",
        "A: [had zero documents. All I have is one picture of my dad, that my uncle gave\nme, nothing about my mom. And my birth certificate was written after the war,\nwher \u2014 and th-there \u2014 there is, you know, a note, parents un \u2014 unknown, you know.\nSo actually, I\u2019m not certain of the day, I\u2019m not certain on the place, you know. It\u2019s\njust \u2014 it just a\u2014 a document \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 means nothing to me.",
        "A: No, no \u2014",
        "A: \u2014no, no. What happened with them, th-they f\u2014 they came to America, and\nbefore they came to America they \u2014 they started to make money in Poland selling\nthis and that, you know, it was popular then. Popular way to make money. But\nanyhow, no, actually they like crossed me out. And I didn\u2019t know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 about them. I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know nothing, until one day \u2014 one day. My oldest\nuncle, he was about to be called to Korea in \u201953. And he was afraid that he might\nnot come back. So he decided to look for me. I mean, it was something, you know,\nhe was, I guess, afraid to face the God. He started to look for me through Red\nCross, because they \u2014 first, you know, they contact the \u2014 the orphanage ho-home\nthey know I was \u2014 that \u2014 that address changed and changed. They went through Red\nCross, and finally he was able to find me being adopted to those people. The name\nwas Zyro, z-y-r-0. But I just got married. So, sort of like he wanted to do\nsomething for me. Actually, 1t was too late. And \u2014",
        "A: They probably called \u2014 they \u2014 they gave me the name, and you know, it was\nfollowing \u2014 following me from one place to another.",

And I am surprised that \u2014 which I told him, cause I am very open person, you\nknow, and if I have something to say, I do say, no matter what. And I told him once,\nI asked him, how could you leave such a little baby after this all, and just escape,\nyou know, to \u2014 how can you, you know, leave like this, with this knowledge? He\nsaid oh, you know, we were so young, we \u2014 we win \u2014 we knew we had \u2014 we have to\nescape. What do we do a do \u2014 what do we \u2014 we do with such a baby, you know, we\n\u2014 we \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t even know what to do. And I said, hey, people you know, go to\nconcentrate camp, you know, go t \u2014 you know, to air \u2014 anything and everything, the\nfamily is together. We \u2014 the \u2014 people were dying because they wanted to be\ntogether. So there is no way, never ever, that I can understand and forgive. And I\ntold him this. I told him this. So \u2014 but anyway, so I \u2014 I knew I have a family in\nAmerica, okay? Well, I thought they, maybe they \u2014 they can help me, or whatever.\nWell, the life in Poland was not easy. One thing I have to say positive about my\nstep-mom. As bad as she was to me as a mom, she was very demanding in terms of\neducation. She pushed me hard, so I had to go, you know, higher and higher and\nhigher. And this is something that, I have to admit it, I have because of her. How\nmuch I need it, I don\u2019t know. Well, definitely it\u2019s useful, but anyhow, with my first\nhusband, I \u2014 I had the first son who died shortly after was born. It was sort of\npathology you know, probably, it doesn\u2019t matter. But it still hurt, you know. Then, I\nhad another son, and my son, Robert, he\u2019s gonna be 40 in few days. He\u2019s\neverything I have. So one day, I, before he graduated from the high school, I send\nhim to America for a vacation, to see the friends, and \u2014 and he fell in love with\nAmerica. He got crazy about America, you know, he loved everything here. He\nbegged me, Mom, I love this country. Do whatever you can, come here and we will\nstay here. Well, you know, I have only one son, and as I say, nothing else matters in\nmy life. So I said okay, Pll try, Pll see. Took me three years to get Polish passport,\nbecause it still \u2014 we had the communist.",
        "A: Communist there, and ma \u2014 I was constantly told by \u2014 by the authorities that I\u2019m\ntoo high educated, I\u2019m needed in Poland.",
        "A: So they didn\u2019t want me \u2014 they didn\u2019t want me to \u2014 to \u2014 to leave Poland. So my\nson was here for three years by himself, calling me constantly, spending all the\nmoney, you know, he was able to make, you know, on the phone, see, it costs\nfortune then. And he said, Mom, if you don\u2019t come, I\u2019Il come back. So I, you know,\nput myself, you know, on \u2014 on my \u2014 you know, almost upside-down, you know, and\nfinally I got the passport, and I came here. I was hoping that my family, my two\nuncles, they will help me, if not for myself, maybe for their parents, or maybe for\ntheir only one sister. Stupid me. Nothing. And because I came, you know, for a\nvisit, I had no papers, no green card, no driver\u2019s license, nothing. So, I had to start\nfrom the scratch. My son, he is a genius. It\u2019s out of question. It\u2019s not because he 1s\nmy son, and you will understand why, I'll tell you. I know when mom talks about\nown child, mom thinks it\u2019s \u2014 his child \u2014 her child is the best in the world. I\u2019m not\neasy to \u2014 to praise anything and anybody, I am very difficult, you know. But my son\nsurprises me every single day of my life. He never went to college. He doesn\u2019t have\nany degree, all he\u2019s got is high school. Because when I came ho \u2014 here, he was\nworking in a factory as, you know, it was a\u2014a\u2014I don\u2019t know how to call it, steel,\nyou know? Steel, they \u2014 they, you know, were \u2014 were processing, you know, out all\nyou know, like iron and everything. So, he had to work physically, you know. They\ndidn\u2019t have proper equipment, so mostly he had to, you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 put manually, you know, tons of things, you know, into the press, which his\nback is hurt and there will be suffering until the \u2014 the last, you know, day of his life.\nBut he loved America. As of me, I started to clean the houses. First, I was stupid\nenough to rich to Jewish people. Not far from where we were renting an apartment,\nthere was a synagogue.",
        "A: Skokie",
        "A: And, you know, I know nothing about religion, about Jews, ye \u2014 you know, there\nare \u2014 there were no Jews around me. Tabula rasa, if you know what it means.",
        "A: So, but I did go to synagogue, and I talked to the rabbi, and I told him my story.\nAnd I said, rabbi, I \u2014 I\u2019m not looking for you to give me the money, what I need is a\njob, any job, simple job, because we have no bread \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 on the table.",
        "A: This was the beginning of 90 \u2014 1990.",
        "A: Mm-hm, because I came to America it was in September \u201989. So it was a couple\n\u2014 couple months later, okay? And what the rabbi said, oh, he was touched of course,\nhe was touched. It\u2019s hard not to be touched by this story, the story of, you know,\none day old baby left alone. He said, well, I don\u2019t have a job for you, but if you\nwant you can clean my house. And I said okay, I will do that. And you know what?\nI did clean his house, took me over 10 hours. He paid me 40 dollars, and I had\nnever, ever seen as dirty, filthy house in my life. Never before and never after. They\nhad like five cats or something, you know, the cobwebs. That stuff from the cats,\nyou know, underneath of the beds. I couldn\u2019t believe that the house could be that\ndirty, you know. That\u2019s how rabbi helped me. Well, actually, he cured me. I never,\never went rich to Jews. Never. And you would not talk to me today, if not one\nfriend of mine. She \u2014 she tries, you know, to bring me, you know, closer. But I\u2019m\nstill in denial, you know.",
        "A: There\u2019s too \u2014 too many bad things. And the funny thing about Polish people, you\nknow, is they \u2014 first of all they think, you Jew? Oh, you must be rich. That\u2019s one \u2014\none thing. The second thing, you Jew? Ooh, Jew \u2014 Jewish \u2014 Jewish organizations,\nthey help. They give you this, they give you that. Bullshit, I\u2019m sorry to say it \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but please to understand, this is what is in my heart. It\u2019s not true at all. Nobody\nhelped me with the green card. How I got the green card? I, you know win \u2014 I- I-\nI mean won, in a lottery.",
        "A: Me. I\u2019m not lucky person, I won. For me, for my husband and for my son, we\ngot green card. But anyhow, America \u2014 America is my furt(ph) kolokowst(ph).\nVery difficult country. Not for young people. For my son, he loves America. He\u2019s\nactually American. He speaks like American you know, no accent, nothing. He just\nabsorbed everything easily, immediately. For me, I was 45, between 45 - 46\nactually. Start from scratch, learn English, go so much down from where I was, was\nalmost impossible. My so \u2014 my \u2014 my husband followed me \u2014 my second husband,\nbecause the first one, I, you know, divorce after 11 years. It was \u2014 was always very\ndifficult for me to \u2014 to divorce husband, because you know, I \u2014 I was doing\neverything possible to keep the family. But, he was nobody. I mean, nobody. He is\nstill my son\u2019s father. He is zero. One day, finally, you know, when the laugh was\nover, he told me, you dirty Jew. So I divorced him. It was very difficult, he didn\u2019t\nwant to give me divorce. He fight it. Maybe he loved me, but in the way, you know,\nI could not accept. My son was four years old. And remembering the background,\nyou know, where I\u2019m coming from, it was so dif \u2014 so \u2014 so important for me to be f\u2014\nfor my son, you know, no matter what. So I, you know, I met another man. Of\ncourse Polish too, because as I say, no \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 no Jewish in Poland at all, and in America, I don\u2019t have Jews around me.",
        "A: You know, I live in a neighborhood, there are no Jews. No synagogues, nothing,\nand not that I care, you know, but that\u2019s how it is. So, my second husband, he \u2014 he\nis a good man, but America was too much for him. He followed me, he followed\nme up here, and he couldn\u2019t stand America. First of all, he was not able to learn\nEnglish, so for him, very good engineer, somebody really important, V.LP. in\nPoland, and suddenly here, nobody. And it\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t try. I know he was\ntrying hard to learn English, he just was not able. So, one day, it was 10 years ago,\nhe told me, Helena, I can\u2019t stay here. I want to go back. And he said, you should go\nback with me, because Robert, my son, you know, he\u2019s gonna hav \u2014 have own\nfamily, and you know, besides, you work too hard in America. And in Poland you\ngonna be a lady. You may do nothing, or a little. What I was doing here, you know,\nafter cleaning, I was taking care of old people. Then I, when I got green card, my\nfirst job, nursing home, I was cleaning after dead people. That was my job. For\nalmost two years. And one day, my supervisor \u2014 I wa \u2014 I was part of housekeeping\ndepartment, my supervisor realized that, you know, I am worth much more, and I\u2019m\nable to be in charge of people, and this and that. And he might get some cash, you\nknow, for me, if he finds me a job. Which I had no idea, at the moment. He asked\nme if I want to be a supervisor. And I said, I\u2019m too old. I was like 48, you know. He\nsays no, that\u2019s the perfect time, you know. So, I was a supervisor, it was next step.\nThen, account manager, then manager. So working hard and hard and hard, I got\nsomewhere. With pretty mo \u2014 pretty good money. But I lost my marriage, and my\nhusband, I divorce him, because I told him, you know, you have to be here or there,\nyou cannot be little bit here, little bit there, you know. And he said, I can\u2019t.\nAmerica is not for me. And I said, look, I cannot, you know, leave my son alone.\nHe\u2019s got nobody. And \u2014 and that\u2019s how it ended up. My son, when he was 20, that\nplace he worked, you know, at, a couple American guys, they offered him, they \u2014\nyou know, they realized that he \u2014 he is very talented [indecipherable] I mean, I \u2014\nit\u2019s \u2014 you know, I have no answer for this, because the guy, whatever he touches,\nit\u2019s superb. If he cooks, it\u2019s, you know, superb cooking, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow. I\u2014I-\u2014TI didn\u2019t teach him, you know. Whatever he does, he just \u2014 he does\nexcellent job. And he\u2019s very handy in terms of electronic, and cell phones. So they,\ntogether they started cellular phone dealership, 20 years ago. He was 20 years then.\nIn the meantime, one guy got killed in motorcycle accident. The other one,\nsomething happened, so in the meantime he just \u2014 he is alone, he is the only one.\nAnd this company is still alive. This company goes through, you know, hard time,\nlike \u2014 like whole \u2014 whole economy, you know, but we\u2019re still in business.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Being adopted in Poland meant that, you know, automatically, I had\ntheir name. So, actually, th-there was no-nothing which would show that I was\nadopted, okay? I had a new birth certificate with their names as mom and dad. So\nthat\u2019s how it is. They both \u2014 they were Jews, but they never talked about this, and it\nwas like a \u2014 something to be ashamed of, you know. They never admitted to\nanything from this area, you know. Just \u2014 they were very much involved in what\nhappened in Poland they \u2014 those years, and I am not proud of it, because my step-\nmom, she was teaching \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to say in English, but you know,\nprobably Marx, Lenin \u2014",

Everything\nwas stupid, you know, and worth nothing, only \u2014 only this. He died first, due to\ncancer, throat cancer. I loved him with all my heart. I was taking care of him until,\nyou know, he \u2014 he passed away. She hated me, she was kicking me out, she didn\u2019t\nwant me to take care of him.

Maybe this is one of the reasons that I don\u2019t like these\nholidays.

His wife\nis American Italian, and she\u2019s not religion too, but \u2014 but still, you know, it\u2019s far.

He \u2014 he recognize this, and he is very thankful. And I can tell you one\nthing, okay, which might make you think. When I had that interview with Shoah,\nyou know, they told me to turn off the phones. It was in my house, and my son, he\ncalls me hundred times a day, Mom, what are you doing?

I didn\u2019t want him to be involved in this \u2014 in this interview, you\nknow. I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not that kind of mother, that I don\u2019t think that \u2014 that kids have\nto take your \u2014 all the burden, you know. I mean, everybody has own life, own\nresponsibilities. I didn\u2019t want him to be part of it. He\u2019s got enough. But he walked\nin, so she said, oh, as you\u2019re here, maybe you want to say something, because we\nare very happy when we can talk to second generation, and maybe you \u2014 you have\nsomething to add to what your mom said. And I can see my son, you know, walking\nup the stairs, I had a townhouse, you know, on \u2014 on the upper floor. And he was\nwalking up the stairs, he \u2014 he said \u2014 he \u2014 you know, jeans, and not dressed up,\nnothing, completely, you know, out of the blue. And he said, okay. And he \u2014 in the\nend of everything, he just said few words. And he said \u2014 you don\u2019t even know Ida,\nbecause I didn\u2019t tell you. He said, this is my mom. And he said, this is \u2014 that I am\nhere, as you can see me, it\u2019s only in hundred percent because of her. He says, this is\nthe best thing ever happened in my life, that\u2019s my mom. That\u2019s what \u2014 how it was, I\nmean. So he knows, and you know, he \u2014 he understands. He \u2014 it\u2019s not that he wants\nhimself to be [indecipherable] you know, my \u2014 my Jewish, you know \u2014",

But he \u2014 he looks at, you know, Jews, through me. Okay,\nunfortunately the family, you know, didn\u2019t do a good job. And he is far away from\neverything, which he\u2019s supposed to, you know. He not supposed to \u2014 oh, let\u2019s say\nthis way. So, my son, my son, as I mentioned to you, he\u2019s gonna be 40 in few days.\nAnd I am very proud of him, I really am. Without a college degree, he managed,\nyou know, to \u2014 you know, get to the point that not many people in America are able\nto get. And I was able to not only survive, but take care of myself. The \u2014 the bad\npart is that I am alone.
