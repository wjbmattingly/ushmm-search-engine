And when my father was, like I\nsay, 19 years old he went to Germany with his parents. He learned to be a tailor while in Berlin\nand he did get married very late in his life. He was married, I think at \u2014 about the age of 42 or 43\nyears to my mother, who also \u2014 1t was my mother\u2019s second marriage. And my mother was born\nin Oberschlesien, that\u2019s near Breslau, which is now Poland.

        "A: Well, from \u2014 a \u2014a stepbrother, so to speak, from my mother\u2019s first marriage, she had son,\nwhich was Klaus Gerstel. And in a way he c-committed suicide. He was arrested, or on the way\nto be arrested in 1942. And when the SS came to arrest him, at that time we \u2014 he was living in\nthe apartment, it was kind of ghetto apartment where they forced all the Jews to be in. And it had\na circular type of a stairway. I think it had about six stories in that building. And when he learned\nthat the SS were there to arrest him, he ran up to the top of the stairway, the circular stairway and\ndove headfirst, which of course killed him, but he says I am not going to go to a concentration\ncamp.",
        "Q: How old was he at the time?",
        "A: He wa \u2014 I think he was 19 or 20 years old.",
        "Q: Did you have a \u2014 a large extended family? You\u2019ve talked about your mother\u2019s family, was\nyour father\u2019s family still in the United States or were there any in Germany?",

And\nafter the war, both of \u2014 which turned out to be our cousins, my brother and my cousin, they did\ngo to the \u2014 came to the U.S. and lived \u2014 and settled down in Joplin, Missouri.",

One\ncousin was crippled, but he still was very well off, he was a piano player and I think he also\nplayed some kind of a piano. He di \u2014 per-performed a lot of c-c-concert pia \u2014 he was a concert\npianist, what I\u2019m trying to say.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: While the other one, I don\u2019t know what he did, but he did own an automobile and he made \u2014\ndrove to Berlin many times to visit us, or actually took us to Breslau and we \u2014 my father and his\nnephews were very close.",
        "Q: Now let\u2019s talk about your immediate family. Di \u2014 again, before the war.",
        "A: Before the war.",
        "Q: Were your parents very politically active?",
        "A: Not to my knowledge, I do not know.",
        "Q: Do you know if they were Zionists?",
        "A: No, they were not. Neither one of my parents were very religious. We were a very Reform\ntype of a Jewish family.",
        "Q: Did you have as \u2014 any kind of religious training as a very young child?",
        "A: Yes, we did go to temple every Friday as long as the temple was [indecipherable]. We even\nlearned some Hebrew and we knew how to say the prayers in Hebrew.",
        "Q: And how did you learn these prayers?",
        "A: We did learn in the Jewish school, the two years \u2014 little over two years that I went through\nschool, my brother three years, we did learn Hebrew \u2014 ah, the prayers.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Neither my brother or I do know Hebrew now, but I still, amazingly enough I can still say\nsome of the prayers.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What was the name of the temple that you went to?",
        "A: I do not know. I do not know.",
        "Q: All right. What kind of neighborhood did you live in? Was \u2014 was it a mixed neighborhood of\nJews and non-Jews?",
        "A: No, I would say 90 percent were Jewish. My father was a tailor, he had a tailor shop in Berlin,\nvery close to the Kurfuirstendamm, which 1s the main shopping center, one block off from there,\nand it was primarily Jewish businesses or tailors in other stores.",
        "Q: And did you have any non-Jewish friends? You said you went to a Jewish school. Again,\nwe're talking pre-war.",
        "A: Yes, my parents had a number of non-Jewish friends. One of them \u2014 here\u2019s the amazing thing,\none of them was a midwife to my birth, and she was a high ranking member of the Nazi party.\nShe had pictures of Hitler and her throughout her entire apartment.",
        "Q: And how did your father know her?",
        "A: That, I wish I had an answer, I do not know. I don\u2019t know if my father hired her as a midwife,\nor if my mother did. But she was the midwife to my birth, may \u2014 possibly \u2014 my father was a man\nand ladies\u2019 tailor, he\u2019d sew dresses as well as man suits and maybe he did some clothing for her.\nI do not know.",
        "Q: And her name?",
        "A: Her name was Gertrude Noelting, it\u2019s g-e-r-t-u-d-e, which is a pretty common German fir \u2014\nlady\u2019s first name. And \u2014",
        "Q: T \u2014 t-r-u-d-e?",
        "A: Yes, Gertrude, and her last name was Noelting, which is \u2014 using the American spelling, it\u2019s n-\no-e-|-t-i-n-g.",
        "Q: So, how would you describe yourself as a young child? Were you very independent, or were\nyou more dependent on your parents type of child?",
        "A: Well, I would say both. At first we, of course, were very dependent on our parents. But when\nour father was arrested in 1943, we realized \u2014 and I say we, my brother and I \u2014 realized what was\nhappening. Well, we already realized what was happening back in 19 \u2014 November 9, 1938,\nKristallnacht. Of course, I was not quite six years old. I was born in \u201933, January. And then I\nrealized what was happening. And of course the Germans took my father\u2019s store away. They\ndestroyed his inventory. They destroyed his sewing machines. Excuse me. [coughs] They\ndestroyed everything and then forced us to live, again, in a apartment unit there. There were \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know how many different levels in that building there was, but we had one room below the\nkitchen. And that\u2019s what we had and that\u2019s what every other Jewish family had that had two kids.\nThey each h-had one room with a kitchen, a small kitchen. It was one bathroom 1n each floor for\nevery 10 in \u2014 in that floor.",
        "Q: So much had happened after you were born that you obviously weren\u2019t aware of, being an\ninfant and a \u2014 and a toddler and a small child. Before Kristallnacht, do you have any memories,\nor is that your first \u2014 do you have any memories of people in uniform, of flags, of anything, or is\nKristallnacht your first memory?",
        "A: No, no, I do have memory of that. Si -- again, since we lived in the Jewish area, the Hitler\nyouth already, kids 10 years old, there were many a times when we \u2014 the kids spit \u2014 spit at us.\nWe could not defend ou-ourselves, even if we were at such an age where we could have \u2014 maybe\nwe\u2019re stronger than those kids that spit at us or kicked us and so forth, but we were not permitted\nto hit anybody that had a Hitler youth uniform.",
        "Q: How did you know that, as a very young child?",
        "A: We were told.",
        "Q: By?",
        "A: By the Jewish community, in school and so forth, that the best thing is walk away, otherwise\nit'll be tougher on us.",
        "Q: So this is something that was discussed openly in school \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: \u2014 by your teachers?",
        "A: That 1s correct.",
        "Q: What about your family? Did you talk this over with your parents?",
        "A: I\u2014I\u2014I wished I had an answer, I do not remember that. I do not.",
        "Q: Now, what about with your brother? Were you very close to your brother as a young child?",
        "A: We were [indecipherable] \u2014 oh, my brother and I were very close together and even today we\nstill are very close together even though I live in Seattle, he lives in Los Angeles, but we are very\nclose.",
        "Q: So as two young boys, and I know very young, and you see these frightening situate \u2014 or part\nof these frightening situations, did you talk this over with your brother?",
        "A: Okay, yes we did. Nowadays, even though my brother is a year older, he hardly remembers\nwhat transpired. He just wiped this whole thing out of his memory. If I can say here, last week,\nof course, was Holocaust Remembrance week. I was asked by the you \u2014 army in Fort Lewis,\nWashington, to talk about the Holocaust. The army there specifically asked Holocaust survivors,\npreferably concentration camp ho \u2014 su-survivors that have also been in the U.S. military,\npreferably in military service. I spent time in the U.S. Army, received a warrant officer\ncommission during my service in Korea and I t-talked about the Holocaust. I did want my\nbrother to talk about the Holocaust, but \u2014 and the reason I wanted him to talk, he spent time in\nVietnam, he spent 22 years in the arm \u2014 U.S. Army, retired a major, a much higher ranking\nofficer than me. But he says he just can\u2019t talk about it, he doesn\u2019t remember it and does not want\nto talk about it. And he\u2019s [indecipherable] he can\u2019t remember what has happened, yet he\u2019s a year\nolder. He cannot speak German any more. While he was in the military he was stationed in\nGermany, in Heidelberg for three years, but never had anything to do with the Germans.",
        "Q: When you were little, in the 30\u2019s, were \u2014 did you and your brother talk about what was\nhappening?",
        "A: No, not that I can recall. We started talking about it, together with our parents too, after\nKristallnacht. And we were told, just try and stay away from Hitler youth. Don\u2019t get involved,\ndon\u2019t get into arguments. And of course, in 1941, I think 1t was, when we had to wear the Jewish\nStar of David. And there were \u2014 it\u2019s not just wearing the star, there were limitations made, what\n\u2014 we couldn\u2019t go to a store except between five and six o\u2019clock in the afternoon. And there were\nso many restrictions, we couldn't use public transportation. And my brother and I talked about it,\nbut we knew there was nothing we could do and just hoping that it will get better.",
        "Q: What does a man like Hitler mean to a five year old German Jewish child?",
        "A: I wish I had an answer for that. I \u2014 I \u2014 we knew that he was not good for us, but we always\nthought it would become better. And again, we were unique inasmuch our father was an\nAmerican citizen. And our father never thought that he would be arrested and sent to a\nconcentration camp. He figured our family would eventually be given exceptions. He just didn\u2019t\nthink it would happen. And \u2014 go ahead.",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home, since your father was American?",
        "A: Only German. We did not know any English. In fact, when my brother and I came to the \u2014 the\nU.S. after the war, it was only German.",
        "Q: Do you know why your father didn\u2019t raise you from birth to be bilingual because he\u2019s \u2014 he\nhad lived in America?",
        "A: I think he was afraid to teach us English. Just \u2014 actually, my father, even though he was an\nAmerican citizen, he served in the German army during World War I. And again, that was\nanother reason that he f-felt, like many Jews that was in the German army during World War \u2014\nWorld War I, figured that they would not ever be arrested. And even when my father lost his\nbusiness, his tailor shop and was moved \u2014 a-and we had to go and live in this apartment, he had\nto go into slave labor, but he figured that\u2019s the worst that the Germans will do to him, they forced\nhim into forced labor. And \u2014 but still he never thought that he\u2019d ever be arrested.",
        "Q: Describe the school you went to in the beginning.",
        "A: I wished I could, but I do know we had hundred to 150 kids in class. And that\u2019s about all I can\nremember. I do not know the name of the schools, which I did learn last year when I found the ca\n\u2014 archives in the east of Berlin, in Potsdam. But other than that I just do not remember.",
        "Q: But it was a Jewish school with Jewish children and Jewish teachers?",
        "A: That is correct, but there were way too many kids in a class, and \u2014",
        "Q: How old were you when you began school?",
        "A: Well, I began school when I was six years old, in 1939. There was \u2014 was some kind of a\nschool almost e-equivalent to kindergarten here, yeah, when I was five years old.",
        "Q: So now let\u2019s talk about Kristallnacht, because that was a pivotal point. As a five and a half\nyear old, what \u2014 what do you remember about that time?",
        "A: I remember it was 1n the middle of the night, which I really think was about four in the\nmorning, when all of a sudden \u2014 maybe I should go back a little bit before the actual\nKristallnacht. It was probably two or three days prior to Kristallnacht. The shop windows were\njust painted with pic \u2014 Jude, which means Jew, in front. And \u2014 well, you couldn\u2019t look out, they\nwere just plain painted with cuss words, so to speak, being a Jew and so forth.",
        "Q: And you were old enough to know what that implied?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I was old enough. And \u2014",
        "Q: How did you \u2014 how does a young child interpret that?",
        "A: Again, I wished I had an answer and could gi \u2014 tell you how my feeling was, but I thought it\nwas terrible that the shop windows of my father were all painted. Very bad. And then my father\nwas forced to clean and make those windows completely clean and it took him all day to have \u2014 I\nthink he had two razor blades to scrape all the paint off. And \u2014 but he wer \u2014 every other shop\nowner, Jewish shop owner in the street was forced to do the same thing.",
        "Q: Did you see your father do this?",
        "A: Yes, I saw, in fact, I tried to help. We \u2014 our \u2014 we tried to help him, but very little we could do,\nespecially he only had two razor blades, and he was forced to do it. And it was two days later,\nafter the windows were all taken \u2014 cleaned, that\u2019s when then they shattered all the windows. And\nwe lived in the back of the store, and of course we saw what was happening. We were scared,\nand I knew in my \u2014 I still remember my mother\u2019s \u2014 my \u2014 my mother saying, what are we going\nto do? They\u2019ve took our store away, they\u2019ve ruined everything. And I remember my father\ntelling my mother, well don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s what we have insurance for. We have insurance for\nvandalism, for theft, and we\u2019ll just have the insurance companies replace everything. Of course,\nthat never happened. And I do remember this like it was yesterday. Yeah, 1t was \u2014 I was five\nyears and 10 month old. And you kind of grew up quickly and became mature prematurely.",
        "Q: Wh \u2014 to see Germans in uniform, what is that vision like for a child?",
        "A: Very bad. I\u2014I feared, especially the brown uniforms, which was in the SR, or the SA, or the\nblack uniforms with a skull, which were the SS. We feared that. It was something that chilled\nyour bodies, at least that\u2019s what it did to me. I\u2014 I knew what it was. When I \u2014 it goes right back\nwatching the Hitler youth uniform. When I see a kid in a Hitler youth uniform, I walked and tried\nnot to be seen by them, especially when \u2014 going back to 1941 when we had to wear the yellow\nstar. We just shied away from them.",
        "Q: Did you have nightmares of \u2014",
        "A: Not as a child, but afterwards, and even occasionally when I \u2014 I\u2019d\u2014a year ago when I was in\nBerlin, I visited the old SS headquarters, which was Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse 9. And I \u2014 that\nevening I had nightmares. In fact, I was asked to give a taped interview over there. They had my\nrecord that I was tortured there. And yes, I had some pretty bad headquarters \u2014 I mean,\nnightmares.",
        "Q: So, le-let\u2019s get back to Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Right, Kristallnacht \u2014",
        "Q: So you woke up the next morning, and \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Well, I woke up when they shattered the window, just the noise from the window\nshattering and the noises. And again, you \u2014 down Jews, and so forth. A-And you \u2014 you don\u2019t\ndeserve to be living here. And I remember that li \u2014 again, like I said, like 1t was yesterday. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did you share a room with your brother?",
        "A: Yes, in fact we only had \u2014 actually we had two rooms. One room my brother and I lived \u2014 and\nthese were small room, almost \u2014 what you almost have a \u2014 like a walk-in closet over here. And\nthen my mother and I had another room. And we had a small kitchen and a small \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, but this was in the first apartment that you grew up in.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Okay, so then what happened?",
        "A: And then we had to move from that apartment into a smaller apartment unit. And this 1s\nwhere I said we had one room per family, plus a kitchen.",
        "Q: And your father?",
        "A: He was there, too. Of course, I wa \u2014 remember, this was probably in fi \u2014 42.",
        "Q: No, no, no, no, we\u2019re still at \u2014 at Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Oh, still at Kristallnacht.",
        "Q: Yeah, let\u2019s go through this \u2014",
        "A: Oh, there we just [indecipherable]",
        "Q: \u2014 chronologically.",
        "A: Okay, I\u2019m sorry. The Kristallnacht we were actually in the store. We had two rooms in the\nback of the store. In-Incidentally, that same store that I remember from Kristallnacht is still at the\nsame location, it was not bombed out.",
        "Q: So th-the \u2014 the store windows were broken, your father said insurance would cover it, and\nthen what happened?",
        "A: Right. Then what happened, of course, insurance didn\u2019t cover it, and the Germans gave my\nfather, I think two or three days to move out and they told her that we have to move to this\napartment unit, which was Commandant Strasse 63, I remember that address. And incidentally,\nwhen I again visited Berlin, I tried to look up that old apartment unit. Unfortunately it \u2014 it was\nbombed, but the entire block is flat because this \u2014 the old Berlin wall separating east and west\nBerlin went right through it. So that is no longer in existence. It\u2019s just an empty lot right now.",
        "Q: So it was late November, or early December \u201938 that you moved?",
        "A: It was November, probably. Well, Kristallnacht was November nine and I would say about\nthe 10\" or the 11% \u2014 11\" or 12 when we had to move.",
        "Q: Oh, you had to move immediately.",
        "A: We had to move immediately, I think the \u2014 two or three days. And \u2014",
        "Q: Were you able to take everything with you?",
        "A: No, they \u2014 they took most of our \u2014 everything \u2014 most of what we had they took away. They\njust scatter it out in the streets. We had very, very little to take along. Some clothing. I think my\nfather had some \u2014 he must have suspected something, but some of the material that he made\nclothing out of, he had someplace else. And he did some sewing for us once we moved in the\napartment, and he did this late at night, because there \u2014 after he was forced to work on the\nrailroad, and \u2014 which was slave labor. But at night he would sew some clothing for us so that we\nhad something to wear, because I think everything we owned really, was taken away.",
        "Q: Did you have any special toys or anything that you were able to take with you, you and your\nbrother?",
        "A: No, they were \u2014 we had no toys, or \u2014 we \u2014 we just didn't grow up with toys. We \u2014 I think my\nbrother and I, I don\u2019t know what we did for play. I don\u2019t think we played. We just \u2014 we just\ndidn\u2019t. I \u2014",
        "Q: Even before Kristallnacht?",
        "A: Even before Kristallnacht, yeah. We did \u2014 I probably should mention that. We lived pretty \u2014\npretty close to a small park and so forth, which had a river and so forth and I know there was one\ntime when some Hitler youth pushed my brother into the river in Berlin. And my brother, of\ncourse, did not know how to swim at that time and he almost drowned and some German worker\nin a bi\u2014 on a bicycle saw my brother drowning and he jumped in and saved him. And of course,\nhe had the Jewish Star on David on my \u2014 my brother had that on, but that German still saved him\nand made sure that my brother was alright and found out where we lived and took my brother\nactually home, in this apartment. Well, my father then, again had material and sewed him, this\nman, some clothing and so forth. Well, that poor ma \u2014 gentleman was arrested because he saved\na Jew. And I do not know whatever happened to him. He was not permitted to talk to us any\nmore, but I do remember that he was arrested for saving a Jew.",
        "Q: Do you know his name?",
        "A: No, I do not know. I wished \u2014 if I knew his name I would try \u2014 would have tried to look him\nup.",
        "Q: So, you moved out of your apartment at \u2014 a couple days after Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And then what did you do? Did you still go to school?",
        "A: No, I think \u2014 yes, we did. We went to school through 1942, again to a Jewish school, and of\ncourse there were many, many kids in one class. And learning, I would say most of my schooling\nwas self studied at our mother. Yeah, I think probably our mother taught us more how to read\nthan what we learned in school.",
        "Q: Did your mother work with your father in the store?",
        "A: No, not really, she pretty much took care of us, and again, gave us classes, how to write and\nread.",
        "Q: And did anything happen to your extended family on Kristallnacht?",
        "A: Well again, like I say, I had a stepbrother from my mother\u2019s previous er \u2014 marr-marriage. And\nof course he killed himself the day he was supposed to have been arrested. And we\u2019ve had \u2014 but\nmost of our extended family, especially from our mother\u2019s side, lived in Breslau, which is now\nPoland. And we had one aunt in Berlin, but she too was one of the early ones that was arrested\nand was in \u2014 shipped to Theresienstadt and I do not know if she died over there. We lost track.\nAnd I\u2019ve done some research on it and I can\u2019t find any record on her. And of course all of m \u2014\nmost of my father\u2019s relatives either were \u2014 remained in the U.S. or went to South America.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Fred Taucher. This is tape number one, side B and we\u2019ve already talked about\nKristallnacht and your moving into the n \u2014 into an apartment. Let\u2019s now talk about your father,\nwhat he did after his store was destroyed.",
        "A: It was shortly after Kristallnacht when his store was destroyed, his property taken away and\nwe were forced into living into a big apartment unit where many, many Jews were forced to live.\nAnd my father was forced to work on the railroad. Rather than being a tailor he was forced to\nwork doing hard labor. It was s \u2014 definitely slave labor. And he was actually forced to live there\nuntil hi-his arrest in 1943.",
        "Q: So, did he come back at night, or \u2014",
        "A: Yes, he did come back every night, completely exhausted. And I do remember that, as young\nas I was. I mean, he could hardly move, but he did come back and he ate what little food my\nmother had to cook for him.",
        "Q: Where did your mother get the food?",
        "A: Well, that was another problem a-after the Kristallnacht, when she cou \u2014 only had a choice to\ngo to \u2014 to stores by \u2014 owned by Jews, between five and six o\u2019clock in the evening. And \u2014 and\nwhat I think my mother did, she went to the store long before five o\u2019clock so that she would be\none of the first in line to buy what necessary food products she could get. And it was very, very\nsmall.",
        "Q: Prior to that, I understand that the Germans forced the Jewish men to take the name in their\nidentification papers of Israel and the mothers \u2014 or the women to take the name of Sarah. Did\nthat happen to your parents?",
        "A: Yes, it did. Their names became \u2014 the middle name was always Israel or Sarah and actually, I\nthink even as boys we had \u2014 we became Israel, was one of the names. I just vaguely remember\nthat.",
        "Q: Did your \u2014 did your parents say anything about that to you?",
        "A: Not really, not really, but yeah, I think every boy was Israel and every girl was Sarah.",
        "Q: Did you have your own papers, or your parents ha-had you on their papers?",
        "A: I do not recall that, I think our parents had the papers, I don\u2019t think we had our own papers.",
        "Q: Prior to Kristallnacht, there was the anschluss in \u2014 in \u2014 in Austria. Did \u2014 were you aware of\nthat?",
        "A: No, we were not. I did not learn this really, until I was older.",
        "Q: Had your parents, or especially your father, ever thought of leaving at this time, or did they\nmake any efforts to try to leave?",
        "A: Yes. Back in 1934, I understand, they did make an effort to leave and we all got as far as\nHolland. But \u2014 it may have been 1936, we got as far as Rotterdam I think, but I think the\nGermans already were doing a lot of things and even though they haven\u2019t \u2014 hadn\u2019t invaded\nHolland yet, but the \u2014 the \u2014 they forced my father to go back to Berlin. Apparently the \u2014 he didn't\nhave the proper papers to leave Germany. And of course \u2014 and he had to pay \u2014 every penny he\nhad, he had to pay just to get back to Berlin, and he just didn't have the financial resources to get\nus \u2014 to get us back out. But then again he was so convinced, being an American, that they are\ngoing to leave him alone. They\u2019ll give him a rough time, but he felt he\u2019d be left alone. And\nagain, like a lot of people, especially business people were arrested and sent to concentration\ncamp, going back to 1941 and 1942. My father wasn\u2019t arrested until 1943, and I think there are\nrecords here at the Holocaust Museum, the date he was arrested, even the transport number. I do\nnot remember now.",
        "Q: But \u2014 but you were saying, to go backwards, that in 1936 he was able to get you \u2014 the four of\nyou to \u2014 to \u2014 th-the four of you in family to \u2014 to Rotterdam?",
        "A: I believe it was 1936, I cannot be sure of the dates, cause again I was too young, I \u2014 I know\nwe moved someplace, and \u2014 but I do not know. But I know through when I lived with my\ncousins after I came here to the U.S., they said that he took us all once to Holland then had to\nturn back, but then he ran out of money.",
        "Q: Now, you\u2019re attending school, you\u2019re in your new, smaller apartment. Your father is doing\nslave labor, your mother is trying to get food and you\u2019re attending school with your brother? And\ndid you again have any contact with non-Jews then, children your age?",
        "A: None whatsoever. Other kids, they wouldn\u2019t \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t dare associate with Jews, and it\nwas strictly other Jewish kids that we were in contact with.",
        "Q: Did you play games as a child during this time? Were you ab \u2014 were the young children able\nto \u2014 I don\u2019t want to use the word disregard, but you know, b-be normal children and play games\nduring this very difficult time?",
        "A: I do not remember, I do not think we played games. I just cannot remember that we ever\nplayed games. I think the times were so complicated. I think in school the teachers concentrated\nmore in group learning and little bit of Hebrew, you know, we studied like the Hebrew alphabet\nand so forth.",
        "Q: But your lessons were in German?",
        "A: Yes, in German. Again, we did learn the Hebrew alphabet, the aleph, bet, gimmel, dalet and\nso forth, which I still know today.",
        "Q: What did the United States mean to a six, seven year old German child under stress?",
        "A: It definitely meant, this is where we\u2019re going to go. Our father always told us how great the\nU.S. are and someday we\u2019re all going to move to the U.S. after the war is over. The U.S. will win\nthe w \u2014 will prevail and we\u2019re all going to go to New York. And we were pretty much raised\nwith that mentality, that to live \u2014 to go to the United States, it was \u2014 we said America.",
        "Q: What did it mean to you, what did it represent?",
        "A: It represented 1\u2014 I guess you could say freedom and that it is the best country in the world to\ngrow up.",
        "Q: So you continued school in 1940. Were you aware \u2014 granted, you were seven \u2014 you know,\nyoung, of what Hitler was doing and invading other countries in 1940?",
        "A: Yes, we did. We were aware of that.",
        "Q: How did you know it?",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have a radio?",
        "A: Yes, we had a radio and we heard it on the radio and we listened to Hitler and his other\ncronies, and yes, we were fully aware of it.",
        "Q: Do you remember his voice on the radio?",
        "A: Oh yes, I remember his screaming, definitely. Occasionally, which we weren\u2019t supposed to, I\n\u2014 this is just \u2014 as we are talking now, I do remember once in awhile, illegally, we took our S-Star\nof David off and did attend a movie thea \u2014 watched a movie, maybe a comedy or something, that\nwe'd go to a public movie. And of course in these movies they also had all this prop \u2014\npropaganda. And I do remember that now, but I never thought about this until right now.",
        "Q: How did you know you\u2019d have to wear a Star of David?",
        "A: Oh that \u2014 every \u2014 I would say even a five year old kid knew that.",
        "Q: How\u201d",
        "A: I think it was publicized \u2014 told by our parents, and everybody. We just knew we were inferior\ncitizens and we had to wear that [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you feel inferior?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t feel inferior, but we knew to the Germans we were inferior. And I think it \u2014 I\nprobably shouldn\u2019t compare, but I will. I think it\u2019s the same way when the Afro-Americans at\none time had to sit at the back of the bus, they had separate public restrooms. And while I don\u2019t\nthink the average child \u2014 black person realized that they were treated as a inferior citizen, but\nthey were treated that way, and this is, I think how we felt in Berlin during the war, in Germany\nduring the war.",
        "Q: And t-tell me about the yellow star, where you wore it and how it was put on your clothes.",
        "A: The yellow star was on our left chest, really, and it was \u2014 had to be sewn on, it had to be sewn\non neatly. And of course our father being a tailor, he did that. And we \u2014 when we went outside\ninto the public streets, we had to wear it. And if you didn\u2019t wear it you were arrested, whether\nyou were a five year old or a 55 year old.",
        "Q: What did you feel like wearing a yellow star?",
        "A: I felt scared, always scared, because I knew that other kids could come, even if they were\nthree year old, or four year olds, they could spit at us, they cou \u2014 if they had a stick they could hit\nus and we couldn\u2019t hit back. And so yes, I was scared and really afraid to go out. And again\nsometimes I think we were blessed, both my brother and I, we did not really look Jewish. So\nsometimes we did take the chance and did not wear the star and did go out and went to a movie\ntheater and so forth.",
        "Q: Wh-When you say you didn\u2019t look Jewish, can you describe yourself?",
        "A: Well, you know, there are certain people, you can tell they\u2019re Jewish. Oh, you may make a\nmistake, like even some Egyptians look Jewish, but we were not obvious Jewish looking,\notherwise we never would have survived living in Berlin.",
        "Q: Were you fair coloring, and \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, very fair coloring and sometimes people thought my brother is a little darker\ncolored, but he looked more Italian, and in those days Italy and Germany were still allies.",
        "Q: So did you \u2014 w-were you ever did \u2014 spat upon? Did any of the nay \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, we were spat upon many times. And like I said earlier, my brother was pushed in\nthe water, almost \u2014 could have drowned. And we underwent \u2014 probably my brother went through\nSs \u2014 more severe pan \u2014 punishments than I was, for some reason.",
        "Q: Because he was a year older?",
        "A: Yeah, I think so, or it\u2019s just where he was at, we weren\u2019t always together. And he was \u2014 he\nwas mistreated more than I was, I believe, at the beginning of the war.",
        "Q: And what about your other Jewish friends, other little Jewish boys? Did you act out any of\nthis or talk this over with them?",
        "A: Again, here is a mind that is blank, I don\u2019t remember. I do remember being with other Jewish\nkids, sometimes walking to school together. And I don\u2019t think a day went by where we didn\u2019t \u2014\nweren't \u2014 not beat up, bu-but mistreated by the German kids, especially Hitler youth kids and\nHitler youth was 10 years and ol \u2014 over.",
        "Q: Do you get used to this treatment? Does a child get used to this treatment?",
        "A: Well, they expect it. It\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t think you ever get used to something like that and I know I\nnever did, but I expected it and it\u2019s just something I knew was going to happen. I don\u2019t know\nhow else I can explain that.",
        "Q: And again, did you confide in your \u2014 1n your parents?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh definitely. And again, I don\u2019t remember what my parents said. My mother just\nsaid well, those days will pass by, just be patient. These were, I think, what my parents were\nsaying.",
        "Q: So you felt your parents were a comfort to you at this time.",
        "A: Oh, very much so. Very much so. Our parents did comfort us as much as they could.",
        "Q: And so then it\u2019s 1941, you\u2019re still at school, your father is doing slave labor \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 and life goes on. Any recollection during that year, or even with Pearl Harbor in December,\nany \u2014 the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December and Americans going into the war.",
        "A: No, we \u2014 we didn\u2019t know about that. I did know that Franklin Roosevelt was president. I do\nremember this, but I do not remember Japan bombing Pearl Harbor. I never even heard of Pearl\nHarbor, so no, I did not know anything like that.",
        "Q: Now, you said this German woman who was your midwife was an acquaintance of your\nfamily. Was there any relationship with her during this time? Had you known about her at this\npoint in your life, in 1940 \u2014 41?",
        "A: Yes, I did, because there were times, going even back to 1939 where we did visit her at her\napartment. And she had a \u2014 an apartment in the better part of Berlin, Schoneberg and we did visit\nher. Sometimes she had dinner for us. And, in fact there were times th \u2014 when she picked us up\nwhere we lived and we did remove our Star of David when we had to wear it, and we went with\nher to her apartment and there we were very safe because she also \u2014 I think she had a special I.D.\nor something, that she was a high ranking Nazi member, a personal friend of Hitler. So nobody\nbothered her when \u2014 especially when we were with her, too.",
        "Q: Was she married?",
        "A: No, she was never married and at that time she was probably in her middle 50\u2019s. She died\nwhen she was 79 years old, I believe, a-after the war.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sure you\u2019re always asked how do you explain the fact that this Nazi party member was so\nhelpful to you.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Even at that time, and we\u2019ll get to more later, of course.",
        "A: Okay, when I was younger I couldn\u2019t figure that out at all, but now, being older and seeing\nwhat has happened, my guess 1s that she was such a Nazi fanatic, she was a good friend of Hitler\nand deep inside she was convinced that Hitler did not know what was going on. She used to tell\nthat to my father, to my mother, that Hitler doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Once he learns what\u2019s\ngoing on, he\u2019s going to stop that. And I believe because of that mentality, she was convinced if\nshe would be caught helping us, that Hitler would free her and she would say everything to\nHitler. A-And I think that\u2019s the only reason that I can think of why she helped us. And of course\nshe mu-must also feel that she brought me onto this world. And I think that\u2019s the only reason.\nAnd I think I\u2019m the only Jewish person she ever assisted in a birth.",
        "Q: Did she deli \u2014 she did not deliver your brother?",
        "A: No, she did not. My brother I think was delivered at a Jewish hospital in Berlin.",
        "Q: And how is that you were not?",
        "A: Again, I don\u2019t know. I\u2014 I\u2014 I th\u2014 somehow either my father or my mother befriended her,\nand I guess this would have been my mother\u2019s actually third child, me, and I guess she wasn\u2019t as\nuncomfortable being assisted by a midwife.",
        "Q: So, were you born at home?",
        "A: Yes, I was. In fact it was \u2014 my father ha \u2014 actually, he had two stores, one of them was within\ntwo blocks of each other and the first store is where I was born. I think that was in Petsalozzi(ph)\nstrasse. And then later on Leipne(ph) strasse, which was at Kristallnacht.",
        "Q: So you would go t-to her house and \u2014 the four of you a-and visit with her, and fi \u2014 through\n1941 and did life go on in this difficult way til 1942? And then what happened in 1943?",
        "A: Well, in 1943, one day our father didn\u2019t come home. And again, we did have a number of n-\nnon-Jewish friends that were against the Hitler regime. And it was one woman that says, leave\nyour apartment, the Germans are arresting everybody. They took your father away, he\u2019s \u2014 he was\narrested.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s how you heard, through this woman?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, who was a friend of ours and she \u2014 I think she owned a \u2014 a laundry or something\nlike that. But, just outside the Jewish section of Berlin. And \u2014 and she is the one that told us, and\nit\u2019s \u2014 really, it was very close. When we gathered the few things that we owned \u2014 as I say we, my\nmother, my brother and I, the few things we owned, we left the apartment and there was a back\nentrance. We went out the back entrance and we understand that the SS came up the front\nentrance. So we just barely escaped.",
        "Q: How much time elapsed between the time the woman told you and the time you left?",
        "A: Again, I\u2019m guessing here, I would say less than an hour. It was very, very close.",
        "Q: So your father was taken away when he was on the labor battalion?",
        "A: That is correct, he was, right from work taken away. And again, from what I see, the record\nshowed he was shipped to Auschwitz and probably \u2014 again, talking to Auschwitz survivors, they\nsay normally what happened is when they arrived in Auschwitz, they had two sides. One side\nthey were tattooed and they were in the work parade, the other side di \u2014 were not even \u2014 didn\u2019t\neven get a number, they were put in the gas chamber and my father was one of those.",
        "Q: Your father was what, late 40\u2019s, or 50 by then?",
        "A: I would say he was \u2014 I think my father was in the early 50\u2019s at the time. Well, my father, I \u2014 I\ncan probably figure it out. I am not sure. He was born either 1981 or 1991.",
        "Q: Now, you mean 1891.",
        "A: Yeah, I mean 18 \u2014 1891, yes, or nin \u2014 1891, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: So he \u2014 so he was 53.",
        "A: Right. And again, he was murdered in Auschwitz, roughly two days after he arrived there\nfrom what other people tell me that have been there.",
        "Q: So your mother got you two boys together.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And where did she and you go?",
        "A: Okay, again we\u2019re going right back to this Nazi midwife. She, because of her friendship with\nHitler, had a summer cabin in the outskirts of Berlin. And only high ranking SS officers could\nhave cabins there. And this is where she put us. She told all the other officers, military officers,\nmostly SS, that our father was a \u2014 a\u2014TI guess a colonel or something in the army \u2014 ar \u2014 German\narmy and he was out in the fronts in \u2014 in the front line in ka \u2014 Russia. And we lived there, right\namongst the SS, or the wives of the SS. But then of course wintertime came along \u2014",
        "Q: Well \u2014 well now wa \u2014 wait a minute, what about papers? Did you mother \u2014 wh-wh-when this\nhappened in the beginning, what kind of papers did your mother have? She didn't have these\npapers.",
        "A: Fraulein Noelting, the midwife, she provided my mother with papers, where we went under\ndifferent names and us kids went under different names. And again, she was right up with her\nparty and we ha \u2014 there was bombing and a lot of civilians were killed during bomb air raids\nback in the 40\u2019s. And so this midwife, she found out what family with \u2014 what mother with two\nchildren were killed at a certain \u2014 our age, were killed at certain a-a-apartments, or houses. And\nshe got us those types of identification. And that\u2019s how we lived. Of course, then after six\nmonths or so, people were wondering \u2014 sometimes my \u2014 maybe I should go \u2014 my brother and I\nwould act like we\u2019d go to school. We\u2019d wear the bags to go as if we were going to school, but we\nnever did go to school. We didn\u2019t dare go to school because of every child had to go into\nphysical training and then you take a bath. Well, us being boys, being circumcised would give us\naway. So we never went to school. But then people got kind of suspicious, they \u2014 nobody ever\nsaw us in school, other kids. So this midwife says, you have to leave from there. And then again\nwe took on different I.D. and we moved from area to area, place to place. Some of the places I do\nnot know, but I \u2014",
        "Q: So the first location you stayed for six months. What was your new identification, who were\nyou?",
        "A: I was \u2014 it so happened I was Horst Grossman. My mother was a Grossman, I don\u2019t know what\nher first name was, and my brother was a Grossman.",
        "Q: These were German, not Jewish Grossmans.",
        "A: These were German named people that were killed during an air raid.",
        "Q: She obviously felt very positive towards Jews then, she had no negative feelings towards\nJews, or \u2014 or were \u2014 or did she and you were just special cases?",
        "A: I believe we were special cases because she used to complain about Jews, they all have so\nmuch money and they are ruining the economy of Germany. I used to hear her say things like\nthat, even to my mother. And yet she said, but our family was different. She was very strange.\nWell, when \u2014 after the war, when only my brother and I survived, she was real upset when we\ntold her we\u2019re going to try and go to America. And she was very upset because she says, you are\nGermans, you can\u2019t leave. And when my brother and I did leave Germany, and we wrote to her\nonce we got to the U.S., she would never answer us, she was so upset. She said we don\u2019t show\nany thank you.",
        "Q: What would you two boys do during the time the Jew \u2014 the German children were in school?\nWhat would you do, you\u2019d take your schoolbags and what would you do?",
        "A: What we did, we \u2014 this was out in forest type of an area and we would just walk inside the\nforest. In fact, we would pick mushrooms, this is what we ate all the time. My brother and I and\nour mother too, we got to know every edible mushroom. And instead of going to school, we\nwould pick mushrooms, so that\u2019s what we had to eat most of the time.",
        "Q: What did your mother do?",
        "A: Oh, I think she \u2014 she stayed at the cabin and she washed clothes. I think she did wash clothing\nfo \u2014 wash and did other things for some other people to get some income.",
        "Q: On \u2014 in your free time, or when the German children were not in school, did you play with\nthem, did you talk with them?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I think we did, but I can\u2019t be sure. There are so many blanks that I can\u2019t\nreally tell you for sure if we did or not. I think we did. I do know \u2014 one thing I do remember,\nduring the \u2014 there was a vacation period about four weeks or so and there was one kid \u2014a\nGerman kid, not Jewish, who drove \u2014 he was 15 years old and he drove a milk delivery vehicle,\nit was a motorized vehicle. And I \u2014 I helped him deliver the milk. And he was pretty much a real\nNazi believer, Hitler youth, but somehow he \u2014 he befriended me, and we became friends. Of\ncourse, I didn\u2019t tell him who I was. And I know there was a time where I helped him deliver the\nfresh milk.",
        "Q: What\u2019s it like \u2014 what was it like to see a swastika?",
        "A: Fear. Just plain fear. Of course you saw it, no matter where you went you saw it. And the\nswastika was actually easier to get used to. The thing that bothered me was the \u2014 the skull that\nthe SS had on, or even some soldiers that were affiliated with the SS all wore that \u2014 that skull.\nThat was, to me, worse than the swastika.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Well, because I knew that were the ones that would kill the Jews \u2014 they would kill us, and we\nknew that.",
        "Q: Were you ever afraid when you were with these young German boys that you would let your\nguard down and say something that was inappropriate?",
        "A: No, again we were mature enough. We never were \u2014 feared that because we knew we would\nnot let our guard down. And that includes my brother too. We knew what to say and what not to\nsay.",
        "Q: Even \u2014 even at such a young age?",
        "A: Yes, yes we did. And we also knew that we were not to expose ourselves in a restroom or so\nforth, because we knew if we did we would be dead.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Fred Taucher. This is tape number two, side A. Just exactly wa-was this cabin \u2014\nwhere was this cabin located?",
        "A: Okay, it was east of Spandau and the place was called Berger Uplager(ph). And again, to get\nthere you had to actually walk, probably worth a 20 or 30 minute walk from the train station, and\nright in the midst of a forest. And that was the name of the place, Berger Uplager(ph).",
        "Q: What was the atmosphere like there among the \u2014 the SS families, the women and the children,\nwhat is \u2014 was it a joyous atmosphere, a relaxed atmosphere?",
        "A: Very joyous and a relaxed atmosphere. Again, these were all, like I said earlier, SS. They had\nthe food, they had everything. And you didn\u2019t think there was a war going on, to them.",
        "Q: Did the SS people come to visit?",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t, because again they knew to \u2014 as far as they knew, our father was in the\nRussian front and \u2014 and my mother always showed like she was so sad, she didn't know where\nFather was exactly, that they pretty much left her alone, as far as I can remember. And we didn't\nmix too much with the \u2014 and most of them didn\u2019t even have kids there, and \u2014 because again they\nwere probably, most of the people there were in their late 30\u2019s, early 40\u2019s and they had kids who\nare \u2014 probably were in se \u2014 in Seattle, I almost said. They were probably in Berlin taking training\nin the Hitler youth, because they were all Hitler youth age.",
        "Q: So you really didn\u2019t talk to the adults?",
        "A: Very little. I cannot really remember it. I\u2019m sure we did, but again there\u2019s so many blanks.\nI\u2019m sure we did but I can\u2019t \u2014 I just cannot remember.",
        "Q: And you did not know at that time what happened to your father.",
        "A: No, we knew he was in Auschwitz because he wrote, right after he was arrested he wrote a\npostcard and said that he is in Auschwitz, things are going fine and will see you all when I get\nback. And that\u2019s the \u2014 and this postcard was written to this midwife and she was a little\nconcerned that they would watch her because she got a letter from a Jew. But again, with her\naffiliation with the SS and with Hitler, they never did anything.",
        "Q: What did she do \u2014 what did she do, this woman, Frau Noe-Noelting, as a job? As work, as an\noccupation. I know she was a midwife, is that what she continued to do?",
        "A: Yes, she continued being a midwife and she brought a lot of kids into this world.",
        "Q: But as a member of a Nazi party \u2014 of the \u2014 of the Nazi party, did she have any specific duties?\nOr she was just a good Nazi?",
        "A: She was just a good friend of Hitler and some of the other people, but she did not like\nHimmler, Goering or Goebbels. She said they\u2019re \u2014 those are the people that are at fault what is\nbeing done to the Jews, and as soon as Hitler knows about it, it\u20191l stop. In the meantime, she did\nher job as a midwife. I do remember that.",
        "Q: Did she ever see Hitler during the time that you were with her?",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe she did. She tried to, but he was so busy that he just didn\u2019t have time to see\nher. But I do know she has made attempts to talk with Hitler.",
        "Q: How did she get this connection, was it through her family?",
        "A: I do not know. I do not know how she and Hitler became friends, but like I said earlier, there\nwere pictures of her and Hitler together, even Hitler had her \u2014 his arm around her in pictures of\nthat. How they became friends, I have no idea.",
        "Q: So then you left this first location because she told you it wasn\u2019t safe to stay and then where\ndid you go?",
        "A: Again, sa \u2014 I \u2014 we lived in different places throughout Berlin, where I do not know. But then\neven that got a little bad \u2014",
        "Q: You went back to the city then?",
        "A: To the city. We went back to the city of Berlin. But then \u2014 things got bad, but again this\nmidwife found another family that was wiped out, by the name of Schmitz. And it so happened\nthis woman had children, two boys, almost our age and they wi \u2014 they looked a li \u2014 somewhat\nlike us. So we actually took their I.D., pictures of them, and we moved to a reso-sort area in Binz\nauf Rugen. It\u2019s a eastern part of Germany and my mother had a job there as a \u2014 as a maid at one\nof the \u2014 at a big hotel again, where soldiers took their own rest and recuperation. And she was \u2014\nmy mother became a maid over there, and had an income. But again, after about four months we\nhad to move, because again, school. We didn't dare go to school. In fact there was a time where\nall the German kids had to work out on a farm and pick vegetables and things, so there was no\nschool. And so my brother and I were out there with the other German kids, boys and girls,\npulling vegetables and things like that. But then it got \u2014 school started and we had to move\nbecause we didn\u2019t dare go to school again. And so we went back to Berlin, again this midwife,\nshe mailed \u2014 via mail she sent us the proper documents that we needed in case there\u2019s an I.D.\ncheck. But at that time we almost has the proper I.D. for Hitler youth. But we were lucky that\nthere was no I.D. check on our way to Berlin, back from Binz auf Raden(ph) on the train,\nbecause we would have been caught of the \u2014 it was very, very, very scary when we went in\npublic transportation. But we ended up back in Berlin. I think we kept that identification until the\nend of the war, the \u2014 by the name of Schmitz. I don\u2019t remember what first name we had, but\nagain we moved from area to area and then, I don\u2019t know where now, in 1945, let\u2019s say \u2014",
        "Q: Well, le-let\u2019s wait a little bit. Did you have any kind of a shorthand communications wi \u2014\ncommunication system with your brother, so if you were out together and there was a problem,\nyou could kind of signal him? Do you know what I\u2019m saying? So you wouldn\u2019t have to talk, but\nyou could \u2014 either with your eyes, or ar \u2014 in \u2014 anyway \u2014 or hands, or with your mother? Any \u2014 do\nyou know what I\u2019m saying? Any kind of back-up protection if things got really bad and you\nreally couldn\u2019t say it openly.",
        "A: Yes, we had some notes. For instance, if we \u2014 if one of us, my mother, brother or I noticed\nsomething that could be a possible Gestapo checking for I.D., if we thought it was, we\u2019d make\nsome hand notes and we slowly in di \u2014 different pe \u2014 not together, we\u2019d disappear. Because some\nthere, sometimes you could almost guess it. We got so we could feel that that was a Gestapo.",
        "Q: So you had hand motions?",
        "A: Yeah, we had the hand motions and then we\u2019d me \u2014 le-leave one at a time, and we wouldn\u2019t\nha \u2014 never go into a restroom, because they \u2014 they caught a lot of il \u2014 so full \u2014 so-called illegal\npeople in restrooms. And so we usually stayed out and tried to move away within two or three\nblocks from where we were at, then we\u2019d get back together. Yes, we \u2014 we did have that, just like\nwe always had a meeting place if we got separated.",
        "Q: Wherever you were. Was this \u2014 did this change day by day\u201d?",
        "A: Not day by day but maybe every third day we\u2019d say, well, if we get separated, let\u2019s meet at\nthis train station, or lets meet at this building. We always decided on a place to meet.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 well then what \u2014 again, what did you and your brother do during the day while the\nother children were at school? You \u2014 you are 11 and he\u2019s 12.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: [sneezes] Excuse me.",
        "A: Yeah, again, I d\u2014 I don\u2019t remember. I just don\u2019t know what we did. We\u2019d walk. Of course\nnow you know you had air raids almost daily. The U.S. used to bomb daytime, the British\nbombed at night and we spend a lot of time in air raid shelters. Especially when we\u2019re g \u2014 now\ngoing to 1944, a lot of our time was spent in air raid shelters.",
        "Q: Did you go to church?",
        "A: No, we never did go to a church, and of course temples were not available. But we \u2014 we did\nnot.",
        "Q: Why didn't you go to church to show you\u2019re a good Christian.",
        "A: We \u2014I don\u2019t think we were at places long enough, but for some reason we never did. Again,\nour mother must have had a reason not to go to a church.",
        "Q: Di-Did she always provide enough food for you?",
        "A: Well, she tried to, but there were times \u2014 there were times where we didn\u2019t have anything to\neat for two or three days. It was not easy. The \u2014 probably where we had most of the food where\nwe did not starve was that short time that we lived in that summer cabin in Berlin and also when\nwe were in that hotel, this resort hotel in Binz auf Rigen. There was had ample food. Again, I\nthink my mother took it from the kitchen at times.",
        "Q: When you walked down the street in Berlin, were you aware that there were other Jews on the\nstreet who were hiding? Did you sense other Jews being nearby who were under false papers?",
        "A: No, could not tell. We did not. I\u2019m sure there were and they probably didn\u2019t know we were\nJewish. No, I ba \u2014 I believe that the \u2014 the Jews that were living like we were, under false \u2014\nassumed names and so forth, did not know anyone else that was in hiding.",
        "Q: Di\u2014 had she delivered any other Jewish babies?",
        "A: I do not know, I don\u2019t think so. I think I was probably the only one that she had delivered.",
        "Q: Did you know if she sheltered other Jews?",
        "A: Definitely not. I know we were the only ones.",
        "Q: How do you know that?",
        "A: She\u2019d say that, she\u2019d tell my mother that. She said, you are the only ones I am helping and I\nknow that if Hitler catches me, he\u2019ll free me and everything will be by \u2014 will be forgiven and the\nconcentration camps would be eliminated once Hitler knew about it.",
        "Q: Did she tell any of her family or her friends about you?",
        "A: She had an adopted daughter, and she\u2019s the only one that knew. And her daughter was in the\nphotography business and I think she developed things against \u2014 for the \u2014 for the Nazis. Pictures\nthat were taken an that were maybe tough to \u2014 to really make a good picture out of, she was able\nto i-improve the \u2014 the pictures of it. I mean, you know, photography was still not too good at the\ntime. In fact, she would even color them if they wanted colored pictures. She would actually\nmanually color the pictures. And, but again, she kept her mouth shut, and she was the only one\nthat knew that we were Jewish.",
        "Q: And what was her name and did you have contact with her?",
        "A: Yes, m\u20141n fact, my brother saw \u2014 visited her when he was stationed in the army in\nHeidelberg.",
        "Q: No, I mean, during the 40\u2019s wer \u2014 did you have contact with her?",
        "A: Yes, I did have contact. In fact, this one picture that I showed to you here, she took that.",
        "Q: I meant during the war.",
        "A: During the war, yes, we did. In fact, she lived with g \u2014 Noelting in Berlin, in Schoneberg.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Traute, t-r-a-u-t-e, I think 1t was Holinova, h-o-]-1-n-o-v-a. I could be wrong on the spelling.\nBut she too has died now.",
        "Q: So, did you stay in different places once you were back in Berlin, or did you move around?",
        "A: We moved around all the time and until the beginni \u2014 beginning of 1945 when we lived in\ndifferent subway stations.",
        "Q: Why weren\u2019t you in an apartment?",
        "A: Well, it got so that we didn\u2019t know where to go any more and the bombing was ak \u2014 like I\nsaid earlier, day and night. And the shelters, the bomb shelters were overcrowded. We couldn\u2019t\nget in, and to be in a bomb shelter again as kids, had to be in Hitler youth uniform, which we\ndidn\u2019t have. And we were afraid to be caught in a bomb shelter, so we stayed in subway stations,\nwhich a lot of other Germans, at the end stayed, because the subway stations were pretty deep\ndown and they were probably one of the safest places to be until bef \u2014 the day before the\nRussians came in.",
        "Q: Did people question you on the street why you weren't in a Hitler youth uniform? Did\nanybody ever ask you?",
        "A: Only once I can remember where I was asked, why aren\u2019t you in uniform, I\u2019d say it\u2019s being\ncleaned. And that\u2019s the only time I was ever asked.",
        "Q: So what did you do during the day?",
        "A: I wished I could give you an answer for that, I do not re \u2014 I do not remember. I don\u2019t know\nwhat we did.",
        "Q: And you still thought your father was alive?",
        "A: Yes, we did, yes. Again, our father had us convinced that he being American, they\u2019ll give him\na bad time, but he\u2019ll be released.",
        "Q: What was your mother\u2019s state of mind?",
        "A: She too thought that he would be freed. She definitely did.",
        "Q: Was she calm during this time? What \u2014 how would you describe this woman?",
        "A: She \u2014 to us she was very calm, and always the \u2014 things will get better, don\u2019t fear. We\u2019ll be\ntogether with the father, then we\u2019ll go to America and so forth. To us she was calm, but I\u2019m sure\nshe was in constant fear. I\u2019m just certain about it.",
        "Q: Then she had no contact with any other Jews as far as you know?",
        "A: As far as I know, no. I know there was a \u2014 another person, not Jewish, who helped us out\nquite a bit, he was a doctor and also analyzed x-rays and so forth, he had a x-ray business. And\nhe \u2014 he was an M.D. and I think the was partly the underground, because th \u2014 he was arrested at\nthe tail end of the war. And I know he 1s the one that gave my mother quite a bit of information,\nand where we can stay and where we could not stay. But other than that, my wa \u2014 mother didn\u2019t\nhave too much contact with anyone else.",
        "Q: Ho-How did she get in contact with him and what was his name?",
        "A: I do not know his name and I don\u2019t know how they got into contact, I\u2014 I do not remember it.\nI do not even know what part of Berlin that was, but I do remember having gone there a couple\nof times, maybe even more than that. But I do not know the name.",
        "Q: So now you\u2019re sleeping in the subway station.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: How do you sleep in this \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: H-How do you sleep in the subway station?",
        "A: Well again, we were kids and we\u2019d just go on a bench and lie down on a bench. It was very\ncold at times, but you got used to that.",
        "Q: Did you feel very old going through these terrifying experiences?",
        "A: Well, let\u2019s put it this way, I did not feel like a 10 - 11 or 12 year old. We grew up, we matured\nvery, very early in life. And yes, I see other \u2014 I would see other 10 year old and I see how \u2014 what\na child they were and I say, they must be a lot younger than me. I do recall that.",
        "Q: Did you feel very German then, or very Jewish, or both?",
        "A: Sometimes I felt German. I had to feel German in order to save myself, but I \u2014 deep inside I\nfelt Jewish, yes, definitely.",
        "Q: Were you angry then that you were Jewish and so you had to go through all these terrible \u2014\nthis terrible ordeal?",
        "A: No, I was not angry, I was just wishing why can\u2019t we be like anyone else. I was not angry\nbeing Jewish, no, but I just was wishing I could be \u2014 that this discrimination against the Jews\nwouldn\u2019t be, that it would stop. And why am I different than any other German kid? I\u2014 maybe I\nregretted it, but I was not angry.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and then what? So you \u2014 you \u2014 as I said, you were living in the subway station until?",
        "A: Until the end of the war. Actually, what happened is we were at one subway station, and all of\na sudden it started being flooded, water came gushing through there. And all the people that were\nat that station started moving \u2014 the s-subways were not running \u2014 on the tracks to another station.\nAnd very few of us had anything to eat or to drink. Some people started drinking the water that\nwas stuving \u2014 coming through, and most of those people actually died due to diseases, I think\ntyphoid or whatever it brought. And there were times my brother and I were going to drink it,\nand we kind of kept each other from drinking it. We knew that that is dirty, we\u2019re not going to\ndrink it. And we, with quite a few other Germans, moved to the next station, which was not\nflooded then. And we probably spent \u2014 and my \u2014 our mother was still alive then, and \u2014 who kind\nof kept us, too, from drinking it. And we got to the other station that was not flooded, and \u2014 but\nwe needed water, and so my mother went outside the station upstairs to a fire hydrant to get\nwater. And she didn't come back down. And I went up and I do remember seeing her lying at the\nfire hydrant. And actually she was killed, I don\u2019t know if it was German or Russians, but the\ncrossfire between the Russians and the Germans. And so \u2014 and I never could get the water, I was\nforced to go back down into the subway station by German soldiers. I was a kid, and he forced\nme to go back down. And I would say that same day, all of a sudden two Russian soldiers came\ninto that subway station with Tommy guns \u2014 machine guns in each hand and everyone \u2014\neveryone down in that subway tunnel started clapping. There were a few German soldiers there,\nthey threw down their weapons and surrendered to those two Russian soldiers. And again, this\nwas at Anhalter Bahnhof, which is no longer a subway station, but the station is still there as a \u2014\na memorial, so to speak. And that was the end of the war for us. And we then \u2014",
        "Q: Let \u2014 let \u2014 let\u2019s go back a little bit. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s painful, but you come upstairs and you see\nyour mother \u2014",
        "A: It was very [indecipherable]",
        "Q: \u2014an-and how did you break the news to your brother?",
        "A: Okay, at the time I didn\u2019t know if she really was dead or just injured. And I told my brother I\nsaw our mother, she was up at the fire hydrant, but the Germans wouldn\u2019t let me get to it, and I\nthink she is okay, but I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s really what I told him. And I didn\u2019t know, I \u2014 it was\njust the way I felt. And of course we never did see her again. And, in fact, up to this day, I do not\nknow if she was killed or injured because the Russians took a lot of \u2014 especially women and\nchildren, they loaded them on truck and s-shipped them to Russia, especially women. In fact,\nafter the war my brother and I were loaded onto trucks many times to be \u2014 to go to Russia, but\nwe knew Berlin like a book, we \u2014 there wasn\u2019t an address we couldn\u2019t find. And we, for awhile\nwere guides to some of the Russian officers going from point A to point B.",
        "Q: Previous to you losing your mother, were di \u2014 di \u2014 wasn\u2019t there a situation where you were\ntaken away?",
        "A: Yes. We didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t cover that. Yes, again, like I said, we moved around freely under\nfalse I.D., and again in a streetcar, and I was there by myself. I think I may have been on my way\nto this midwife, Noelting, because she had some groceries for us. And we\u2019d do that, sometimes\nmy brother went to see her. And this was on April 15\", 1945. I was caught in a streetcar. And the\nreason is they had what I always feared, we all of us feared, an I.D. check. And they had an I.D.\ncheck and I had the I.D., I was \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the first name, the last name was Schmitz.\nBut I didn't have my Hitler youth card with me. So again, they make you drop the pants and they\nknew pretty much if you didn\u2019t have the Hitler youth I.D. you were Jewish. And of course, to a\n12 year old having to drop their pants in front of everybody was a humiliation to begin with. And\nof course, I was circumcised, Jewish, and they \u2014 I was arrested. They tied me up, my hands\nbehind my back, very tightly and they took me to Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse 9. That was the SS\nheadquarters. And they had a kind of a basement, like a dungeon where they questioned people,\nnot just Jews, even Germans that helped Jews, or others that talked against the regime, they were\ntortured at that place. And again, according to the archives \u2014 the archives in Germany do not s-\nsay what happened to me when I was arrested April 15\". It only showed that on April 17\", I was\nshipped to Dachau on a t \u2014 railcar, a train. Well, for t\u2014 two days there, between the 15\" and the\n17\", I was tortured, but they didn\u2019t get any information out of me because they beat me and\nthings they did, pulling teeth out, I have dentures. Pulling out teeth without any Novocain or\nanything, and usually I\u2019d pass out, and they finally gave up and stuck me in one of those trains.\nAnd that was April 17, according to the archives. And I ended up, after two days roughly, 1-in\nDachau, which I believe was the only concentration camp that still was open and there with a\nroute between Berlin and Munich. And of course Dachau was very close to Munich. I never left\nthe train. The train, railcar that I was in was mostly \u2014 were mostly Russian soldiers, men and\nwomen soldiers. There were, I think, a couple of kids my age in there and a few other women\nand men, Germans, Jews, I do not know. Then there were a whole bunch of people on the floor\nof the train that were already dead, or were trampled to death, or been there a lot longer. I don\u2019t\nknow how long they save, you know, kept the train in Berlin until it was full, completely full. So\nthere were a number of people that I know were dead. There was nothing to eat, no water and no\nsanitation facilities. And it was \u2014 it was the worst hell I\u2019ve ever been in. And it was either April\n19\" or April 20\", I do not know. Again, during th \u2014 fr \u2014 apar \u2014 from the records that were kept, I\nturned up missing April 20\". It may have been th-the day before. But during and air raid, there\nwas an air raid, and somebody during that air raid opened up the door of the railcar that we were\nin. Why, I don\u2019t know. I kind of think is that the German guards \u2014 they were SS, they were\nvolunteers to be there, I think knew the allies were right outside the camp because Dachau was\nliberated April 29\". And this was let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s say this was April 20\". And so I think to be maybe\nhe or she, whoever opened the railcar door figured maybe they\u2019d get better treatment. And so\nthat door opened and whoever was strong enough, jumped out. I followed a bunch of Russian\nsoldiers. There must have been 15 or 20 of them that I followed, and it wasn\u2019t too far. We ended\nup on a camp where there were nothing but Hitler youth and a few German soldiers. They were\nnot SS, they were German soldiers, and they were teaching the Hitler youth kids how to fire a\nrifle because at that time now they made everybody defend the Motherland \u2014 the Fatherland. And\nanyhow, the Russians overpowered the few German soldiers. Over half of the Russian soldiers\nwere killed themselves, they were POWs, right, and they didn\u2019t have no weapons. But in groups\nthey just attacked the Germans, and like I say, over half were killed.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: \u2014 of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred\nTaucher. This is tape number two, side B.",
        "A: Okay, after the Russian soldiers ar \u2014 overpowered the Germans, the Hitler youth, even though\nthey had weapons, but they were so frightened, they just froze. They just looked in awe, and the\nRussians did shoot every one of the Hitler youth, they killed every one of them. And then they\nstarted to move someplace and I wanted to follow them, and they said nein, nein, no you can\u2019t.\nAnd so what I did is I looked at the Hitler youth kids that were dead and took off the uniform of\none of the kids that was my size and put on that uniform. And I followed the railroad tracks,\nbecause I knew there were old Autobahn, the freeway \u2014 not \u2014 not freeway, highway, was right\nnext to the railara \u2014 railroad car. And so I walked towards there and I decided to flag down a car.\nAnd the first car that went by was a German SS car, a Mercedes and two SS officers were in.\nWell, they stopped, and I said I\u2019m \u2014 I need to go back to Berlin, I was at this camp here and\nRussians came by and they killed everybody. I\u2019m the only one that is left aline, and I want \u2014 a-\nalive, I want to go back to Berlin and meet \u2014 and go to my mother. And they said come on in,\njump in, we have a message for Hitler, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to. Now remember, I didn\u2019t \u2014\nthe only language I knew was German. I talked like a German, I was German, except they didn't\nknow I was a German Jew. There were numerous roadblocks from Munich to Berlin, however,\nwe were waived through every roadblock because they were again \u2014 I don\u2019t know what rank they\nwere, but they were high in the SS and they had a little sticker on the windshield, and they hardly\neven ever slowed down for a roadblock, 1t was opened up for them to go through. And they\ndropped me off at Anhalter Bahnhof, which was \u2014 actually, that was our meeting place where we\nalways said if we get separated, this is where we meet, and \u2014 and every day we\u2019d go and meet\nthere. Well, we got to \u2014 I got to Anhalter Bahnhof and there was my mother and brother who\nalmost fainted when they saw me in the Hitler youth uniform. But anyhow, this was \u2014 you see,\nit\u2019s so close to the war and we did then go to the Noelting, the midwife, we went to her home,\nand I did change clothes. I didn\u2019t dare stay in the Hitler youth uniform because they could take\nme like they did take Hitler youth kids and gave them a rifle to defend. So I didn\u2019t want to be in\nthe Hitler youth. In fact, I think my brother and I both, she put Band-Aids on our feet like we\nwere injured, and then put on civilian clothes and that\u2019s really how we lived until the Russians\ncame in.",
        "Q: How do you explain how you kept your equilibrium through all of this? You were so young,\nyou were 12 years old. Let\u2019s even go back to the railcar. Well, no, let\u2019s even go back previous to\nthat, to how you were tortured. Ho-ho \u2014 you were 12 years old.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Well, they were so animal-like. They had, like I say, after some pain, I passed\nout. And by the time \u2014 I was never \u2014 why I didn\u2019t talk, I do not know, I cannot tell you that.\nAnother thing I want to mention, which I think nowadays, I was so thin. I mean when \u2014 after the\nwar, when we lived with the Russians, I think I weighed 50 some pounds and my brother wasn\u2019t\nmuch heavier, that those SS who I got the ride with didn\u2019t recognize tha \u2014 how thin I was. I\nprobably looked more like an eight year old than a 11 year old, but they didn\u2019t see that. I think\ntheir whole thing was to get to Berlin to let Hitler \u2014 probably what I think happened is because\nthey knew the allies were outside, probably to ask Hitler what should be done. They could have\nbeen general officers, I\u2019m \u2014 I don\u2019t know. But, I mean, we practically flew to Berlin. I mean,\nthey drove that Mercedes as fast as it could be driven and of course they\u2019re \u2014 the only vehicles\nyou saw on the Autobahn were military vehicles.",
        "Q: And then when you were in the railcar, was that a cattle car?",
        "A: It was a cattle car, and this is why even today, right here at this museum, I \u2014 I\u2019ve been here\nfour or five times, I have never been able to step foot in that cattle car that is right here at this\nmuseum.",
        "Q: How do you explain your keeping your composure, your sanity in a car like that, when you\nwere \u2014 when you were going through it?",
        "A: Well, I knew I was going to die. I knew my \u2014 that s \u2014 that I was caught, they\u2019re taking me to a\nconcentration camp, I didn\u2019t know which one and I knew the end of my life was near. And I\naccepted that. And of course my brother and my mother, we all knew that we are living from day\nto day and it could be at any time we could be arrested and put to a concentration camp. I mean,\nwe knew our father went to Auschwitz, we knew that. Even though we thought, again, him being\nan American, he will survive.",
        "Q: Did you know what a concentration camp was?",
        "A: Yes, yes, we knew and we knew they were gassing Jews.",
        "Q: How did you know that?",
        "A: It spread. I believe the \u2014 this midwife told us. But we knew, and th-the word spread. The\nGermans knew it. Of course they said they didn\u2019t know, and now they all say they never knew,\nwhich 1s a lie. They all knew. And of course the way they beat people up into the railcars, I\nmean, not only Jews, also Jehovah Witness was one, gay people and of course Poles or other\nforeigners that were enemies of Germany. And they were just beaten, literally beaten up into the\nrailcars and squeezed together like cattle.",
        "Q: Did the older people in the railcar help you, as a 12 year old?",
        "A: No, I would say the Russian soldiers helped me and actually kept me from getting down on\nthe ground, because they knew if I would fall, I wou \u2014 could be dead, because I\u2019d be trampled\non. And I will say the Russian \u2014 incidentally, they treated me well, and treated my brother well\nafter they liberated Berlin.",
        "Q: But in the railcar?",
        "A: I-In the railcar they treated me very well. They kept me up and made sure that I stand up and\ndon\u2019t try to lie down. And especially, I mean I \u2014 sleepy. You know, I was there at least two days,\nnothing to eat, nothing to drink. But they kept me from lying down.",
        "Q: Was it dark?",
        "A: Oh yes. There were \u2014 there was some light coming in daytime, but very little. And with all the\npeople stacked in, it was mostly dark. And it was still \u2014 well again, we were so close together.\nThat\u2019s one good thing, otherwise we would have been freezing. I mean April in Germany still\ngets \u2014 the nights get very cold.",
        "Q: Was it all men, or was it men and women?",
        "A: Men and women, men and women. And it was very unpleasant. There are things that \u2014 well, I\nwas young enough really, I didn\u2019t know about a woman having a period. I didn\u2019t know about\nthat. Of course, that transpired there. And a lot of people had diarrhea, and again, no sanitation\nfacilities. And it\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what went on there and I\u2019m not the only one that suffered like that.\nAnd \u2014 but again, the railcar was probably as wor \u2014 as bad as having been tortured, because in the\ntorture, so much of it, I passed out. And though I woke up with pain, but still, the railcar was the\nworst thing that could have any \u2014 happened to anybody.",
        "Q: Besides the Russian soldiers being of help to you, did you sense that people were helping\nothers? Other people were helping \u2014",
        "A: You mean in the railcar?",
        "Q: \u2014 other victims in the railcar?",
        "A: No, I think \u2014 I think most of them were in there much longer and were too weak to do\nanything. And I think the Russian soldiers that helped me and were helpful, I think were c-caught\non the eastern part of Berlin, which the Russian came in on. I think they were caught shortly \u2014\nabout the same time I was, or maybe it \u2014 two or three days sooner. But of course they were not\ntortured, they were just loaded on that railcar til 1t was completely full. But I don\u2019t think they\nwere in too long and were still strong enough to survive this ordeal.",
        "Q: What does death mean to a 12 year old? You said you knew you were going to die.",
        "A: It meant strictly, that\u2019s it, you\u2019re going to be \u2014 you\u2019re going to be away from this world. It\u2019s \u2014\nto me, I knew death. Of course, remember, I saw my stepbrother kill himself. And I knew he was\ndead, he would never be alive again. And that\u2019s really what it meant to me, I\u2019Il be just like Klaus,\nmy s-stepbrother.",
        "Q: Were you afraid of death?",
        "A: No, that\u2019s the thing. My brother, and I think this 1s probably why he can\u2019t remember anything,\nhe feared death, he \u2014 he feared the bombing. We sometimes had to hold him or he would run\nright into the fire, practically. He feared death and I didn\u2019t. I just took it one day at a time and\nalways took it, and I guess I still feel like that today. I mean, I spent time in Korea and I just felt\nlike, when the time comes, I \u2014 I\u2019Il die. And I thought my time was there when I was in the train,\nespecially with all the dead people around me.",
        "Q: When you got back to your mother and your brother after the railcar, did you tell them what\nyou went through, and the tortures?",
        "A: Yes, I told them where I was at, what happened. And of course, my mother just cried and\nhugged me and so thankful that I survived. And she suspected that 1s what had happened,\nbecause we had never been separated more than a \u2014 a day, never. No, I think one time, my\nmother couldn\u2019t come back and she was gone for one night, but then we got together again. But\nother than that we\u2019ve always spent the nights together, wherever.",
        "Q: You were very, very quick thinking and quick witted to put on that Hitler youth uniform and\nflag down that car. What do you attribute that to? That was a very brilliant decision, and you\nwere 12 years old.",
        "A: Well \u2014 that\u2019s right. Well, I think my brother would have done the same thing. Again, maybe\nour mother brainwashed us in there \u2014 in this. And I think maybe this Frau Noelting told us\nwhenever things like happen, what to do, I \u2014 I think, but I just knew what I had to do, especially\nwhen I couldn\u2019t follow the Russians and here I was all alone. And \u2014 and I decided, well, the only\nway I\u2019m going to make it is put on the Hitler youth uniform, and hoping that I wouldn\u2019t be\nforced to take a rifle and start shooting. And again, I didn\u2019t know like, at the time that the allies\nwere out or the \u2014 outside the Dachau camp that the ger \u2014 Russians were outside, I didn\u2019t know\nthat. But I knew, we all knew the war was coming to an end, and we even knew that before I was\narrested. We knew it was the end of the war coming. Well, we knew that and th-the word spread.\nPeople, Germans that were against the regime weren't afraid to talk any more that much. And I\nused to hear people say, look at all those tanks there \u2014 to other people \u2014 look at those tanks,\nthere\u2019s not enough gasoline to operate the tanks, they\u2019re out of gas. And so the Germans weren\u2019t\nquite as afraid any more. But of course afterwards, and I \u2014 I do know women, I know men that\nwould say, oh we\u2019re \u2014 we have a secret weapon. This just when the Russians were really fighting\nfor Berlin, where we were, we have secret weapons and they going to take them, they\u2019re going to\nkill the \u2014 all the Russians that are coming in. There were still those fanatics around and I heard\nwomen say, oh, if these Russians should come in, I\u2019m going to pour boiling water on them. And\nPll do everything, they\u2019ll never get me, I'll kill them, and so forth. Of course, after the Russians\ncame in, oh how sweet you are. And \u2014 and honestly, the Russians would wa \u2014 rape the women\nright out in daylight in the street. Again, things I didn\u2019t know until 1t came true. And you know, I\nhad no remorse on those women that used to \u2014 I used to hear in the train station that they are\ngoing to kill the Russian, they are going to knife them to death or they\u2019re gonna put boiling\nwaters on them. That\u2019s how they felt then, and then they were friends. So, the Russians that came\ninto Berlin were completely uneducated. They had no common sense, and they were \u2014 in fact, I\nwouldn\u2019t be surprised if those were released prisoners, because the Russian \u2014 I think the front\nline soldiers were maybe from Siberia, or people that were politically arrested or other \u2014 some\nreason other arrest. And they were \u2014 they were not the nicest people, and yet to us kids, they\ntreated us well. And of \u2014 of course after Berlin was divided between the Russians, the French,\nthe British and the U.S. troops, we then went to live with this midwife.",
        "Q: When \u2014 so you \u2014 le-let\u2019s get back just chronologically, you \u2014 you \u2014 the ra \u2014 you found your\nmother, you saw that your mother had been shot.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: You came downstairs, you told your brother and then the Russian soldiers came in.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And then what happened?",
        "A: What happened, we went to the Russian soldiers and we found somebody that spoke German\n\u2014no, we even found a Jewish soldier. We found a Russian Jewish soldier who spook \u2014 spoke\nYiddish. And so we communicated in Yiddish and said we were hungry and we told them we\nwere Yiddish, right? And they gave us food, they gave us water. They actually nourished us back\na little bit.",
        "Q: Did you feel liberated at that moment?",
        "A: Yes, we felt liberated.",
        "Q: And what did that mean to you boys?",
        "A: Freedom, food. We can talk freely. We don\u2019t have to worry about being arrested by the Nazis.\nWe don\u2019t have to worry about being beaten or spit upon by other German kids. That\u2019s what it\nmeant, it just meant full freedom. And \u2014 and after we received food and everything from the\nRussians, we then \u2014 this Russian soldier, I don\u2019t know what his rank was, or what, but he was \u2014\nthis Jewish soldier was a little bit more educated and we became the guide to his officer, and\nshowed him where to go in Berlin from point A to point B, because we knew it so well.",
        "Q: Wher-Where were you living?",
        "A: We were still living with the Russians, very close to this Anhalter Bahnhof, the train station\nwhere our mother was killed, we think. In fact, this soldier wa \u2014 by the time we went back\noutside the train station, our mother was not \u2014 there was nobody by this fire hydrant. And that\nJewish soldier did try to find our mother, but couldn\u2019t. So we do not know if she was taken to\nRussia or buried, or what.",
        "Q: And you s \u2014 you still expected to find your father?",
        "A: Right. But then after \u2014 after the division between the Russians, the \u2014 and the Americans when\nBerlin was divided up in sectors, and then we went to live with that midwife, we knew that \u2014 that\n\u2014 we found out that the people that were in concentration camp by that time would have been\nback in Berlin or we would have known and our father would have known to get in touch with\nthis midwife. And when he didn't \u2014 and the same thing with our mother \u2014 we knew our mother \u2014\nagain, we didn't know, and of course, I still don\u2019t know. Even today I don\u2019t know if our mother\ndied in this crossfire or if she was sent to Russia, because the Russians did take thousands of \u2014 of\nkids and women to Russia. I\u2019m sure you are aware of that. And so that, we don\u2019t know. We did,\nbefore we came to the U.S., we had to identify our mother, and we had to get a birth ad \u2014-a\u2014a-\u2014\na death certificate of our mother. And we said well, we don\u2019t know. Well, if you want to leave\nGermany you need to have a death certificate. So there were a whole bunch of people and so we\njust identified yes, that was our mother. They showed us pictures of several people, I said yes,\nthat\u2019s our mother, so we could get a death certificate. But if she really died there, we don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You stayed with the Russian soldiers \u2014",
        "A: For a\u2014",
        "Q: For how long?",
        "A: Well, I\u2014I\u2019m not sure. There must be records. When \u2014 when Berlin was divided into the four\nsectors, it was until the division, we stayed with the Russians. One thing is, we were their guide,\nbut trains didn\u2019t run and things like this, until the division really, and wa \u2014 there was no way we\ncould have gotten to Schoneberg to the \u2014 to the midwife, and we didn\u2019t even know if she was\nstill alive or \u2014 or what. But it was after the di-division that we went to Schoneberg, to the\nmidwife.",
        "Q: Before that did you meet with people \u2014 meet people who had also been in hiding, other Jews?",
        "A: Well, you saw the picture of the synagogue, but no that was \u2014 no, I didn\u2019t, no.",
        "Q: I-I meant in the very beginning, after liberation.",
        "A: At the very beginning no, we did not meet anyone that was in hiding. No, I\u2019m co \u2014 incorrect\nthere. I know of about two or three people that also received this concentration camp I.D. that\nwere not in hiding, that were out of concentration camps, because the Russian government, or the\nRussian military produced these I.D.\u2019s that we were in concentration camp very close to where I\nwas at at that Anhalter Bahnhof. And I \u2014 I did meet two or three people, elderly people that did\nget out of a concentration camp and also received this I.D. But as far as people that were living\nin hiding, at that time no, I ha \u2014 did not meet anyone.",
        "Q: So then you \u2014 you went back to this woman \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- the \u2014 the midwife?",
        "A: To the midwife. And of course \u2014 she actually signed us up, we did go to a German school\nthere after the war for a little bit, but not very long, about two months.",
        "Q: She was willing to take you back in?",
        "A: Yes, she took us back in and \u2014",
        "Q: Did you assume your old names, your real names?",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 we assumed our real name and she even provided clothing for us because we wore\npractically rags. But we weren\u2019t the only Germans that wore rags, you couldn\u2019t buy clothing\nduring the war. But anyhow, she got us some clothing and signed us up to a school. And I think\nshe started me in the second grade and my brother in the third grade in Germany. But we only\nwent to that school for about a month or two, and then the British military, they inherited what\nused to be a\u2014a rest and cu \u2014 recuperation camp outside of Berlin, about three or four hours drive\nout of Berlin in Luneburg, and where the Germans had a rest and recuperation camp. And they\ntook a bunch of \u2014 at that time now, kids that were either in hiding or in concentration camp, they\nlooked those people up, including my brother and I, and in British ambulances they drove us to\nthis former [indecipherable] camp in Luneburg, where we were nursed \u2014 we were given\ncomplete physical examinations and we were nursed back into health. And that is straight \u2014\nbefore we went to that camp, my brother and I then got to know some of the Jewish American\nsoldiers who opened up the synagogue, and this one, Werner Nathan was his name, a private in\nthe U.S. Army, and he is the one that actually was responsible in opening up that synagogue at\nRosh Hashanah, and he got us in touch, or got the Joint Distribution Committee 1n touch with us,\nwho sponsored us to come to the States. Well, trying to. And while we were waiting to co-come\nto the U.S., we went to this rest camp that the British sponsored, that should have been for, I\nthink eight weeks. For two months. Well, we were there about three months when a American\nsoldier, not Werner Nathan, some other American soldier came, looked for us and says we are\ngoing to be coming to the United States. We have our \u2014 our visas and we\u2019re going to come to the\nU.S. So we left that camp early, went back to Berlin and he drove us back to Berlin and I don\u2019t\nknow if it was a private vehicle or U.S. Army vehicle, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: When you were in this rest camp, there were other Jewish children, did you talk and compare\nstories?",
        "A: No. Nobody wanted to talk about it. They didn\u2019t really want to talk about it, including me. We\njust survived, and some of them were living in conditions like \u2014 you know, maybe in a ceiling\nsomeplace and never saw daylight. Or somehow that they had \u2014 maybe people hid them, and\nreally hid them. And mo \u2014 and lot of the kids I know were in \u2014 out in farms someplace. And \u2014\nbut again, lived in hiding where nobody knew that they were in that \u2014 a farmhouse. And \u2014 but\nnobody really wanted to talk about it too much.",
        "Q: What do you attribute that to?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think \u2014 even me at the time, I was still thinking, is this real? Am I really free? And\nyeah \u2014 and nobody asked. I may mention something here. Two years ago I met a woman, she too\nwas in this rest camp. We met each other in Prague at the Child Survivors of the Holocaust\nconference. And \u2014 but if \u2014 we just didn\u2019t talk about it. And when I went back to Berlin after they\nrescue \u2014 recuperating, and my brother and I, and we told the midwife, Frau Noelting that we\nwere going to America. And oh, she was upset. She says, you\u2019re German, you can\u2019t go. But we\ndid.",
        "Q: T-Tell me more in detail how you met Werner Nathan.",
        "A: After the \u2014 Berlin was divided, again our father being an American and being pretty much\ntold that we\u2019re going to come to \u2014 go to America some day, we went to a U.S. Army camp. And\nwhere we lived in Schoneberg was the w \u2014 American sector, fortunately enough. And so we just\nwent to an army camp and we started telling at the front gate really, 1s there anybody here that\nspeaks German? And most of them don\u2019t, you know, and \u2014 and says yes, and they called this one\nprivate out, which was Werner Nathan. He is ori \u2014 was originally from Austria and they went to\nthe States before the war. If he is alive he\u2019d be in his 80\u2019s now. And anyhow, we talked with him\n\u2014 and he was very Orthodox, too. And he says, well he\u2019s in the process of finding a synagogue\nand they found a synagogue, the only synagogue in Berlin that was not burned. And that he was\nopening up that synagogue for Rosh Hashanah. And that\u2019s really how we met him.",
        "Q: So he stayed in contact with you from that day on?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And he 1s the one that contacted the Joint Distribution Committee in New York.",
        "Q: Did you go to the Rosh Hashanah services?",
        "A: Yes. This is a picture, and here is my brother and I at the Rosh Hashanah services right here\nin this picture.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts during that service?",
        "A: Thanking God that we are alive, and \u2014 and afterwards this so \u2014 Werner Nathan forced us to\nstudy a little bit more Hebrew, and the various prayers. And I think it was a month or two later\nthat we \u2014 maybe not even that long, I don\u2019t know exactly, is when we became Bar Mitzvah. My\nbrother and I were the first two Jewish boys Bar Mitzvah in Berlin after the war.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Fred Taucher. This is tape number three, side A, and you had begun to talk about\npreparing for your Bar Mitzvah.",
        "A: Right, well, having been away from really, the Jewish religion for all these war years, we\nwere taught by this American serviceman, who was very Orthodox, and he probably knew as\nmuch as a rabbi, and he made sure that we learned all the prayers and says we have to be Bar\nMitzvah. And even though I was only 12 years old and my brother were 13, he recruited one of\nthe Jewish chaplains fr \u2014 chaplains from his American company in the army and we were\nofficially Bar Mitzvah, went through all the various prayers. And I do not know the exactly \u2014\nexact date, but I would say it was some time in 1946 and probably I would \u2014 I\u2019m guessing now,\nbetween March and April of 1946 when we were Bar Mitzvah, becau \u2014",
        "Q: So you were already 13, cause you were 13 in January.",
        "A: Ah, no I wa \u2014 that\u2019s correct, I was 13 in January, so I was th \u2014 that\u2019s right, I was 13 and my\nbrother was 14. And of course, he was a year late before he could be Bar Mitzvah.",
        "Q: Did you want to have a Bar Mitzvah?",
        "A: Yes, we\u2019ve always wanted to be Bar Mitzvah. I mean, even though we were never very\nreligious, we were very conservative, but 1t was always our parents saying that when \u2014 I\nremember always saying when my brother becomes 13 years old he\u2019s going to be a man, he\u2019s\ngoing to be Bar Mitzvah. And the same thing was true with me. And yes, I did want to be Bar\nMitzvah and we were very proud when we became Bar Mitzvah.",
        "Q: Can you describe what you did?",
        "A: No, that I do not remember. I do not remember, but I know there was a big party afterwards,\nat that synagogue, and it was a \u2014 a day of celebration, but what we did, I do not remember, but it\nwas probably the most enjoyable time in our lives, from the day I can remember.",
        "Q: Who came to the service?",
        "A: A lot of Jewish, as well \u2014 Jewish U.S. soldiers, Russian soldiers and I\u2019m not sure but I \u2014\nsomething in my back of the mind, I\u2014 I\u2019m sure that the midwife\u2019s stepdaughter, who was a\nphotographer, I believe she took pictures. I do not have any of those pictures, but I b \u2014 do believe\nshe was there taking pictures. And that\u2019s all I can really remember.",
        "Q: Was it difficult not having your parents there at your Bar Mitzvah?",
        "A: Of course it was. We missed our mother, we wished our father could have been there even\nthough we knew the fact that he was dead and perished in Auschwitz. And so we \u2014 but we did\nmiss our mother and again in \u2014 in th \u2014 at that time we still were not sure, we did not know\nwhether she was still alive, or \u2014 or dead. We didn\u2019t know that, so yes, it was very, very hard not\nhaving our mother there, though we celebrated, it was joyous. But we still wished that our\nmother could have been there.",
        "Q: Were you trying to locate your mother still, at that point?",
        "A: Oh yes, all the time, we \u2014 whenever we learned of a place that had records, and regardless\nwhat section, whether it \u2014 whether it was French, British or what, we\u2019d go over there and see if\nwe could find anything on our mother. But we, of course, never found anything.",
        "Q: Did Gertrude Noelting come to your Bar Mitzvah, or just her daughter?",
        "A: I do not recall her coming, but I \u2014 I\u2019m not 100 percent sure if her daughter came, but I \u2014 I\nreally believe she did come and took fi \u2014 pictures, but I\u2019m almost positive that Frau Noelting\nnever did come to it.",
        "Q: So d- and you had the celebration at the synagogue itself?",
        "A: That is correct, they had a big celebration that we had food, and we had fruits that we haven\u2019t\n\u2014 had never seen, like a banana. We almost didn\u2019t know how to peel a banana and I believe we\nhad banana the first time since the war. I do remember that.",
        "Q: And your relationship with your brother then, did it \u2014 it was still as intensely close as it had\nbeen during the war?",
        "A: Oh, very much so. We\u2019ve been very close, even though after we got older and came to the\nU.S., just like brothers one year apart used to fight and argue, which we did, too, but still we\nwere very close and even today we\u2019re still very close.",
        "Q: And did you two talk about the wartime at that \u2014 in 1946, did you talk about the previous\nyears?",
        "A: No, we never did, even when we came to the States, we hardly ever talked about the war\nyears. It\u2019s something that \u2014 and it was probably more so my brother than me. He just did not\nwant to talk about it and so I didn\u2019t. He \u2014 he took the whole thing a lot harder than I did, I\nbelieve.",
        "Q: And in order to get food you said you had this folder, this camp folder, the red \u2014 the red side\nof \u2014",
        "A: Oh, oh, oh, that, yes, most people that were \u2014 that have survived from a concentration camp,\nthat were in a concentration camp, first in Berlin were given a little identification by the Russian\nsoldiers, it was in German and Russian, indicating that we were discriminated against and have\nsurvived a concentration camp. And it was a red sheet of paper with the concentration camp\nlogo. And once we \u2014 if \u2014 when we held that certificate going through lines, buying food or other\nitems, we could just hold that and could go to the front of the line. And there was not a single\nGerman that ever complained, us going to the front of the line. In fact, they turned the other way,\nthey didn\u2019t even want to see this concentration camp logo, they all knew what it was. And we\nhad full privileges, even when we took a train. Shortly after the war, some of the trains started\nrunning again in Berlin, and we could go to the train, never had to pay to ride the trains, I mean\nwe had a free hand in Berlin right after the war.",
        "Q: Were you able to go back to your original house, original apartment?",
        "A: The original apartment \u2014 well, the apartment where th \u2014 I call it the ghetto type of a\napartment, where we were forced to live, that was bombed out. That was no longer in existence.\nHowever, both of the stores, the first store that I remember as a very small child, that my father\nhad in Petsalozzi(ph) strasse and not very far, couple of blocks from there in Leipne(ph) strasse,\nwhich was the street where \u2014 that suffered from the Kristallnacht, that store was still in existence.\nAnd I don\u2019t recall us visiting either one of those stores right after the war, before we came to the\nStates. But I went back to Berlin for my first time in 1975, I believe, and I did visit that store.\nAnd it didn\u2019t change much, and I just, a year ago in berli \u2014 in April, a year ago when I was in\nBerlin, I did visit it and of course there\u2019s the one on Leipne(ph) strasse was for rent and the one\non Petsalozzi(ph) strasse, there was a Chinese family living there and also they had a store of\nChinese artifacts and souvenir type items. In fact, I stopped and talked with them. Their son, it so\nhappened, graduated from the University of California, spoke pretty good English and I talked\nwith him for probably close to an hour. And he found it very interesting that as a child I was\nliving at that place, at a \u2014 it did some \u2014 was some major remodeling done and more space. Well,\nwe had two bedrooms and a kitchen and a bathroom 1n that store when we lived there before the\nKristallnacht. A-And now it had some much nicer and more roomy type of bedrooms and it was\nalmost like a very comfortable type of an apartment.",
        "Q: When you were with \u2014 studying with this young American soldier, was he helping other\nJewish children?",
        "A: If he was, I\u2019m not aware of it. I don\u2019t think so because he still was a soldier and I think he was\na company cook and he still had to do his duties there and in his off time he worked with us. So I\ndoubt very much that he helped others, because we were not as a group. He worked with us\nstrictly as individuals.",
        "Q: Did you learn English then?",
        "A: No, we did not. We \u2014 the only word of English I knew was hello, goodbye and where\u2019s the\nbathroom? And thank you. I think my brother learned a few more words of English. But\nincidentally, both my brother and I were able to communicate in Russian. We were not fluent,\nbut we were able to communicate in Russian pretty good, because we\u2019ve lived with the Russians\nfor about 90 days.",
        "Q: And you were able to pick up the ru \u2014 Russian language?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. We were able to, and like I say, communicate and pick up, right. I have\ncompletely forgotten it, I still know a few words, but I could not carry on a conversation and I\ncan understand very little.",
        "Q: And then how much longer did you stay in Germany after your Bar Mitzvah?",
        "A: Okay, again, I think the Bar Mitzvah was in the spring of 1946 and we left Berlin in\nSeptember 1946.",
        "Q: I forgot to ask you an important question, did you get any gifts for your Bar Mitzvah?",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe we did. I don\u2019t recall that we received any gifts. We were just so happy to be\namongst our own without fear of being arrested. That was a gift alone.",
        "Q: Absolutely. Did you feel connected to the Russian Jewish soldiers?",
        "A: At the time, yes. The \u2014 we didn\u2019t meet too many of them, but yes, they treated us well, and I\nwas somewhat connected, but not as much as once the Americans came in. I mean, we didn't\neven keep track of the Russian and Jewish soldiers, except some of them were at the Bar\nMitzvah. But we pretty much got connected to the American Jewish soldiers, both enlisted men\nas well as officers. I even remember some of the names, Lieutenant Nowalski(ph), who helped us\nout, and there were a few other officers. And the only names I can remember was Lieutenant\nNowalski(ph) and Private Werner Nathan.",
        "Q: Important names. And the name of the synagogue, you said you\u2019re not sure?",
        "A: No, I wished I would know. I don\u2019t know the address, I \u2014 I do not know the name, but I do\nknow it was the only synagogue not burned out, not burned by the Germans.",
        "Q: What was your relationship with the German children your age, the non-Jewish chil-children?\nDid they talk to you, did you play with them, did you do anything with them? After the war.",
        "A: After the war? Well again, we went to school for two or three months after the war, and we\nplayed with them and I still sensed there was some prejudice towards the Jews by some of them.\nBut like I have shown you this \u2014 this is \u2014 the funny thing is is how I knew there was a write-up in\nthis British magazine, The Illustrated. And there were \u2014 was a picture of my brother and I in that\nIllustrated. It was a German kid whose parents knew English and subscribed to that magazine.\nAnd they are the ones that showed us that magazine with our pictures in it.",
        "Q: Right. You\u2019re talking about the October 6\", 1945 issue of The Illustrated?",
        "A: That is the issue I am talking about. And it was really one Jewish boy that was in our class\nafter the war, in Berlin, that brought that magazine to school and showed it to us.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And so you s \u2014 how \u2014 you said you sensed some prejudice on the part of the German\nchildren. How \u2014 an-an-and can you give an example?",
        "A: They were not friendly to us aft \u2014 they know \u2014 knew we were Jewish. They could \u2014 they\ncould see me go in front of a line to buy a loaf of bread, and they resented that. The adults, they\ndidn\u2019t say a word, but th-the kids resented that. Of course, they probably didn\u2019t understand why\nwe had those privileges. But I-I di \u2014 definitely saw resentment.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Wat \u2014 was there any more overt anti-Semitism? Any spitting, like you said before?",
        "A: Not that I notice it. Not that I notice. I have notice anti-Semitism, especially in Munich in the\nlast five years.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll get to that. So you stayed, and you said Werner Nathan made arrangements with the\nAmerican Joint Distribution \u2014 Jewish Distribution Committee. And so can you \u2014 let\u2019s just talk\nabout th-those arrangements.",
        "A: Okay. Werner \u2014 we again explained to Werner \u2014 fortunately he was fluent in German, as he\ncame from Austria \u2014 that our father was an American citizen, died in Auschwitz and we want to\ncome \u2014 go to America. And again he did, on his own, he contacted the Joint Distribution\nCommittee in New York, and a-again, I don\u2019t remember how long it took, but I know in the\nmeantime we went to Luneburg where we went to a recuperation camp sponsored by the British\nmilitary, who put us back into health. And it was an American soldier \u2014 in fact, I think it was that\nLieutenant Nowalski(ph) that picked us up from Luneburg, took us back to Berlin and it was \u2014\nagain, that must have been in late August, because September seventh we left Bremerhaven on\nthe SS Marine Marlin, that was the ship, and went to New York. And besides \u2014 just recently I\nmet an old man in Seattle, who was a seaman on the sister ship of the SS Marine Marlin, who\nalso brought Jewish immigrants to the U.S. And usually people don\u2019t know anything about,\nnever heard of a SS Marine Marlin, and he knew right away, he said that that was his \u2014 the \u2014 his\nsister ship. So it\u2019s quite a small world.",
        "Q: What were your feelings about leaving Germany? You said that you felt partly German.",
        "A: I felt more \u2014 I was German and I acted like a German during the war, living under false or\nassumed names. But the day we walked onto the ship, it was the greatest feeling you can\nimagine. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you bring anything special with you from Germany?",
        "A: No, we did not. We didn\u2019t want anything. Like when the Russians came into Berlin we \u2014 my\nbrother and I each picked up some very expensive Leica cameras from photography stores.\nEverybody else took it, so we took some of this belongings. They took our belongings, the\nGerman. But we did not want anything German. We did not bring anything back that was\nGerman. We \u2014 on the ship, we made a few dollars on the ship. Well, I did, my brother got too\nseasick. He was sick most of the way across. For some reason I did not get seasick. And pe \u2014\nother refugees that were on the ship wanted to buy shaving cream or things that was in the \u2014 that\nyou could purchase on the ship. And they didn\u2019t want to stay in line and so I used to stay in line\nfor \u2014 for them and buy what they wanted. In fact here\u2019s a \u2014 I still remember this one gentleman\nwanted chewing gum. And I purchased and I took the German pronunciation for ch-chewing\ngum, which would be shaving gum, and instead of getting chewing gum for him, I ended up with\na tube of shaving cream. I still remember that. And I ended up \u2014 I have finally ended up selling it\nto somebody else, because he wanted chewing gum, not shaving cream.",
        "Q: Were there \u2014 was it all refugees on the boat?",
        "A: I would say 99 percent were refugees, and again those were people either that were \u2014 survived\nat a concentration camp or lived in hiding someplace, somewhere so \u2014 somewhere.",
        "Q: And again, did you talk to each other about what you had gone through?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t believe \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to, my brother didn\u2019t want to and I don\u2019t think anyone\naboard wanted to talk about what they went through. It\u2019s \u2014 yes, they wanted to get that out of\ntheir mind.",
        "Q: And how long did the voyage take?",
        "A: It took 10 days. We left September seventh, we arrived \u2014 when I saw the Statue of Liberty in\nNew York, that was September 17\". Greatest sight you can see.",
        "Q: And what was it like to put your foot down on American soil?",
        "A: Oh, it was great. Something that we thought we would never see. And there were quite a few\nkids like us, orphan kids on that ship, again, also sponsored by the Joint Distribution Committee,\nmost of them had no parents. And they were like we were, maybe some of them thought they had\na relative there, but again didn't know. And again, it was representatives from the Joint that\npicked us up and took us to 441 Caldwell Avenue, Brooklyn \u2014 I mean, Bronx, New York. And of\ncourse we were fed and treated wonderfully. And the next day we were interviewed by German\nspeaking people, and \u2014",
        "Q: Wa-Was this a family that you went to on \u2014 1n the Bronx?",
        "A: No, it was a\u2014 I really would say like an orphan home. It was for children, and we were in\nthere and they had beds, several beds in a room. And they, of course, separated the boys and the\ngirls.",
        "Q: And then after your interview, what happened?",
        "A: And then, of course, we told them that we had two uncles someplace in the U.S. And they\nsaid well, were they from Germany? And we said yes, they were originally from Breslau, now\nber \u2014 Poland. And they said, well there is a newspaper that has a nationwide publication plus\nCanada. Of course, we didn\u2019t know Canada was a neighbor of the U.S. at the time. But they said\nthey will put an ad in the \u201cAufbau\u201d and see if our uncles \u2014 at that time we still thought they were\nuncles \u2014 if our uncles by any chance were to read that newspaper, as most German speaking Jews\nwere subscribers to that newspaper. Well, our uncles did not read it, but very good friends of\ntheirs in Saint Louis, Missouri read that ad. And there were pages and pages and pages of kids or\nadults looking for people and most of them \u2014 it was arranged alphabetically, I believe, the ads,\nand these friends of my uncles, which turned out to be cousins, read that and called them. They\nwere in Saint Louis, and my cousins \u2014 we\u2019|I call them my true things, my cousins from my\nfather\u2019s side, were called up and said there are two kids, just came from Berlin and they are\nlooking for Alfred and Felix tau \u2014 Taucher. And of course that\u2019s when we learned they were\ncousins. And my cousins were both brothers and they had just, actually not that long ago had\ncome to the U.S., because one cousin lived in Shanghai during the war, while the other one lived\nin South America. But apparently they had kept in touch all through the war and they ended up\nin Joplin, Missouri. How they ended up in Joplin, I have no idea. But Joplin is a small\ncommunity of about 35,000 people, and that\u2019s where they ended up. And since they were in\nJoplin when we were found, but they were single people, there was no woman in the house, the\nsocial welfare agency, Jewish social fe \u2014 agency wouldn\u2019t let us live there and so we went to live\nwith foster parents in Kansas City, Missouri. A family by the name of Levinson, and he was a\nvery Orthodox rabbi and of course very kosher and we lived with them for probably four or five\nmonths. But we had really problems living together, because we were not raised Orthodox. And\nso then we were moved into \u2014 in to another family.",
        "Q: Did you go to school th-then?",
        "A: Yes, we started th \u2014 both of us started in the eight grade. Now remember, my brother went\nthrough the third grade, I went the second grade of school in Germany. Even after the war, the\nshort time we went to the German school then was still only the second grade, didn\u2019t know\nEnglish. But we went to school in Kansas City, Missouri for two years, and they assigned a\nteacher to us who knew a little bit of German, not very much. She was Jewish, Mrs. Weinberg,\nand she worked as \u2014 worked with us \u2014 tutored us to learn English. And what my brother and I did\nafter we started school, we took a German English dictionary and just studied it page by page,\nword for word. And after awhile it got so that we used words that the English teachers didn\u2019t\nunderstand, or we used it in the wrong context. And my brother then \u2014 this was in the ninth\ngrade, I believe, I had a different English teacher than my brother did and my English teacher,\nshe says \u2014 a Miss Ulrichi, she says, Fred, you have to buy some comic books and start reading\ncomic books. I don\u2019t care what comic books you read, but buy comic books and you will have\nthe \u2014 a much \u2014 maybe not the best grammar in the world, but you will get English that is being\nused every day. And I will say it really helped. Reading the comics, I had a \u2014 seeing the pictures\nand getting most of it out, I probably learned more English from that than anything.",
        "Q: And what about your name? You were then \u2014 by then Fred? Was that your decision?",
        "A: Oh, ba \u2014 my \u2014 my cousin who we lived with then, after Kansas City when we moved to Joplin\n\u2014 oh, I should say that. We went to school in Kansas City for two years, and then my \u2014 in the\nmeantime my cousin brought in one of their aunts who was in Israel, at that time I believe still\nknown as Palestine. Well, it was \u201948 when Palestine was \u2014 became an independent state. And\nthey brought her there to Joplin from Israel and then we were permitted to live with them, and\nwe went to the 10\", 11\" and 12\" grade in Joplin, Missouri.",
        "Q: And you s \u2014 and \u2014 and when did you change your name?",
        "A: We changed our name when we \u2014 we became citizen. Actually, I did not change my name\nfrom Horst Alfred until after I got out of the army. Maybe we should go back to that later. I\nfinished high school, my brother finished high school.",
        "Q: Did the \u2014 did the Missouri children accept you? Did you feel like an outside in the high\nschool?",
        "A: Not at all. We \u2014 in fact, we were asked to speak at assemblies about our \u2014 some of our lives in\nGermany and Berlin during the war. And didn\u2019t really want to talk about \u2014 we didn\u2019t talk to a lot\nof the detail because we were ashamed to talk about it. For instance, I didn\u2019t want to talk, in fact\nI didn\u2019t tell anybody I was in a concentration camp or in a train, I was too ashamed of it,\nespecially how I was caught. I mean, no 12 year old kid wants to talk about why they were\ncaught. And we didn\u2019t say that we were in a concentration camp, but we just talked what it was\nlife, the bombing and how it was life, living in fear, trying not to get caught. And that\u2019s really\nmost of the things that we talked about to other kids. But we were very well accepted by the kids.\nWe made a lot of friends. In fact, both my brother and I go to reunion. In fact we have, in\nSeptember, we have the 50\" year reunion coming up in Joplin, which I plan to attend and so does\nmy brother. And we\u2019ve made a lot of friends there.",
        "Q: Did you take part in school activities and sports?",
        "A: Very much so. Not in sports so much, but I actually was in ROTC, Reserved Officer\u2019s\nTraining. And we had rifle teams, we had drill teams a \u2014 which I participated. I also belonged to\na \u2014 to various clubs, like the Key Club, which is the forerunners, I think to the Kiwanis, and I\nwas very active. My brother was not too active, my brother \u2014 actually, my a\u2014 one of our cousins\nwho we lived with was a pianist and he also taught piano, and my brother always wanted to learn\nthe piano. So while I was involved in a lot of school activity, my brother practiced and played the\npiano, but he, which I was not, got to really enjoy playing baseball, and learned \u2014 and became a\nvery good baseball player. And he belonged to a baseball team, a high school baseball team and\nso forth. And that\u2019s where his activity was, while mine was in drill teams and rifle teams and\nKiwanis clubs and so forth. In fact, I even learned how to be a speaker. And this is why I do a lot\nof speaking engagements now and it doesn\u2019t bother me to be \u2014 be speak in front of public, or\neven on TV, where I\u2019ve taught many, many times.",
        "Q: Did you feel very American at that point?",
        "A: Yes, I did. I felt \u2014 after I got pretty proficient in English, in fact when I went in the U.S.\nArmy, five years after coming here, nobody believed me that I was a \u2014 originally from Germany,\nI spoke English like an American, rather than a foreigner. Through the years I started speaking\nGerman again, also learned Japanese and I speak both languages. And so I \u2014 it seems like I\u2019ve\nreacquired an accent.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: \u2014 volunteer collection interview with Fred Taucher. This is tape number three, side B and you\nwere talking about how you kept up \u2014 you were \u2014 you have an aptitude for languages. So then\nyou graduated from high school, and what happened?",
        "A: Graduated from high school in 1951 and then I applied to go to the University of Missouri\nlaw school, since I had two uncles from my mother\u2019s side that were lawyers. We also had uncles\nthat were dentists, mostly from our mother\u2019s side. In fact, I know of one uncle who was in\nShanghai during the war, and I met somebody in Seattle who \u2014 whose dentist was my uncle in\nShanghai. But anyhow \u2014",
        "Q: You \u2014 bu-but you were \u2014 what about undergraduate at college? What do you mean you\napplied to law \u2014 you wanted to apply to law school?",
        "A: I applied after I got out of high school, I applied to go to the University of Missouri and then\neventually go into law school, right? Well, when I took the entrance examination for the\nUniversity of Missouri, apparently my score on the English part of the test was above average.\nAnd I was told that I cheated because the results of the test score was much higher than it\npossibly could have been with the lack of education I have had and the short time that I have\nbeen in the U.S. I did ask to take the test over again, but back in 1951 that was not done. At \u2014\ntimes have changed today. But so \u2014 since I could not go to the University of Missouri, I didn\u2019t\nreally know what I wanted to study then, because my goal was to be a lawyer, just like my\nparents wanted me to be a lawyer, my brother to be a dentist. And so I was 18 and a half years\nold, or almost. They were just starting to draft 18 and a half year olds, so I decided to join the\narmy and get that out of my \u2014 out of my life here. And so I joined the army.",
        "Q: And this was during the Korean war?",
        "A: That was ko \u2014 during the Korean war. And after I took my basic training in Fort Leonard\nWood, Missouri, I was assigned to a replacement company there as a company clerk. And then\none of the generals who was reassigned from Fort Leonard Wood, who was reassigned to\nGermany, wanted a native speaking German to be his driver in Germany. So I was picked to be\nthe driver for this general, since I was a native speaking German. But I, at that time I was not\nprepared to go back to Germany, and since I was still a citizen of the u \u2014 of Germany, I did not\nhave to go.",
        "Q: All right, you were not a citizen yet of the United States?",
        "A: I was still a non-citizen. Now, I did take \u2014 this was kind of odd \u2014 I did take the examination\nfor citizenship in Rolla, Missouri, a small city near Fort Leonard Wood. In fact this was a college\ntown, I think it was a \u2014 still is a very well known engineering school. And this is where, in that\ncity, I took my exam for citizenship. In fact, one of the questions that I was asked by the\nexaminer \u2014 and I was in U.S. Army uniform, I was a corporal at the time \u2014 and this examiner,\none of the questions asked, if I were called to serve in the U.S. military in time of war, would I\ndo that? And I looked at him, I said, well... And he says yes, I \u2014 I\u2019m sorry that I have to ask that,\nbut that \u2014 that is the rule, and I realize you are in the military. It k-kind of struck me odd. And\nanyhow, I took my citizenship examination, which I passed. Of course, it was everything I had\nlearned in high school, in government and so forth. Was a \u2014 to me \u2014 for me it was a very simple\nexam. And it was really about \u2014 shortly wi \u2014 thereafter, when I had the orders to go to Germany,\nbut then I looked up the Jewish chaplain in Forth Leonard Wood, and I told him a little bit of my\nstory, and of course he got my a \u2014 says no, I don\u2019t have to go and they canceled my order to\nGermany. But abou \u2014",
        "Q: Why did you not want to go to Germany\u201d?",
        "A: I-I still had too many bad memories in Germany. And the feeling there, I just was not\nprepared. And I also \u2014 besides that, I didn\u2019t want to be a driver for a general. I wanted to learn\nsomething while I was in the military rather than drive a car around and be what I considered a\nnursemaid. And so my orders three days later were for Korea. And I had a two weeks leave, went\nback to Joplin, visited my friends and said the goodbyes and everything. And I went to Fort\nLewis, Washington, which is about a fr \u2014 one hour drive out of Seattle. And I kind of fell in love\nwith that part of the country and I said to myself, if I make it back alive from Korea, this is going\nto be home. And I went to Korea and that was 1952.",
        "Q: How did you feel putting on an American army uniform?",
        "A: Proud. I was very proud to be wearing the army uniform. And I think this is why I made, even\nthrough the enlisted rating, I made rank much faster than ma \u2014 the average American citizen\ncounterpart. While these people complained about the military and they didn\u2019t want to work, I\ndid my duty and I was proud of it. And I believe this is why in Korea, even though there were\nsergeants that were 15 years in the army, I passed them up and received the rank of warrant\nofficer appointment, when others way ahead of me should have received it. It was probably a\nresponsibility I had at my age that I shouldn\u2019t have had. I was only 20 years old when I became a\nwarrant officer. 21 years old, I guess. But I always felt proud to be an American soldier.",
        "Q: What were your duties in Korea?",
        "A: In Korea I \u2014 my fir \u2014 my first duties were to code reports that came from the front lines, and\npick out the soldiers that were killed in action, wounded in action, missing, and I also had the\nlocator; an assignment I wasn\u2019t supposed to have had as I was not a U.S. citizen, but I had that\nassignment. And then I got \u2014 those papers I got ready to be put into, which now are computers, in\nthose times they were machine accounting, we programmed them with \u2014 through plugboard\nwires and punch cards. And the man that was really in charge and doing the actual operating of\nthe equipment was a warrant officer. Well, he was killed driving over a mine and \u2014 which I\ndidn\u2019t know, but he \u2014 he was late in bringing the reports in, which I had to code, for him to\nprocess through. But instead of him coming in, the \u2014 a colonel came in and stuck a couple of\nwarrant officers\u2019 bars on my shoulder, tore off my sergeant stripes and says, you have just been\nappointed to a warrant officer, you are going to be \u2014 replace Mr. Eberhart(ph) \u2014 a warrant officer\nis addressed as mister \u2014 who was killed in action, and we will have a replacement for you\nshortly. After my replacement came in, they assigned another warrant officer to that unit and sent\nme to Japan for three weeks, where I learned how to operate those machines. And after three\nweeks I went back to Korea and continued the duties as a warrant officer.",
        "Q: Did you ever \u2014 when you were in Korea, did you ever see any bodies?",
        "A: I see \u2014 saw a lot of bodies.",
        "Q: And did that remind you of your experience during the war, being in the railroad car and\nduring the bombing of Berlin, seeing bodies?",
        "A: No, it did not. It did not remind me at all. Is \u2014 was sad, seeing American soldiers dead, but it\ndi \u2014 it was not even close to reminding me what it was like in the railroad car, because first of all,\nin the railroad car it was dark and you \u2014 most of the time you couldn\u2019t see the bodies, you\ncouldn\u2019t see the faces. And even if you could, you didn\u2019t want to. And you just saw people that\nwere dead and I never related that. I felt sorrow for the poor American soldiers that were killed.\nAnd again, it\u2019s just like I felt that way ever since a child in \u2014 during my life in Germany, that\nwhen my time is up I\u2019m going to go, and if not, P\u2019Il keep on going and living.",
        "Q: And how long did you stay in Korea?",
        "A: Until the very tail end of the war, which I believe was September or October of 53, I\u2019m not\nquite sure. And after Korea I was transferred to Tokyo, where I was stationed for nine months.\nAnd actually \u2014 well, not at the time, I \u2014 I took up the martial arts over there, I took both judo and\nkarate. And my instructor introduced me to his sister, who was Japanese, of course. And \u2014 and I\nfell in love and applied to get married. But as an officer \u2014 at that time an officer could not marry\noutside the race unless you go back to an enlisted rating. So I was due to be discharged then, so I\nwent back to the States, took my discharge and then went back to Japan to get married. We were\nmarried in excess of 40 years but we are divorced now, but we\u2019re still friends.",
        "Q: So you got married in Japan and then brought your bride to the United States?",
        "A: Yes, I did. Yes, I was married by the American consul in Tokyo. And \u2014 oh, one thing I should\nmention. While I was heading to Korea, the army sent my immigration records and citizenship\nrecords \u2014 that\u2019s to be a citizen, to Germany, where my assignment was supposed to \u2014 where the\nfirst orders for it \u2014 for Germany. By the time everything got caught up I was going back to the\nStates to be discharged. So I \u2014 when I got \u2014 before I got discharged again, being a warrant\nofficer, an officer had to be a citizen before they can get discharged from the military. So I had to\ntake a 10 day leave of absence, which I wanted to get paid for and the army arranged a special\ncitizenship exam for me in Rolla, Missouri, where all my records were still, where I was taking\nmy \u2014 took my examination. And they had a special hearing for me to sworn in as a citizen. Then\nI had to go back \u2014 I was at that time stationed at Fort Carlson, Colorado, and I had to go back to\nFort Carlson, get my discharge.",
        "Q: And to be a udis \u2014 U.S. citizen?",
        "A: And then to be au\u2014a U.S. citizen, the greatest feeling that could ha \u2014 happen to \u2014 could have\nhappened to me. And again, I was proud that I could serve in the U.S. Army, and even more\nproud then, to be a citizen.",
        "Q: And then you came \u2014 and then you came back and \u2014 when you got discharged, and went to\nschool?",
        "A: No, I did not. I did not go to school. My \u2014 then my goal was to go back to Japan to get\nmarried.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I got a job \u2014 at that time, U.S. military people stoo \u2014 air force, navy, I\u2014 I should say air\nforce, Marines and army were still going overseas to Korea, even though it was after the war, to\nKorea or Japan on ships. And I took a job a\u2014 on the military sea transportation service, that\u2019s a\ncivilian group. We were taking troops overseas and bringing them back. And I took a job on one\nof those ships and got good pay and went back to Japan to get married. And came back after my\nmarriage and took a job in \u2014 again I\u2019Il call it computers, in the \u2014 doing the same thing except \u2014 e-\nexcept I wasn\u2019t te \u2014 keeping track of casualties, my first job was working for an insurance\ncompany where I operated the machine accounting.",
        "Q: Now, did you go back to Missouri or did you go to Seattle?",
        "A: I went to Seattle. I went back to Missouri, visit my cousins and took some of the belongings I\nhad there and went back to Seattle.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re with your young bride?",
        "A: No, no, she came \u2014 she didn't come o-over until about six or seven months later. Since I was a\nnaturalized citizen, and a new naturalized citizen, it took me quite some time to get a passport for\nher. And since I was in Seattle, Washington, all my \u2014 again, my immigration and naturalization\npaper were in Missouri, I had to apply for her visa through Missouri, and it was a \u2014 quite a\nlengthy operation.",
        "Q: And then she came and what \u2014 then what happened?",
        "A: Okay, she came over here and about a year later we had our first son. And six years later we\nhad a daughter.",
        "Q: And your w-work career?",
        "A: I worked then \u2014 at that time I worked for a trucking company, again in machine accounting,\nand in 1960 I set up a com \u2014 this is when the first part of the computers came around\n[indecipherable] programming computers, and I took the second programming course in Seattle,\nback in 1959, learning how to program those new, beautiful computers, IBM computers, which\nwere then the 1401. And took a job with a division of Boise Cascade Corporation, and I set up\nthe very first computer installation for Greystone Concrete Products. Like I say, that was a\ndivision from Boise Cascade, it was \u2014 they made concrete blocks and pipe, cement products. And\nI se \u2014 they had 11 different locations and I set up the computer department in all 11 locations,\nand then became, besides being the \u2014 what was called the data processing manager, I also was\nmade the assistant controller. And I put in many, many hours and in 1963, a \u2014 this Greystone\ndivision, some of the managers bought the division from Boise Cascade, and I was supposed to\nhave been included as one of the owners but they cut me out, strictly the controller of that\ncompany, who was als \u2014 see \u2014 embezzling from the company. And of course, being the \u2014 in the\naccounting department, which was part of the data processing, I knew what was going on. And\nhe cut me out as being a owner of the company. So in 1963, I resigned my position and started\nmy own business, and \u2014 which 1s \u2014 I still have that business. Today, my company, the second\noldest privately owned computer company in Seattle. I have pretty much turned the business\nover to my son. I am still active in the financial area of the company.",
        "Q: Speaking of your son and your daughter, when you were raising them, did you tell them about\nwhat you went through?",
        "A: Ver \u2014 not too much. My son was never too much interested 1n it. My daughter was very much\ninterested. And when my daughter went to the University of Washington, she decided she\nwanted to join a sorority. And I never pushed it or anything, she decided she wanted to join the\nAEPhi, which was a Jewish sorority. And she has taken a lot more interest in what we went\nthrough, and even now she is very much interested. I think she belongs to some kind of a Jewish\nfriendship club here in Washington, D.C., where she is living.",
        "Q: Did you r-raise your children Jewishly?",
        "A: No, I did not, as a \u2014 neither m \u2014 none of my family were that Jewish and we \u2014 well, I do\nconsider myself Jewish, but I am not a religious person. And of course my wife, being Japanese\nwas not Jewish and 1s also not religious, that we let our kids do their own. And my daughter\nleans very much towards the Jewish religion, rather than anything else.",
        "Q: Are your children bilingual?",
        "A: My son is not. He never picked up the other language, even though at home we spoke\nJapanese. My son can understand Japanese, not everything. He can understand his mother, but\nother Japanese he can\u2019t really understand. But my daughter is very much bilingual. In high\nschool she studied German and could communicate very well in German. And in Japanese, her\nJapanese now 1s much better than my Japanese. She \u2014 most of her clients \u2014 she works as a\nconsultant for a company and all of her clients, not most \u2014 most of her c \u2014 yes, most of her\nclients are Japanese. She does have one client in London and I think she has two different clients\nin Spain, where she has visited. But most of her clients are in Japan, and of course, she speaks it.\nAnd the strange thing is, to Japanese, my daughter does not look Japanese, she looks more\nAmerican, more Caucasian. And when she speaks Japanese to the Japanese, they are just\nflabbergasted because she does not speak like a foreign, like an American Japanese, she speaks\nlike a native Japanese.",
        "Q: Are there any sights or sounds today, or smells that remind you of your wartime experience,\nthat kind of triggers a memory?",
        "A: Well, a good experience is in Seattle just about three weeks ago. Again, like I say, I\u2019m still in\nthe computer business today. One of the things we do is we host websites. The \u2014 we have a\nelection coming up very shortly in Seattle, one of them is for mayor. A man that\u2019s running for\nmayor is presently the city attorney, who happens to be Jewish, and we are hosting his website.\nAnd his website is Sidran for Seattle mayor dot org, dot com, we\u2019ve used all of them. Well\nsomebody who doesn\u2019t like him put up another website and called it Mark Sidran dot com,\nwhich is this \u2014 this attorney who 1s running for, his first name. Well, his website is only Sidran\nfor Seattle mayor because Mark Sidran was already taken. Well, that website has a huge\nswastika, and compares Mark Sidran as a \u2014 a Nazi, as an SS. And it\u2019s somebody that is upset\nwith him. And that \u2014 seeing that swastika bothers me more now than it did when I saw it every\nday and lived with it in Germany during the regime. Another time \u2014 and I refuse to go back to\nMunich, Germany \u2014 I \u2014 a few years ago I had a client in Munich and we were doing big business,\nreally, with each other. And finally \u2014 and we always talked over the phone, always in English.\nThis was, of course, back quite some time, before email really, where we sent faxes. We sent\nfaxes back and forth, always in English. And in 1979 I visited him in person. And we had a\nappointment at 15 minutes before 12 at his place. I got there at 15 minutes before 12, told his\nreceptionist who I was, and she said yes, I\u2019ll let Mr. \u2014 I forgot his name now \u2014 I\u2019 Il let him know.\nAnd so I waited, and then I asked the receptionist, in English, she spoke pretty good English, I\nspoke no German at the time. And ask him well, does he have somebody with him, is he busy?\nShe says no, but he must be busy, but he\u2019Il be out. And at exactly 12 o\u2019clock \u2014 and at exactly 12\no\u2019clock he comes out and he starts speaking German to me. Herr Taucher, and used the German\npronunciation and didn\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry or anything. And I spoke in English. And he didn\u2019t even\nknow I spoke engli \u2014 German. We never before spoke German, it was strictly a business\nrelationship in English. He spoke very good English when we talked over the phone. His\ncommunication in English and on faxes was excellent. And I said, don\u2019t you s-speak English?\nYou know, we\u2019ve been communicating \u2014 yes, bu \u2014 and in German he answers, but you are in\nGermany, you have to speak German. So I finally said, okay, I'll play your silly game. In\nGerman. Of course, that startled him. And the next thing he says, oh it\u2019s 12 o\u2019clock, I have to go\nlunch. Well, thanks for stopping in. I said goodbye, and I have never communicated with this\nguy. And we gave him on an average of 70 to 80,000 dollars, U.S. dollars, a month in business.\nAnd we gave it to somebody else. And I have found other times in Munich, that is the mentality I\nfind in Munich. Anyplace else, and that includes eastern Germany, I have not found that. The\npeople say in eastern Germany you have a lot of anti-Semitism and so forth, I have not found\nthat myself in eastern Germany. In Munich, yes, I can see kids even, 17 \u2014 18 year old kids giving\nthe Hitler youth \u2014 I-I mean, the Hitler salute. That is completely illegal and in Berlin, in east\nGermany that\u2019s not permitted and they get arrested. In Munich the police turns around. And I see\nthe Nazi mentality all over again in Munich, and I refuse to go back to Munich.",
        "Q: What does that do to you?",
        "A: It \u20141it hurts me, it bothers me. And again, if I were younger, I would probably get myself in\ntrouble. But I \u2014 I will say my training in judo and karate does teach you discipline, and you don\u2019t\nstart a fight. But I-I am afraid in my younger days, I could have lost myself. It does bother me.",
        "Q: Do you think about your experien \u2014 your wartime experiences now often, more often?",
        "A: Yeah. I do. What \u2014 when I really we \u2014 in fact, that\u2019s the first time in many, many years that I\nhave nightmares is when I took Patricia, who you met, with me to Berlin last year, and I took her\nto the SS headquarters, the old SS \u2014 SS headquarters. In fact, that was Himmler\u2019s headquarters,\nwhere they also had the torture chamber. And they had some records of me, and I was asked to\ngive a taped interview there. And the first thing, of course I asked, why do you want it for? What\ndo you want it? And this gentleman who I talked to, he was in his middle 30\u2019s, I'd say, he says,\nwell there\u2019s so much denial going on in Germany that we want to get interviews from people that\nhave been here, whether they were Jewish or not Jewish. There were a number of Germans that\nwere also arrested and tortured there, and we\u2019d like to interview every one of them, and then we\nare s-spreading those tapes through high schools throughout Germany. So, of course I agreed to\nthat interview and I had probably a 45 minute interview there, all in German, so that high school\nkids can fully understand it.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you before about that experience. How 1s it that you did not release any\ninformation when they were questioning you? You were so young.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s \u2014 I first knew that if I released information, my mother and my brother would also\nbe caught. I knew that first of all. Second, every time when I was ready to talk, they tortured me\nso much that I passed out. And when I came to again, again I passed out. I mean, there were\ntimes, I\u2019ve told you some of them, like pulling teeth, filling teeth without any medication. Other\ntimes I remember they had me jump in a bathtub full of ice cubes, full of ice, and then\nimmediately go out in very hot water, and \u2014 which, I passed out. And it \u2014 things like that. Some\nof it I\u2014 I don\u2019t even want to talk about it, it\u2019s just \u2014 but when I did visit that place with Patricia,\nthey make \u2014 made a memorial out of it now, maybe you\u2019re aware of that, I had nightmares for\nthe next two or three nights in the hotel. Yeah, they really brought back the memories like it\nhappened.",
        "Q: Are there any smells that \u2014 that stimulate mem \u2014 are any smells that stimulate you?",
        "A: Occasionally so-some things maybe \u2014 you smell something, maybe there was a dead animal\naround in a real hot climate. Yes, that \u2014 that does remind me, but I try to wipe it out of my mind.\nBut yes, occasionally that has reminded me, mostly of the train. And even \u2014 I'll say it, even\nsmelling dog feces, that reminds me of the train.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Fred Taucher. This is tape number four, side A, and we were talking about sounds\nand sights that \u2014 that trigger memory for you. Anything else that you wanted to include?",
        "A: No, that\u2019s really \u2014 I believe again the smell sometimes of dead animal or what I said earlier is\nprobably the only thing that \u2014 or when I see a swastika. Yeah, when I see a swastika, it\u2019s \u2014 it\nimmediately reminds me \u2014 it reminds me of Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse neun, or nine, the torture\nchamber, what I call. It does remind me. And another thing 1s, like I said, it does remind me right\nhere at the Holocaust Museum, when I am in front of that train, I cannot step foot. ve been\nreminded of this when I visited Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, and they have that train up there on\nthe stand. And that train that they have there looks just identical to the train that I was in. And I\ndid have some nightmare that night at the hotel in Jerusalem. The rest of it, I can go \u2014 another\nthing I cannot do, I have actually visited the camp in Dachau once, and really I didn\u2019t have too\nmany problems visiting it. It did give me an idea had I been out of the train what I \u2014 what it\nwould have been like. And I was able to visit that. When I visited Prague a year ago for the Child\nSurvivors of the Holocaust Conference in Prague, they had tours to Theresienstadt and also to\nAuschwitz. I could not go there. I decided not to go, because I lost a lot of my family in both of\nthose places. Was some first in Theresienstadt and then in Auschwitz. And I decided there\u2019s no\nway I could go inside Auschwitz. So I chose not to take that tour. And th \u2014 I think in Prague,\nbeing in Prague and going through the Jewish cemetery there, even though I had no relatives in\nPrague, but it sure brought back memories.",
        "Q: When you ju \u2014 got off of the train car in Dachau, did you see any part of the camp?",
        "A: Well, I jo \u2014 only \u2014 I\u2019m sorry \u2014 I only see the front, with a gate there, freiheit \u2014 Arbeit macht\nfreiheit. I did see some people walking, mostly Nazis. I do remember seeing two or three people\nwalking, I saw dead people. And of course some of them couldn\u2019t \u2014 no, I don\u2019t think the camp\nwas really bombed. I think the \u2014 the allies and both \u2014 the Russians did not bomb the camp. And\nof course at that time they flew very low. I mean, there were some times when I was still in the\ntrain I thought the airplanes were going to land on top of the train. I mean, you could hear how\nclose they were. And \u2014 but I saw \u2014 I can remember there were soldiers and I saw a few striped\njackets, which were prisoners, but that\u2019s about all I remem \u2014 remember of inside the camp. And I\nthink there were only a few privileged prisoners, I think, that could be close to the gate for some\nreason or another. But other than that I do not remember. But like I say again, I jumped off the\ntrain and then immediately followed all those Russian soldiers which was crossing the train\ngoing the other direction.",
        "Q: Would you be a different person today, do you think, if you hadn\u2019t had the childhood that you\ndid?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I think I probably wouldn\u2019t be as active in non-profit organizations that I am.\nBut I don\u2019t think so. In fact, this bother me now, I hear kids in trouble, kids taking dope and so\nforth, drugs. And I feel the media is excusing the kids because they have come from broken\nhomes or bad parents and so forth. I think it\u2019s still the child that wants it that way. I just cannot\nput all the blames on the parents. I think \u2014 I think the news media helps make the kids blame\ntheir parents. And they don\u2019t have to do what they are doing. I interviewed one time a former\nservice man for a job, and he started talking that he took dope when he was in Vietnam, but you\nknow how it is like in wartime? And I just had to take, and everybody else took dope. And I said\nlisten, I\u2019ve gone through a war too, in Korea, and not in Vietnam, but als \u2014 also si\u2014 was a\nprisoner in a concentration camp, and I never dreamed of taking dope. That\u2019s not an excuse and I\n\u2014I can\u2019t use you here in my company. And I didn\u2019t spend any more time. It a\u2014I just wouldn\u2019t\nbuy it. Yes, there are some kids that were abused by their parents or so \u2014 gran \u2014 or foster parents\nor what have you, but still some of it, it\u2019s up to the ki-kid. And I don\u2019t think I became a criminal.\nAnd \u2014 and people have asked me, well how come you have made something of yourself? And\nwhy do other kids get in trouble? I have no answer for it, but I do know that they don\u2019t have to\nbe it.",
        "Q: Do you seek out other survivors as friends and do you \u2014 if you meet one, do you feel a\nconnection?",
        "A: Yes, I definitely do. Yes, I do. I know what they\u2019ve gone through and they know what I\u2019ve\ngone through, yes. But a lot of survivors, again, they hold a \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a grudge, but\nthey don\u2019t want to forget it, they want to live with the past. And I say hey, you don\u2019t want to\nforget it, but don\u2019t live with the past. Live with what it is now. A good example is we talked\nabout \u2014 earlier about Liineburg, and this recuperation camp put on by the British. There is one\nlady, Dodie Jacobson, I believe her \u2014 is her name. She fo-found me in Prague, when we were in\nPrague and we were at a workshop where we talked about our experiences during the war. And\nnobody wanted to speak up, and so I was the first to speak, and I was telling my story in Berlin,\nand my brother and I survived, etcetera. And all of a sudden this one lady, Dodie, interrupted,\nand she says, were you in Luneburg? And I said yes, my brother and I were there. And she went\nhysterical, because she is one that was in Luneburg with us. And she was never in a\nconcentration camp, but lived in horrible condition in hiding. And today she has never gotten\nmarried, doesn\u2019t want to, can\u2019t get along with people. And again, she said it right at this\nworkshop, she \u2014 there is \u2014 she \u2014 it\u2019s still from her time in Germany. She doesn\u2019t really want to\nmake good friends with anybody very long. And again I say, Dodie, these are different times.\nYou gotta live with what\u2019s now. But she doesn\u2019t want to do it. And too many of the survivors\nlive that way, which I think is wrong.",
        "Q: Some say that they feel like two different people, one on the outside to the outside world, and\na different person on the inside. Do you feel like that too?",
        "A: Yeah, I do not feel that way, but I do \u2014 many of them that do feel that way, and I feel it\u2019s\nwrong. You have to \u2014 for instance, I do not hold any prejudice towards the younger generation\nGerman, except the ones that \u2014 those neo-Nazis. And s \u2014 but of course, we have them right here\nin the U.S. But the younger generation, the \u2014 the people 50 years old, even 60 years old and\nyounger, I really don\u2019t have any grudge against them. They couldn\u2019t do anything about it, they\nwere too young then. Most of them knew what was going on, but they didn\u2019t know how bad it\nwas and they couldn\u2019t do anything. The people older than me, 72 years old, let\u2019s say, and older,\nthey could have done something about it. And those I just \u2014 I can\u2019t be friends with them. I have a\ntough time talking to them. But you have to get over it. You don\u2019t have to be friends, but you\ncan\u2019t just hold a grudge against the younger generation that couldn\u2019t help it.",
        "Q: When you walk down the streets in Germany, I guess excluding Munich, do you feel\ncomfortable?",
        "A: Yes, I do. In fact, I can tell you another example that really surprised me. Two years ago\nwhen I was in Berlin, and as a \u2014 at the invitation of Berlin; they paid for my trip, they put me up\nat the Crown Plaza Hotel, that\u2019s a block off the Kurftirstendamm, one of the main thing of it, like\nTimes Square. And wh-while we were having dinner there was a big party going on in the main\nballroom. And I\u2019m a curious kind of a person and I looked in, and I see a lot of people with a\nyarmulke on. So I kind of walked in and I asked somebody there, he was about 19 years old, with\na yarmulke, and I spoke German with him and I said, what\u2019s going on here? He said, this is a Bar\nMitzvah. Do you know what a Bar Mitzvah is? I said yes, and I told him that I lived in Berlin all\nthrough the war. I didn\u2019t tell him I was in a concentration camp, I said I am an American now,\nbut I am Jewish. And I asked him, how does it feel for a Jewish person like you, especially your\nage, living here in Berlin? And he looked at me kind of strange, he says, I am a German, he said.\nI am a German, I am a \u2014 Jewish is my religion. And that\u2019s how some of the Jewish community\nthinks today as a \u2014 that generation, the 19 years and younger generation. They consider\nthemselves German and Jewish. Of course, Jewish is a religion and j \u2014 they should consider\nthemselves as such. But that they just come right out and say, I\u2019m German, Jewish is my\nreligion. It really \u2014 1t almost shocked me.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?",
        "A: What my thoughts were, hang him. Just don\u2019t waste the time. Everybody know \u2014 the world\nknows he was as guilty as could be. And sometimes \u2014 I don\u2019t believe in capital punishment, I\nguess, but Eichmann or any of those, definitely. Don\u2019t waste the time and money to keep them\nalive. That\u2019s how I felt.",
        "Q: What are your attitudes towards food?",
        "A: To \u2014 towards food?",
        "Q: Towards food. You \u2014 you went through times of terrible hunger.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did it affect your attitude today?",
        "A: It affects my attitude towards food. First of all ve said to myself a long time ago, that was all\nthe lack of food I\u2019ve had and where I\u2019ve had to eat practically dirt, I ate food that we didn\u2019t know\nwas poisonous or not, like plants, I have said I\u2019m only going to eat food that I like. I\u2019m not going\nto do \u2014 eat food that I don\u2019t like. For instance, I never could get used to Oriental food, whether\nit\u2019s Chinese, Japanese, or what. Even though I was married to a Japanese for over 40 years, I\nrefused to eat Japanese food. I have customers in Japan, I do go to Japan. Every one of my\ncustomers know that I will not eat Japanese food and they take me to western foods. I\u2019m a very\nfussy eater and I just refuse to eat food that doesn\u2019t agree with me or I don\u2019t like. That\u2019s my\nattitude on food.",
        "Q: Do you feel very safe here?",
        "A: Yes, I do. I do. I don\u2019t care what area I am in, I do feel safe. I just \u2014 I\u2019ve never had a problem.\nYes, in my younger days I did need judo once when somebody tried to rob me, and I was able to\ndefend myself, keep my property. I did break this \u2014 I was going to say gentleman, he was not a\ngentleman \u2014 break his arm. And afterwards the police \u2014 tha-that was in Chicago and one of the\ndetectives from the Cook County police department called me in Seattle and asked me how much\nI weighed, how tall I was. And I could almost see a smile through this detective\u2019s face over the\nphone. What happened, the guy that tried to rob me was 180 pounds and six foot tall, and I broke\nhis arm, and his lawyer said I used unnecessary roughness. But I was a little younger at that time,\ntoo. But I do feel safe, but part of it is probably due to my training.",
        "Q: We talked about this before, and maybe just to revisit 1t again, talking about whether or not\nyou were angry that people your age in the United Sta \u2014 Jews in \u2014 your age in the United States\nwere safe, and yet your life was in danger and you had these terrible losses. Does that anger you\ntoday?",
        "A: No, it does not. I have absolutely no anger towards that. What does anger me a little bit, and\nthat is for instance, the ship the Saint Louis that was turned back to their death, so to speak. Even\nthe German skipper wanted to go someplace where he could \u2014 he could free the people, and that\nthe U.S. did not admit them, that angers me. And again, while a lot of people, especially Jewish\npeople \u2014 I know my cousins thought the world of Franklin Roosevelt. Well, I still blame him. He\ncould have stopped all of that. He could have saved millions of Jews. And so I\u2019m angry towards\nthat. But other than that, no, Iam not angry. But I\u2019m angry, again, for anyone that could have\nbeen saved by the U.S., and di \u2014 wasn\u2019t. In fact, my brother \u2014 my brother, my father, my family\nshould have been permitted to come to the U.S., without money. And again, I do not know, I was\ntoo young, I don\u2019t know if my father ever contacted the American consulate in Berlin, I do not\nknow. But I think even if he had, I don\u2019t think he could have gotten out, he didn\u2019t have the\nmoney. And that does anger me.",
        "Q: When your children were the ages that you were from let\u2019s say six to 12, you know \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 during those difficult times, did that make you think even more of the \u2014 of your experiences,\nwhen they were going through the same age di \u2014 that you were?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if I can say that, I don\u2019t think so. I, of course remember what has happened, I\nthink about it. I think about it right here in this building and of course this interview here. But\nother than that I try not to think about it. Of course I\u2019m talking about it more than I used to. I\nhave spoken to Rotaries, and like I say, ve spoken to the military. And it\u2019s much easier to talk\nabout it now than it used to be.",
        "Q: Wh-Why is that?",
        "A: Maybe time and age. And I have gotten used to talking about it and feel it is necessary that\nthe world still knows. I have found too many young people, educated people that know so little\nof what has happened. In fact, some of these people even believe what they read on the internet,\nthat it didn\u2019t happen. And that\u2019s when I started to talk about it more, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a lot\neasier to talk about it now. Even today as we were talking there were some times, I don\u2019t know if\nyou noticed, I was getting choked up a little bit. And that I can\u2019t help. But at one time I just could\nhardly talk, th \u2014 I had to take a break and couldn\u2019t talk about it. But now it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not like that\nany more.",
        "Q: Did your experience affect how you and your wife raised your children?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. My wife \u2014 my ex-wife was very good in raising the\nchildren, and part of it is the Japanese culture too. And I\u2019m very proud of both of my kids. And I\nhave to give her the credit for it because I was starting a business and spent not enough time with\nthe kids. And that\u2019s probably part of the fault why we ended up in a divorce that should have\nbeen much longer ago than it has. But I will \u2014 I definitely will give her the credit that our kids\nwere raised properly and never have gotten into trouble. And of course I\u2019m very proud of both of\nmy kids.",
        "Q: Do you feel a connection to Germany? Do you \u2014 do you feel German?",
        "A: Not at all, Iam an American, and I feel a very loyal American. If I were to be asked by the\nU.S. Army, or any U.S. military force, to serve in the military again due to some emergency, I\nwould not say no. I would be ready to do it and I know my brother would go do the same thing.\nI-I definitely feel my allegiance is to the U.S. and not to Germany. And of course, I also feel very\nstrongly about Israel, but I\u2019m still an American more than an Israelite.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what are your thoughts about Israel?",
        "A: What my thoughts is, I hope someday there will be peace there. I feel very good that finally\nthere is a country that Jews can live there, and hopefully again sometime in peace. I visited Israel\nfor my first time in 1998, when Israel was celebrating their 50 year independence. I represented\nthe mayor of Seattle. And I was \u2014 it was quite an experience to be in Israel. I enjoyed visiting it\nand I do hope to visit Israel again. I feel it is part of me, but still, my country is the U.S.A.",
        "Q: Were you active in the Civil Rights movement, or \u2014 ve \u2014 well, because you lived in a country\nwhere people\u2019s civil rights were denied?",
        "A: No, I was never active in the Civil Rights. Again, I was too young, and of course \u2014 well, I\ndon\u2019t know if you ever heard of The White Rose?",
        "Q: Yes [inaudible]",
        "A: Then you know I mean. These were Germans, and they were all executed. In fact, I think they\nwere first tortured at the same place I was at, and then hung at Plotzensee, which was the place\nwhere the \u2014 where the gallows were where they hung the Germans that didn\u2019t go along with the\nregime or helped Jews or so forth.",
        "Q: A-And what is the connection? We were talking about your activity in the Civil Rights mov \u2014",
        "A: Well, I was not \u2014 I was not active. I was just saying the people that were active did not live\nvery long.",
        "Q: No, no, no, I \u2014 that\u2019s not what I meant. I meant, were you active in the Civil Rights movement\nin the United States, because you had lived in a country that deprived others of civil rights. Did\nyou \u2014 was this something that you\u2019ve worked towards as an adult?",
        "A: As an adult, no, I was not active. I think \u2014 I think you\u2019re going back to the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s.\nFirst of all, in Seattle, we did not have the problems there that you have had in other parts of the\ncountry. For instance, we\u2019ve had Afro-American mayors in s \u2014 in \u2014 1n Seattle. Exec \u2014 the present\ncounty executive is a \u2014 1s a black man. And lately here we\u2019ve had a few more problems, but that\nis because we get these activists coming in, not even from Seattle, that demonstrate on \u2014 any\ntime there\u2019s something going on, starting when we had that WTO there. And these are people\nthat were \u2014 are actually being paid to demonstrate. And \u2014 but lately we ni \u2014 didna \u2014 we have not\nhad good leadership in Seattle. The mayor, even though \u2014 the present mayor, even though I\nsupported him, Paul Schell, is not very strong. The previous police chief, the present police chief\nis not very strong. And if anything I am an activist now to get those people out. And again I\u2019m\nvery much up within the city councilor, like I said earlier, I\u2019m sort of on the sister city council of\nSeattle and I know most of the politicians.",
        "Q: So you are active in the political life of your city?",
        "A: In the political life, yes, I am very active in the political life.",
        "Q: Why is that?",
        "A: Well, probably it goes back because about 30 years ago the former governor of the state of\nWashington, Albert D. Rosellini and I became good friends, strictly through my C.P.A. And my\nC.P.A. is a Sephardic Jew, also speaks Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, he speaks about seven\nlanguages. And the former governor is an American, but he is from Italian parents. In fact, a\nbook has been written on him. And my C.P.A., Victor Barkey(ph) introduced me to Governor\nRosellini, and they have been long, long friends, and they always speak Italian together. And\nover the years Governor Rosellini and I have become very close friends. And he is the man \u2014\nagain probably because I am in the computer business and I did mailings for candidates and so\nforth.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s not because you were aware of what can happen when a political system goes awry?",
        "A: No, definitely not, it is just that I helped in the political party and some of them \u2014 right now\nyes, I\u2019m very active to get Mark Sidran elected as mayor, because first of all, he is Jewish and he\ntries to eliminate demonstration that shouldn\u2019t be there. Again, people like \u2014 that put up that\nswastika, and he\u2019s definitely, of course, against that, and he is against, naturally, anti-Semitism.\nAnd lately we have seen a little bit of that in Seattle.",
        "Q: What does that do to you?",
        "A: It bothers me. And again, that\u2019s why I\u2019m very much in support of Mark Sidran for mayor.\nAnd hopefully he will have a police chief that can do the right thing.",
        "Q: When you see pictures of victims in Rwanda or the Sudan, what does that do to you?",
        "A: That bothers me, definitely.",
        "Q: Because of your childhood?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure it is, and again I say why does that happen? Again, I was all for the U.S. to help out\nwith troops over there. I didn't like the way it was taken out. And again, 1-it bothers me, is just\nlike the U.S. could have helped many million of Jews being saved. And why they aren\u2019t helping\nout further bothers me. I don\u2019t like what happened in Iraq. I think they \u2014 it was good for us to be\nin there, but why not get rid of the main cancer in Iraq, which is still over there. And those things\nbother me.",
        "Q: Do you think you are more sensitive to that than those of us who did not grow up in Europe?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure I am, I\u2019m sure I am. I know a lot of people, including Jews in Seattle that did not like\nus going into Rwanda or Iraq and so forth. They say why should we get involved? I said, the\nsame reason we should have been involved to save Jews. And some of them, like I say, even\nother Jewish people I know, were against that.",
        "Q: Do you speak publicly about your experiences?",
        "A: Yes, lately I have. I have spoken to two different rotary clubs in the Seattle area. I spoke to\nthe troops in Fort Lewis, mostly officers. In fact, had a long talk afterwards with the assistant\ncommanding general of Fort Lewis, a two star general. And yes, I do talk about it.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Again, like I say, it cannot be forgotten and the people, so many of the younger generation,\nare not learning enough in s-schools. And I\u2019m talking about even college students do not know\nenough about it, and they should know. And that\u2019s why it feels very important, people like me,\nsurvivors of the concentration camps, should speak publicly. And in Seattle now, we have the\nHolocaust Education Center, and they get the requests for speakers and I am signed up as a\nspeaker.",
        "Q: Do you \u2014 have you been to any conferences?",
        "A: Yes, I attended the Child Survivors of the Holocaust Conference in Prague, and was the\nchairman of that ho \u2014 Child Survivors Conference of the Holocaust in Seattle, that we had last\nSeptember. And the \u2014 prior to this I did not, as my ex didn\u2019t want me to go to any of that. But \u2014\nand now I plan to go, as long as I\u2019m healthy, I plan to go to every one. The next one is in\nHouston in October, and the following year itll be in Montreal. And right now I\u2019m not at liberty\nto say there\u2019s another city in another state that wants to have a conference. And they have asked\nme to help them organize it because they were in \u2014 the main organizers were in Seattle, and \u2014\nand again, that state has very few survivors, which of course Washington state has, and I put on,\nI feel, a fairly decent conference.",
        "Q: How is it that you got to be the one to put on the conference?",
        "A: Well, first of all, the people in Seattle know what I\u2019ve been very active. I serve on the United\nStates Olympic Committee, and we put on several fundraisers that I have headed. And\nincidentally, Governor Rosellini is the head of the U.S. Olympic Committee for Washington\nstate. I have also been involved in professional associations where I have put on conferences\nhere.

        "A: And anyhow, some of the people in Seattle, the survivors and so forth, knew that I had been\nvery active in different activities, putting on conferences and banquets and so forth. When I was\nin Prague, at the conference there, I was asked if Seattle could put th \u2014 on the conference, since\ninitially it was scheduled for Vancouver, B.C., about a two hour drive from Seattle. And if \u2014 they\ncancelled the Vancouver consom \u2014 conference, but still wanted it, and then asked if we could put\nit on in Seattle. And I said, if I can get the proper facilities, yes. And so I found the proper\nfacilities and then I got the survivors \u2014 child survivors of the Holocaust in Seattle, there were\nabout eight or nine of them. And I presented that, and with the exception of two people that\ndropped out, they asked me to be the chairman of it. And that\u2019s how it came about that I headed\nthat conference.",
        "Q: And obviously you feel a connection to these other child survivors.",
        "A: Oh, I certainly do. And we \u2014 we meet monthly. And we\u2019re just a small group, but we do meet\nmonthly and kind of talk about how we survived and what we can do.",
        "Q: Are you proud of yourself that you were able to make a life after such a difficult childhood?",
        "A: Yes, I am. I am very proud of what has happened, and some of it I blame my parents for it. I\nmean, they tre \u2014 they raised us \u2014 and I\u2019m saying rus \u2014 us, my brother and I, the proper way, even\nas young as we were. And I am proud of my accomplishments and I am proud of my brother\u2019s\naccomplishments. Be \u2014 being \u2014 going in as a private recruit in the army, no college education,\nworking up to a field grade officer, which a major 1s, he can be proud of himself, and I am proud\nof him.",
        "Q: Did he marry?",
        "A: Well, he actually has been \u2014 he\u2019s on the third marriage right now. And as you probably know,\na lot of survivors do have troubles staying married, but he now is married to a girl from s \u2014\noriginally from Scotland, and they\u2019ve been married now for about 22 years.",
        "Q: Does he have children?",
        "A: He has one daughter from his very first mar \u2014 marriage, which he never should have married,\nand then he has two boys from his second marriage. I think he is somewhat in contact with one\nof the boys. And he has two children, a boy and a girl from his present marriage.",
        "Q: Oh. Did you, when you c \u2014 came to this country, try to stay in touch with Frau Noelting?",
        "A: Yes, we did, we wri \u2014 have written to her, but e \u2014 I think she wrote back once, and it was a\nvery disturbing letter. She still \u2014 she was just as upset when we left Germany, and also wrote to\nus. First of all, she criticized the ge \u2014 the poor spelling and so forth, and grammar we used in\nGerman. Of course, we had a second and third grade education. So of course our writing skill\nwasn\u2019t very good in German. [sneeze] Bless you.",
        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: And she criticized that and she really criticized us going to the U.S. And I think we did\nanswer her, but we never heard anything from her. Now, my brother, when he was stationed as a\nmilitary soldier \u2014 in fact I think he was a lieutenant or a captain at that time in the army \u2014 excuse\nme \u2014 and he was stationed in Heidelberg, he did visit Trowta(ph) Noelting, the stepdaughter, and\nthey did get together. And I think they had a very good get together, and I think it was shortly\nafter Frau Noelting had passed away, and they talked about her. She \u2014 she was very old in age,\nand really didn\u2019t want to die, but she knew she was dying.",
        "Q: So your only contact with Frau Noelting was that one letter, and then her return \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s what I can remember, and I\u2019m pretty sure my brother will agree to that.",
        "Q: And then what was your connection with Werner Nathan?",
        "A: Again, I actually visited him with my ex-wife in New Jersey. And again, it must have been \u2014 I\nwas an officer in the Data Processing Management Association and we had a convention in New\nYork, that my ex went with me. And that must have been in \u201969 or \u201970 and we went to visit him,\nbut then I lost track. I n \u2014 lost track of him once when I went to Korea in the army, but then I\nfound his address again and actually was able to look him up. And he was doing very well, he\nhad a very successful ber \u2014 furniture business. We went to his house. In fact, he picked us up at\nthe airport, I think, in a new Cadillac at that time, I remember it. And he was very well off. But\nthen again we lost track. Again I was in the midst of building a business and spending too much\ntime in the business and didn\u2019t take time to write. And then I know I had written him again\nmaybe six months or a year later and the letter came back and no forwarding address. So \u2014 and\nthat\u2019s when we lost track. And he may be \u2014 may have moved out of Newark. But I have tried to\nlook it up on the internet, but unless they have a listed phone number, you can\u2019t find them.",
        "Q: Do you receive reparations?",
        "A: No. And this is again one of my reasons that I\u2019m going to Germany next month. It\u2019s one thing\n\u2014 first of all I play to reestablish my German citizenship. I have found out a lot of survivors,\nespecially in our new group here, have rees \u2014 established their citizenship and I know some\npeople are getting as much as 1100 dollars a month pension from the German government.",
        "Q: When you say your new group, what do you mean?",
        "A: The group that we have formed, each state has formed their own little group, a survivor\u2019s\ngroup and then we are combining it as the Holocaust Survivor Foundation, and all the various\nother groups. For instance, in Seattle we have formed the Survivors of the Holocaust Asset\nRecovery Project. And we are going to join as an affiliate. We\u2019re still separate corporations, but\nwe will be part of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation. And a number of these people, they are\nall elected officials from their own state, just like I am president of the Washington state group.\nAnd \u2014 and a lot of these people have reestablished their German citizenship because now in the\nU.S., dual citizenship is permitted. And by reestablishing the German citizenship, there is a\nchance to recev \u2014 receive a pension. And I\u2019m going to take every penny I can get out of the\nGerman government.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Well, they took too much away from my parents and from me, and I think I have a moral right\nto get some monies out of \u2014 I can live without it, I don\u2019t need the money, but I think morally it\u2019s\nright for me to get some money.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about Holocaust survivors today who are indigent or in \u2014 in dire\nstraights?",
        "A: Well, this is \u2014 I have a real problem with the \u2014 you have the Claims Conference, that has\nreceived billions of dollars. In fact, the U.S. government gave them four million dollars. And the\n\u2014 there are people, especially in Miami that are living out on the street and begging for food, that\nare concentration camp survivors and not receiving any money. We had, at our meeting two days\nago, we had Gideon Taylor, the \u2014 I guess the s \u2014 executive vice president from the Claims\nConference talking and say well, half of the survivors are living in Israel, and the Claims\nConference also has to look out for the people living in Israel. And we have built memorials.\nWell, we don\u2019t want memorials. We want money for the people that need it the most, and so we\nare trying to do something. And first of \u2014 also, the Claims Conference is made up of mostly self\nappointed people that are not Holocaust survivors. And it should be Holocaust survivors that do\nthe distribution of the funds. And that\u2019s what we are working on right now, even if \u2014 if it\u2019s\nnecessary, we will sue the Claims Conference. And they have to release some money because\nour people are dying. I have the 1999 tax return from the Claims Conference. Oh, I didn\u2019t bring\nit with me. I didn't bring it with me, but where they had, in the 1999 return, they had a profit, or\nincome of over 247 million dollars. And yet they don\u2019t have money to pay the people that need it\nthe most. That is not right. And Mr. Gideon Taylor, the executive director, in 1999 his salary was\n184,000 dollars, plus 35,000 dollars in benefits, I don\u2019t know what those benefits are, plus\nexpense money that we don\u2019t know how much. That shouldn\u2019t be. And we are, our group is\ntrying to do something about it, and that\u2019s why we met here in Washington last November, and\njust this week. So in fact, I think you said you were at the \u2014 at our meeting place.",
        "Q: Do you think the world has learned any lessons from the Holocaust?",
        "A: I\u2019m afraid not. I am hoping that they did, but did they really? Look what was going on in\nYugoslavia. Even going back to Cambodia, the killing fields in Cambodia. I don\u2019t think they\nhave learned, but I don\u2019t think anything has been as bad what it was through the \u2014 during the\nNazi regime.",
        "Q: Why do you say that?",
        "A: Well, were six million Jews \u2014 people tortured and murdered. Children put to death. Yes, there\nwere a lot of them, but I don\u2019t think that many. And forced in sof \u2014 put into forced labor until\nthey couldn\u2019t stand up any more and then murdered. I think when they were murdered, they were\nmurdered a little more quickly than what the Germans did. But a \u2014 a lesson learned? No, I\u2019m\nafraid not. And again, it will take countries like the U.S., Great Britain or other free countries to\nmake sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.",
        "Q: When we were walking in the museum, we saw these young high school students outside.\nWhat lesson would you like to pass on to those young people who were standing in line?",
        "A: When you see things like this happen, don\u2019t let it happen. If you are in military age and you\nget asked to serve in your military in \u2014 of your country, which appear to be American, U.S.,\nserve, and serve proudly. I feel very strongly again, about the Vietnam war. It was wrong, we all\nknow it was wrong. But for every American that refused to serve, somebody else went and died\nfor it. While Bill Clinton, I thought, forgetting some of his personal problems, as a president he\ndid a fairly good job. He was a real friend towards Israel and the Jews. But I never voted for him\nand never would vote for him, strictly because he said when he was 13 years old, I think, he said\nhe was going to be president of the U.S.A. someday. And somebody, with that being in mind,\navoiding the draft, going to a foreign country, and demonstrating against his own county \u2014\ncountry about the Vietnam war, does not deserve to be a president. And that\u2019s why I never voted\nfor that man. Like I said just earlier, every American man that refused to serve, somebody else\nwent and died for it. Look at me, I was in the U.S. for five years, getting out of hell, but I served\nmy country, and I was proud to serve. My brother served this country, and proud to serve, both\nof us as officers.",
        "Q: You said that you \u2014 earlier on that you lost your childhood, you weren't a little boy after\nawhile. Did you ever get that childhood back?",
        "A: No, no, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s gone forever. I will say that when my brother and I first came to the\nStates and lived in Kansas City, we for some reason started loving watching cowboy movies.\nWe'd go all over Kansas City, if there was a cowboy movie on like a Roy Roger, or Gene Autry,\nJohnny McBrown, I can still remember some of those names, we loved to watch those movies.\nAnd maybe that\u2019s maybe coming back a \u2014 a childhood where kids maybe at the age of 10 would\nlove that. We were 13 and 14 and we loved those movies.",
        "Q: Did you t-talk about your parents with your brother once you got to the United States? Is it\nstill a topic of conversation?",
        "A: Yes, at first we definitely did and we always for many years thereafter. We talked about it, we\nwondered where our mother was. And probably my brother more so than I, that I quit talking\nabout it. We talked about our mother and father and he would start crying. And for some reason I\n\u2014I would not \u2014 I\u2014 I mean, maybe mentally I was stronger than he was, I am not sure.",
        "Q: Is \u20141s it that he\u2019s more emotional that you?",
        "A: He \u2014 he is more \u2014",
        "Q: What \u2014 what do you attribute the difference in response to your childhood?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. Again, maybe \u2014 I was younger and my brother was a year older and I think\nmaybe he matured more \u2014 he was more mature in that respect than I was. A-Again, I can\u2019t really\ngive you a full answer. But I remember more. And yet, when it came to memory of our parents,\nmy brother was much more emotional than I was.",
        "Q: Did he have more awareness of the danger that you were in, or do you think it was equal, that\nyour awareness was the same as his?",
        "A: We were both aware equally, but my brother was more a-afraid, more scared, not only of\nbeing caught by the SS or the Nazis, but also he was scared, very scared of the bombing. That\nfrightened him, when he could hear the bombing, the artillery, the anti-aircraft. He was very,\nvery frightened.",
        "Q: Was it because of sound for \u2014 he was more sensitive to sound? You said he wanted to be a\npianist. Do you think maybe the sound was more harsher for him?",
        "A: You know, I never th \u2014 gave that a thought, but he is very musically inclined, and now is a\nvery excellent pianist, incidentally. And I never gave that a thought, but maybe that\u2019s what it 1s.\nHe \u2014 his sound 1s better. I mean, I tried to take a \u2014 violin lessons, but I\u2019m just not musically\ninclined. But a \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s it or not.",
        "Q: Was he as physically strong as \u2014 as you?",
        "A: Probably more so physically strong. Again, in sports, he was much better in sports than \u2014 than\nI was, especially in baseball. Too bad I bra \u2014 didn\u2019t bring it aga \u2014 along, I should ha \u2014 should\nmake a picture. In 1947, the \u201cKansas City Star\u201d had a picture of us both first coming to the U.S.,\nto Kansas City, and we were playing baseball. I think my brother was a batter and I was a\ncatcher.",
        "Q: What did baseball represent to you?",
        "A: America. And we learned how to play baseball very quickly. I was never very good at it and\nmy brother was. I was a better swimmer, I \u2014 than my brother was. I think in \u2014 in sports my\nbrother was much better than I was, except for swimming, which I could do better. I guess I am\nmore in a individual sport like swimming and martial arts and so forth, while my brother was\nmore in a team type of sports, like baseball.",
        "Q: What are your children\u2019s names?",
        "A: My son\u2019s name is Walter and my daughter\u2019s name is Audrey.",
        "Q: Are they named after anybody specifically?",
        "A: Walter was named after my uncle, who was a lawyer. No, I had two uncles by the name of\nWalter. One of them was a lawyer and one of them was a doctor \u2014 a \u2014 a dentist. And Audrey, her\nmiddle name we gave to \u2014 as Teresa, which was our mother\u2019s name. But actually, she thinks \u2014\nshe and her mother are very close, and she and I are very close and she doesn\u2019t hold our divorce\nagainst each other. She \u2014 she understands her mother, and \u2014 but she did change her middle name\nto Cavanno(ph), my mother\u2019s maiden name. I mean, my wife\u2019s maiden name.",
        "Q: Do you think that the \u2014 the interest in the Holocaust now is something that\u2019s permanent or just\na passing \u2014",
        "A: No, I think it\u2019s permanent. Yeah, I think it\u2019s very permanent and my daughter is very much\ninterested in it. When we had the conference in Seattle, the Child Survivors of the Holocaust, my\ndaughter went to Seattle to participate in it. Because \u2014 I was probably one of the first to include\nsecond generation, much to the disagreement of the previous people from the Child Survivors.\nBut I included quite a number of the second generation, I had seminars that both second\ngeneration and survivors could attend, because I found out some \u2014 a lot of the second generations\nwanted to be involved and hear from other survivors than just their parents. And so I did include\na number of activities the second generation, and my daughter did attend a lot of the sessions.",
        "Q: Is there anything you wanted to talk about that we haven\u2019t touched on?",
        "A: No, I think we have pretty much touched everything, and I have \u2014 really feel good being able\nto give my story. And I think we\u2019ve covered anything, unless you think of anything else you\nwanted to cover.",
        "Q: Do you feel that you\u2019ve lived a normal life after the war, once you got settled?",
        "A: Yes, I feel I lived a normal life. I am fortunate that I was able to build up a business with a\nvery minimum education. A lot of my education 1s self study. I\u2019ve led here lately a very\ncomfortable life. I will say back in the 60\u2019s when I started the business, it was not easy. It was\nworking 14 hours a day, seven days a week, sometimes not taking a paycheck but made sure all\nemployees got paid. But lately I\u2019ve lived a very comfortable life and I think I can live the rest of\nmy life comfortably. And again, like I say, I enjoy traveling and I do quite a bit of it, and I just\nhope my health will hold out. But until it holds out, \u2019'm going to enjoy life.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s a wonderful note to end on. Thank you very much for doing the interview.",
        "A: Sure, it\u2019s \u2014 really, I am glad I was able to talk about this.",

        "A: No, it is not. My name at birth was Horst Alfred Taucher. And Horst \u2014 Horst became Horace\nand Alfred became Fred.",
        "A: I was born January 29\", 1933 in Berlin, Germany.",
        "A: In this area, actually \u2014 in Washington, D.C., not very long.",
        "A: Oh, in Berlin. Well, I cannot tell you exactly, but I do know that my father was born in New\nYork, New York, in Manhattan. In fact, he went through high school in New York and then went\nto Germany with his parents.",
        "A: I do not know. I do not know if my grandparents were born in the U.S. I \u2014 I think they were\nborn in Germany, lived here and then went back to Germany. And when my father was, like I\nsay, 19 years old he went to Germany with his parents. He learned to be a tailor while in Berlin\nand he did get married very late in his life. He was married, I think at \u2014 about the age of 42 or 43\nyears to my mother, who also \u2014 1t was my mother\u2019s second marriage. And my mother was born\nin Oberschlesien, that\u2019s near Breslau, which is now Poland. And my brother was \u2014 she had a\nnumber of brothers and sisters all in Oberschlesien and they were dentists and lawyers. She had\none sister who was an opera singer by the name of Rosie Albach(ph) Gerstel. She actually passed\naway about a month before I learned that she was living in Vancouver, British Columbia, which\nwas about a two and a half hour drive from where I lived in Seattle, Washington.",
        "A: My father\u2019s name was Julius Taucher, and of course he succumbed in Auschwitz in 1943,\nshort \u2014 almost immediately after he was arrested. My mother\u2019s name was Teresa, but she was\nborn \u2014 her maiden name was Gerstel, g-e-r-s-t-e-l.",

        "A: Well, from \u2014 a \u2014a stepbrother, so to speak, from my mother\u2019s first marriage, she had son,\nwhich was Klaus Gerstel. And in a way he c-committed suicide. He was arrested, or on the way\nto be arrested in 1942. And when the SS came to arrest him, at that time we \u2014 he was living in\nthe apartment, it was kind of ghetto apartment where they forced all the Jews to be in. And it had\na circular type of a stairway. I think it had about six stories in that building. And when he learned\nthat the SS were there to arrest him, he ran up to the top of the stairway, the circular stairway and\ndove headfirst, which of course killed him, but he says I am not going to go to a concentration\ncamp.",
        "A: He wa \u2014 I think he was 19 or 20 years old.",
        "A: No, there were two nephews that left, one when all of this broke \u2014 came out in Germany\nabout 1938, one nephew of my father\u2019s went to South America, in Argentina, I believe, while the\nother one couldn\u2019t make it to South America and he ended up in Shanghai during the war. And\nafter the war, both of \u2014 which turned out to be our cousins, my brother and my cousin, they did\ngo to the \u2014 came to the U.S. and lived \u2014 and settled down in Joplin, Missouri.",
        "A: Yes, we did meet and they were \u2014 they lived in Breslau and they were very well off. One\ncousin was crippled, but he still was very well off, he was a piano player and I think he also\nplayed some kind of a piano. He di \u2014 per-performed a lot of c-c-concert pia \u2014 he was a concert\npianist, what I\u2019m trying to say.",
        "A: While the other one, I don\u2019t know what he did, but he did own an automobile and he made \u2014\ndrove to Berlin many times to visit us, or actually took us to Breslau and we \u2014 my father and his\nnephews were very close.",
        "A: Before the war.",
        "A: Not to my knowledge, I do not know.",
        "A: No, they were not. Neither one of my parents were very religious. We were a very Reform\ntype of a Jewish family.",
        "A: Yes, we did go to temple every Friday as long as the temple was [indecipherable]. We even\nlearned some Hebrew and we knew how to say the prayers in Hebrew.",
        "A: We did learn in the Jewish school, the two years \u2014 little over two years that I went through\nschool, my brother three years, we did learn Hebrew \u2014 ah, the prayers.",
        "A: Neither my brother or I do know Hebrew now, but I still, amazingly enough I can still say\nsome of the prayers.",
        "A: I do not know. I do not know.",
        "A: No, I would say 90 percent were Jewish. My father was a tailor, he had a tailor shop in Berlin,\nvery close to the Kurfuirstendamm, which 1s the main shopping center, one block off from there,\nand it was primarily Jewish businesses or tailors in other stores.",
        "A: Yes, my parents had a number of non-Jewish friends. One of them \u2014 here\u2019s the amazing thing,\none of them was a midwife to my birth, and she was a high ranking member of the Nazi party.\nShe had pictures of Hitler and her throughout her entire apartment.",
        "A: That, I wish I had an answer, I do not know. I don\u2019t know if my father hired her as a midwife,\nor if my mother did. But she was the midwife to my birth, may \u2014 possibly \u2014 my father was a man\nand ladies\u2019 tailor, he\u2019d sew dresses as well as man suits and maybe he did some clothing for her.\nI do not know.",
        "A: Her name was Gertrude Noelting, it\u2019s g-e-r-t-u-d-e, which is a pretty common German fir \u2014\nlady\u2019s first name. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes, Gertrude, and her last name was Noelting, which is \u2014 using the American spelling, it\u2019s n-\no-e-|-t-i-n-g.",
        "A: Well, I would say both. At first we, of course, were very dependent on our parents. But when\nour father was arrested in 1943, we realized \u2014 and I say we, my brother and I \u2014 realized what was\nhappening. Well, we already realized what was happening back in 19 \u2014 November 9, 1938,\nKristallnacht. Of course, I was not quite six years old. I was born in \u201933, January. And then I\nrealized what was happening. And of course the Germans took my father\u2019s store away. They\ndestroyed his inventory. They destroyed his sewing machines. Excuse me. [coughs] They\ndestroyed everything and then forced us to live, again, in a apartment unit there. There were \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know how many different levels in that building there was, but we had one room below the\nkitchen. And that\u2019s what we had and that\u2019s what every other Jewish family had that had two kids.\nThey each h-had one room with a kitchen, a small kitchen. It was one bathroom 1n each floor for\nevery 10 in \u2014 in that floor.",
        "A: No, no, I do have memory of that. Si -- again, since we lived in the Jewish area, the Hitler\nyouth already, kids 10 years old, there were many a times when we \u2014 the kids spit \u2014 spit at us.\nWe could not defend ou-ourselves, even if we were at such an age where we could have \u2014 maybe\nwe\u2019re stronger than those kids that spit at us or kicked us and so forth, but we were not permitted\nto hit anybody that had a Hitler youth uniform.",
        "A: We were told.",
        "A: By the Jewish community, in school and so forth, that the best thing is walk away, otherwise\nit'll be tougher on us.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That 1s correct.",
        "A: I\u2014I\u2014I wished I had an answer, I do not remember that. I do not.",
        "A: We were [indecipherable] \u2014 oh, my brother and I were very close together and even today we\nstill are very close together even though I live in Seattle, he lives in Los Angeles, but we are very\nclose.",
        "A: Okay, yes we did. Nowadays, even though my brother is a year older, he hardly remembers\nwhat transpired. He just wiped this whole thing out of his memory. If I can say here, last week,\nof course, was Holocaust Remembrance week. I was asked by the you \u2014 army in Fort Lewis,\nWashington, to talk about the Holocaust. The army there specifically asked Holocaust survivors,\npreferably concentration camp ho \u2014 su-survivors that have also been in the U.S. military,\npreferably in military service. I spent time in the U.S. Army, received a warrant officer\ncommission during my service in Korea and I t-talked about the Holocaust. I did want my\nbrother to talk about the Holocaust, but \u2014 and the reason I wanted him to talk, he spent time in\nVietnam, he spent 22 years in the arm \u2014 U.S. Army, retired a major, a much higher ranking\nofficer than me. But he says he just can\u2019t talk about it, he doesn\u2019t remember it and does not want\nto talk about it. And he\u2019s [indecipherable] he can\u2019t remember what has happened, yet he\u2019s a year\nolder. He cannot speak German any more. While he was in the military he was stationed in\nGermany, in Heidelberg for three years, but never had anything to do with the Germans.",
        "A: No, not that I can recall. We started talking about it, together with our parents too, after\nKristallnacht. And we were told, just try and stay away from Hitler youth. Don\u2019t get involved,\ndon\u2019t get into arguments. And of course, in 1941, I think 1t was, when we had to wear the Jewish\nStar of David. And there were \u2014 it\u2019s not just wearing the star, there were limitations made, what\n\u2014 we couldn\u2019t go to a store except between five and six o\u2019clock in the afternoon. And there were\nso many restrictions, we couldn't use public transportation. And my brother and I talked about it,\nbut we knew there was nothing we could do and just hoping that it will get better.",
        "A: I wish I had an answer for that. I \u2014 I \u2014 we knew that he was not good for us, but we always\nthought it would become better. And again, we were unique inasmuch our father was an\nAmerican citizen. And our father never thought that he would be arrested and sent to a\nconcentration camp. He figured our family would eventually be given exceptions. He just didn\u2019t\nthink it would happen. And \u2014 go ahead.",
        "A: Only German. We did not know any English. In fact, when my brother and I came to the \u2014 the\nU.S. after the war, it was only German.",
        "A: I think he was afraid to teach us English. Just \u2014 actually, my father, even though he was an\nAmerican citizen, he served in the German army during World War I. And again, that was\nanother reason that he f-felt, like many Jews that was in the German army during World War \u2014\nWorld War I, figured that they would not ever be arrested. And even when my father lost his\nbusiness, his tailor shop and was moved \u2014 a-and we had to go and live in this apartment, he had\nto go into slave labor, but he figured that\u2019s the worst that the Germans will do to him, they forced\nhim into forced labor. And \u2014 but still he never thought that he\u2019d ever be arrested.",
        "A: I wished I could, but I do know we had hundred to 150 kids in class. And that\u2019s about all I can\nremember. I do not know the name of the schools, which I did learn last year when I found the ca\n\u2014 archives in the east of Berlin, in Potsdam. But other than that I just do not remember.",
        "A: That is correct, but there were way too many kids in a class, and \u2014",
        "A: Well, I began school when I was six years old, in 1939. There was \u2014 was some kind of a\nschool almost e-equivalent to kindergarten here, yeah, when I was five years old.",
        "A: I remember it was 1n the middle of the night, which I really think was about four in the\nmorning, when all of a sudden \u2014 maybe I should go back a little bit before the actual\nKristallnacht. It was probably two or three days prior to Kristallnacht. The shop windows were\njust painted with pic \u2014 Jude, which means Jew, in front. And \u2014 well, you couldn\u2019t look out, they\nwere just plain painted with cuss words, so to speak, being a Jew and so forth.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I was old enough. And \u2014",
        "A: Again, I wished I had an answer and could gi \u2014 tell you how my feeling was, but I thought it\nwas terrible that the shop windows of my father were all painted. Very bad. And then my father\nwas forced to clean and make those windows completely clean and it took him all day to have \u2014 I\nthink he had two razor blades to scrape all the paint off. And \u2014 but he wer \u2014 every other shop\nowner, Jewish shop owner in the street was forced to do the same thing.",
        "A: Yes, I saw, in fact, I tried to help. We \u2014 our \u2014 we tried to help him, but very little we could do,\nespecially he only had two razor blades, and he was forced to do it. And it was two days later,\nafter the windows were all taken \u2014 cleaned, that\u2019s when then they shattered all the windows. And\nwe lived in the back of the store, and of course we saw what was happening. We were scared,\nand I knew in my \u2014 I still remember my mother\u2019s \u2014 my \u2014 my mother saying, what are we going\nto do? They\u2019ve took our store away, they\u2019ve ruined everything. And I remember my father\ntelling my mother, well don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s what we have insurance for. We have insurance for\nvandalism, for theft, and we\u2019ll just have the insurance companies replace everything. Of course,\nthat never happened. And I do remember this like it was yesterday. Yeah, 1t was \u2014 I was five\nyears and 10 month old. And you kind of grew up quickly and became mature prematurely.",
        "A: Very bad. I\u2014I feared, especially the brown uniforms, which was in the SR, or the SA, or the\nblack uniforms with a skull, which were the SS. We feared that. It was something that chilled\nyour bodies, at least that\u2019s what it did to me. I\u2014 I knew what it was. When I \u2014 it goes right back\nwatching the Hitler youth uniform. When I see a kid in a Hitler youth uniform, I walked and tried\nnot to be seen by them, especially when \u2014 going back to 1941 when we had to wear the yellow\nstar. We just shied away from them.",
        "A: Not as a child, but afterwards, and even occasionally when I \u2014 I\u2019d\u2014a year ago when I was in\nBerlin, I visited the old SS headquarters, which was Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse 9. And I \u2014 that\nevening I had nightmares. In fact, I was asked to give a taped interview over there. They had my\nrecord that I was tortured there. And yes, I had some pretty bad headquarters \u2014 I mean,\nnightmares.",
        "A: Right, Kristallnacht \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Well, I woke up when they shattered the window, just the noise from the window\nshattering and the noises. And again, you \u2014 down Jews, and so forth. A-And you \u2014 you don\u2019t\ndeserve to be living here. And I remember that li \u2014 again, like I said, like 1t was yesterday. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes, in fact we only had \u2014 actually we had two rooms. One room my brother and I lived \u2014 and\nthese were small room, almost \u2014 what you almost have a \u2014 like a walk-in closet over here. And\nthen my mother and I had another room. And we had a small kitchen and a small \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: And then we had to move from that apartment into a smaller apartment unit. And this 1s\nwhere I said we had one room per family, plus a kitchen.",
        "A: He was there, too. Of course, I wa \u2014 remember, this was probably in fi \u2014 42.",
        "A: Oh, still at Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Oh, there we just [indecipherable]",
        "A: Okay, I\u2019m sorry. The Kristallnacht we were actually in the store. We had two rooms in the\nback of the store. In-Incidentally, that same store that I remember from Kristallnacht is still at the\nsame location, it was not bombed out.",
        "A: Right. Then what happened, of course, insurance didn\u2019t cover it, and the Germans gave my\nfather, I think two or three days to move out and they told her that we have to move to this\napartment unit, which was Commandant Strasse 63, I remember that address. And incidentally,\nwhen I again visited Berlin, I tried to look up that old apartment unit. Unfortunately it \u2014 it was\nbombed, but the entire block is flat because this \u2014 the old Berlin wall separating east and west\nBerlin went right through it. So that is no longer in existence. It\u2019s just an empty lot right now.",
        "A: It was November, probably. Well, Kristallnacht was November nine and I would say about\nthe 10\" or the 11% \u2014 11\" or 12 when we had to move.",
        "A: We had to move immediately, I think the \u2014 two or three days. And \u2014",
        "A: No, they \u2014 they took most of our \u2014 everything \u2014 most of what we had they took away. They\njust scatter it out in the streets. We had very, very little to take along. Some clothing. I think my\nfather had some \u2014 he must have suspected something, but some of the material that he made\nclothing out of, he had someplace else. And he did some sewing for us once we moved in the\napartment, and he did this late at night, because there \u2014 after he was forced to work on the\nrailroad, and \u2014 which was slave labor. But at night he would sew some clothing for us so that we\nhad something to wear, because I think everything we owned really, was taken away.",
        "A: No, they were \u2014 we had no toys, or \u2014 we \u2014 we just didn't grow up with toys. We \u2014 I think my\nbrother and I, I don\u2019t know what we did for play. I don\u2019t think we played. We just \u2014 we just\ndidn\u2019t. I \u2014",
        "A: Even before Kristallnacht, yeah. We did \u2014 I probably should mention that. We lived pretty \u2014\npretty close to a small park and so forth, which had a river and so forth and I know there was one\ntime when some Hitler youth pushed my brother into the river in Berlin. And my brother, of\ncourse, did not know how to swim at that time and he almost drowned and some German worker\nin a bi\u2014 on a bicycle saw my brother drowning and he jumped in and saved him. And of course,\nhe had the Jewish Star on David on my \u2014 my brother had that on, but that German still saved him\nand made sure that my brother was alright and found out where we lived and took my brother\nactually home, in this apartment. Well, my father then, again had material and sewed him, this\nman, some clothing and so forth. Well, that poor ma \u2014 gentleman was arrested because he saved\na Jew. And I do not know whatever happened to him. He was not permitted to talk to us any\nmore, but I do remember that he was arrested for saving a Jew.",
        "A: No, I do not know. I wished \u2014 if I knew his name I would try \u2014 would have tried to look him\nup.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, I think \u2014 yes, we did. We went to school through 1942, again to a Jewish school, and of\ncourse there were many, many kids in one class. And learning, I would say most of my schooling\nwas self studied at our mother. Yeah, I think probably our mother taught us more how to read\nthan what we learned in school.",
        "A: No, not really, she pretty much took care of us, and again, gave us classes, how to write and\nread.",
        "A: Well again, like I say, I had a stepbrother from my mother\u2019s previous er \u2014 marr-marriage. And\nof course he killed himself the day he was supposed to have been arrested. And we\u2019ve had \u2014 but\nmost of our extended family, especially from our mother\u2019s side, lived in Breslau, which is now\nPoland. And we had one aunt in Berlin, but she too was one of the early ones that was arrested\nand was in \u2014 shipped to Theresienstadt and I do not know if she died over there. We lost track.\nAnd I\u2019ve done some research on it and I can\u2019t find any record on her. And of course all of m \u2014\nmost of my father\u2019s relatives either were \u2014 remained in the U.S. or went to South America.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: It was shortly after Kristallnacht when his store was destroyed, his property taken away and\nwe were forced into living into a big apartment unit where many, many Jews were forced to live.\nAnd my father was forced to work on the railroad. Rather than being a tailor he was forced to\nwork doing hard labor. It was s \u2014 definitely slave labor. And he was actually forced to live there\nuntil hi-his arrest in 1943.",
        "A: Yes, he did come back every night, completely exhausted. And I do remember that, as young\nas I was. I mean, he could hardly move, but he did come back and he ate what little food my\nmother had to cook for him.",
        "A: Well, that was another problem a-after the Kristallnacht, when she cou \u2014 only had a choice to\ngo to \u2014 to stores by \u2014 owned by Jews, between five and six o\u2019clock in the evening. And \u2014 and\nwhat I think my mother did, she went to the store long before five o\u2019clock so that she would be\none of the first in line to buy what necessary food products she could get. And it was very, very\nsmall.",
        "A: Yes, it did. Their names became \u2014 the middle name was always Israel or Sarah and actually, I\nthink even as boys we had \u2014 we became Israel, was one of the names. I just vaguely remember\nthat.",
        "A: Not really, not really, but yeah, I think every boy was Israel and every girl was Sarah.",
        "A: I do not recall that, I think our parents had the papers, I don\u2019t think we had our own papers.",
        "A: No, we were not. I did not learn this really, until I was older.",
        "A: Yes. Back in 1934, I understand, they did make an effort to leave and we all got as far as\nHolland. But \u2014 it may have been 1936, we got as far as Rotterdam I think, but I think the\nGermans already were doing a lot of things and even though they haven\u2019t \u2014 hadn\u2019t invaded\nHolland yet, but the \u2014 the \u2014 they forced my father to go back to Berlin. Apparently the \u2014 he didn't\nhave the proper papers to leave Germany. And of course \u2014 and he had to pay \u2014 every penny he\nhad, he had to pay just to get back to Berlin, and he just didn't have the financial resources to get\nus \u2014 to get us back out. But then again he was so convinced, being an American, that they are\ngoing to leave him alone. They\u2019ll give him a rough time, but he felt he\u2019d be left alone. And\nagain, like a lot of people, especially business people were arrested and sent to concentration\ncamp, going back to 1941 and 1942. My father wasn\u2019t arrested until 1943, and I think there are\nrecords here at the Holocaust Museum, the date he was arrested, even the transport number. I do\nnot remember now.",
        "A: I believe it was 1936, I cannot be sure of the dates, cause again I was too young, I \u2014 I know\nwe moved someplace, and \u2014 but I do not know. But I know through when I lived with my\ncousins after I came here to the U.S., they said that he took us all once to Holland then had to\nturn back, but then he ran out of money.",
        "A: None whatsoever. Other kids, they wouldn\u2019t \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t dare associate with Jews, and it\nwas strictly other Jewish kids that we were in contact with.",
        "A: I do not remember, I do not think we played games. I just cannot remember that we ever\nplayed games. I think the times were so complicated. I think in school the teachers concentrated\nmore in group learning and little bit of Hebrew, you know, we studied like the Hebrew alphabet\nand so forth.",
        "A: Yes, in German. Again, we did learn the Hebrew alphabet, the aleph, bet, gimmel, dalet and\nso forth, which I still know today.",
        "A: It definitely meant, this is where we\u2019re going to go. Our father always told us how great the\nU.S. are and someday we\u2019re all going to move to the U.S. after the war is over. The U.S. will win\nthe w \u2014 will prevail and we\u2019re all going to go to New York. And we were pretty much raised\nwith that mentality, that to live \u2014 to go to the United States, it was \u2014 we said America.",
        "A: It represented 1\u2014 I guess you could say freedom and that it is the best country in the world to\ngrow up.",
        "A: Yes, we did. We were aware of that.",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "A: Yes, we had a radio and we heard it on the radio and we listened to Hitler and his other\ncronies, and yes, we were fully aware of it.",
        "A: Oh yes, I remember his screaming, definitely. Occasionally, which we weren\u2019t supposed to, I\n\u2014 this is just \u2014 as we are talking now, I do remember once in awhile, illegally, we took our S-Star\nof David off and did attend a movie thea \u2014 watched a movie, maybe a comedy or something, that\nwe'd go to a public movie. And of course in these movies they also had all this prop \u2014\npropaganda. And I do remember that now, but I never thought about this until right now.",
        "A: Oh that \u2014 every \u2014 I would say even a five year old kid knew that.",
        "A: I think it was publicized \u2014 told by our parents, and everybody. We just knew we were inferior\ncitizens and we had to wear that [indecipherable]",
        "A: We didn\u2019t feel inferior, but we knew to the Germans we were inferior. And I think it \u2014 I\nprobably shouldn\u2019t compare, but I will. I think it\u2019s the same way when the Afro-Americans at\none time had to sit at the back of the bus, they had separate public restrooms. And while I don\u2019t\nthink the average child \u2014 black person realized that they were treated as a inferior citizen, but\nthey were treated that way, and this is, I think how we felt in Berlin during the war, in Germany\nduring the war.",
        "A: The yellow star was on our left chest, really, and it was \u2014 had to be sewn on, it had to be sewn\non neatly. And of course our father being a tailor, he did that. And we \u2014 when we went outside\ninto the public streets, we had to wear it. And if you didn\u2019t wear it you were arrested, whether\nyou were a five year old or a 55 year old.",
        "A: I felt scared, always scared, because I knew that other kids could come, even if they were\nthree year old, or four year olds, they could spit at us, they cou \u2014 if they had a stick they could hit\nus and we couldn\u2019t hit back. And so yes, I was scared and really afraid to go out. And again\nsometimes I think we were blessed, both my brother and I, we did not really look Jewish. So\nsometimes we did take the chance and did not wear the star and did go out and went to a movie\ntheater and so forth.",
        "A: Well, you know, there are certain people, you can tell they\u2019re Jewish. Oh, you may make a\nmistake, like even some Egyptians look Jewish, but we were not obvious Jewish looking,\notherwise we never would have survived living in Berlin.",
        "A: Yes, yes, very fair coloring and sometimes people thought my brother is a little darker\ncolored, but he looked more Italian, and in those days Italy and Germany were still allies.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, we were spat upon many times. And like I said earlier, my brother was pushed in\nthe water, almost \u2014 could have drowned. And we underwent \u2014 probably my brother went through\nSs \u2014 more severe pan \u2014 punishments than I was, for some reason.",
        "A: Yeah, I think so, or it\u2019s just where he was at, we weren\u2019t always together. And he was \u2014 he\nwas mistreated more than I was, I believe, at the beginning of the war.",
        "A: Again, here is a mind that is blank, I don\u2019t remember. I do remember being with other Jewish\nkids, sometimes walking to school together. And I don\u2019t think a day went by where we didn\u2019t \u2014\nweren't \u2014 not beat up, bu-but mistreated by the German kids, especially Hitler youth kids and\nHitler youth was 10 years and ol \u2014 over.",
        "A: Well, they expect it. It\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t think you ever get used to something like that and I know I\nnever did, but I expected it and it\u2019s just something I knew was going to happen. I don\u2019t know\nhow else I can explain that.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh definitely. And again, I don\u2019t remember what my parents said. My mother just\nsaid well, those days will pass by, just be patient. These were, I think, what my parents were\nsaying.",
        "A: Oh, very much so. Very much so. Our parents did comfort us as much as they could.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, we \u2014 we didn\u2019t know about that. I did know that Franklin Roosevelt was president. I do\nremember this, but I do not remember Japan bombing Pearl Harbor. I never even heard of Pearl\nHarbor, so no, I did not know anything like that.",
        "A: Yes, I did, because there were times, going even back to 1939 where we did visit her at her\napartment. And she had a \u2014 an apartment in the better part of Berlin, Schoneberg and we did visit\nher. Sometimes she had dinner for us. And, in fact there were times th \u2014 when she picked us up\nwhere we lived and we did remove our Star of David when we had to wear it, and we went with\nher to her apartment and there we were very safe because she also \u2014 I think she had a special I.D.\nor something, that she was a high ranking Nazi member, a personal friend of Hitler. So nobody\nbothered her when \u2014 especially when we were with her, too.",
        "A: No, she was never married and at that time she was probably in her middle 50\u2019s. She died\nwhen she was 79 years old, I believe, a-after the war.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay, when I was younger I couldn\u2019t figure that out at all, but now, being older and seeing\nwhat has happened, my guess 1s that she was such a Nazi fanatic, she was a good friend of Hitler\nand deep inside she was convinced that Hitler did not know what was going on. She used to tell\nthat to my father, to my mother, that Hitler doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Once he learns what\u2019s\ngoing on, he\u2019s going to stop that. And I believe because of that mentality, she was convinced if\nshe would be caught helping us, that Hitler would free her and she would say everything to\nHitler. A-And I think that\u2019s the only reason that I can think of why she helped us. And of course\nshe mu-must also feel that she brought me onto this world. And I think that\u2019s the only reason.\nAnd I think I\u2019m the only Jewish person she ever assisted in a birth.",
        "A: No, she did not. My brother I think was delivered at a Jewish hospital in Berlin.",
        "A: Again, I don\u2019t know. I\u2014 I\u2014 I th\u2014 somehow either my father or my mother befriended her,\nand I guess this would have been my mother\u2019s actually third child, me, and I guess she wasn\u2019t as\nuncomfortable being assisted by a midwife.",
        "A: Yes, I was. In fact it was \u2014 my father ha \u2014 actually, he had two stores, one of them was within\ntwo blocks of each other and the first store is where I was born. I think that was in Petsalozzi(ph)\nstrasse. And then later on Leipne(ph) strasse, which was at Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Well, in 1943, one day our father didn\u2019t come home. And again, we did have a number of n-\nnon-Jewish friends that were against the Hitler regime. And it was one woman that says, leave\nyour apartment, the Germans are arresting everybody. They took your father away, he\u2019s \u2014 he was\narrested.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, who was a friend of ours and she \u2014 I think she owned a \u2014 a laundry or something\nlike that. But, just outside the Jewish section of Berlin. And \u2014 and she is the one that told us, and\nit\u2019s \u2014 really, it was very close. When we gathered the few things that we owned \u2014 as I say we, my\nmother, my brother and I, the few things we owned, we left the apartment and there was a back\nentrance. We went out the back entrance and we understand that the SS came up the front\nentrance. So we just barely escaped.",
        "A: Again, I\u2019m guessing here, I would say less than an hour. It was very, very close.",
        "A: That is correct, he was, right from work taken away. And again, from what I see, the record\nshowed he was shipped to Auschwitz and probably \u2014 again, talking to Auschwitz survivors, they\nsay normally what happened is when they arrived in Auschwitz, they had two sides. One side\nthey were tattooed and they were in the work parade, the other side di \u2014 were not even \u2014 didn\u2019t\neven get a number, they were put in the gas chamber and my father was one of those.",
        "A: I would say he was \u2014 I think my father was in the early 50\u2019s at the time. Well, my father, I \u2014 I\ncan probably figure it out. I am not sure. He was born either 1981 or 1991.",
        "A: Yeah, I mean 18 \u2014 1891, yes, or nin \u2014 1891, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "A: Right. And again, he was murdered in Auschwitz, roughly two days after he arrived there\nfrom what other people tell me that have been there.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Okay, again we\u2019re going right back to this Nazi midwife. She, because of her friendship with\nHitler, had a summer cabin in the outskirts of Berlin. And only high ranking SS officers could\nhave cabins there. And this is where she put us. She told all the other officers, military officers,\nmostly SS, that our father was a \u2014 a\u2014TI guess a colonel or something in the army \u2014 ar \u2014 German\narmy and he was out in the fronts in \u2014 in the front line in ka \u2014 Russia. And we lived there, right\namongst the SS, or the wives of the SS. But then of course wintertime came along \u2014",
        "A: Fraulein Noelting, the midwife, she provided my mother with papers, where we went under\ndifferent names and us kids went under different names. And again, she was right up with her\nparty and we ha \u2014 there was bombing and a lot of civilians were killed during bomb air raids\nback in the 40\u2019s. And so this midwife, she found out what family with \u2014 what mother with two\nchildren were killed at a certain \u2014 our age, were killed at certain a-a-apartments, or houses. And\nshe got us those types of identification. And that\u2019s how we lived. Of course, then after six\nmonths or so, people were wondering \u2014 sometimes my \u2014 maybe I should go \u2014 my brother and I\nwould act like we\u2019d go to school. We\u2019d wear the bags to go as if we were going to school, but we\nnever did go to school. We didn\u2019t dare go to school because of every child had to go into\nphysical training and then you take a bath. Well, us being boys, being circumcised would give us\naway. So we never went to school. But then people got kind of suspicious, they \u2014 nobody ever\nsaw us in school, other kids. So this midwife says, you have to leave from there. And then again\nwe took on different I.D. and we moved from area to area, place to place. Some of the places I do\nnot know, but I \u2014",
        "A: I was \u2014 it so happened I was Horst Grossman. My mother was a Grossman, I don\u2019t know what\nher first name was, and my brother was a Grossman.",
        "A: These were German named people that were killed during an air raid.",
        "A: I believe we were special cases because she used to complain about Jews, they all have so\nmuch money and they are ruining the economy of Germany. I used to hear her say things like\nthat, even to my mother. And yet she said, but our family was different. She was very strange.\nWell, when \u2014 after the war, when only my brother and I survived, she was real upset when we\ntold her we\u2019re going to try and go to America. And she was very upset because she says, you are\nGermans, you can\u2019t leave. And when my brother and I did leave Germany, and we wrote to her\nonce we got to the U.S., she would never answer us, she was so upset. She said we don\u2019t show\nany thank you.",
        "A: What we did, we \u2014 this was out in forest type of an area and we would just walk inside the\nforest. In fact, we would pick mushrooms, this is what we ate all the time. My brother and I and\nour mother too, we got to know every edible mushroom. And instead of going to school, we\nwould pick mushrooms, so that\u2019s what we had to eat most of the time.",
        "A: Oh, I think she \u2014 she stayed at the cabin and she washed clothes. I think she did wash clothing\nfo \u2014 wash and did other things for some other people to get some income.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I think we did, but I can\u2019t be sure. There are so many blanks that I can\u2019t\nreally tell you for sure if we did or not. I think we did. I do know \u2014 one thing I do remember,\nduring the \u2014 there was a vacation period about four weeks or so and there was one kid \u2014a\nGerman kid, not Jewish, who drove \u2014 he was 15 years old and he drove a milk delivery vehicle,\nit was a motorized vehicle. And I \u2014 I helped him deliver the milk. And he was pretty much a real\nNazi believer, Hitler youth, but somehow he \u2014 he befriended me, and we became friends. Of\ncourse, I didn\u2019t tell him who I was. And I know there was a time where I helped him deliver the\nfresh milk.",
        "A: Fear. Just plain fear. Of course you saw it, no matter where you went you saw it. And the\nswastika was actually easier to get used to. The thing that bothered me was the \u2014 the skull that\nthe SS had on, or even some soldiers that were affiliated with the SS all wore that \u2014 that skull.\nThat was, to me, worse than the swastika.",
        "A: Well, because I knew that were the ones that would kill the Jews \u2014 they would kill us, and we\nknew that.",
        "A: No, again we were mature enough. We never were \u2014 feared that because we knew we would\nnot let our guard down. And that includes my brother too. We knew what to say and what not to\nsay.",
        "A: Yes, yes we did. And we also knew that we were not to expose ourselves in a restroom or so\nforth, because we knew if we did we would be dead.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Okay, it was east of Spandau and the place was called Berger Uplager(ph). And again, to get\nthere you had to actually walk, probably worth a 20 or 30 minute walk from the train station, and\nright in the midst of a forest. And that was the name of the place, Berger Uplager(ph).",
        "A: Very joyous and a relaxed atmosphere. Again, these were all, like I said earlier, SS. They had\nthe food, they had everything. And you didn\u2019t think there was a war going on, to them.",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t, because again they knew to \u2014 as far as they knew, our father was in the\nRussian front and \u2014 and my mother always showed like she was so sad, she didn't know where\nFather was exactly, that they pretty much left her alone, as far as I can remember. And we didn't\nmix too much with the \u2014 and most of them didn\u2019t even have kids there, and \u2014 because again they\nwere probably, most of the people there were in their late 30\u2019s, early 40\u2019s and they had kids who\nare \u2014 probably were in se \u2014 in Seattle, I almost said. They were probably in Berlin taking training\nin the Hitler youth, because they were all Hitler youth age.",
        "A: Very little. I cannot really remember it. I\u2019m sure we did, but again there\u2019s so many blanks.\nI\u2019m sure we did but I can\u2019t \u2014 I just cannot remember.",
        "A: No, we knew he was in Auschwitz because he wrote, right after he was arrested he wrote a\npostcard and said that he is in Auschwitz, things are going fine and will see you all when I get\nback. And that\u2019s the \u2014 and this postcard was written to this midwife and she was a little\nconcerned that they would watch her because she got a letter from a Jew. But again, with her\naffiliation with the SS and with Hitler, they never did anything.",
        "A: Yes, she continued being a midwife and she brought a lot of kids into this world.",
        "A: She was just a good friend of Hitler and some of the other people, but she did not like\nHimmler, Goering or Goebbels. She said they\u2019re \u2014 those are the people that are at fault what is\nbeing done to the Jews, and as soon as Hitler knows about it, it\u20191l stop. In the meantime, she did\nher job as a midwife. I do remember that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe she did. She tried to, but he was so busy that he just didn\u2019t have time to see\nher. But I do know she has made attempts to talk with Hitler.",
        "A: I do not know. I do not know how she and Hitler became friends, but like I said earlier, there\nwere pictures of her and Hitler together, even Hitler had her \u2014 his arm around her in pictures of\nthat. How they became friends, I have no idea.",
        "A: Again, sa \u2014 I \u2014 we lived in different places throughout Berlin, where I do not know. But then\neven that got a little bad \u2014",
        "A: To the city. We went back to the city of Berlin. But then \u2014 things got bad, but again this\nmidwife found another family that was wiped out, by the name of Schmitz. And it so happened\nthis woman had children, two boys, almost our age and they wi \u2014 they looked a li \u2014 somewhat\nlike us. So we actually took their I.D., pictures of them, and we moved to a reso-sort area in Binz\nauf Rugen. It\u2019s a eastern part of Germany and my mother had a job there as a \u2014 as a maid at one\nof the \u2014 at a big hotel again, where soldiers took their own rest and recuperation. And she was \u2014\nmy mother became a maid over there, and had an income. But again, after about four months we\nhad to move, because again, school. We didn't dare go to school. In fact there was a time where\nall the German kids had to work out on a farm and pick vegetables and things, so there was no\nschool. And so my brother and I were out there with the other German kids, boys and girls,\npulling vegetables and things like that. But then it got \u2014 school started and we had to move\nbecause we didn\u2019t dare go to school again. And so we went back to Berlin, again this midwife,\nshe mailed \u2014 via mail she sent us the proper documents that we needed in case there\u2019s an I.D.\ncheck. But at that time we almost has the proper I.D. for Hitler youth. But we were lucky that\nthere was no I.D. check on our way to Berlin, back from Binz auf Raden(ph) on the train,\nbecause we would have been caught of the \u2014 it was very, very, very scary when we went in\npublic transportation. But we ended up back in Berlin. I think we kept that identification until the\nend of the war, the \u2014 by the name of Schmitz. I don\u2019t remember what first name we had, but\nagain we moved from area to area and then, I don\u2019t know where now, in 1945, let\u2019s say \u2014",
        "A: Yes, we had some notes. For instance, if we \u2014 if one of us, my mother, brother or I noticed\nsomething that could be a possible Gestapo checking for I.D., if we thought it was, we\u2019d make\nsome hand notes and we slowly in di \u2014 different pe \u2014 not together, we\u2019d disappear. Because some\nthere, sometimes you could almost guess it. We got so we could feel that that was a Gestapo.",
        "A: Yeah, we had the hand motions and then we\u2019d me \u2014 le-leave one at a time, and we wouldn\u2019t\nha \u2014 never go into a restroom, because they \u2014 they caught a lot of il \u2014 so full \u2014 so-called illegal\npeople in restrooms. And so we usually stayed out and tried to move away within two or three\nblocks from where we were at, then we\u2019d get back together. Yes, we \u2014 we did have that, just like\nwe always had a meeting place if we got separated.",
        "A: Not day by day but maybe every third day we\u2019d say, well, if we get separated, let\u2019s meet at\nthis train station, or lets meet at this building. We always decided on a place to meet.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah, again, I d\u2014 I don\u2019t remember. I just don\u2019t know what we did. We\u2019d walk. Of course\nnow you know you had air raids almost daily. The U.S. used to bomb daytime, the British\nbombed at night and we spend a lot of time in air raid shelters. Especially when we\u2019re g \u2014 now\ngoing to 1944, a lot of our time was spent in air raid shelters.",
        "A: No, we never did go to a church, and of course temples were not available. But we \u2014 we did\nnot.",
        "A: We \u2014I don\u2019t think we were at places long enough, but for some reason we never did. Again,\nour mother must have had a reason not to go to a church.",
        "A: Well, she tried to, but there were times \u2014 there were times where we didn\u2019t have anything to\neat for two or three days. It was not easy. The \u2014 probably where we had most of the food where\nwe did not starve was that short time that we lived in that summer cabin in Berlin and also when\nwe were in that hotel, this resort hotel in Binz auf Rigen. There was had ample food. Again, I\nthink my mother took it from the kitchen at times.",
        "A: No, could not tell. We did not. I\u2019m sure there were and they probably didn\u2019t know we were\nJewish. No, I ba \u2014 I believe that the \u2014 the Jews that were living like we were, under false \u2014\nassumed names and so forth, did not know anyone else that was in hiding.",
        "A: I do not know, I don\u2019t think so. I think I was probably the only one that she had delivered.",
        "A: Definitely not. I know we were the only ones.",
        "A: She\u2019d say that, she\u2019d tell my mother that. She said, you are the only ones I am helping and I\nknow that if Hitler catches me, he\u2019ll free me and everything will be by \u2014 will be forgiven and the\nconcentration camps would be eliminated once Hitler knew about it.",
        "A: She had an adopted daughter, and she\u2019s the only one that knew. And her daughter was in the\nphotography business and I think she developed things against \u2014 for the \u2014 for the Nazis. Pictures\nthat were taken an that were maybe tough to \u2014 to really make a good picture out of, she was able\nto i-improve the \u2014 the pictures of it. I mean, you know, photography was still not too good at the\ntime. In fact, she would even color them if they wanted colored pictures. She would actually\nmanually color the pictures. And, but again, she kept her mouth shut, and she was the only one\nthat knew that we were Jewish.",
        "A: Yes, m\u20141n fact, my brother saw \u2014 visited her when he was stationed in the army in\nHeidelberg.",
        "A: Yes, I did have contact. In fact, this one picture that I showed to you here, she took that.",
        "A: During the war, yes, we did. In fact, she lived with g \u2014 Noelting in Berlin, in Schoneberg.",
        "A: Traute, t-r-a-u-t-e, I think 1t was Holinova, h-o-]-1-n-o-v-a. I could be wrong on the spelling.\nBut she too has died now.",
        "A: We moved around all the time and until the beginni \u2014 beginning of 1945 when we lived in\ndifferent subway stations.",
        "A: Well, it got so that we didn\u2019t know where to go any more and the bombing was ak \u2014 like I\nsaid earlier, day and night. And the shelters, the bomb shelters were overcrowded. We couldn\u2019t\nget in, and to be in a bomb shelter again as kids, had to be in Hitler youth uniform, which we\ndidn\u2019t have. And we were afraid to be caught in a bomb shelter, so we stayed in subway stations,\nwhich a lot of other Germans, at the end stayed, because the subway stations were pretty deep\ndown and they were probably one of the safest places to be until bef \u2014 the day before the\nRussians came in.",
        "A: Only once I can remember where I was asked, why aren\u2019t you in uniform, I\u2019d say it\u2019s being\ncleaned. And that\u2019s the only time I was ever asked.",
        "A: I wished I could give you an answer for that, I do not re \u2014 I do not remember. I don\u2019t know\nwhat we did.",
        "A: Yes, we did, yes. Again, our father had us convinced that he being American, they\u2019ll give him\na bad time, but he\u2019ll be released.",
        "A: She too thought that he would be freed. She definitely did.",
        "A: She \u2014 to us she was very calm, and always the \u2014 things will get better, don\u2019t fear. We\u2019ll be\ntogether with the father, then we\u2019ll go to America and so forth. To us she was calm, but I\u2019m sure\nshe was in constant fear. I\u2019m just certain about it.",
        "A: As far as I know, no. I know there was a \u2014 another person, not Jewish, who helped us out\nquite a bit, he was a doctor and also analyzed x-rays and so forth, he had a x-ray business. And\nhe \u2014 he was an M.D. and I think the was partly the underground, because th \u2014 he was arrested at\nthe tail end of the war. And I know he 1s the one that gave my mother quite a bit of information,\nand where we can stay and where we could not stay. But other than that, my wa \u2014 mother didn\u2019t\nhave too much contact with anyone else.",
        "A: I do not know his name and I don\u2019t know how they got into contact, I\u2014 I do not remember it.\nI do not even know what part of Berlin that was, but I do remember having gone there a couple\nof times, maybe even more than that. But I do not know the name.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: Well again, we were kids and we\u2019d just go on a bench and lie down on a bench. It was very\ncold at times, but you got used to that.",
        "A: Well, let\u2019s put it this way, I did not feel like a 10 - 11 or 12 year old. We grew up, we matured\nvery, very early in life. And yes, I see other \u2014 I would see other 10 year old and I see how \u2014 what\na child they were and I say, they must be a lot younger than me. I do recall that.",
        "A: Sometimes I felt German. I had to feel German in order to save myself, but I \u2014 deep inside I\nfelt Jewish, yes, definitely.",
        "A: No, I was not angry, I was just wishing why can\u2019t we be like anyone else. I was not angry\nbeing Jewish, no, but I just was wishing I could be \u2014 that this discrimination against the Jews\nwouldn\u2019t be, that it would stop. And why am I different than any other German kid? I\u2014 maybe I\nregretted it, but I was not angry.",
        "A: Until the end of the war. Actually, what happened is we were at one subway station, and all of\na sudden it started being flooded, water came gushing through there. And all the people that were\nat that station started moving \u2014 the s-subways were not running \u2014 on the tracks to another station.\nAnd very few of us had anything to eat or to drink. Some people started drinking the water that\nwas stuving \u2014 coming through, and most of those people actually died due to diseases, I think\ntyphoid or whatever it brought. And there were times my brother and I were going to drink it,\nand we kind of kept each other from drinking it. We knew that that is dirty, we\u2019re not going to\ndrink it. And we, with quite a few other Germans, moved to the next station, which was not\nflooded then. And we probably spent \u2014 and my \u2014 our mother was still alive then, and \u2014 who kind\nof kept us, too, from drinking it. And we got to the other station that was not flooded, and \u2014 but\nwe needed water, and so my mother went outside the station upstairs to a fire hydrant to get\nwater. And she didn't come back down. And I went up and I do remember seeing her lying at the\nfire hydrant. And actually she was killed, I don\u2019t know if it was German or Russians, but the\ncrossfire between the Russians and the Germans. And so \u2014 and I never could get the water, I was\nforced to go back down into the subway station by German soldiers. I was a kid, and he forced\nme to go back down. And I would say that same day, all of a sudden two Russian soldiers came\ninto that subway station with Tommy guns \u2014 machine guns in each hand and everyone \u2014\neveryone down in that subway tunnel started clapping. There were a few German soldiers there,\nthey threw down their weapons and surrendered to those two Russian soldiers. And again, this\nwas at Anhalter Bahnhof, which is no longer a subway station, but the station is still there as a \u2014\na memorial, so to speak. And that was the end of the war for us. And we then \u2014",
        "A: It was very [indecipherable]",
        "A: Okay, at the time I didn\u2019t know if she really was dead or just injured. And I told my brother I\nsaw our mother, she was up at the fire hydrant, but the Germans wouldn\u2019t let me get to it, and I\nthink she is okay, but I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s really what I told him. And I didn\u2019t know, I \u2014 it was\njust the way I felt. And of course we never did see her again. And, in fact, up to this day, I do not\nknow if she was killed or injured because the Russians took a lot of \u2014 especially women and\nchildren, they loaded them on truck and s-shipped them to Russia, especially women. In fact,\nafter the war my brother and I were loaded onto trucks many times to be \u2014 to go to Russia, but\nwe knew Berlin like a book, we \u2014 there wasn\u2019t an address we couldn\u2019t find. And we, for awhile\nwere guides to some of the Russian officers going from point A to point B.",
        "A: Yes. We didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t cover that. Yes, again, like I said, we moved around freely under\nfalse I.D., and again in a streetcar, and I was there by myself. I think I may have been on my way\nto this midwife, Noelting, because she had some groceries for us. And we\u2019d do that, sometimes\nmy brother went to see her. And this was on April 15\", 1945. I was caught in a streetcar. And the\nreason is they had what I always feared, we all of us feared, an I.D. check. And they had an I.D.\ncheck and I had the I.D., I was \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the first name, the last name was Schmitz.\nBut I didn't have my Hitler youth card with me. So again, they make you drop the pants and they\nknew pretty much if you didn\u2019t have the Hitler youth I.D. you were Jewish. And of course, to a\n12 year old having to drop their pants in front of everybody was a humiliation to begin with. And\nof course, I was circumcised, Jewish, and they \u2014 I was arrested. They tied me up, my hands\nbehind my back, very tightly and they took me to Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse 9. That was the SS\nheadquarters. And they had a kind of a basement, like a dungeon where they questioned people,\nnot just Jews, even Germans that helped Jews, or others that talked against the regime, they were\ntortured at that place. And again, according to the archives \u2014 the archives in Germany do not s-\nsay what happened to me when I was arrested April 15\". It only showed that on April 17\", I was\nshipped to Dachau on a t \u2014 railcar, a train. Well, for t\u2014 two days there, between the 15\" and the\n17\", I was tortured, but they didn\u2019t get any information out of me because they beat me and\nthings they did, pulling teeth out, I have dentures. Pulling out teeth without any Novocain or\nanything, and usually I\u2019d pass out, and they finally gave up and stuck me in one of those trains.\nAnd that was April 17, according to the archives. And I ended up, after two days roughly, 1-in\nDachau, which I believe was the only concentration camp that still was open and there with a\nroute between Berlin and Munich. And of course Dachau was very close to Munich. I never left\nthe train. The train, railcar that I was in was mostly \u2014 were mostly Russian soldiers, men and\nwomen soldiers. There were, I think, a couple of kids my age in there and a few other women\nand men, Germans, Jews, I do not know. Then there were a whole bunch of people on the floor\nof the train that were already dead, or were trampled to death, or been there a lot longer. I don\u2019t\nknow how long they save, you know, kept the train in Berlin until it was full, completely full. So\nthere were a number of people that I know were dead. There was nothing to eat, no water and no\nsanitation facilities. And it was \u2014 it was the worst hell I\u2019ve ever been in. And it was either April\n19\" or April 20\", I do not know. Again, during th \u2014 fr \u2014 apar \u2014 from the records that were kept, I\nturned up missing April 20\". It may have been th-the day before. But during and air raid, there\nwas an air raid, and somebody during that air raid opened up the door of the railcar that we were\nin. Why, I don\u2019t know. I kind of think is that the German guards \u2014 they were SS, they were\nvolunteers to be there, I think knew the allies were right outside the camp because Dachau was\nliberated April 29\". And this was let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s say this was April 20\". And so I think to be maybe\nhe or she, whoever opened the railcar door figured maybe they\u2019d get better treatment. And so\nthat door opened and whoever was strong enough, jumped out. I followed a bunch of Russian\nsoldiers. There must have been 15 or 20 of them that I followed, and it wasn\u2019t too far. We ended\nup on a camp where there were nothing but Hitler youth and a few German soldiers. They were\nnot SS, they were German soldiers, and they were teaching the Hitler youth kids how to fire a\nrifle because at that time now they made everybody defend the Motherland \u2014 the Fatherland. And\nanyhow, the Russians overpowered the few German soldiers. Over half of the Russian soldiers\nwere killed themselves, they were POWs, right, and they didn\u2019t have no weapons. But in groups\nthey just attacked the Germans, and like I say, over half were killed.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Okay, after the Russian soldiers ar \u2014 overpowered the Germans, the Hitler youth, even though\nthey had weapons, but they were so frightened, they just froze. They just looked in awe, and the\nRussians did shoot every one of the Hitler youth, they killed every one of them. And then they\nstarted to move someplace and I wanted to follow them, and they said nein, nein, no you can\u2019t.\nAnd so what I did is I looked at the Hitler youth kids that were dead and took off the uniform of\none of the kids that was my size and put on that uniform. And I followed the railroad tracks,\nbecause I knew there were old Autobahn, the freeway \u2014 not \u2014 not freeway, highway, was right\nnext to the railara \u2014 railroad car. And so I walked towards there and I decided to flag down a car.\nAnd the first car that went by was a German SS car, a Mercedes and two SS officers were in.\nWell, they stopped, and I said I\u2019m \u2014 I need to go back to Berlin, I was at this camp here and\nRussians came by and they killed everybody. I\u2019m the only one that is left aline, and I want \u2014 a-\nalive, I want to go back to Berlin and meet \u2014 and go to my mother. And they said come on in,\njump in, we have a message for Hitler, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to. Now remember, I didn\u2019t \u2014\nthe only language I knew was German. I talked like a German, I was German, except they didn't\nknow I was a German Jew. There were numerous roadblocks from Munich to Berlin, however,\nwe were waived through every roadblock because they were again \u2014 I don\u2019t know what rank they\nwere, but they were high in the SS and they had a little sticker on the windshield, and they hardly\neven ever slowed down for a roadblock, 1t was opened up for them to go through. And they\ndropped me off at Anhalter Bahnhof, which was \u2014 actually, that was our meeting place where we\nalways said if we get separated, this is where we meet, and \u2014 and every day we\u2019d go and meet\nthere. Well, we got to \u2014 I got to Anhalter Bahnhof and there was my mother and brother who\nalmost fainted when they saw me in the Hitler youth uniform. But anyhow, this was \u2014 you see,\nit\u2019s so close to the war and we did then go to the Noelting, the midwife, we went to her home,\nand I did change clothes. I didn\u2019t dare stay in the Hitler youth uniform because they could take\nme like they did take Hitler youth kids and gave them a rifle to defend. So I didn\u2019t want to be in\nthe Hitler youth. In fact, I think my brother and I both, she put Band-Aids on our feet like we\nwere injured, and then put on civilian clothes and that\u2019s really how we lived until the Russians\ncame in.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Well, they were so animal-like. They had, like I say, after some pain, I passed\nout. And by the time \u2014 I was never \u2014 why I didn\u2019t talk, I do not know, I cannot tell you that.\nAnother thing I want to mention, which I think nowadays, I was so thin. I mean when \u2014 after the\nwar, when we lived with the Russians, I think I weighed 50 some pounds and my brother wasn\u2019t\nmuch heavier, that those SS who I got the ride with didn\u2019t recognize tha \u2014 how thin I was. I\nprobably looked more like an eight year old than a 11 year old, but they didn\u2019t see that. I think\ntheir whole thing was to get to Berlin to let Hitler \u2014 probably what I think happened is because\nthey knew the allies were outside, probably to ask Hitler what should be done. They could have\nbeen general officers, I\u2019m \u2014 I don\u2019t know. But, I mean, we practically flew to Berlin. I mean,\nthey drove that Mercedes as fast as it could be driven and of course they\u2019re \u2014 the only vehicles\nyou saw on the Autobahn were military vehicles.",
        "A: It was a cattle car, and this is why even today, right here at this museum, I \u2014 I\u2019ve been here\nfour or five times, I have never been able to step foot in that cattle car that is right here at this\nmuseum.",
        "A: Well, I knew I was going to die. I knew my \u2014 that s \u2014 that I was caught, they\u2019re taking me to a\nconcentration camp, I didn\u2019t know which one and I knew the end of my life was near. And I\naccepted that. And of course my brother and my mother, we all knew that we are living from day\nto day and it could be at any time we could be arrested and put to a concentration camp. I mean,\nwe knew our father went to Auschwitz, we knew that. Even though we thought, again, him being\nan American, he will survive.",
        "A: Yes, yes, we knew and we knew they were gassing Jews.",
        "A: It spread. I believe the \u2014 this midwife told us. But we knew, and th-the word spread. The\nGermans knew it. Of course they said they didn\u2019t know, and now they all say they never knew,\nwhich 1s a lie. They all knew. And of course the way they beat people up into the railcars, I\nmean, not only Jews, also Jehovah Witness was one, gay people and of course Poles or other\nforeigners that were enemies of Germany. And they were just beaten, literally beaten up into the\nrailcars and squeezed together like cattle.",
        "A: No, I would say the Russian soldiers helped me and actually kept me from getting down on\nthe ground, because they knew if I would fall, I wou \u2014 could be dead, because I\u2019d be trampled\non. And I will say the Russian \u2014 incidentally, they treated me well, and treated my brother well\nafter they liberated Berlin.",
        "A: I-In the railcar they treated me very well. They kept me up and made sure that I stand up and\ndon\u2019t try to lie down. And especially, I mean I \u2014 sleepy. You know, I was there at least two days,\nnothing to eat, nothing to drink. But they kept me from lying down.",
        "A: Oh yes. There were \u2014 there was some light coming in daytime, but very little. And with all the\npeople stacked in, it was mostly dark. And it was still \u2014 well again, we were so close together.\nThat\u2019s one good thing, otherwise we would have been freezing. I mean April in Germany still\ngets \u2014 the nights get very cold.",
        "A: Men and women, men and women. And it was very unpleasant. There are things that \u2014 well, I\nwas young enough really, I didn\u2019t know about a woman having a period. I didn\u2019t know about\nthat. Of course, that transpired there. And a lot of people had diarrhea, and again, no sanitation\nfacilities. And it\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what went on there and I\u2019m not the only one that suffered like that.\nAnd \u2014 but again, the railcar was probably as wor \u2014 as bad as having been tortured, because in the\ntorture, so much of it, I passed out. And though I woke up with pain, but still, the railcar was the\nworst thing that could have any \u2014 happened to anybody.",
        "A: You mean in the railcar?",
        "A: No, I think \u2014 I think most of them were in there much longer and were too weak to do\nanything. And I think the Russian soldiers that helped me and were helpful, I think were c-caught\non the eastern part of Berlin, which the Russian came in on. I think they were caught shortly \u2014\nabout the same time I was, or maybe it \u2014 two or three days sooner. But of course they were not\ntortured, they were just loaded on that railcar til 1t was completely full. But I don\u2019t think they\nwere in too long and were still strong enough to survive this ordeal.",
        "A: It meant strictly, that\u2019s it, you\u2019re going to be \u2014 you\u2019re going to be away from this world. It\u2019s \u2014\nto me, I knew death. Of course, remember, I saw my stepbrother kill himself. And I knew he was\ndead, he would never be alive again. And that\u2019s really what it meant to me, I\u2019Il be just like Klaus,\nmy s-stepbrother.",
        "A: No, that\u2019s the thing. My brother, and I think this 1s probably why he can\u2019t remember anything,\nhe feared death, he \u2014 he feared the bombing. We sometimes had to hold him or he would run\nright into the fire, practically. He feared death and I didn\u2019t. I just took it one day at a time and\nalways took it, and I guess I still feel like that today. I mean, I spent time in Korea and I just felt\nlike, when the time comes, I \u2014 I\u2019Il die. And I thought my time was there when I was in the train,\nespecially with all the dead people around me.",
        "A: Yes, I told them where I was at, what happened. And of course, my mother just cried and\nhugged me and so thankful that I survived. And she suspected that 1s what had happened,\nbecause we had never been separated more than a \u2014 a day, never. No, I think one time, my\nmother couldn\u2019t come back and she was gone for one night, but then we got together again. But\nother than that we\u2019ve always spent the nights together, wherever.",
        "A: Well \u2014 that\u2019s right. Well, I think my brother would have done the same thing. Again, maybe\nour mother brainwashed us in there \u2014 in this. And I think maybe this Frau Noelting told us\nwhenever things like happen, what to do, I \u2014 I think, but I just knew what I had to do, especially\nwhen I couldn\u2019t follow the Russians and here I was all alone. And \u2014 and I decided, well, the only\nway I\u2019m going to make it is put on the Hitler youth uniform, and hoping that I wouldn\u2019t be\nforced to take a rifle and start shooting. And again, I didn\u2019t know like, at the time that the allies\nwere out or the \u2014 outside the Dachau camp that the ger \u2014 Russians were outside, I didn\u2019t know\nthat. But I knew, we all knew the war was coming to an end, and we even knew that before I was\narrested. We knew it was the end of the war coming. Well, we knew that and th-the word spread.\nPeople, Germans that were against the regime weren't afraid to talk any more that much. And I\nused to hear people say, look at all those tanks there \u2014 to other people \u2014 look at those tanks,\nthere\u2019s not enough gasoline to operate the tanks, they\u2019re out of gas. And so the Germans weren\u2019t\nquite as afraid any more. But of course afterwards, and I \u2014 I do know women, I know men that\nwould say, oh we\u2019re \u2014 we have a secret weapon. This just when the Russians were really fighting\nfor Berlin, where we were, we have secret weapons and they going to take them, they\u2019re going to\nkill the \u2014 all the Russians that are coming in. There were still those fanatics around and I heard\nwomen say, oh, if these Russians should come in, I\u2019m going to pour boiling water on them. And\nPll do everything, they\u2019ll never get me, I'll kill them, and so forth. Of course, after the Russians\ncame in, oh how sweet you are. And \u2014 and honestly, the Russians would wa \u2014 rape the women\nright out in daylight in the street. Again, things I didn\u2019t know until 1t came true. And you know, I\nhad no remorse on those women that used to \u2014 I used to hear in the train station that they are\ngoing to kill the Russian, they are going to knife them to death or they\u2019re gonna put boiling\nwaters on them. That\u2019s how they felt then, and then they were friends. So, the Russians that came\ninto Berlin were completely uneducated. They had no common sense, and they were \u2014 in fact, I\nwouldn\u2019t be surprised if those were released prisoners, because the Russian \u2014 I think the front\nline soldiers were maybe from Siberia, or people that were politically arrested or other \u2014 some\nreason other arrest. And they were \u2014 they were not the nicest people, and yet to us kids, they\ntreated us well. And of \u2014 of course after Berlin was divided between the Russians, the French,\nthe British and the U.S. troops, we then went to live with this midwife.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: What happened, we went to the Russian soldiers and we found somebody that spoke German\n\u2014no, we even found a Jewish soldier. We found a Russian Jewish soldier who spook \u2014 spoke\nYiddish. And so we communicated in Yiddish and said we were hungry and we told them we\nwere Yiddish, right? And they gave us food, they gave us water. They actually nourished us back\na little bit.",
        "A: Yes, we felt liberated.",
        "A: Freedom, food. We can talk freely. We don\u2019t have to worry about being arrested by the Nazis.\nWe don\u2019t have to worry about being beaten or spit upon by other German kids. That\u2019s what it\nmeant, it just meant full freedom. And \u2014 and after we received food and everything from the\nRussians, we then \u2014 this Russian soldier, I don\u2019t know what his rank was, or what, but he was \u2014\nthis Jewish soldier was a little bit more educated and we became the guide to his officer, and\nshowed him where to go in Berlin from point A to point B, because we knew it so well.",
        "A: We were still living with the Russians, very close to this Anhalter Bahnhof, the train station\nwhere our mother was killed, we think. In fact, this soldier wa \u2014 by the time we went back\noutside the train station, our mother was not \u2014 there was nobody by this fire hydrant. And that\nJewish soldier did try to find our mother, but couldn\u2019t. So we do not know if she was taken to\nRussia or buried, or what.",
        "A: Right. But then after \u2014 after the division between the Russians, the \u2014 and the Americans when\nBerlin was divided up in sectors, and then we went to live with that midwife, we knew that \u2014 that\n\u2014 we found out that the people that were in concentration camp by that time would have been\nback in Berlin or we would have known and our father would have known to get in touch with\nthis midwife. And when he didn't \u2014 and the same thing with our mother \u2014 we knew our mother \u2014\nagain, we didn't know, and of course, I still don\u2019t know. Even today I don\u2019t know if our mother\ndied in this crossfire or if she was sent to Russia, because the Russians did take thousands of \u2014 of\nkids and women to Russia. I\u2019m sure you are aware of that. And so that, we don\u2019t know. We did,\nbefore we came to the U.S., we had to identify our mother, and we had to get a birth ad \u2014-a\u2014a-\u2014\na death certificate of our mother. And we said well, we don\u2019t know. Well, if you want to leave\nGermany you need to have a death certificate. So there were a whole bunch of people and so we\njust identified yes, that was our mother. They showed us pictures of several people, I said yes,\nthat\u2019s our mother, so we could get a death certificate. But if she really died there, we don\u2019t know.",
        "A: For a\u2014",
        "A: Well, I\u2014I\u2019m not sure. There must be records. When \u2014 when Berlin was divided into the four\nsectors, it was until the division, we stayed with the Russians. One thing is, we were their guide,\nbut trains didn\u2019t run and things like this, until the division really, and wa \u2014 there was no way we\ncould have gotten to Schoneberg to the \u2014 to the midwife, and we didn\u2019t even know if she was\nstill alive or \u2014 or what. But it was after the di-division that we went to Schoneberg, to the\nmidwife.",
        "A: Well, you saw the picture of the synagogue, but no that was \u2014 no, I didn\u2019t, no.",
        "A: At the very beginning no, we did not meet anyone that was in hiding. No, I\u2019m co \u2014 incorrect\nthere. I know of about two or three people that also received this concentration camp I.D. that\nwere not in hiding, that were out of concentration camps, because the Russian government, or the\nRussian military produced these I.D.\u2019s that we were in concentration camp very close to where I\nwas at at that Anhalter Bahnhof. And I \u2014 I did meet two or three people, elderly people that did\nget out of a concentration camp and also received this I.D. But as far as people that were living\nin hiding, at that time no, I ha \u2014 did not meet anyone.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: To the midwife. And of course \u2014 she actually signed us up, we did go to a German school\nthere after the war for a little bit, but not very long, about two months.",
        "A: Yes, she took us back in and \u2014",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 we assumed our real name and she even provided clothing for us because we wore\npractically rags. But we weren\u2019t the only Germans that wore rags, you couldn\u2019t buy clothing\nduring the war. But anyhow, she got us some clothing and signed us up to a school. And I think\nshe started me in the second grade and my brother in the third grade in Germany. But we only\nwent to that school for about a month or two, and then the British military, they inherited what\nused to be a\u2014a rest and cu \u2014 recuperation camp outside of Berlin, about three or four hours drive\nout of Berlin in Luneburg, and where the Germans had a rest and recuperation camp. And they\ntook a bunch of \u2014 at that time now, kids that were either in hiding or in concentration camp, they\nlooked those people up, including my brother and I, and in British ambulances they drove us to\nthis former [indecipherable] camp in Luneburg, where we were nursed \u2014 we were given\ncomplete physical examinations and we were nursed back into health. And that is straight \u2014\nbefore we went to that camp, my brother and I then got to know some of the Jewish American\nsoldiers who opened up the synagogue, and this one, Werner Nathan was his name, a private in\nthe U.S. Army, and he is the one that actually was responsible in opening up that synagogue at\nRosh Hashanah, and he got us in touch, or got the Joint Distribution Committee 1n touch with us,\nwho sponsored us to come to the States. Well, trying to. And while we were waiting to co-come\nto the U.S., we went to this rest camp that the British sponsored, that should have been for, I\nthink eight weeks. For two months. Well, we were there about three months when a American\nsoldier, not Werner Nathan, some other American soldier came, looked for us and says we are\ngoing to be coming to the United States. We have our \u2014 our visas and we\u2019re going to come to the\nU.S. So we left that camp early, went back to Berlin and he drove us back to Berlin and I don\u2019t\nknow if it was a private vehicle or U.S. Army vehicle, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: No. Nobody wanted to talk about it. They didn\u2019t really want to talk about it, including me. We\njust survived, and some of them were living in conditions like \u2014 you know, maybe in a ceiling\nsomeplace and never saw daylight. Or somehow that they had \u2014 maybe people hid them, and\nreally hid them. And mo \u2014 and lot of the kids I know were in \u2014 out in farms someplace. And \u2014\nbut again, lived in hiding where nobody knew that they were in that \u2014 a farmhouse. And \u2014 but\nnobody really wanted to talk about it too much.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think \u2014 even me at the time, I was still thinking, is this real? Am I really free? And\nyeah \u2014 and nobody asked. I may mention something here. Two years ago I met a woman, she too\nwas in this rest camp. We met each other in Prague at the Child Survivors of the Holocaust\nconference. And \u2014 but if \u2014 we just didn\u2019t talk about it. And when I went back to Berlin after they\nrescue \u2014 recuperating, and my brother and I, and we told the midwife, Frau Noelting that we\nwere going to America. And oh, she was upset. She says, you\u2019re German, you can\u2019t go. But we\ndid.",
        "A: After the \u2014 Berlin was divided, again our father being an American and being pretty much\ntold that we\u2019re going to come to \u2014 go to America some day, we went to a U.S. Army camp. And\nwhere we lived in Schoneberg was the w \u2014 American sector, fortunately enough. And so we just\nwent to an army camp and we started telling at the front gate really, 1s there anybody here that\nspeaks German? And most of them don\u2019t, you know, and \u2014 and says yes, and they called this one\nprivate out, which was Werner Nathan. He is ori \u2014 was originally from Austria and they went to\nthe States before the war. If he is alive he\u2019d be in his 80\u2019s now. And anyhow, we talked with him\n\u2014 and he was very Orthodox, too. And he says, well he\u2019s in the process of finding a synagogue\nand they found a synagogue, the only synagogue in Berlin that was not burned. And that he was\nopening up that synagogue for Rosh Hashanah. And that\u2019s really how we met him.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And he 1s the one that contacted the Joint Distribution Committee in New York.",
        "A: Yes. This is a picture, and here is my brother and I at the Rosh Hashanah services right here\nin this picture.",
        "A: Thanking God that we are alive, and \u2014 and afterwards this so \u2014 Werner Nathan forced us to\nstudy a little bit more Hebrew, and the various prayers. And I think it was a month or two later\nthat we \u2014 maybe not even that long, I don\u2019t know exactly, is when we became Bar Mitzvah. My\nbrother and I were the first two Jewish boys Bar Mitzvah in Berlin after the war.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Right, well, having been away from really, the Jewish religion for all these war years, we\nwere taught by this American serviceman, who was very Orthodox, and he probably knew as\nmuch as a rabbi, and he made sure that we learned all the prayers and says we have to be Bar\nMitzvah. And even though I was only 12 years old and my brother were 13, he recruited one of\nthe Jewish chaplains fr \u2014 chaplains from his American company in the army and we were\nofficially Bar Mitzvah, went through all the various prayers. And I do not know the exactly \u2014\nexact date, but I would say it was some time in 1946 and probably I would \u2014 I\u2019m guessing now,\nbetween March and April of 1946 when we were Bar Mitzvah, becau \u2014",
        "A: Ah, no I wa \u2014 that\u2019s correct, I was 13 in January, so I was th \u2014 that\u2019s right, I was 13 and my\nbrother was 14. And of course, he was a year late before he could be Bar Mitzvah.",
        "A: Yes, we\u2019ve always wanted to be Bar Mitzvah. I mean, even though we were never very\nreligious, we were very conservative, but 1t was always our parents saying that when \u2014 I\nremember always saying when my brother becomes 13 years old he\u2019s going to be a man, he\u2019s\ngoing to be Bar Mitzvah. And the same thing was true with me. And yes, I did want to be Bar\nMitzvah and we were very proud when we became Bar Mitzvah.",
        "A: No, that I do not remember. I do not remember, but I know there was a big party afterwards,\nat that synagogue, and it was a \u2014 a day of celebration, but what we did, I do not remember, but it\nwas probably the most enjoyable time in our lives, from the day I can remember.",
        "A: A lot of Jewish, as well \u2014 Jewish U.S. soldiers, Russian soldiers and I\u2019m not sure but I \u2014\nsomething in my back of the mind, I\u2014 I\u2019m sure that the midwife\u2019s stepdaughter, who was a\nphotographer, I believe she took pictures. I do not have any of those pictures, but I b \u2014 do believe\nshe was there taking pictures. And that\u2019s all I can really remember.",
        "A: Of course it was. We missed our mother, we wished our father could have been there even\nthough we knew the fact that he was dead and perished in Auschwitz. And so we \u2014 but we did\nmiss our mother and again in \u2014 in th \u2014 at that time we still were not sure, we did not know\nwhether she was still alive, or \u2014 or dead. We didn\u2019t know that, so yes, it was very, very hard not\nhaving our mother there, though we celebrated, it was joyous. But we still wished that our\nmother could have been there.",
        "A: Oh yes, all the time, we \u2014 whenever we learned of a place that had records, and regardless\nwhat section, whether it \u2014 whether it was French, British or what, we\u2019d go over there and see if\nwe could find anything on our mother. But we, of course, never found anything.",
        "A: I do not recall her coming, but I \u2014 I\u2019m not 100 percent sure if her daughter came, but I \u2014 I\nreally believe she did come and took fi \u2014 pictures, but I\u2019m almost positive that Frau Noelting\nnever did come to it.",
        "A: That is correct, they had a big celebration that we had food, and we had fruits that we haven\u2019t\n\u2014 had never seen, like a banana. We almost didn\u2019t know how to peel a banana and I believe we\nhad banana the first time since the war. I do remember that.",
        "A: Oh, very much so. We\u2019ve been very close, even though after we got older and came to the\nU.S., just like brothers one year apart used to fight and argue, which we did, too, but still we\nwere very close and even today we\u2019re still very close.",
        "A: No, we never did, even when we came to the States, we hardly ever talked about the war\nyears. It\u2019s something that \u2014 and it was probably more so my brother than me. He just did not\nwant to talk about it and so I didn\u2019t. He \u2014 he took the whole thing a lot harder than I did, I\nbelieve.",
        "A: Oh, oh, oh, that, yes, most people that were \u2014 that have survived from a concentration camp,\nthat were in a concentration camp, first in Berlin were given a little identification by the Russian\nsoldiers, it was in German and Russian, indicating that we were discriminated against and have\nsurvived a concentration camp. And it was a red sheet of paper with the concentration camp\nlogo. And once we \u2014 if \u2014 when we held that certificate going through lines, buying food or other\nitems, we could just hold that and could go to the front of the line. And there was not a single\nGerman that ever complained, us going to the front of the line. In fact, they turned the other way,\nthey didn\u2019t even want to see this concentration camp logo, they all knew what it was. And we\nhad full privileges, even when we took a train. Shortly after the war, some of the trains started\nrunning again in Berlin, and we could go to the train, never had to pay to ride the trains, I mean\nwe had a free hand in Berlin right after the war.",
        "A: The original apartment \u2014 well, the apartment where th \u2014 I call it the ghetto type of a\napartment, where we were forced to live, that was bombed out. That was no longer in existence.\nHowever, both of the stores, the first store that I remember as a very small child, that my father\nhad in Petsalozzi(ph) strasse and not very far, couple of blocks from there in Leipne(ph) strasse,\nwhich was the street where \u2014 that suffered from the Kristallnacht, that store was still in existence.\nAnd I don\u2019t recall us visiting either one of those stores right after the war, before we came to the\nStates. But I went back to Berlin for my first time in 1975, I believe, and I did visit that store.\nAnd it didn\u2019t change much, and I just, a year ago in berli \u2014 in April, a year ago when I was in\nBerlin, I did visit it and of course there\u2019s the one on Leipne(ph) strasse was for rent and the one\non Petsalozzi(ph) strasse, there was a Chinese family living there and also they had a store of\nChinese artifacts and souvenir type items. In fact, I stopped and talked with them. Their son, it so\nhappened, graduated from the University of California, spoke pretty good English and I talked\nwith him for probably close to an hour. And he found it very interesting that as a child I was\nliving at that place, at a \u2014 it did some \u2014 was some major remodeling done and more space. Well,\nwe had two bedrooms and a kitchen and a bathroom 1n that store when we lived there before the\nKristallnacht. A-And now it had some much nicer and more roomy type of bedrooms and it was\nalmost like a very comfortable type of an apartment.",
        "A: If he was, I\u2019m not aware of it. I don\u2019t think so because he still was a soldier and I think he was\na company cook and he still had to do his duties there and in his off time he worked with us. So I\ndoubt very much that he helped others, because we were not as a group. He worked with us\nstrictly as individuals.",
        "A: No, we did not. We \u2014 the only word of English I knew was hello, goodbye and where\u2019s the\nbathroom? And thank you. I think my brother learned a few more words of English. But\nincidentally, both my brother and I were able to communicate in Russian. We were not fluent,\nbut we were able to communicate in Russian pretty good, because we\u2019ve lived with the Russians\nfor about 90 days.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. We were able to, and like I say, communicate and pick up, right. I have\ncompletely forgotten it, I still know a few words, but I could not carry on a conversation and I\ncan understand very little.",
        "A: Okay, again, I think the Bar Mitzvah was in the spring of 1946 and we left Berlin in\nSeptember 1946.",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe we did. I don\u2019t recall that we received any gifts. We were just so happy to be\namongst our own without fear of being arrested. That was a gift alone.",
        "A: At the time, yes. The \u2014 we didn\u2019t meet too many of them, but yes, they treated us well, and I\nwas somewhat connected, but not as much as once the Americans came in. I mean, we didn't\neven keep track of the Russian and Jewish soldiers, except some of them were at the Bar\nMitzvah. But we pretty much got connected to the American Jewish soldiers, both enlisted men\nas well as officers. I even remember some of the names, Lieutenant Nowalski(ph), who helped us\nout, and there were a few other officers. And the only names I can remember was Lieutenant\nNowalski(ph) and Private Werner Nathan.",
        "A: No, I wished I would know. I don\u2019t know the address, I \u2014 I do not know the name, but I do\nknow it was the only synagogue not burned out, not burned by the Germans.",
        "A: After the war? Well again, we went to school for two or three months after the war, and we\nplayed with them and I still sensed there was some prejudice towards the Jews by some of them.\nBut like I have shown you this \u2014 this is \u2014 the funny thing is is how I knew there was a write-up in\nthis British magazine, The Illustrated. And there were \u2014 was a picture of my brother and I in that\nIllustrated. It was a German kid whose parents knew English and subscribed to that magazine.\nAnd they are the ones that showed us that magazine with our pictures in it.",
        "A: That is the issue I am talking about. And it was really one Jewish boy that was in our class\nafter the war, in Berlin, that brought that magazine to school and showed it to us.",
        "A: They were not friendly to us aft \u2014 they know \u2014 knew we were Jewish. They could \u2014 they\ncould see me go in front of a line to buy a loaf of bread, and they resented that. The adults, they\ndidn\u2019t say a word, but th-the kids resented that. Of course, they probably didn\u2019t understand why\nwe had those privileges. But I-I di \u2014 definitely saw resentment.",
        "A: Not that I notice it. Not that I notice. I have notice anti-Semitism, especially in Munich in the\nlast five years.",
        "A: Okay. Werner \u2014 we again explained to Werner \u2014 fortunately he was fluent in German, as he\ncame from Austria \u2014 that our father was an American citizen, died in Auschwitz and we want to\ncome \u2014 go to America. And again he did, on his own, he contacted the Joint Distribution\nCommittee in New York, and a-again, I don\u2019t remember how long it took, but I know in the\nmeantime we went to Luneburg where we went to a recuperation camp sponsored by the British\nmilitary, who put us back into health. And it was an American soldier \u2014 in fact, I think it was that\nLieutenant Nowalski(ph) that picked us up from Luneburg, took us back to Berlin and it was \u2014\nagain, that must have been in late August, because September seventh we left Bremerhaven on\nthe SS Marine Marlin, that was the ship, and went to New York. And besides \u2014 just recently I\nmet an old man in Seattle, who was a seaman on the sister ship of the SS Marine Marlin, who\nalso brought Jewish immigrants to the U.S. And usually people don\u2019t know anything about,\nnever heard of a SS Marine Marlin, and he knew right away, he said that that was his \u2014 the \u2014 his\nsister ship. So it\u2019s quite a small world.",
        "A: I felt more \u2014 I was German and I acted like a German during the war, living under false or\nassumed names. But the day we walked onto the ship, it was the greatest feeling you can\nimagine. And \u2014",
        "A: No, we did not. We didn\u2019t want anything. Like when the Russians came into Berlin we \u2014 my\nbrother and I each picked up some very expensive Leica cameras from photography stores.\nEverybody else took it, so we took some of this belongings. They took our belongings, the\nGerman. But we did not want anything German. We did not bring anything back that was\nGerman. We \u2014 on the ship, we made a few dollars on the ship. Well, I did, my brother got too\nseasick. He was sick most of the way across. For some reason I did not get seasick. And pe \u2014\nother refugees that were on the ship wanted to buy shaving cream or things that was in the \u2014 that\nyou could purchase on the ship. And they didn\u2019t want to stay in line and so I used to stay in line\nfor \u2014 for them and buy what they wanted. In fact here\u2019s a \u2014 I still remember this one gentleman\nwanted chewing gum. And I purchased and I took the German pronunciation for ch-chewing\ngum, which would be shaving gum, and instead of getting chewing gum for him, I ended up with\na tube of shaving cream. I still remember that. And I ended up \u2014 I have finally ended up selling it\nto somebody else, because he wanted chewing gum, not shaving cream.",
        "A: I would say 99 percent were refugees, and again those were people either that were \u2014 survived\nat a concentration camp or lived in hiding someplace, somewhere so \u2014 somewhere.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t believe \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to, my brother didn\u2019t want to and I don\u2019t think anyone\naboard wanted to talk about what they went through. It\u2019s \u2014 yes, they wanted to get that out of\ntheir mind.",
        "A: It took 10 days. We left September seventh, we arrived \u2014 when I saw the Statue of Liberty in\nNew York, that was September 17\". Greatest sight you can see.",
        "A: Oh, it was great. Something that we thought we would never see. And there were quite a few\nkids like us, orphan kids on that ship, again, also sponsored by the Joint Distribution Committee,\nmost of them had no parents. And they were like we were, maybe some of them thought they had\na relative there, but again didn't know. And again, it was representatives from the Joint that\npicked us up and took us to 441 Caldwell Avenue, Brooklyn \u2014 I mean, Bronx, New York. And of\ncourse we were fed and treated wonderfully. And the next day we were interviewed by German\nspeaking people, and \u2014",
        "A: No, it was a\u2014 I really would say like an orphan home. It was for children, and we were in\nthere and they had beds, several beds in a room. And they, of course, separated the boys and the\ngirls.",
        "A: And then, of course, we told them that we had two uncles someplace in the U.S. And they\nsaid well, were they from Germany? And we said yes, they were originally from Breslau, now\nber \u2014 Poland. And they said, well there is a newspaper that has a nationwide publication plus\nCanada. Of course, we didn\u2019t know Canada was a neighbor of the U.S. at the time. But they said\nthey will put an ad in the \u201cAufbau\u201d and see if our uncles \u2014 at that time we still thought they were\nuncles \u2014 if our uncles by any chance were to read that newspaper, as most German speaking Jews\nwere subscribers to that newspaper. Well, our uncles did not read it, but very good friends of\ntheirs in Saint Louis, Missouri read that ad. And there were pages and pages and pages of kids or\nadults looking for people and most of them \u2014 it was arranged alphabetically, I believe, the ads,\nand these friends of my uncles, which turned out to be cousins, read that and called them. They\nwere in Saint Louis, and my cousins \u2014 we\u2019|I call them my true things, my cousins from my\nfather\u2019s side, were called up and said there are two kids, just came from Berlin and they are\nlooking for Alfred and Felix tau \u2014 Taucher. And of course that\u2019s when we learned they were\ncousins. And my cousins were both brothers and they had just, actually not that long ago had\ncome to the U.S., because one cousin lived in Shanghai during the war, while the other one lived\nin South America. But apparently they had kept in touch all through the war and they ended up\nin Joplin, Missouri. How they ended up in Joplin, I have no idea. But Joplin is a small\ncommunity of about 35,000 people, and that\u2019s where they ended up. And since they were in\nJoplin when we were found, but they were single people, there was no woman in the house, the\nsocial welfare agency, Jewish social fe \u2014 agency wouldn\u2019t let us live there and so we went to live\nwith foster parents in Kansas City, Missouri. A family by the name of Levinson, and he was a\nvery Orthodox rabbi and of course very kosher and we lived with them for probably four or five\nmonths. But we had really problems living together, because we were not raised Orthodox. And\nso then we were moved into \u2014 in to another family.",
        "A: Yes, we started th \u2014 both of us started in the eight grade. Now remember, my brother went\nthrough the third grade, I went the second grade of school in Germany. Even after the war, the\nshort time we went to the German school then was still only the second grade, didn\u2019t know\nEnglish. But we went to school in Kansas City, Missouri for two years, and they assigned a\nteacher to us who knew a little bit of German, not very much. She was Jewish, Mrs. Weinberg,\nand she worked as \u2014 worked with us \u2014 tutored us to learn English. And what my brother and I did\nafter we started school, we took a German English dictionary and just studied it page by page,\nword for word. And after awhile it got so that we used words that the English teachers didn\u2019t\nunderstand, or we used it in the wrong context. And my brother then \u2014 this was in the ninth\ngrade, I believe, I had a different English teacher than my brother did and my English teacher,\nshe says \u2014 a Miss Ulrichi, she says, Fred, you have to buy some comic books and start reading\ncomic books. I don\u2019t care what comic books you read, but buy comic books and you will have\nthe \u2014 a much \u2014 maybe not the best grammar in the world, but you will get English that is being\nused every day. And I will say it really helped. Reading the comics, I had a \u2014 seeing the pictures\nand getting most of it out, I probably learned more English from that than anything.",
        "A: Oh, ba \u2014 my \u2014 my cousin who we lived with then, after Kansas City when we moved to Joplin\n\u2014 oh, I should say that. We went to school in Kansas City for two years, and then my \u2014 in the\nmeantime my cousin brought in one of their aunts who was in Israel, at that time I believe still\nknown as Palestine. Well, it was \u201948 when Palestine was \u2014 became an independent state. And\nthey brought her there to Joplin from Israel and then we were permitted to live with them, and\nwe went to the 10\", 11\" and 12\" grade in Joplin, Missouri.",
        "A: We changed our name when we \u2014 we became citizen. Actually, I did not change my name\nfrom Horst Alfred until after I got out of the army. Maybe we should go back to that later. I\nfinished high school, my brother finished high school.",
        "A: Not at all. We \u2014 in fact, we were asked to speak at assemblies about our \u2014 some of our lives in\nGermany and Berlin during the war. And didn\u2019t really want to talk about \u2014 we didn\u2019t talk to a lot\nof the detail because we were ashamed to talk about it. For instance, I didn\u2019t want to talk, in fact\nI didn\u2019t tell anybody I was in a concentration camp or in a train, I was too ashamed of it,\nespecially how I was caught. I mean, no 12 year old kid wants to talk about why they were\ncaught. And we didn\u2019t say that we were in a concentration camp, but we just talked what it was\nlife, the bombing and how it was life, living in fear, trying not to get caught. And that\u2019s really\nmost of the things that we talked about to other kids. But we were very well accepted by the kids.\nWe made a lot of friends. In fact, both my brother and I go to reunion. In fact we have, in\nSeptember, we have the 50\" year reunion coming up in Joplin, which I plan to attend and so does\nmy brother. And we\u2019ve made a lot of friends there.",
        "A: Very much so. Not in sports so much, but I actually was in ROTC, Reserved Officer\u2019s\nTraining. And we had rifle teams, we had drill teams a \u2014 which I participated. I also belonged to\na \u2014 to various clubs, like the Key Club, which is the forerunners, I think to the Kiwanis, and I\nwas very active. My brother was not too active, my brother \u2014 actually, my a\u2014 one of our cousins\nwho we lived with was a pianist and he also taught piano, and my brother always wanted to learn\nthe piano. So while I was involved in a lot of school activity, my brother practiced and played the\npiano, but he, which I was not, got to really enjoy playing baseball, and learned \u2014 and became a\nvery good baseball player. And he belonged to a baseball team, a high school baseball team and\nso forth. And that\u2019s where his activity was, while mine was in drill teams and rifle teams and\nKiwanis clubs and so forth. In fact, I even learned how to be a speaker. And this is why I do a lot\nof speaking engagements now and it doesn\u2019t bother me to be \u2014 be speak in front of public, or\neven on TV, where I\u2019ve taught many, many times.",
        "A: Yes, I did. I felt \u2014 after I got pretty proficient in English, in fact when I went in the U.S.\nArmy, five years after coming here, nobody believed me that I was a \u2014 originally from Germany,\nI spoke English like an American, rather than a foreigner. Through the years I started speaking\nGerman again, also learned Japanese and I speak both languages. And so I \u2014 it seems like I\u2019ve\nreacquired an accent.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: Graduated from high school in 1951 and then I applied to go to the University of Missouri\nlaw school, since I had two uncles from my mother\u2019s side that were lawyers. We also had uncles\nthat were dentists, mostly from our mother\u2019s side. In fact, I know of one uncle who was in\nShanghai during the war, and I met somebody in Seattle who \u2014 whose dentist was my uncle in\nShanghai. But anyhow \u2014",
        "A: I applied after I got out of high school, I applied to go to the University of Missouri and then\neventually go into law school, right? Well, when I took the entrance examination for the\nUniversity of Missouri, apparently my score on the English part of the test was above average.\nAnd I was told that I cheated because the results of the test score was much higher than it\npossibly could have been with the lack of education I have had and the short time that I have\nbeen in the U.S. I did ask to take the test over again, but back in 1951 that was not done. At \u2014\ntimes have changed today. But so \u2014 since I could not go to the University of Missouri, I didn\u2019t\nreally know what I wanted to study then, because my goal was to be a lawyer, just like my\nparents wanted me to be a lawyer, my brother to be a dentist. And so I was 18 and a half years\nold, or almost. They were just starting to draft 18 and a half year olds, so I decided to join the\narmy and get that out of my \u2014 out of my life here. And so I joined the army.",
        "A: That was ko \u2014 during the Korean war. And after I took my basic training in Fort Leonard\nWood, Missouri, I was assigned to a replacement company there as a company clerk. And then\none of the generals who was reassigned from Fort Leonard Wood, who was reassigned to\nGermany, wanted a native speaking German to be his driver in Germany. So I was picked to be\nthe driver for this general, since I was a native speaking German. But I, at that time I was not\nprepared to go back to Germany, and since I was still a citizen of the u \u2014 of Germany, I did not\nhave to go.",
        "A: I was still a non-citizen. Now, I did take \u2014 this was kind of odd \u2014 I did take the examination\nfor citizenship in Rolla, Missouri, a small city near Fort Leonard Wood. In fact this was a college\ntown, I think it was a \u2014 still is a very well known engineering school. And this is where, in that\ncity, I took my exam for citizenship. In fact, one of the questions that I was asked by the\nexaminer \u2014 and I was in U.S. Army uniform, I was a corporal at the time \u2014 and this examiner,\none of the questions asked, if I were called to serve in the U.S. military in time of war, would I\ndo that? And I looked at him, I said, well... And he says yes, I \u2014 I\u2019m sorry that I have to ask that,\nbut that \u2014 that is the rule, and I realize you are in the military. It k-kind of struck me odd. And\nanyhow, I took my citizenship examination, which I passed. Of course, it was everything I had\nlearned in high school, in government and so forth. Was a \u2014 to me \u2014 for me it was a very simple\nexam. And it was really about \u2014 shortly wi \u2014 thereafter, when I had the orders to go to Germany,\nbut then I looked up the Jewish chaplain in Forth Leonard Wood, and I told him a little bit of my\nstory, and of course he got my a \u2014 says no, I don\u2019t have to go and they canceled my order to\nGermany. But abou \u2014",
        "A: I-I still had too many bad memories in Germany. And the feeling there, I just was not\nprepared. And I also \u2014 besides that, I didn\u2019t want to be a driver for a general. I wanted to learn\nsomething while I was in the military rather than drive a car around and be what I considered a\nnursemaid. And so my orders three days later were for Korea. And I had a two weeks leave, went\nback to Joplin, visited my friends and said the goodbyes and everything. And I went to Fort\nLewis, Washington, which is about a fr \u2014 one hour drive out of Seattle. And I kind of fell in love\nwith that part of the country and I said to myself, if I make it back alive from Korea, this is going\nto be home. And I went to Korea and that was 1952.",
        "A: Proud. I was very proud to be wearing the army uniform. And I think this is why I made, even\nthrough the enlisted rating, I made rank much faster than ma \u2014 the average American citizen\ncounterpart. While these people complained about the military and they didn\u2019t want to work, I\ndid my duty and I was proud of it. And I believe this is why in Korea, even though there were\nsergeants that were 15 years in the army, I passed them up and received the rank of warrant\nofficer appointment, when others way ahead of me should have received it. It was probably a\nresponsibility I had at my age that I shouldn\u2019t have had. I was only 20 years old when I became a\nwarrant officer. 21 years old, I guess. But I always felt proud to be an American soldier.",
        "A: In Korea I \u2014 my fir \u2014 my first duties were to code reports that came from the front lines, and\npick out the soldiers that were killed in action, wounded in action, missing, and I also had the\nlocator; an assignment I wasn\u2019t supposed to have had as I was not a U.S. citizen, but I had that\nassignment. And then I got \u2014 those papers I got ready to be put into, which now are computers, in\nthose times they were machine accounting, we programmed them with \u2014 through plugboard\nwires and punch cards. And the man that was really in charge and doing the actual operating of\nthe equipment was a warrant officer. Well, he was killed driving over a mine and \u2014 which I\ndidn\u2019t know, but he \u2014 he was late in bringing the reports in, which I had to code, for him to\nprocess through. But instead of him coming in, the \u2014 a colonel came in and stuck a couple of\nwarrant officers\u2019 bars on my shoulder, tore off my sergeant stripes and says, you have just been\nappointed to a warrant officer, you are going to be \u2014 replace Mr. Eberhart(ph) \u2014 a warrant officer\nis addressed as mister \u2014 who was killed in action, and we will have a replacement for you\nshortly. After my replacement came in, they assigned another warrant officer to that unit and sent\nme to Japan for three weeks, where I learned how to operate those machines. And after three\nweeks I went back to Korea and continued the duties as a warrant officer.",
        "A: I see \u2014 saw a lot of bodies.",
        "A: No, it did not. It did not remind me at all. Is \u2014 was sad, seeing American soldiers dead, but it\ndi \u2014 it was not even close to reminding me what it was like in the railroad car, because first of all,\nin the railroad car it was dark and you \u2014 most of the time you couldn\u2019t see the bodies, you\ncouldn\u2019t see the faces. And even if you could, you didn\u2019t want to. And you just saw people that\nwere dead and I never related that. I felt sorrow for the poor American soldiers that were killed.\nAnd again, it\u2019s just like I felt that way ever since a child in \u2014 during my life in Germany, that\nwhen my time is up I\u2019m going to go, and if not, P\u2019Il keep on going and living.",
        "A: Until the very tail end of the war, which I believe was September or October of 53, I\u2019m not\nquite sure. And after Korea I was transferred to Tokyo, where I was stationed for nine months.\nAnd actually \u2014 well, not at the time, I \u2014 I took up the martial arts over there, I took both judo and\nkarate. And my instructor introduced me to his sister, who was Japanese, of course. And \u2014 and I\nfell in love and applied to get married. But as an officer \u2014 at that time an officer could not marry\noutside the race unless you go back to an enlisted rating. So I was due to be discharged then, so I\nwent back to the States, took my discharge and then went back to Japan to get married. We were\nmarried in excess of 40 years but we are divorced now, but we\u2019re still friends.",
        "A: Yes, I did. Yes, I was married by the American consul in Tokyo. And \u2014 oh, one thing I should\nmention. While I was heading to Korea, the army sent my immigration records and citizenship\nrecords \u2014 that\u2019s to be a citizen, to Germany, where my assignment was supposed to \u2014 where the\nfirst orders for it \u2014 for Germany. By the time everything got caught up I was going back to the\nStates to be discharged. So I \u2014 when I got \u2014 before I got discharged again, being a warrant\nofficer, an officer had to be a citizen before they can get discharged from the military. So I had to\ntake a 10 day leave of absence, which I wanted to get paid for and the army arranged a special\ncitizenship exam for me in Rolla, Missouri, where all my records were still, where I was taking\nmy \u2014 took my examination. And they had a special hearing for me to sworn in as a citizen. Then\nI had to go back \u2014 I was at that time stationed at Fort Carlson, Colorado, and I had to go back to\nFort Carlson, get my discharge.",
        "A: And then to be au\u2014a U.S. citizen, the greatest feeling that could ha \u2014 happen to \u2014 could have\nhappened to me. And again, I was proud that I could serve in the U.S. Army, and even more\nproud then, to be a citizen.",
        "A: No, I did not. I did not go to school. My \u2014 then my goal was to go back to Japan to get\nmarried.",
        "A: And I got a job \u2014 at that time, U.S. military people stoo \u2014 air force, navy, I\u2014 I should say air\nforce, Marines and army were still going overseas to Korea, even though it was after the war, to\nKorea or Japan on ships. And I took a job a\u2014 on the military sea transportation service, that\u2019s a\ncivilian group. We were taking troops overseas and bringing them back. And I took a job on one\nof those ships and got good pay and went back to Japan to get married. And came back after my\nmarriage and took a job in \u2014 again I\u2019Il call it computers, in the \u2014 doing the same thing except \u2014 e-\nexcept I wasn\u2019t te \u2014 keeping track of casualties, my first job was working for an insurance\ncompany where I operated the machine accounting.",
        "A: I went to Seattle. I went back to Missouri, visit my cousins and took some of the belongings I\nhad there and went back to Seattle.",
        "A: No, no, she came \u2014 she didn't come o-over until about six or seven months later. Since I was a\nnaturalized citizen, and a new naturalized citizen, it took me quite some time to get a passport for\nher. And since I was in Seattle, Washington, all my \u2014 again, my immigration and naturalization\npaper were in Missouri, I had to apply for her visa through Missouri, and it was a \u2014 quite a\nlengthy operation.",
        "A: Okay, she came over here and about a year later we had our first son. And six years later we\nhad a daughter.",
        "A: I worked then \u2014 at that time I worked for a trucking company, again in machine accounting,\nand in 1960 I set up a com \u2014 this is when the first part of the computers came around\n[indecipherable] programming computers, and I took the second programming course in Seattle,\nback in 1959, learning how to program those new, beautiful computers, IBM computers, which\nwere then the 1401. And took a job with a division of Boise Cascade Corporation, and I set up\nthe very first computer installation for Greystone Concrete Products. Like I say, that was a\ndivision from Boise Cascade, it was \u2014 they made concrete blocks and pipe, cement products. And\nI se \u2014 they had 11 different locations and I set up the computer department in all 11 locations,\nand then became, besides being the \u2014 what was called the data processing manager, I also was\nmade the assistant controller. And I put in many, many hours and in 1963, a \u2014 this Greystone\ndivision, some of the managers bought the division from Boise Cascade, and I was supposed to\nhave been included as one of the owners but they cut me out, strictly the controller of that\ncompany, who was als \u2014 see \u2014 embezzling from the company. And of course, being the \u2014 in the\naccounting department, which was part of the data processing, I knew what was going on. And\nhe cut me out as being a owner of the company. So in 1963, I resigned my position and started\nmy own business, and \u2014 which 1s \u2014 I still have that business. Today, my company, the second\noldest privately owned computer company in Seattle. I have pretty much turned the business\nover to my son. I am still active in the financial area of the company.",
        "A: Ver \u2014 not too much. My son was never too much interested 1n it. My daughter was very much\ninterested. And when my daughter went to the University of Washington, she decided she\nwanted to join a sorority. And I never pushed it or anything, she decided she wanted to join the\nAEPhi, which was a Jewish sorority. And she has taken a lot more interest in what we went\nthrough, and even now she is very much interested. I think she belongs to some kind of a Jewish\nfriendship club here in Washington, D.C., where she is living.",
        "A: No, I did not, as a \u2014 neither m \u2014 none of my family were that Jewish and we \u2014 well, I do\nconsider myself Jewish, but I am not a religious person. And of course my wife, being Japanese\nwas not Jewish and 1s also not religious, that we let our kids do their own. And my daughter\nleans very much towards the Jewish religion, rather than anything else.",
        "A: My son is not. He never picked up the other language, even though at home we spoke\nJapanese. My son can understand Japanese, not everything. He can understand his mother, but\nother Japanese he can\u2019t really understand. But my daughter is very much bilingual. In high\nschool she studied German and could communicate very well in German. And in Japanese, her\nJapanese now 1s much better than my Japanese. She \u2014 most of her clients \u2014 she works as a\nconsultant for a company and all of her clients, not most \u2014 most of her c \u2014 yes, most of her\nclients are Japanese. She does have one client in London and I think she has two different clients\nin Spain, where she has visited. But most of her clients are in Japan, and of course, she speaks it.\nAnd the strange thing is, to Japanese, my daughter does not look Japanese, she looks more\nAmerican, more Caucasian. And when she speaks Japanese to the Japanese, they are just\nflabbergasted because she does not speak like a foreign, like an American Japanese, she speaks\nlike a native Japanese.",
        "A: Well, a good experience is in Seattle just about three weeks ago. Again, like I say, I\u2019m still in\nthe computer business today. One of the things we do is we host websites. The \u2014 we have a\nelection coming up very shortly in Seattle, one of them is for mayor. A man that\u2019s running for\nmayor is presently the city attorney, who happens to be Jewish, and we are hosting his website.\nAnd his website is Sidran for Seattle mayor dot org, dot com, we\u2019ve used all of them. Well\nsomebody who doesn\u2019t like him put up another website and called it Mark Sidran dot com,\nwhich is this \u2014 this attorney who 1s running for, his first name. Well, his website is only Sidran\nfor Seattle mayor because Mark Sidran was already taken. Well, that website has a huge\nswastika, and compares Mark Sidran as a \u2014 a Nazi, as an SS. And it\u2019s somebody that is upset\nwith him. And that \u2014 seeing that swastika bothers me more now than it did when I saw it every\nday and lived with it in Germany during the regime. Another time \u2014 and I refuse to go back to\nMunich, Germany \u2014 I \u2014 a few years ago I had a client in Munich and we were doing big business,\nreally, with each other. And finally \u2014 and we always talked over the phone, always in English.\nThis was, of course, back quite some time, before email really, where we sent faxes. We sent\nfaxes back and forth, always in English. And in 1979 I visited him in person. And we had a\nappointment at 15 minutes before 12 at his place. I got there at 15 minutes before 12, told his\nreceptionist who I was, and she said yes, I\u2019ll let Mr. \u2014 I forgot his name now \u2014 I\u2019 Il let him know.\nAnd so I waited, and then I asked the receptionist, in English, she spoke pretty good English, I\nspoke no German at the time. And ask him well, does he have somebody with him, is he busy?\nShe says no, but he must be busy, but he\u2019Il be out. And at exactly 12 o\u2019clock \u2014 and at exactly 12\no\u2019clock he comes out and he starts speaking German to me. Herr Taucher, and used the German\npronunciation and didn\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry or anything. And I spoke in English. And he didn\u2019t even\nknow I spoke engli \u2014 German. We never before spoke German, it was strictly a business\nrelationship in English. He spoke very good English when we talked over the phone. His\ncommunication in English and on faxes was excellent. And I said, don\u2019t you s-speak English?\nYou know, we\u2019ve been communicating \u2014 yes, bu \u2014 and in German he answers, but you are in\nGermany, you have to speak German. So I finally said, okay, I'll play your silly game. In\nGerman. Of course, that startled him. And the next thing he says, oh it\u2019s 12 o\u2019clock, I have to go\nlunch. Well, thanks for stopping in. I said goodbye, and I have never communicated with this\nguy. And we gave him on an average of 70 to 80,000 dollars, U.S. dollars, a month in business.\nAnd we gave it to somebody else. And I have found other times in Munich, that is the mentality I\nfind in Munich. Anyplace else, and that includes eastern Germany, I have not found that. The\npeople say in eastern Germany you have a lot of anti-Semitism and so forth, I have not found\nthat myself in eastern Germany. In Munich, yes, I can see kids even, 17 \u2014 18 year old kids giving\nthe Hitler youth \u2014 I-I mean, the Hitler salute. That is completely illegal and in Berlin, in east\nGermany that\u2019s not permitted and they get arrested. In Munich the police turns around. And I see\nthe Nazi mentality all over again in Munich, and I refuse to go back to Munich.",
        "A: It \u20141it hurts me, it bothers me. And again, if I were younger, I would probably get myself in\ntrouble. But I \u2014 I will say my training in judo and karate does teach you discipline, and you don\u2019t\nstart a fight. But I-I am afraid in my younger days, I could have lost myself. It does bother me.",
        "A: Yeah. I do. What \u2014 when I really we \u2014 in fact, that\u2019s the first time in many, many years that I\nhave nightmares is when I took Patricia, who you met, with me to Berlin last year, and I took her\nto the SS headquarters, the old SS \u2014 SS headquarters. In fact, that was Himmler\u2019s headquarters,\nwhere they also had the torture chamber. And they had some records of me, and I was asked to\ngive a taped interview there. And the first thing, of course I asked, why do you want it for? What\ndo you want it? And this gentleman who I talked to, he was in his middle 30\u2019s, I'd say, he says,\nwell there\u2019s so much denial going on in Germany that we want to get interviews from people that\nhave been here, whether they were Jewish or not Jewish. There were a number of Germans that\nwere also arrested and tortured there, and we\u2019d like to interview every one of them, and then we\nare s-spreading those tapes through high schools throughout Germany. So, of course I agreed to\nthat interview and I had probably a 45 minute interview there, all in German, so that high school\nkids can fully understand it.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s \u2014 I first knew that if I released information, my mother and my brother would also\nbe caught. I knew that first of all. Second, every time when I was ready to talk, they tortured me\nso much that I passed out. And when I came to again, again I passed out. I mean, there were\ntimes, I\u2019ve told you some of them, like pulling teeth, filling teeth without any medication. Other\ntimes I remember they had me jump in a bathtub full of ice cubes, full of ice, and then\nimmediately go out in very hot water, and \u2014 which, I passed out. And it \u2014 things like that. Some\nof it I\u2014 I don\u2019t even want to talk about it, it\u2019s just \u2014 but when I did visit that place with Patricia,\nthey make \u2014 made a memorial out of it now, maybe you\u2019re aware of that, I had nightmares for\nthe next two or three nights in the hotel. Yeah, they really brought back the memories like it\nhappened.",
        "A: Occasionally so-some things maybe \u2014 you smell something, maybe there was a dead animal\naround in a real hot climate. Yes, that \u2014 that does remind me, but I try to wipe it out of my mind.\nBut yes, occasionally that has reminded me, mostly of the train. And even \u2014 I'll say it, even\nsmelling dog feces, that reminds me of the train.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: No, that\u2019s really \u2014 I believe again the smell sometimes of dead animal or what I said earlier is\nprobably the only thing that \u2014 or when I see a swastika. Yeah, when I see a swastika, it\u2019s \u2014 it\nimmediately reminds me \u2014 it reminds me of Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse neun, or nine, the torture\nchamber, what I call. It does remind me. And another thing 1s, like I said, it does remind me right\nhere at the Holocaust Museum, when I am in front of that train, I cannot step foot. ve been\nreminded of this when I visited Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, and they have that train up there on\nthe stand. And that train that they have there looks just identical to the train that I was in. And I\ndid have some nightmare that night at the hotel in Jerusalem. The rest of it, I can go \u2014 another\nthing I cannot do, I have actually visited the camp in Dachau once, and really I didn\u2019t have too\nmany problems visiting it. It did give me an idea had I been out of the train what I \u2014 what it\nwould have been like. And I was able to visit that. When I visited Prague a year ago for the Child\nSurvivors of the Holocaust Conference in Prague, they had tours to Theresienstadt and also to\nAuschwitz. I could not go there. I decided not to go, because I lost a lot of my family in both of\nthose places. Was some first in Theresienstadt and then in Auschwitz. And I decided there\u2019s no\nway I could go inside Auschwitz. So I chose not to take that tour. And th \u2014 I think in Prague,\nbeing in Prague and going through the Jewish cemetery there, even though I had no relatives in\nPrague, but it sure brought back memories.",
        "A: Well, I jo \u2014 only \u2014 I\u2019m sorry \u2014 I only see the front, with a gate there, freiheit \u2014 Arbeit macht\nfreiheit. I did see some people walking, mostly Nazis. I do remember seeing two or three people\nwalking, I saw dead people. And of course some of them couldn\u2019t \u2014 no, I don\u2019t think the camp\nwas really bombed. I think the \u2014 the allies and both \u2014 the Russians did not bomb the camp. And\nof course at that time they flew very low. I mean, there were some times when I was still in the\ntrain I thought the airplanes were going to land on top of the train. I mean, you could hear how\nclose they were. And \u2014 but I saw \u2014 I can remember there were soldiers and I saw a few striped\njackets, which were prisoners, but that\u2019s about all I remem \u2014 remember of inside the camp. And I\nthink there were only a few privileged prisoners, I think, that could be close to the gate for some\nreason or another. But other than that I do not remember. But like I say again, I jumped off the\ntrain and then immediately followed all those Russian soldiers which was crossing the train\ngoing the other direction.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I think I probably wouldn\u2019t be as active in non-profit organizations that I am.\nBut I don\u2019t think so. In fact, this bother me now, I hear kids in trouble, kids taking dope and so\nforth, drugs. And I feel the media is excusing the kids because they have come from broken\nhomes or bad parents and so forth. I think it\u2019s still the child that wants it that way. I just cannot\nput all the blames on the parents. I think \u2014 I think the news media helps make the kids blame\ntheir parents. And they don\u2019t have to do what they are doing. I interviewed one time a former\nservice man for a job, and he started talking that he took dope when he was in Vietnam, but you\nknow how it is like in wartime? And I just had to take, and everybody else took dope. And I said\nlisten, I\u2019ve gone through a war too, in Korea, and not in Vietnam, but als \u2014 also si\u2014 was a\nprisoner in a concentration camp, and I never dreamed of taking dope. That\u2019s not an excuse and I\n\u2014I can\u2019t use you here in my company. And I didn\u2019t spend any more time. It a\u2014I just wouldn\u2019t\nbuy it. Yes, there are some kids that were abused by their parents or so \u2014 gran \u2014 or foster parents\nor what have you, but still some of it, it\u2019s up to the ki-kid. And I don\u2019t think I became a criminal.\nAnd \u2014 and people have asked me, well how come you have made something of yourself? And\nwhy do other kids get in trouble? I have no answer for it, but I do know that they don\u2019t have to\nbe it.",
        "A: Yes, I definitely do. Yes, I do. I know what they\u2019ve gone through and they know what I\u2019ve\ngone through, yes. But a lot of survivors, again, they hold a \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a grudge, but\nthey don\u2019t want to forget it, they want to live with the past. And I say hey, you don\u2019t want to\nforget it, but don\u2019t live with the past. Live with what it is now. A good example is we talked\nabout \u2014 earlier about Liineburg, and this recuperation camp put on by the British. There is one\nlady, Dodie Jacobson, I believe her \u2014 is her name. She fo-found me in Prague, when we were in\nPrague and we were at a workshop where we talked about our experiences during the war. And\nnobody wanted to speak up, and so I was the first to speak, and I was telling my story in Berlin,\nand my brother and I survived, etcetera. And all of a sudden this one lady, Dodie, interrupted,\nand she says, were you in Luneburg? And I said yes, my brother and I were there. And she went\nhysterical, because she is one that was in Luneburg with us. And she was never in a\nconcentration camp, but lived in horrible condition in hiding. And today she has never gotten\nmarried, doesn\u2019t want to, can\u2019t get along with people. And again, she said it right at this\nworkshop, she \u2014 there is \u2014 she \u2014 it\u2019s still from her time in Germany. She doesn\u2019t really want to\nmake good friends with anybody very long. And again I say, Dodie, these are different times.\nYou gotta live with what\u2019s now. But she doesn\u2019t want to do it. And too many of the survivors\nlive that way, which I think is wrong.",
        "A: Yeah, I do not feel that way, but I do \u2014 many of them that do feel that way, and I feel it\u2019s\nwrong. You have to \u2014 for instance, I do not hold any prejudice towards the younger generation\nGerman, except the ones that \u2014 those neo-Nazis. And s \u2014 but of course, we have them right here\nin the U.S. But the younger generation, the \u2014 the people 50 years old, even 60 years old and\nyounger, I really don\u2019t have any grudge against them. They couldn\u2019t do anything about it, they\nwere too young then. Most of them knew what was going on, but they didn\u2019t know how bad it\nwas and they couldn\u2019t do anything. The people older than me, 72 years old, let\u2019s say, and older,\nthey could have done something about it. And those I just \u2014 I can\u2019t be friends with them. I have a\ntough time talking to them. But you have to get over it. You don\u2019t have to be friends, but you\ncan\u2019t just hold a grudge against the younger generation that couldn\u2019t help it.",
        "A: Yes, I do. In fact, I can tell you another example that really surprised me. Two years ago\nwhen I was in Berlin, and as a \u2014 at the invitation of Berlin; they paid for my trip, they put me up\nat the Crown Plaza Hotel, that\u2019s a block off the Kurftirstendamm, one of the main thing of it, like\nTimes Square. And wh-while we were having dinner there was a big party going on in the main\nballroom. And I\u2019m a curious kind of a person and I looked in, and I see a lot of people with a\nyarmulke on. So I kind of walked in and I asked somebody there, he was about 19 years old, with\na yarmulke, and I spoke German with him and I said, what\u2019s going on here? He said, this is a Bar\nMitzvah. Do you know what a Bar Mitzvah is? I said yes, and I told him that I lived in Berlin all\nthrough the war. I didn\u2019t tell him I was in a concentration camp, I said I am an American now,\nbut I am Jewish. And I asked him, how does it feel for a Jewish person like you, especially your\nage, living here in Berlin? And he looked at me kind of strange, he says, I am a German, he said.\nI am a German, I am a \u2014 Jewish is my religion. And that\u2019s how some of the Jewish community\nthinks today as a \u2014 that generation, the 19 years and younger generation. They consider\nthemselves German and Jewish. Of course, Jewish is a religion and j \u2014 they should consider\nthemselves as such. But that they just come right out and say, I\u2019m German, Jewish is my\nreligion. It really \u2014 1t almost shocked me.",
        "A: What my thoughts were, hang him. Just don\u2019t waste the time. Everybody know \u2014 the world\nknows he was as guilty as could be. And sometimes \u2014 I don\u2019t believe in capital punishment, I\nguess, but Eichmann or any of those, definitely. Don\u2019t waste the time and money to keep them\nalive. That\u2019s how I felt.",
        "A: To \u2014 towards food?",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: It affects my attitude towards food. First of all ve said to myself a long time ago, that was all\nthe lack of food I\u2019ve had and where I\u2019ve had to eat practically dirt, I ate food that we didn\u2019t know\nwas poisonous or not, like plants, I have said I\u2019m only going to eat food that I like. I\u2019m not going\nto do \u2014 eat food that I don\u2019t like. For instance, I never could get used to Oriental food, whether\nit\u2019s Chinese, Japanese, or what. Even though I was married to a Japanese for over 40 years, I\nrefused to eat Japanese food. I have customers in Japan, I do go to Japan. Every one of my\ncustomers know that I will not eat Japanese food and they take me to western foods. I\u2019m a very\nfussy eater and I just refuse to eat food that doesn\u2019t agree with me or I don\u2019t like. That\u2019s my\nattitude on food.",
        "A: Yes, I do. I do. I don\u2019t care what area I am in, I do feel safe. I just \u2014 I\u2019ve never had a problem.\nYes, in my younger days I did need judo once when somebody tried to rob me, and I was able to\ndefend myself, keep my property. I did break this \u2014 I was going to say gentleman, he was not a\ngentleman \u2014 break his arm. And afterwards the police \u2014 tha-that was in Chicago and one of the\ndetectives from the Cook County police department called me in Seattle and asked me how much\nI weighed, how tall I was. And I could almost see a smile through this detective\u2019s face over the\nphone. What happened, the guy that tried to rob me was 180 pounds and six foot tall, and I broke\nhis arm, and his lawyer said I used unnecessary roughness. But I was a little younger at that time,\ntoo. But I do feel safe, but part of it is probably due to my training.",
        "A: No, it does not. I have absolutely no anger towards that. What does anger me a little bit, and\nthat is for instance, the ship the Saint Louis that was turned back to their death, so to speak. Even\nthe German skipper wanted to go someplace where he could \u2014 he could free the people, and that\nthe U.S. did not admit them, that angers me. And again, while a lot of people, especially Jewish\npeople \u2014 I know my cousins thought the world of Franklin Roosevelt. Well, I still blame him. He\ncould have stopped all of that. He could have saved millions of Jews. And so I\u2019m angry towards\nthat. But other than that, no, Iam not angry. But I\u2019m angry, again, for anyone that could have\nbeen saved by the U.S., and di \u2014 wasn\u2019t. In fact, my brother \u2014 my brother, my father, my family\nshould have been permitted to come to the U.S., without money. And again, I do not know, I was\ntoo young, I don\u2019t know if my father ever contacted the American consulate in Berlin, I do not\nknow. But I think even if he had, I don\u2019t think he could have gotten out, he didn\u2019t have the\nmoney. And that does anger me.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if I can say that, I don\u2019t think so. I, of course remember what has happened, I\nthink about it. I think about it right here in this building and of course this interview here. But\nother than that I try not to think about it. Of course I\u2019m talking about it more than I used to. I\nhave spoken to Rotaries, and like I say, ve spoken to the military. And it\u2019s much easier to talk\nabout it now than it used to be.",
        "A: Maybe time and age. And I have gotten used to talking about it and feel it is necessary that\nthe world still knows. I have found too many young people, educated people that know so little\nof what has happened. In fact, some of these people even believe what they read on the internet,\nthat it didn\u2019t happen. And that\u2019s when I started to talk about it more, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a lot\neasier to talk about it now. Even today as we were talking there were some times, I don\u2019t know if\nyou noticed, I was getting choked up a little bit. And that I can\u2019t help. But at one time I just could\nhardly talk, th \u2014 I had to take a break and couldn\u2019t talk about it. But now it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not like that\nany more.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. My wife \u2014 my ex-wife was very good in raising the\nchildren, and part of it is the Japanese culture too. And I\u2019m very proud of both of my kids. And I\nhave to give her the credit for it because I was starting a business and spent not enough time with\nthe kids. And that\u2019s probably part of the fault why we ended up in a divorce that should have\nbeen much longer ago than it has. But I will \u2014 I definitely will give her the credit that our kids\nwere raised properly and never have gotten into trouble. And of course I\u2019m very proud of both of\nmy kids.",
        "A: Not at all, Iam an American, and I feel a very loyal American. If I were to be asked by the\nU.S. Army, or any U.S. military force, to serve in the military again due to some emergency, I\nwould not say no. I would be ready to do it and I know my brother would go do the same thing.\nI-I definitely feel my allegiance is to the U.S. and not to Germany. And of course, I also feel very\nstrongly about Israel, but I\u2019m still an American more than an Israelite.",
        "A: What my thoughts is, I hope someday there will be peace there. I feel very good that finally\nthere is a country that Jews can live there, and hopefully again sometime in peace. I visited Israel\nfor my first time in 1998, when Israel was celebrating their 50 year independence. I represented\nthe mayor of Seattle. And I was \u2014 it was quite an experience to be in Israel. I enjoyed visiting it\nand I do hope to visit Israel again. I feel it is part of me, but still, my country is the U.S.A.",
        "A: No, I was never active in the Civil Rights. Again, I was too young, and of course \u2014 well, I\ndon\u2019t know if you ever heard of The White Rose?",
        "A: Then you know I mean. These were Germans, and they were all executed. In fact, I think they\nwere first tortured at the same place I was at, and then hung at Plotzensee, which was the place\nwhere the \u2014 where the gallows were where they hung the Germans that didn\u2019t go along with the\nregime or helped Jews or so forth.",
        "A: Well, I was not \u2014 I was not active. I was just saying the people that were active did not live\nvery long.",
        "A: As an adult, no, I was not active. I think \u2014 I think you\u2019re going back to the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s.\nFirst of all, in Seattle, we did not have the problems there that you have had in other parts of the\ncountry. For instance, we\u2019ve had Afro-American mayors in s \u2014 in \u2014 1n Seattle. Exec \u2014 the present\ncounty executive is a \u2014 1s a black man. And lately here we\u2019ve had a few more problems, but that\nis because we get these activists coming in, not even from Seattle, that demonstrate on \u2014 any\ntime there\u2019s something going on, starting when we had that WTO there. And these are people\nthat were \u2014 are actually being paid to demonstrate. And \u2014 but lately we ni \u2014 didna \u2014 we have not\nhad good leadership in Seattle. The mayor, even though \u2014 the present mayor, even though I\nsupported him, Paul Schell, is not very strong. The previous police chief, the present police chief\nis not very strong. And if anything I am an activist now to get those people out. And again I\u2019m\nvery much up within the city councilor, like I said earlier, I\u2019m sort of on the sister city council of\nSeattle and I know most of the politicians.",
        "A: In the political life, yes, I am very active in the political life.",
        "A: Well, probably it goes back because about 30 years ago the former governor of the state of\nWashington, Albert D. Rosellini and I became good friends, strictly through my C.P.A. And my\nC.P.A. is a Sephardic Jew, also speaks Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, he speaks about seven\nlanguages. And the former governor is an American, but he is from Italian parents. In fact, a\nbook has been written on him. And my C.P.A., Victor Barkey(ph) introduced me to Governor\nRosellini, and they have been long, long friends, and they always speak Italian together. And\nover the years Governor Rosellini and I have become very close friends. And he is the man \u2014\nagain probably because I am in the computer business and I did mailings for candidates and so\nforth.",
        "A: No, definitely not, it is just that I helped in the political party and some of them \u2014 right now\nyes, I\u2019m very active to get Mark Sidran elected as mayor, because first of all, he is Jewish and he\ntries to eliminate demonstration that shouldn\u2019t be there. Again, people like \u2014 that put up that\nswastika, and he\u2019s definitely, of course, against that, and he is against, naturally, anti-Semitism.\nAnd lately we have seen a little bit of that in Seattle.",
        "A: It bothers me. And again, that\u2019s why I\u2019m very much in support of Mark Sidran for mayor.\nAnd hopefully he will have a police chief that can do the right thing.",
        "A: That bothers me, definitely.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure it is, and again I say why does that happen? Again, I was all for the U.S. to help out\nwith troops over there. I didn't like the way it was taken out. And again, 1-it bothers me, is just\nlike the U.S. could have helped many million of Jews being saved. And why they aren\u2019t helping\nout further bothers me. I don\u2019t like what happened in Iraq. I think they \u2014 it was good for us to be\nin there, but why not get rid of the main cancer in Iraq, which is still over there. And those things\nbother me.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure I am, I\u2019m sure I am. I know a lot of people, including Jews in Seattle that did not like\nus going into Rwanda or Iraq and so forth. They say why should we get involved? I said, the\nsame reason we should have been involved to save Jews. And some of them, like I say, even\nother Jewish people I know, were against that.",
        "A: Yes, lately I have. I have spoken to two different rotary clubs in the Seattle area. I spoke to\nthe troops in Fort Lewis, mostly officers. In fact, had a long talk afterwards with the assistant\ncommanding general of Fort Lewis, a two star general. And yes, I do talk about it.",
        "A: Again, like I say, it cannot be forgotten and the people, so many of the younger generation,\nare not learning enough in s-schools. And I\u2019m talking about even college students do not know\nenough about it, and they should know. And that\u2019s why it feels very important, people like me,\nsurvivors of the concentration camps, should speak publicly. And in Seattle now, we have the\nHolocaust Education Center, and they get the requests for speakers and I am signed up as a\nspeaker.",
        "A: Yes, I attended the Child Survivors of the Holocaust Conference in Prague, and was the\nchairman of that ho \u2014 Child Survivors Conference of the Holocaust in Seattle, that we had last\nSeptember. And the \u2014 prior to this I did not, as my ex didn\u2019t want me to go to any of that. But \u2014\nand now I plan to go, as long as I\u2019m healthy, I plan to go to every one. The next one is in\nHouston in October, and the following year itll be in Montreal. And right now I\u2019m not at liberty\nto say there\u2019s another city in another state that wants to have a conference. And they have asked\nme to help them organize it because they were in \u2014 the main organizers were in Seattle, and \u2014\nand again, that state has very few survivors, which of course Washington state has, and I put on,\nI feel, a fairly decent conference.",
        "A: Well, first of all, the people in Seattle know what I\u2019ve been very active. I serve on the United\nStates Olympic Committee, and we put on several fundraisers that I have headed. And\nincidentally, Governor Rosellini is the head of the U.S. Olympic Committee for Washington\nstate. I have also been involved in professional associations where I have put on conferences\nhere. At that time data processing management association, of which \u2014\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: And anyhow, some of the people in Seattle, the survivors and so forth, knew that I had been\nvery active in different activities, putting on conferences and banquets and so forth. When I was\nin Prague, at the conference there, I was asked if Seattle could put th \u2014 on the conference, since\ninitially it was scheduled for Vancouver, B.C., about a two hour drive from Seattle. And if \u2014 they\ncancelled the Vancouver consom \u2014 conference, but still wanted it, and then asked if we could put\nit on in Seattle. And I said, if I can get the proper facilities, yes. And so I found the proper\nfacilities and then I got the survivors \u2014 child survivors of the Holocaust in Seattle, there were\nabout eight or nine of them. And I presented that, and with the exception of two people that\ndropped out, they asked me to be the chairman of it. And that\u2019s how it came about that I headed\nthat conference.",
        "A: Oh, I certainly do. And we \u2014 we meet monthly. And we\u2019re just a small group, but we do meet\nmonthly and kind of talk about how we survived and what we can do.",
        "A: Yes, I am. I am very proud of what has happened, and some of it I blame my parents for it. I\nmean, they tre \u2014 they raised us \u2014 and I\u2019m saying rus \u2014 us, my brother and I, the proper way, even\nas young as we were. And I am proud of my accomplishments and I am proud of my brother\u2019s\naccomplishments. Be \u2014 being \u2014 going in as a private recruit in the army, no college education,\nworking up to a field grade officer, which a major 1s, he can be proud of himself, and I am proud\nof him.",
        "A: Well, he actually has been \u2014 he\u2019s on the third marriage right now. And as you probably know,\na lot of survivors do have troubles staying married, but he now is married to a girl from s \u2014\noriginally from Scotland, and they\u2019ve been married now for about 22 years.",
        "A: He has one daughter from his very first mar \u2014 marriage, which he never should have married,\nand then he has two boys from his second marriage. I think he is somewhat in contact with one\nof the boys. And he has two children, a boy and a girl from his present marriage.",
        "A: Yes, we did, we wri \u2014 have written to her, but e \u2014 I think she wrote back once, and it was a\nvery disturbing letter. She still \u2014 she was just as upset when we left Germany, and also wrote to\nus. First of all, she criticized the ge \u2014 the poor spelling and so forth, and grammar we used in\nGerman. Of course, we had a second and third grade education. So of course our writing skill\nwasn\u2019t very good in German. [sneeze] Bless you.",
        "A: And she criticized that and she really criticized us going to the U.S. And I think we did\nanswer her, but we never heard anything from her. Now, my brother, when he was stationed as a\nmilitary soldier \u2014 in fact I think he was a lieutenant or a captain at that time in the army \u2014 excuse\nme \u2014 and he was stationed in Heidelberg, he did visit Trowta(ph) Noelting, the stepdaughter, and\nthey did get together. And I think they had a very good get together, and I think it was shortly\nafter Frau Noelting had passed away, and they talked about her. She \u2014 she was very old in age,\nand really didn\u2019t want to die, but she knew she was dying.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I can remember, and I\u2019m pretty sure my brother will agree to that.",
        "A: Again, I actually visited him with my ex-wife in New Jersey. And again, it must have been \u2014 I\nwas an officer in the Data Processing Management Association and we had a convention in New\nYork, that my ex went with me. And that must have been in \u201969 or \u201970 and we went to visit him,\nbut then I lost track. I n \u2014 lost track of him once when I went to Korea in the army, but then I\nfound his address again and actually was able to look him up. And he was doing very well, he\nhad a very successful ber \u2014 furniture business. We went to his house. In fact, he picked us up at\nthe airport, I think, in a new Cadillac at that time, I remember it. And he was very well off. But\nthen again we lost track. Again I was in the midst of building a business and spending too much\ntime in the business and didn\u2019t take time to write. And then I know I had written him again\nmaybe six months or a year later and the letter came back and no forwarding address. So \u2014 and\nthat\u2019s when we lost track. And he may be \u2014 may have moved out of Newark. But I have tried to\nlook it up on the internet, but unless they have a listed phone number, you can\u2019t find them.",
        "A: No. And this is again one of my reasons that I\u2019m going to Germany next month. It\u2019s one thing\n\u2014 first of all I play to reestablish my German citizenship. I have found out a lot of survivors,\nespecially in our new group here, have rees \u2014 established their citizenship and I know some\npeople are getting as much as 1100 dollars a month pension from the German government.",
        "A: The group that we have formed, each state has formed their own little group, a survivor\u2019s\ngroup and then we are combining it as the Holocaust Survivor Foundation, and all the various\nother groups. For instance, in Seattle we have formed the Survivors of the Holocaust Asset\nRecovery Project. And we are going to join as an affiliate. We\u2019re still separate corporations, but\nwe will be part of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation. And a number of these people, they are\nall elected officials from their own state, just like I am president of the Washington state group.\nAnd \u2014 and a lot of these people have reestablished their German citizenship because now in the\nU.S., dual citizenship is permitted. And by reestablishing the German citizenship, there is a\nchance to recev \u2014 receive a pension. And I\u2019m going to take every penny I can get out of the\nGerman government.",
        "A: Well, they took too much away from my parents and from me, and I think I have a moral right\nto get some monies out of \u2014 I can live without it, I don\u2019t need the money, but I think morally it\u2019s\nright for me to get some money.",
        "A: Well, this is \u2014 I have a real problem with the \u2014 you have the Claims Conference, that has\nreceived billions of dollars. In fact, the U.S. government gave them four million dollars. And the\n\u2014 there are people, especially in Miami that are living out on the street and begging for food, that\nare concentration camp survivors and not receiving any money. We had, at our meeting two days\nago, we had Gideon Taylor, the \u2014 I guess the s \u2014 executive vice president from the Claims\nConference talking and say well, half of the survivors are living in Israel, and the Claims\nConference also has to look out for the people living in Israel. And we have built memorials.\nWell, we don\u2019t want memorials. We want money for the people that need it the most, and so we\nare trying to do something. And first of \u2014 also, the Claims Conference is made up of mostly self\nappointed people that are not Holocaust survivors. And it should be Holocaust survivors that do\nthe distribution of the funds. And that\u2019s what we are working on right now, even if \u2014 if it\u2019s\nnecessary, we will sue the Claims Conference. And they have to release some money because\nour people are dying. I have the 1999 tax return from the Claims Conference. Oh, I didn\u2019t bring\nit with me. I didn't bring it with me, but where they had, in the 1999 return, they had a profit, or\nincome of over 247 million dollars. And yet they don\u2019t have money to pay the people that need it\nthe most. That is not right. And Mr. Gideon Taylor, the executive director, in 1999 his salary was\n184,000 dollars, plus 35,000 dollars in benefits, I don\u2019t know what those benefits are, plus\nexpense money that we don\u2019t know how much. That shouldn\u2019t be. And we are, our group is\ntrying to do something about it, and that\u2019s why we met here in Washington last November, and\njust this week. So in fact, I think you said you were at the \u2014 at our meeting place.",
        "A: I\u2019m afraid not. I am hoping that they did, but did they really? Look what was going on in\nYugoslavia. Even going back to Cambodia, the killing fields in Cambodia. I don\u2019t think they\nhave learned, but I don\u2019t think anything has been as bad what it was through the \u2014 during the\nNazi regime.",
        "A: Well, were six million Jews \u2014 people tortured and murdered. Children put to death. Yes, there\nwere a lot of them, but I don\u2019t think that many. And forced in sof \u2014 put into forced labor until\nthey couldn\u2019t stand up any more and then murdered. I think when they were murdered, they were\nmurdered a little more quickly than what the Germans did. But a \u2014 a lesson learned? No, I\u2019m\nafraid not. And again, it will take countries like the U.S., Great Britain or other free countries to\nmake sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.",
        "A: When you see things like this happen, don\u2019t let it happen. If you are in military age and you\nget asked to serve in your military in \u2014 of your country, which appear to be American, U.S.,\nserve, and serve proudly. I feel very strongly again, about the Vietnam war. It was wrong, we all\nknow it was wrong. But for every American that refused to serve, somebody else went and died\nfor it. While Bill Clinton, I thought, forgetting some of his personal problems, as a president he\ndid a fairly good job. He was a real friend towards Israel and the Jews. But I never voted for him\nand never would vote for him, strictly because he said when he was 13 years old, I think, he said\nhe was going to be president of the U.S.A. someday. And somebody, with that being in mind,\navoiding the draft, going to a foreign country, and demonstrating against his own county \u2014\ncountry about the Vietnam war, does not deserve to be a president. And that\u2019s why I never voted\nfor that man. Like I said just earlier, every American man that refused to serve, somebody else\nwent and died for it. Look at me, I was in the U.S. for five years, getting out of hell, but I served\nmy country, and I was proud to serve. My brother served this country, and proud to serve, both\nof us as officers.",
        "A: No, no, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s gone forever. I will say that when my brother and I first came to the\nStates and lived in Kansas City, we for some reason started loving watching cowboy movies.\nWe'd go all over Kansas City, if there was a cowboy movie on like a Roy Roger, or Gene Autry,\nJohnny McBrown, I can still remember some of those names, we loved to watch those movies.\nAnd maybe that\u2019s maybe coming back a \u2014 a childhood where kids maybe at the age of 10 would\nlove that. We were 13 and 14 and we loved those movies.",
        "A: Yes, at first we definitely did and we always for many years thereafter. We talked about it, we\nwondered where our mother was. And probably my brother more so than I, that I quit talking\nabout it. We talked about our mother and father and he would start crying. And for some reason I\n\u2014I would not \u2014 I\u2014 I mean, maybe mentally I was stronger than he was, I am not sure.",
        "A: He \u2014 he is more \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. Again, maybe \u2014 I was younger and my brother was a year older and I think\nmaybe he matured more \u2014 he was more mature in that respect than I was. A-Again, I can\u2019t really\ngive you a full answer. But I remember more. And yet, when it came to memory of our parents,\nmy brother was much more emotional than I was.",
        "A: We were both aware equally, but my brother was more a-afraid, more scared, not only of\nbeing caught by the SS or the Nazis, but also he was scared, very scared of the bombing. That\nfrightened him, when he could hear the bombing, the artillery, the anti-aircraft. He was very,\nvery frightened.",
        "A: You know, I never th \u2014 gave that a thought, but he is very musically inclined, and now is a\nvery excellent pianist, incidentally. And I never gave that a thought, but maybe that\u2019s what it 1s.\nHe \u2014 his sound 1s better. I mean, I tried to take a \u2014 violin lessons, but I\u2019m just not musically\ninclined. But a \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s it or not.",
        "A: Probably more so physically strong. Again, in sports, he was much better in sports than \u2014 than\nI was, especially in baseball. Too bad I bra \u2014 didn\u2019t bring it aga \u2014 along, I should ha \u2014 should\nmake a picture. In 1947, the \u201cKansas City Star\u201d had a picture of us both first coming to the U.S.,\nto Kansas City, and we were playing baseball. I think my brother was a batter and I was a\ncatcher.",
        "A: America. And we learned how to play baseball very quickly. I was never very good at it and\nmy brother was. I was a better swimmer, I \u2014 than my brother was. I think in \u2014 in sports my\nbrother was much better than I was, except for swimming, which I could do better. I guess I am\nmore in a individual sport like swimming and martial arts and so forth, while my brother was\nmore in a team type of sports, like baseball.",
        "A: My son\u2019s name is Walter and my daughter\u2019s name is Audrey.",
        "A: Walter was named after my uncle, who was a lawyer. No, I had two uncles by the name of\nWalter. One of them was a lawyer and one of them was a doctor \u2014 a \u2014 a dentist. And Audrey, her\nmiddle name we gave to \u2014 as Teresa, which was our mother\u2019s name. But actually, she thinks \u2014\nshe and her mother are very close, and she and I are very close and she doesn\u2019t hold our divorce\nagainst each other. She \u2014 she understands her mother, and \u2014 but she did change her middle name\nto Cavanno(ph), my mother\u2019s maiden name. I mean, my wife\u2019s maiden name.",
        "A: No, I think it\u2019s permanent. Yeah, I think it\u2019s very permanent and my daughter is very much\ninterested in it. When we had the conference in Seattle, the Child Survivors of the Holocaust, my\ndaughter went to Seattle to participate in it. Because \u2014 I was probably one of the first to include\nsecond generation, much to the disagreement of the previous people from the Child Survivors.\nBut I included quite a number of the second generation, I had seminars that both second\ngeneration and survivors could attend, because I found out some \u2014 a lot of the second generations\nwanted to be involved and hear from other survivors than just their parents. And so I did include\na number of activities the second generation, and my daughter did attend a lot of the sessions.",
        "A: No, I think we have pretty much touched everything, and I have \u2014 really feel good being able\nto give my story. And I think we\u2019ve covered anything, unless you think of anything else you\nwanted to cover.",
        "A: Yes, I feel I lived a normal life. I am fortunate that I was able to build up a business with a\nvery minimum education. A lot of my education 1s self study. I\u2019ve led here lately a very\ncomfortable life. I will say back in the 60\u2019s when I started the business, it was not easy. It was\nworking 14 hours a day, seven days a week, sometimes not taking a paycheck but made sure all\nemployees got paid. But lately I\u2019ve lived a very comfortable life and I think I can live the rest of\nmy life comfortably. And again, like I say, I enjoy traveling and I do quite a bit of it, and I just\nhope my health will hold out. But until it holds out, \u2019'm going to enjoy life.",
        "A: Sure, it\u2019s \u2014 really, I am glad I was able to talk about this.\n"
