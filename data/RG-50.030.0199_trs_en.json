        "Q: Both.",
        "A: I was born as Naftali Salsitz and now my name is Norman Salsitz, but during the war I had a\nfew different names.",
        "Q: We'll get to that. Tell me where you were born and when.",
        "A: I was raised in a small town. It's in southern Poland it's named Kolbuszowa, and this\nbelonged to the minor Poland. We called it in Polish Mourpoliska. And before the first world\nwar, it belonged to Alsea which was called Galicia. In 1920.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your parents and your family before the war.",
        "A: Well, we were a very large family. We were nine children, five sisters and four brothers. I\nwas the youngest from the nine. My father was a Hasidic Jew, very religious, my\nmother...the whole family was very religious. He had a long grey beard and my mother was\nvery religious. She wear a Sheitel, which means a wig. And everything was around Jewish\ntradition, Jewish religion. I attended when I was 3 years, I started heder, which means a\nschool for boys. Til 3 years I had my hair. By 3 years, they cut off my hair, but they left side\nlocks. And after this heder when I was 6 years, I attended a small Yeshiva. They called it\nYeshiva for the young boys. I also started public school, regular public schools for which\nwas together with the Polish boys. And when I was 15 years I was sent out to a Yeshiva to a\nvery famous Rabbi in the town named Tarnow, a larger town and which my father was a\ndisciple of this Rabbi. He was a follower, so he send me to his Yeshiva. And then when I\ncame back...I wasn't there too long, because I wasn't very happy with it, I started to work in\nmy father's business. And my father had a wholesale store in which we sold everything. Now\nthe stores in the villages used to come to us and they bought the merchandise for their stores.\nSo here you could call it a general store. We had there everything what was needed for a\nhousehold, we sold it. And it was quite a prosperous business. Our town mostly, they were\nvery poor Jews. I would say 50 percent were poor, and 40 percent made a living, and 10\npercent were rich Jews. My father was considered to be among the 10 percent rich Jews.\nAnd this how we lived. It was a very close family. My sisters, when they were married, my\nfather saw to it that they would remain in our town. He gave them a dowry. He bought them\na house, and he established a business for them. What he used to do, he used to take a branch\nfrom our business and he gave it over to him and he took care of this on a wholesale level for\nthis business. And this we lived quite happily til the war. My oldest brother went to America\nin 1919 one year before I was born because in 1919 we had the pogrom. The Poles came and\nthey killed nine Jews, wounded 200, and this pogrom was for the celebration of gaining\nindependence. So what 1s a better way to celebrate independence after so many years than to\nhave a little pogrom. Not a big one, but at least nine people killed. So after this, my oldest\nbrother left and he came to America. So he didn't know me because I was born a year later.\nIn 1933, my second brother left. He became a Zionist which all family was always in. There\nwere Hasidic, but they always were, all the sisters belong to Zionist organizations and even\nmy father was enough up-to-date that he was a Zionist. And my brother left in 1933 as a\nChalutz, as a pioneer in this time. So those brothers were out from our town, but the rest\nwere living in our town til the war started. And it was a happy life. I was never satisfied with\nthis life in this little stetl because I looked for something else. I wanted to go to school. I\nwanted to study. I wanted to go to gymnasium. My dream was to become a doctor, but I was\ntoo young and I was maybe too weak to say to my father, \"I want to take off this Hasidic\nclothing,\" which I always hated, \"and to be like everybody else, to be a modern man.\u201d But it\ndidn't come til a year before the war. I joined the Zionist organization which was the Hanoar\nHatzioni. It was the young movement and I was very happy because this was the tie that\ngave me a chance to belong to organization together with girls, which before I couldn't speak\nto her. There was special one girl which I fell in love when I was 12 years old, and I had a\nchance to be with her together with our other friends, and this was quite a happy time for me\nthat I could get out of this burden of what my father wanted me to be a Hasidic boy to sit in\nthe temple, in the synagogue and to study from morning til night.",
        "Q: What happened when the war broke out?",
        "A: Well, then before the war we started to feel when the things happened to Germany, we felt it\nin Poland. We felt it because the climate started to be...the Poles started to show their anti-\nSemitism a little more openly. Til 1935 was not so bad because til 1935, Pilsudki was the\nmarshall in Poland, and he was quite good for Jews. And the minute Pilsudski died, a lot of\ntihngs happened. It changed. Smidli took it over and then special laws came out against\nJews. The businesses started to be bad for Jews. They opened cooperatives and slogans were\nall over and they used to say in Poland, [polish] [polish] means everybody to his own for his\nown. The small businesses lost everything because those cooperatives started small\nbusinesses in the villages. So what they did. peasants didn't sell their produce to Jews, so\nusually used to buy them, but they brought them to the cooperatives and they used to\nexchange them for merchandise they needed. So they cut out the Jew who bought the\nproduce and they cut out the Jew who sold them their merchandise. But we, our family didn't\nsuffer because they were not enough advanced to have wholesale places to supply the\nstorekeepers in the villages. So even there were more storekeepers in the villages, our\nbusiness improved because they had to come to us for this merchandise to sell to the\npeasants in the villages. So we didn't feel it. But my father always said that this is only for a\ntime being because eventually they will be enough advanced to start their own wholesale\nstores and their own manufacturing, that they will cut out even the wholesale letting the\nmanufacture which was mostly in Jewish hands. So we knew this is only...in a short time,\nour business will go down also. And then the climate was so bad that everything what\nhappened in Germany from the papers we started to see, it started to happen in Poland. There\nwas a time that they tried to forbid ritual slaughter for kosher meat which in the time of\nPilsudski would never happen, but it happened, but the Jews fought back and it didn't come\nto be that the slaughters should be forbidden. Also, they organized ,they established a\nconcentration camp on the system that it was in Germany tn this time because in Germany\neven before the war, they had a few concentration camp, which starting with Dachau,\nBuchenwald. So they had in Poland, a concentration camp in Breizakotuska . This was in the\nnorthern part in Poland. And what they brought in mostly, supposedly to be for communists\nwhich were enemies of the state, but also Jews who they thought didn't do such business,\nthey did something wrong. Instead to put them to jail or instead they give them fine, they\nbrought them over to this concentration camp, which was a very notorious concentration\ncamp. So all those things were prepared against the Jews. Like for instance, there was the\nPrime Minister. His name was Slatkovski ?. He was a general, so he even was a very famous\nexpression, when there was a debate about Jews and people say the Jews have to go out of\nPoland, be thrown out of Poland, beaten up in Poland, so he said to beat up Jews no, but to\ndestroy them economically he said ofshun. In Polish ofshun means by all means. So this was\na very famous saying, ofshun, Prime Minister said that we have to do it. Now, for instance,\nthe...",
        "Q: Excuse me. I'm gonna have to break in if I may. We need...for this interview, I want to talk\nabout you. So let's focus on what happened to you.",
        "A: Alright. Well, this I give you just a feeling how the situation and this was so in this time, I\ndecided that I have to leave Poland, that this Poland was not for me, so I had to leave. Now\nto leave Poland wasn't so easy because where would you go to? I wanted to go to Palestine\nbecause I became a Zionist and this was my dream. But to go to Palestine wasn't so easy. I\nwas little too young, and then later you had to have a certificate from the English\ngovernment and only a few got and a few were lucky in that. And so I decided to go illegal\nto Palestine. So in 1938, I joined a groups that we paid in money and we're supposed to be\nsmuggled to Romania, and Romania to take a boat illegal to enter Palestine. So we had to\npay 500 zlotys for it; 500 zlotys was quite a lot of money. I decided with a friend of mine, he\nwas a very close friend. Now this boy didn't have the 500 zlotys, so I remember the day\nwhen the letter came that we should pay it in, I paid in my 500 zlotys, and he didn't have it.\nSo his mother had two silver candlesticks, probably from her mother, so she went and she\nhad to sell the two candlesticks and still he didn't have the 200...the 500 zlotys. He was short\n200, so I remember I gave him the 200 zlotys, and he said he would pay it back to me in\nPalestine. And we paid in and we were prepared and we waited to go, but this never came to\nbe and the war in the middle started and we supposed to go in August and the war started in\nSeptember, the Ist of September. And this dream fell through. Also I wanted to come to\nAmerica because I had here a brother, and all my father's brothers and sisters were here. My\nfather was the only one who remained home. So I wrote them letters and I begged them to\nsend me papers. But none of them sent me papers. Only what they had to do 1s to invest 25\ncents to go to another Republic and send me affidavit. But they didn't do it. And when they\ndidn't do it, so America was out. Palestine was out. So I had to stay there til the Germans\ncame in. Now, Ist of September the war broke out. And it was a very bad feeling because we\nknew that this something terrible will happen. Everybody there were rumors that the Polish\narmy is strong. We have a strong calvary, and they mobilized people, the older people. Now\nthe Polish government, I don't know if they did it purposefully, if they had traitors there,\nbecause they mobilized old people. People who used to serve in the Austrian army in the first\nworld war. The young people they didn't mobilize. And so I felt that my duty, I felt myself as\na Polish patriot. I wanted to be part of Poland. I lived in Poland. So I went and I volunteered\nto the army soon as the war broke out. They didn't accept me because they said they don't\nhave enough uniforms for the regular army. How would they take me? So my parents\nnaturally didn't know that I went and I volunteered. The feeling was that something terrible\nwill happen and we awaited it. Now the Ist of September, the war broke out right a day, 2, 3\ndays later. Thousands of refugee came through our town. And most refugee who fled from\nthe western part of Poland came to us and the reason why they came to us is because we\ndidn't have a railroad. And there was a short cut from Tarnow to cut through to the east, and\nusually when there was a railroad the Germans used to bomb the railroad and to shoot, so\nthis way because there were fields so they used to go through this route, thousands and\nthousands, every day more and more. And then later you could see the army broken up,\nbroken units, and they came through our town. And Saturday, the 9th of September, the\nGermans came in. And as we were never a lucky town, like we had a pogrom; we had other\nthings always happen in our town. So Saturday morning the town was clear. There were no\nPolish soldiers, so we figured there would not be no battle and the Germans will come and\ntake the town. So it happens at 12 o'clock, a new regiment came in that had run away and\nthey said they're going to make a line in our town. And the Germans came in about 3 o'clock,\nand there was a battle and there were 65 Germans killed and about 200 Polish soldiers, and\nthere were about 150 Jewish civilians. Why Jewish? They didn't kill when there was a battle\npicking out Jews, but the Jews were the refugees. They didn't know where to hide. They\nmostly were Jews, because Poles didn't run away. They were not so much afraid so they\nwere caught in the middle 1n a strange town and they were killed. And the atrocities started\nright away. They took us out in a open place, and they burned half of the town. And we were\nin the middle and they came and they said that the battle, the fight was done by Jews, not by\nPolish soldiers, and for this reason they're going to burn alive all the Jews from our town.\nAnd they burned, they purposely started to burn the town, the houses around where we were\nlocated. And we saw that maybe they will do these things, which they did not at the time.\nBut it so happened in the evening, somebody came and they said, \"No. They will let us go.\u201d\nAnd they kept us for a whole night in the fields. The next day we came home, and all the\nhouses were plundered, the houses which were not burned were plundered. The Germans\nstayed in there a half day. They went in and took out everything they wanted. And we started\nto live under German occupation.",
        "Q: Can you slow down just a moment. Tell us what it was like for you under these conditions?\nWhat did it feel like you standing there watching all this?",
        "A: When I was watching where we were in this place, surrounded and when they started to burn\nthe houses around us and I saw there the young soldiers standing there and watching us and I\nlooked at them and in this time I imagined myself being him. Being 1n a uniform, having a\nrifle in my hand, and he should be the victim. And I was thinking, \"Would I let him die, to be\nburned alive?\" Because there were children started to cry and I wanted to compare myself\nwhat I would do in that case like this and I couldn't understand that they came and they\noccupy a town and take civilian people and kill them. Because we were sure that they would\nkeep their promise and they would burn us. So then later, the next day they started to take us\nto work. And every day they came and they took out everybody and there was a lot of work.\nThe whole Polish army was broken up and we had to clean the weapons and used shells from\ncannons and we used to load it on trucks to take away. Also, we had maybe a hundred dead\nhorses because it happened that this unit which came to our town this day, this was a cavalry\nunit and when the fighting started, the horses were killed. And the horses were laying dead,\nand this was still hot summer, so it start that we had to clean them up. Now Jews were not\nused to such kind of work, bury horses. They were not strong enough for this. So we had to\ndig holes and pull the horses and bury them because we were afraid of an epidemic. And so\nthere were a case I remember that one Jew when we dug the horses, one officer came and he\nsaid to the Jew he didn't [like] him for some reason or other. And he said to go in in the hole\nwith the horse and we had to burn him too alive. And we started to cover and with the dirt.\nThen in the last minute his wife found out and she came and she screamed and begged and\ncried. Finally, he was almost buried completely. He said, \"Alright, you can dig him out.\u201d In\nthose [days] they started to harass the Jews. They used to take old Jews with long beards and\nthey used to harness them to wagons, and they used to sit on the wagons and they used to\npull them. Just to show and make pictures and make a film. Everything to insult. In the\nbeginning those insults were very bad, because we didn't know what awaits us. But everyday\nsomething else happened. And we got used to the yesterday's insults, but the next day there\nwere more severe insults. So we forgot already what happened yesterday because we had to\ncope with the new one. And then later they gave out the curfew that Jews can only walk out\nfrom their houses between 10 in the morning til 12 noon, and then from 4 in the afternoon till\n6. So you imagine only for the 2 hours to go out and to do everything what you had to do for\nthe family. Naturally, nobody did business anymore. They confiscated the merchandise.\nThey took away everything. And in the 2 hours you could see everybody was running,\nrunning, running because you wanted to do, to accomplish in the 2 hours what he could do in\na whole day. And then later he was in a hurry to go home, not to be caught in the middle. So\nthose were the harassments. Then later it came the harassments which couldn't walk on the\nsidewalk. We had to walk on the road, on the street. The first day it was terrible. What you\nmean I cannot walk on the sidewalk? But later we got used to it. We got used to it, so we\nwalked on the street and if somebody walked on the sidewalk in the beginning they didn't\nshoot us, but they arrested them. Then later came out a order that every Jew who saw a\nGerman on the street had to take off his hat. He had to greet him. Now, so they were cases\nlike in my father for instance, I remember, there came a young German policeman, so he\ntook off his hat. So he went to him. He started to beat him up. And he beat him up and he\nsaid, \"Why do you beat me?\" He says, \"Well, because why you taking off the hat. Why you\ngreeting me? What am I? Your friend? You are a dirty, lousy Jew and I'm a German. Why\nam I your friend. Why you greeting me?\" So the next day, when he saw a German, he didn't\ntake off the hat. So he went and he beat him up. And he said, \"How long do we have to teach\nyou when you see a German you should take off up your hat, take off your hat and bow\nbecause you are subhuman and..... So everything what they did, 1t was only to make life\nmiserable. And then the war, of course, very bad because every day they caught the same\npeople and they took them away to all kind of work, to clean the streets. And then the Poles\nwere standing and laughing and enjoying because they didn't touch them and they were\nvery[helpful?] and if sometimes the Germans didn't know where the Jews lived, the\nPoles...usually the young Polish boys used to go with the Germans. They couldn't speak\nGerman. One word they learned very fast. Jude. Jude. So they went with the Germans and\nthey used to show the houses. Jude. Jude. Jude. That there lives a Jew. So the Germans went\nin and took out everybody and dragged them to work. Now the work was done and they\ndidn't pay for it. The people were hungry. They couldn't make a few zlotys 1n their\nprofession or something like this. They had to go from morning til night to work. And the\nworst time was in the winter. In the winter we had to clear the streets. From far away,\nkilometers away, for the Germans that their cars and trucks should be able to travel. So we\nhad to stay in the snow from morning til night. Even when the snow was falling down, we\nstill had to clean. So we sometimes asked, \"What's the use to clean up? In 5 minutes they\nwill be covered with snow again?\" But nevertheless, we had to do it. And I was with the\nGermans about a month. Then something happened to my father, somebody, one of his\nfriends denounced him to the Germans that we had hidden merchandise and the Germans\ntook away everything we had from our warehouses. They cleared out everything. They didn't\nleave anything. And I said to this man...I threatened him and I said to him, \"Someday, I will\npay you back for it.\u2019 And he went to the Germans and he told them that I'm a very\ndangerous. I was at this time 19 years old. I was a boy from the Yeshiva from a Rabbinical\nschool. Before the war, I wore the long peijes. And he told them that I belonged before the\nwar to a communist party which was against...and that I'm dangerous to the Germans, and I\nalso said that I will go and to do some sabotage. This what he told the Germans. Now, they\ndidn't know me, so they said that tomorrow we're gonna arrest him and we shoot him. I find\nout about it and I run away to Russia. To the Russia zone because Poland was divided. The\nwestern part was taken over by the Germans, and the eastern part was taken over by the\nRussians. So I went over to the Russian zone and I went to Lemberg [Lwow]. And I was\nvery happy in Lemberg because there I joined a gymnasium which I always dreamed about\nit. And I also joined a Jewish theatrical group. There was a Jewish theatre and I always I\nsaid, \"If I cannot be a doctor, I want to be an actor.\u201d I always had it in my blood. And even in\nhome before the war when we used to make like plays for a holiday for Hanukkah for Purim,\nevery year our school made the play. And I always had the lead in this play and I used to\nsing by a cantor. I had a voice soprano, so the cantor liked me and I used to sing solos. So I\ncame to Lemberg and my dream was fulfilled. I went to a gymnasium and I joined a theater\nso I could play...be a part of it. So I said, \"Well, the war will last maybe a year or two, and I\nwill meanwhile do what I want to do.\u201d Meanwhile, I found out, I was there 3 months. I find\nout that my girlfriend which I liked...her mother is gravely ill and she was only with her\nmother because her father and brother and sister were on the Russian side. So I find out\nabout it. I decided to come home. And I came back to the Germans. And I will never forget,\nthis was already in January. We had to put white sheets over us to camouflage the snow and\nwe went through the border and we were caught. Those are long stories. I don't want to dwell\non how we were caught by the Russians, and then they had to take us to jail to Lemberg,\nback to Russia. We knew once we are in the jail, so after from the jail, they send us to\nSiberia. So during the night, we overpowered the guards and we tied them down with\nblankets. We took away their rifles, and we went back to the border and this time we\nmanaged to cross the border.",
        "Q: Who is... Slow down. We have plenty of time. Who is we?",
        "A: Well, there was one man. Before the war, he was a horse dealer. And he lived in the section\nwhere the border is. The town's name was Jarloslaw. It was known that every week he takes\na group of people who want to go to back. And when we came back he took a group of\npeople who want to run away from the German side. So he was like a smuggler. He was a\nJewish man. And he took at this time 15 boys from our town who wanted to go back.\nBecause 1n the beginning they couldn't make a living in Lemberg. It was very bad. There\nwere thousands and thousands of refugees. They didn't have where to live, where to sleep. So\nhere somebody told us that the Jews live in their houses. It's bad under the Germans. They\nhave to work. They have to do certain things. But the atrocities didn't start night in the\nbeginning, so they figured they will come home. I came home because on account of this\ngirl. Maybe subconsciously I wanted to be with the family too. And I will never forget the\nday that I came home, my father was sitting in our kitchen studying some Talmud, and I\ncame in and he saw me and I said, \"I'm back.\u201d And he didn't lift his eyes. While looking still\nin the book, he said, \"As much as I am happy to see you, you made the biggest mistake in\nyour life that you came back.\u201d Those were his words when he saw me when I came back.\nAnd naturally when I came back the first week, I was hiding because I was afraid that\nsomebody would say, \"The police.\u201d because I remembered that they wanted me. But this\nwas already new police, and nobody remembered and I joined the Jews with their misery in\nour town going to work and starting to do business and my father still had this little store, but\nit was little in this time. But he didn't come in in the store, because he was a Jew with a long\nbeard and it was like a red cloth when you want to aggravate a bull. So my sisters were in the\nstore and I started to travel to different towns, and brought in merchandise, mostly black\nmarket. And this how we started to make a living. And I was the young in the family, so I\nhad to do it, and I did it to support all my sisters because I had the three married sisters. Their\nhusbands were not capable to do it. They were very religious Jews with the beards and I was\nyoung. They didn't speak so good Polish. So I used to travel every day someplace else and to\nbring in merchandise and to sell it and to make money. And we worked like this til about\nspring of 1940. Spring of 1940, they made a registration, so all the Jews had to be registered.\nAnd then they used to make like...there came a few high officers from Rzeszow, and they\ntook us in a big building and they made like a selection. From the people who were\nregistered, they picked out at this time 200 young boys and we had to come to the places\nwhere trucks were waiting. And they send us to a labor camp. This was the first time they\nmade this registration. And the labor camp was in a town...in a village called Leipyia. This\nwas near a town Novisanz. This was near the southern border this was in the Carpathian\nmountains. Our work was that we had to break rocks. It was like a quarry where we had to\nbreak rocks, but the problem was that what we did...when we broke up the rocks we had to\ntransport them to a place on hand wagons, on wheel barrels, and the next day we took the\nsame rocks and we brought them back to the first place. And this was our work. It was very\nhard work. And they gave us very little food. But 1t wasn't so bad because in this time, this\nwas in 1940, our people in our town still lived in their homes. They still had what to eat. And\nthe post office could send...we could send packages. So the community from our town used\nto send every week a package to every prisoner. And they send it to the community of\nNovasanz, of this town. And this Jewish community brought it us to the camp. So we had\nenough. After 2 or 3 months, we started to run away. And all of us run away. And the\nGermans didn't even look for us even run away. What did they do? When everybody run\naway, they had from different towns, also young people, so they went to other town and\nbrought in other transport. So they didn't bother looking for us. So I came back from this\ncamp and I started to work by the Germans. So they took me and we started to build garages\nfor the Wehrmacht. And they accepted me. They also made us register, they looked us over\nwho is young and strong, so because of my work. So everyday I went to work. They didn't\npay us for the work, but I was glad to go to work for them so they wouldn't catch me to work\ndifferent work like cleaning the streets, cleaning the buildings. Because I had to go work\nanyways. At least I went in the morning. I had a pass that nobody should grab me from the\nstreet. And we worked there. And once being with those Germans or working in the garages,\nso I used to buy for them a quart of kerosene, a loaf of bread. I used to bring to the Germans\na few eggs, and we exchanged this. And it was there where I worked. And sisters were 1n the\nstore, and they did some business buying this from peasants and selling some produce. It was\nnot like before the war, but we thought it 1s bad, but somehow we will survive. They didn't\nkill at this time. But Jews for every little things were arrested. They were harassed. And they\ncaught the slaughter the Shochet who used to slaughter for a kosher meat, so they arrested\nhim. After 2 weeks, they paid a lot of ransom...they paid money, they let him out. And\neverything was done with money, you could buy yourself out by the German police. And we\nstill lived in our houses, so it wasn't so bad. But we knew that we are under German\noccupation, and also we heard stories from other towns about atrocities. There was a town\nMielec, for instance, not far from my town, so when the Germans came in, they took about\n200 Jews and they put them in in the shul, in the temple, and also in the public bath and they\nclosed the doors and they burned the people with the buildings.",
        "Q: Do you see that?",
        "A: No. No. No. This I didn't see, but this was in the next town. So we heard about atrocities\nfrom different towns, but they asked...1t was just arresting contribution...we had to pay\nmoney, but nothing terrible happened. Until in the fall of 1940, they came, they established a\nvery notorious camp near us named Pruszkow, and Pruszkow was an SS camp. Now\nPruszkow was established because this was the place where they started experiments for the\nV-1, V-2, rockets. This is the first what they did it, and they picked out this place because\nthere were a lot of woods. In Poland, there was a section, it was called Pushun Sandomerska\n. It means the wilderness of Sandomierz, the town. Before the 18th century practically,\nnobody could go through it. It was old, virgin forest. Later, people started to make villages,\ntowns. In this section of Pruszkow Sandomerzko, they made the first experiments. They\nbrought in Jews and Poles too, and they worked there for a certain time. Later, they killed the\npeople. They were afraid that they would run away and they would start to tell stories about\nthose experiments. I remember that during the day, three or four times you could hear a\nboom, a noise, but you didn't see a airplane. You didn't see anything. You could hear it. It\nsound like something is flying then noise, then it was an explosion in the air. You could see a\nball of fire and it disappeared. And this happened a few times a days, so this were the\nexperiments that they used to shoot the rockets, but they exploded. Then later when the\nrockets exploded, then on the places pieces of cast aluminum used to fall on the ground.\nNow the peasants used to collect it and they used to make utensils, spoons, jars, cups,\neverything they used to make from this. So the Germans didn't want it should be, and they\nused to send out special police to go and collect those items. And this came from Pruszkow.\nSo in 1941, at the end of 40, I was taken to Pruszkow. Again, there came a commission, and\nthey took the young people and they looked through and while they picked out the people,\nthey beat up everybody. And I remember I was beaten up terrible. I was standing in line,\nthen somebody and I didn't move so fast, so SS men with their rifle butt hit me in the back\nand I flew to the front and I feel down and I was all bleeding. So the man who was in charge,\nhis name was Schmidt. He was a Feldwebel, I mean a Scharfuhrer from the SS. And he saw\nme on the floor, so they picked me up, and I was bleeding from my mouth, from my nose. So\nhe came out and he said, \"Hey, what happened to you?\" Like not...he joked around. So he\ntook out a handkerchief and he gave the handkerchief I should wipe the blood. So I wiped\nthe blood. He said, \"Now, clean my boots.\u201d So with my blood, I had to take and I had to\nwipe his boots with the blood.\u201d So those were the things that they were terrible in this time,\nbut looking back those were things that you could survive. They were terrible, but it was not\nextermination. It was not killing off everybody. But in this time, those were the bad things.\nSo I was taken to Pruszkow. They were so vicious that when they took us on open trucks and\nthey took in this maybe 100 from our town in the open trucks, when we traveled, they took\nus by the trucks to Pruszkow. The driver purposefully, in Poland on the road, on both sides,\nthere were trees. Now trees were not high so he purposely drove the truck under the trees\nwhere the branches were sticking out and the people should be hurt, and a few of them were\nhurt. It cut open their heads and all that because the truck went in the branches. I was in\nPruszkow about 6 weeks. During the time, every night was there a ritual. When there was the\nappell, this Schmidt picked out somebody and he was hanged. We all had to watch by the\nappell how the man was hanged. And usually he picked out somebody of us, and he was the\nhangman. Now there were times in the books that I am writing there and I give more details,\nso there was a times that he picked somebody who didn't want to hang the other Jew. So he\ntook a knife and he cut his throat because he didn't want to hang him. And also this Schmidt\nhad a habit, when we walked to work we cut trees because they wanted to make the camp a\nlittle larger, so he used to shoot just in our rank, in our column. Not aiming. So once I was hit\nin my right arm. And it was very difficult to work because the hand, but he didn't do no\ndamage and I with somebody's help, I was transferred to other detail to put up telephone\npoles through the town of Tarnow. And one time when I lifted a telephone pole, I dislocated\na disc in my neck and I couldn't straighten out. And then I knew that if I would be there and\nthey would find out that this happen, they would shoot me because what do they need a man\nwith a dislocated disc? And then with the help of somebody I escaped, and I came back\nhome.\n01:40",
        "Q: Let's back up again. Tell us, again...slow down. Tell us how you escaped.",
        "A: Well, when I was shot, so the Germans, they didn't know would be tied down to 1, 10 men. I\nwent to work. It was hard too, because we worked there cutting the trees. So it was hard, but\nwith the help with others, they covered me. You know, in a camp the comradeship, the\nfriendship was so big that everybody would do everything for his friend. Even we were\nstrangers we became so friendly that at times even they would endanger their lives to help\ntheir other friend. So they covered, but when I dislocated a disc it was very bad for me. I\nused to hold on to two guys when we worked I should be a little straight. And I knew that I\nwould not be able to hide this a long time. So there was a man who was in charge of the\nJewish columns. It so happens that this man was a cousin of my girlfriend. And I told him\nthis. His name was Kleinhandler from Tarnow. And he was the head, he was like a middle\nman between the workers of Tarnow in this Pruszkow camp. So through him, he\nrecommended me to somebody else and through the other man helped me to escape. He\nopened a truck when I went to work...a truck went to a town Bembitza. And he told me to\ngo on the truck, and they took me away. Because the truck was a SS truck, but he had to pick\nout so many workers to go to this town so he picked me out. He knew that I have his name, I\nremember even was Immergluck . And he was not very much liked, because he did things\nthat he didn't have to do to the Jewish workers. But to me, he was good because this other\nfriend told him to do it, so he picked me up and they helped me go on the truck and they took\nme to work supposedly to the Bembitza to bring some merchandise or to bring some\nsupplies. So I went to Bembitza, the Jews were still there, so I didn't go back. And that's it.\nThey didn't look for me. I came home and I started to wear a brace. And then later after a few\nweeks, it healed. I had problems later, but I could walk out. I came back home. The situation\nstarted to be much worse, every day, every day, you could see that the situation 1s worse.\nThen later we received, we got in our town a Land Kommissar which is the head of the\ncounty, because our town was the county seat, and there came a Land commissar, and his\nname was Farting. And he was the biggest sadist ever lived. And he was a German, but he\nalso was a Polish guy, because he spoke German and Polish. And this was very bad, because\nhe could speak to the Polish people and he could find out a lot of things which was not\nhealthy for us. So this Farding came to us as a LandKommissar._Before he used to be in the\nGestapo in Rzeszow. So they said and we used to say he is so bad because he has all bad\nthings from both nations, the bad things from the Germans and the bad things from the Poles,\nand he combined it in one person. He looked like a caricature. He was short, very fat, with a\nbig belly, a shaved head which in the sun it was gleaming like a mirror, small little eyes like\na pig, very small piercing eyes, and he had a voice that it was like a shrilled voice, like it\ncame from animal or something, very shrill you say, and he was very shrewd, very smart.\nAnd he wanted to outsmart everybody, but he was very vicious. So when he came he\norganized a ghetto in our town. And our ghetto was organized before large towns had ghetto\nbecause we already had a ghetto in June 1941, which was very early. And he pushed into the\nghetto, where before used to be 70 Poles, he put in 2,000. And it was very cramped. And we\nlived in the ghetto. And then we had an old man who was the President of the Judenrat,\nwhich was a Doctor Unterman. And I think this Doctor Unterman should be remembered. If\nthe Jews would have in their religion to make a saint of somebody, I think he should have\nbeen the first saint. Because being that president of the Judenrat, he actually sacrificed his\nlife for the Jews. Before the war, this Doctor Unterman didn't consider himself a Jew. He\nwas a assimilated Jew. He never bothered with Jews. He never belonged to a temple. He\nnever even stepped in a Jewish temple. Only had his friends with the Polish people because\nhe was a Polish officer, and was a Polish patriot, and he was considered by them that he was\none of the most important people in our town. But with Jews he never had anything to do. He\nhad Jewish, had Jewish patients, but that's all. When the war started he saw that he can speak\nto the Germans different than a Jew with a long beard. He was clean shaven. He was a\ncaptain in the Austrian army. He\nstudied medicine in Vienna, spoke beautiful German, and he could stand up to them. Now,\nagain, he couldn't understand that the Germans will be so vicious and he thought with him\nthey will think twice. So he agreed to become the president, which before he said, \"What I\nhave nothing to do with Jews?\" But later, we convinced him and he said he will become\npresident if he would pick out 12 people which he liked with him. And he picked out 12\nyounger people, Jews without beards, people who were outstanding citizens before the war.\nHonest people. Fine people. And he said, \"If they will be with me in the Judenrat, then I will\nbe come the Hauptman. And they agreed. As a matter of fact, between the 12 people, he\npicked out my older brother and my brother-in-law he was one of the 12. And he ran this\nJudenrot that I don't think so that any Judenrot was run like this. He was so honest. I don't\nknow if we should go in details, but Linda, I'll give you two examples. Once they brought in,\nthey gave to the Jews to divide pieces of soap, to give every family a piece of soap. And the\nJudenrat divided the soap. And then about 5 kilo soap was left. It was more than they...so the\nJudenrat, the man who was in charge of dividing the soap, he made 13 packages to give\nwhat's left over to each member of the Judenrat to take home. And one was for Dr.\nUnterman. And Dr. Unterman came in, and they said, \"This is for you.\u201d He said, \"What is\nit?\" He said, \"Well, this is the soap.\u201d He says, \"But I already got soap, what I suppose to\nget.\u201d \"Well, this was left.\u201d And they explained it. And he said, \"It was left and how much?\"\nAnd they said, \"We made 13 packages.\u201d He said, \"I want to see the 13 packages.\u201d So they\nbrought back what everybody took for himself. He opened it and he said, \"Give me a list of\n13 poorest Jews in our town.\u201d So they picked out 13 poor Jews. \"I want everybody should\nget a package. Not you. Not I.\u201d And he divided...this kind of man way he was. Like to the\nGermans he spoke to them like to equals. Like this Farding who came in, he wanted to take\nover Unterman's house because he built this house a year before the war. And because he\nwas a physician he was well off. And he built a beautiful house, and this was the only house\nin our town that had electricity. He had his own generator. The only one in town that he had\nindoor plumbing. He made it a beautiful house. So naturally, Farding wanted this house. So\nhe asked him, \"I want to move in. Why don't you move in into the ghetto.\u201d So he told him,\n\"In the ghetto I will move 1n til the last Jew will have a roof over his head. So long as the last\nJew doesn't have a roof over his head, I will not move in.\u201d Then later this Farding said, \"The\nJudenrat will have to pay 10,000 zlotys to me to renovate the house.\u201d He said, \"Renovate? I\njust built 1t. And besides if I could live 1n it, you can live in it. And then why should you\nrenovate. After the war will end, I will come back to my house. You will go back to\nGermany.\u201d Now he didn't like this thing, we were in the ghetto about 2 weeks, he took the\nwhole Judenrat with Dr. Unterman and he arrested them and they were sitting in jail in\nKolbuszowa about a week or 2 weeks. They they were sent to Rzeszow and from\nRzeszowize they were sent to Auschwitz. In Auschwitz, there were orders was right in the\nbeginning. This was in the fall of 1941. In this time, you hardly knew that Auschwitz exists.\nAnd then they were sent to Auschwitz, and after 2, 3 weeks, telegrams started to come to the\nfamilies, and the telegram said that your husband died on cancer. Other one your husband\ndied on heart attack. Your husband died while he was running away. And then it was a letter\nthat the widow had to sign that her husband suffered for cancer for 2 years, that her husband\nhad heart trouble for 4 years. Why they did it, why this evidence they needed, I don't know.\nBut they had to sign a letter that he actually was sickly and to add salt to the wound,\neverybody received a bill for the cremation. They said people were cremated and the\ncremation cost so and so much, and you will have to pay the money. So every widow had to\npay money for the cremation. Now when the Judenrot was liquidated, naturally, Fardring\norganized a new Judenrot. But [for] this Judenrat he already picked out people who he liked.\nAnd this Judenrat, I wouldn't say that they were murderers, but they were more to the liking\nof the Germans than Dr. Unterman. That the old man of this Judenrat wouldn't go out and\nwouldn't, if there was left there 13 packages of soap, he wouldn't say divide it to the poor. He\nprobably would say I want the whole 13 packages. This was a different. And then it was life\nstarted to be more and more terrible. Another [thing] I want to tell you about is Dr.\nUnterman. When he saw that the Jews are so poor and they cannot afford a doctor, so he\norganized an ambulatorium. And every day he gave 2 hours, he was sitting in the\nambulatorium, and this was in my sister's apartment, and everybody who was sick who\ncouldn't pay could come to him, and he treated the people. And then later the Judenrat had to\npay for medicine what they received. Because he liked me, so he took me in the\nambulatorium I should be his assistant. As I mentioned before, I always wanted to be a\ndoctor. So I worked with him and he taught me how to open wounds, how to clean wounds,\nhow to put in all kinds of ointments, how to bandage, all those things. And I worked with\nhim every day and he showed me all these things. This gave me opportunity when we were\nlater in our camp, which we come to it, and we were in the woods I became the doctor, the\nso-called doctor. We had to do some medically, I always had that little suitcase with all kind\nof instruments which I inherited after he was killed. And I had this and I used to treat the\npeople as much as I could, as much as he taught me. So this Doctor Unterman got killed, and\nthe Judenrat got killed. He had a wife with a son, and his wife, after he was arrested, the wife\nwith the son escaped to Warsaw and they lived as Aryans, illegal people, Poles, illegal\npapers which they could very easily survive because they didn't look Jewish, and their\nlanguage was only Polish. And during the uprising, not the ghetto uprising, but the general\nuprising in Warsaw, her son was a officer of the AK, the Polish underground, and he was\nkilled. She survived and came to America, and after the war and since then she died. So men\nlike this should be remembered because we didn't have too many people like this. Actually,\nthe Poles begged him to escape from jail in Kolbuszowa, and they wanted to take him and\nhide him and do anything for him. And he said, \"I cannot do it, because I cannot leave the\nJews, because nobody will stick up for them.\u201d And he thought that he would be able to speak\nup, and then later they got rid of him. Now once he was killed yes, also under his\nadministration, because you asked me I should tell about me. Because I before the war, I\n01:55\nworked in my father's store and I used to go to different towns buying all kind of\nmerchandise for our store, I knew the suppliers. I knew the ways how to buy and bring in the\nstuff. And also when I left our ghetto, we had to wear the arm band, a white arm band with a\nblue star of David. Every time I left the ghetto, the first thing I took off my arm band. And I\ntraveled, nobody stopped me and it so happens that I was never, never stopped for\nquestioning that I'm a Jew. I look so Polish, more than the Polish people. So I never was\nsuspected, so it was easy for me to go because and then later to bring in merchandise as a\nnon-Jew. So Unterman picked me out and I was the one who used to go to different towns\nand to bring in merchandise for the ghetto. Now, we later organized a kitchen for the people\nto come in to have a warm meal once a day. Now when we had to buy those things we didn't\nreceive as for the ghetto on card, but we had to buy like potatoes, flour and other things. So I\nused to go out to the peasants and used to buy it and bring it in. And I did it for the Judenrat.\nNow, also the ghetto received flour for baking bread, and each family recetved so much.\nSometimes two\n01:57:\nloaves a week, sometimes | loaf a week. This had to brought in. So I used to go to the flour\nmills and bring it in. This was officially I brought it in. We used to get sugar. We used to get\nmarmalade. We used to get other things...supplies what the Germans get. And this we used\nto get in Rzeszow. So I went twice a week, once a week, with wagons and I brought this in\nand this was my job. Instead to go and work on the streets and clean the streets, so this was\nmy job that Unterman assigned me to. And for me, it was very good because when I went to\nbuy all those things, I always brought something on the black market. Paid extra money, and\ntogether with this merchandise, I could bring it in and then later to supply my family and to\nsell something like this. This went on til he was arrested. When the new old man [Aeltester] .",
        "Q: Excuse me. This is a good place to stop and break and change tapes.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: You were telling us about you bringing in the supplies in the ghetto.",
        "A: So when the second Judenrat came into power...meanwhile, we had all kind of new orders.\nOrders like to give up all the furs, and if somebody would have a fur, and they would be\ncaught with a piece of fur in the ghetto and would be shot. So naturally most of the Jews\ngave the Germans the furs. I remember there came a truck.",
        "Q: Gave them what?",
        "A: Fur. Fur. Fur. And then they had collars and fur, they gave them. And it was not a rich town,\nso you could see somebody had there a coat with a fur lining, it was maybe a 100 years [old]\nor so. It was all falling apart. But they brought it over. Everybody was afraid. Some younger\nwoman had Persian Lamb coats because this was the style. So some didn't give the Persian\nLamb coats because it was valuable, so we used to hide it or give it to peasants to hide. I\nremember one of my sisters had a Persian Lamb coat, so she gave it to me and I brought it\nout from the ghetto to somebody who we trusted and they should hide it for us, which by the\nway they never gave it back to us. And then there were other contributions. Once this\nFarding came in and he said he wants to have 10 kilo of gold. Ten kilo of gold in our\ntown...they were poor Jews...how could they could, but I knew how. But this new president\nfrom the Judenrot, his name was Pashek Rappaport. He was very energetic. And people were\nsometimes afraid of him. So he somehow managed to get together the 10 kilo gold to give it\nto Farding. And when they gave it to Farding, so he said, \"You know, you saved 20 Jewish\nlives with it because I was prepared to kill 20 people if you wouldn't give that 20 kilo gold.\u201d\nI remember to the gold, everybody gave what he had, a wedding band, a pair of earrings, but\n10 kilo is a lot. So I remember there was still missing, this night I will never forget that my\nfather came and he brought a package and he opened it and he had there, he said I'm going to\ngive this too to save lives, so he opened it and there was a gold watch on a long chain like in\nthis time the women used to wear a gold chain with a watch and also he had in this package a\ncigarette box from gold. So he said, \"I'm going to give it. You see when I was engaged with\nyour mother,\" he told me, \"I gave her this watch, and she gave me this cigarette and I saved\nit through the first world war. I had it hidden, and now I'm going to give it.\u201d And he gave it.\nAnd now the Jews gave...and we came up with the 10 kilo gold and then he said we saved so\nmany lives. And every day new atrocities a new one on top of one [that] was not finished,\nthe other came up. The other came up. We lived in this time in the ghetto. We were fortunate\nthat my brother's apartment was in the ghetto, so we could move into his, so he had two\nrooms, SO we moved in in one room and he had one room. I had three married sisters, so one\nof my sisters lived in the place where the ghetto was with the other two sisters moved in. So\nsomehow I was appointed by the new Judenrot to my old job to go to other towns and to\nbring in the merchandise which was very helpful. But in December of 1941, I went once to\nRzeszow, and Rzeszowi was a epidemic of dysentery. And a lot of people died. And I ate\nthere. I remember I bought two tomatoes, and I ate the two tomatoes and I came home and I\nhad dysentery. And this was very dangerous because with the Germans, because this was\nvery contagious and when the Germans find out that there is somebody with dysentery,\nprobably they would have me killed. So we didn't tell nobody. I went to the attic, and my\nyounger sister which was the dearest to me because we were the closest in age. She was 3\nyears older. Her name was Rachel. And we decided I would be on the attic. We wouldn't tell\nnobody, and she was with me during all the time. She used to give me food, what I could eat,\nand she used to take away from me what was necessary because it had to buried because the\nGermans. And I somehow survived this dysentery. We didn't have no injections. We didn't\nhave no doctor. And as I recuperated I got middle ear infection, and\nI started to have terrible pain. And, again, no doctor so home remedies. We used to put in oil\nand this and that and it went on and on and got worse and worse and worse. And after 3\nweeks, the pains were so terrible, I cannot describe the pains because everything was\ninfected. So this was in the winter. Somehow my brother got a sleigh with somebody, and\nthey took me out from the ghetto, and they brought me to the ghetto in Rzeszow, to Dr.\nHeller. He was a. It was a specialist for ear, throat and nose. And he said that I have to have\nan operation right away. If I wouldn't have operation, I would die because all the puss was\naround the brain, but he cannot operate. There is no facilities. There are no Jewish hospital in\nRzeszow, and I cannot go to a non-Jewish hospital. So I went there with my sisters. I was\nthere with my sisters. So I have to go to Krakow. How can you go to Krakow? Jews are not\npermitted to ride by train. So my brother went back to Kolbuszowa and somehow he\nmanaged to get a false...from this Rappaport some that he had, a pass signed by this Earding,\nby this Land Kommissar, but it was not made out to nobody, so he made out my name with\nmy sisters and they took me, with the train, to Krakow. On the train, a young Polish boy\ncame up and he saw that there are three Jews, my two sisters and myself. He said, \"What are\nJews doing on the train?\" He said, \"I'm coming now from Germany. I work in Germany. In\nGermany, they wouldn't allow Jews on the train.\u201d And he started to speak to the rest of the\npeople. He said, \"We cannot have Jews on the train. We have to throw them out.\u201d And they\ncame to us and they wanted to throw us out from the running train. So my sister started to\ncry and to beg. They said, \"Look this man...this boy is almost dead. He's so sick. He needs an\noperations.\u201d My head was all with bandages. So some people they said, \"Well, Let's...let's\nwait til a station.\u201d There was a station. So this man went down. He brought up two\npolicemen, German policemen, and he said, \"I want you should throw them down because\nthey are Jews.\u201d So we showed him the papers. So the policeman said, \"What...we cannot do\nanything. They have the Passier Schein.\u201d That means they have a pass for travel. So again\nthey started to yell, \"Oh, we don't want to travel with Jews. So we will throw them out.\u201d\nAgain the same story, and my sisters begged them so they said okay. We'll not throw you\nout, but the next stop you have to go out. So we had to choice. The next stop. Meanwhile,\nthey caught the other Jew, and they threw him out from the running station. Not the\nGermans, the Poles. So the next station we stopped. So happens that it was in Tarnow. And\nTarnow was quite a big town. I knew Tarnow because I went to the Yeshiva in Tarnow, and\nwe had there a cousin. We came to the cousin and we were very lucky that in Tarnow there\nwas a doctor. His name was David Rabinowitz. And this David Rabinowitz, he was the chief\nsurgeon in Lodz in a hospital in the name of Poznanski, a very rich manufacturer. And he\nwas thrown out from Lodz and he came to Tarnow. So we came to him, and he looked at me\nand he said, \"I don't think so we can do anything to this boy because it's too long. Everything\nis already full with puss.\u201d But anyway, they made an operation. The operation took 8 hours,\nand he operated and he said, \"Well, he will be deaf or blind or something or he will die.\u201d But\nanyway, he operated so that after 3, 4 weeks my hearing came back and when he operated he\neven cut the drum for the puss to come out, and then later he sew it. He was a wonderful man\nand I became alright and I came home with my head all bandaged and in our town they\nalready spoke about it that I'm dead already. Now I want to tell you what happened to this\nDavid Rabinowitz. He was such a wonderful surgeon, such a wonderful man;a Jewish doctor\ncouldn't operate on a Gentile. But there was a case that somebody was very sick on the same\nthing and there was not a Polish doctor he should do this operation because it was a very\ndelicate operation. They came to him, and he told them, \"I cannot operate on a non-Jew.\u201d So\nthey said, \"Listen, you have to save this man.\u201d He went and he operated.\u201d And he saved him.\nAbout a week later, a brother-in-law of the man who was operated...a Polish guy also, went\nto the Germans and he told them that this Rabinowitz operated on his brother-in-law. They\ncame to the hospital, and from the hospital they they dragged him out to the yard, and they\nshot him. They shot him because he operated a non-Jew. And he saved him. Well, those\nwere the times. So when I came home, the whole situation in Kolbuszowa was already\ndifferent. During the 3 months, everything was pushed toward the end and we didn't know in\nthis time that are\ndeath camps, gas chambers. This was in April 1942, and this time you didn't have any\ntransports yet, but we could feel from the Germans' behavior that every day something else\ncame up. When I came back so I got back my job. Instead to go to work, I got back my job to\ngo for merchandise from the other towns, and I got the pass. I took over the ambulatorium\nfrom Dr. Unterman and I got all his instruments and I got medicine. I already knew what\nmedicines applied to this and which medicine applied to his, and I bought in the Apotheke\nmore medicine so I got a pass that I am in Gesundheitsdienst, which means a health service,\nthat I could go out from the ghetto if it's needed, which was very helpful. And we lived again\nin the ghetto. And this was the 28th of April, the 28th of April, 1942, we were sitting home\nand we had dinner cause dinner was not at night, but dinner was around 12, | o'clock. And\nwhat the dinner was, probably a tomato soup, a potato soup, something very austere. So we\nwere sitting, and then we hear somebody knocking on the door downstairs, and from the\nknocking we right away knew it's Germans because this was their knocking. Not knocking,\nbanging. And somebody looked through the window. They saw two Gestapo men standing,\nbecause their uniforms, the Gestapo had uniforms with SS, and we knew their banging. So\nthe first thing my sisters bolted the door from the inside, and the first thing was to hide the\nmen, because in this time we thought the men are most vulnerable. So my brother and I we\nwere home, so we ran out through the back door through the yard. We run out to a neighbor,\nand we run to the attic. We thought maybe they come to us, they will not go to them. My\nsister took my father and they put him in the outhouse in the yard and put in a padlock on the\ndoor to make believe that nobody is there because the padlock is on the outside. And he was\nthere. They were banging and banging. When they saw that not nobody opens and they\ncannot break down the door, one of the Gestapo went around the houses to see to go from\nthe back entrance. And then my sister was afraid that maybe it's not a good place for my\nfather to be there because they keep banging. Maybe he should go where I am hiding, so she\nwent and she opened the\n02:14:\nouthouse and let out my father. In this moment, the other Gestapo came from the back and he\nfaced my father. He first thing, he had a list and he asked my father, \"What's your name?\"\nMy father knew that if somebody would be on the list, he would be on the list. So he said,\n\"My name is Salich.\u201d\u201d Was Salsitz, but Salich. He looked. He didn't see no Salich.\nMeanwhile, they dragged out the other...you know when that men from the front broke down\nthe door, he took out the other man with him. His name was Hoofer. He was not on the list.\nAnd he took him to the yard, and he asked this Hoofer, \"What is this man's name?\" And he\nsaid, \"Salsitz.\u2019\u2019 He didn't know why, what, so he said, \"Salsitz.\u201d Well, so they had him on the\nlist, so they told the other man to go back and they took my father and started to push him\ntowards a wood shed which was in the yard. And, naturally, we knew, they took out the\nrevolvers, we knew what it is. So my two sisters, my single two sisters were with him. They\nstarted to scream and they runned to the Gestapo men to try to take out their revolvers. Why\nthey didn't shoot them I don't understand til now. So one [sister], the older one, Maddle, went\nto one and she grabbed his hand and she tried to pull out the revolver from him so he took\nthe revolver and hit her over the head and the head started to bleed and she fell down. When\nmy second sister, the youngest sister, she was 3 years older than I, saw this. She run to the\nsecond one and started to twist his hand and take out the revolver. He did the same thing. He\nhit her til she fell down. And they took my father and they pushed him in this wood shed and\nI could hear two shots. Now those shots were the loudest shots I ever heard in my life. They\nwere something so loud that til today, I hear them. Til today when I wake up at night, I could\nhear those two shots. It was something, and I saw them going in the woodshed from this attic\nwindow, but I didn't see what they're doing. And when they shot and my sisters were there,\nand they ran in and the two Gestapo men walked out from the wood shed after the two shots.\nThen you could hear the screams of my father. But the screams were not human screams.\nThey were screams like they would come from heaven or from an unnatural animal.\nSomething...not a human scream. He started to scream so loud I could hear it in the attic. The\nfirst thing he screamed, he said...he started to say Vidui. Vidui is a prayer when religious\nJews say before death. And then he ended with Shema Yisrael. He said the Shema so loud\nthat I could...it rings in my...in my ears. Then later he started to yell Nekuma, nemt Nekuma.\nIt means revenge, revenge. Take revenge. And he didn't stop yelling this word revenge and\nwhen this...when he started to yell this, the two men, the two Gestapo heard it because they\nwere in the next yard. They came back because they heard him still yelling. They came back\nand they shot him five times more and he became quiet. During all the time I was 1n this\nattic, I...I couldn't...I said to hear my father's being shot....I see it. I hear it. I don't do\nanything? Why don't you do anying. Now what could I do? I wanted to say something. I\ncouldn't. I wanted to move. I couldn't. I was like a piece of stone. After it was quiet I said to\nmy brother, \"I'm going down.\u201d And when I came down, so the two Gestapo men and I\nremember, they were young, tall, blond, handsome, and one's name...I remember his\nname...because I saw him before. His name was Norman. Norman. I'm trying to get now his\npicture. And they were still standing with their revolvers in their hand. And when they saw\nme and they saw my head was all full of with bandages because this was from the operation,\nso they thought maybe I was wounded today because there was so much shooting. And\nusually somebody was wounded, they finished him off. So they came...one came into me,\ntook out his revolver. And with him was a young Jewish policeman. So he asked him,\n\"Where was he wounded?\" He said, \"No, he wasn't wounded. He just came back from the\nhospital. He had an operation on his head.\u201d So he put back his revolver, and I went back to\nsee where my father was shot. And then I saw my mother, with the sister, and those little\nbabies, 3 years old, my nieces, beautiful babies like angels were sitting there and crying.\nThey probably didn't know what the crying 1s for, but everybody is crying, they were crying.\nAnd I could see my mother, my sisters laying over my father and kissing his face and\ncaressing him and he was dead. One hand was ripped, broken off because when they shot\nhim they hit the hand and the bullets hit the bones and the hand was...you could see the hand\nlaying in the side.\n:\nAnd he was laying there and they were crying and kissing him. One thing I want to tell you\nbefore...before this day. About a week before, this Pasha Rappaport, the new president from\nthe Judenrat came, to the Judenrat and he had a list of about 15 Jews who had long beards\nand he gave a note that the Jews should cut off their beards, that Farding, the\nLandkommissar told him that when he brings his friends to visit the ghetto, he's very much\nembarrassed to see so many Jews with beards. So he wants the beards should be cut off. And\nmy father was on the list that they had to cut off the beard. For my father to cut off the beard\nwas the worse thing because since his beard started to grow, he never touched a hair, even in\nthe first world war in the army, he never touched the beard. So we called a young boy a\nbarber to our home to cut his beard. So he begged him to leave him a little bit here. And\nwhen he cut it, my father was sitting, he was pale like it was white, and after he finished he\ngot up and in Yiddish he said, \"Jetzt hob Ich gefielt dem Ta'am miesse\".. It means now I felt\nthe taste of death when he cut this beard. And when we looked on my father we didn't\nrecognize him. He looked like a strange person because we were always used to seeing him\nwith a full grey beard. And here he's shaven. It looked like a different person. This a week\nbefore he was shot. After he was shot, the Gestapo came back and they told me with this\nyoung Jewish policeman and they said, \"We want you should go and gather together all the\ndead people and bring them to the cemetery, to the Jewish cemetery to be buried.\u201d So he\ntook me and we went to somebody who had a wagon, and the men were shot, and you could\nhear from different houses screaming, yelling. This day they came and they had a list of 20\nJews. Because they said they're going to kill one percent of the Jews. There were two\nthousand Jews. So they had a list of 20 Jews, the most prominent Jews from before the war\nto be shot. But the end was they they killed 22. I don't know by mistake or just for good\nmeasure. You know, when you buy something, you add...but they killed 22. So we went and\nwe started to get together those dead people on the wagons to take them to the Jewish\ncemetery. I went alone. I didn't feel anything in this time even my father was shot. But my\nfather always had a reserved place on the cemetery near his father. Now we are Kohanim. I\ndon't know if you know, Kohanim means from the priestly family. And this goes over from\nfather to son from father to son, father son. Because the Kohanim cannot go on the cemetery,\nso usually the Kohanim, the priests were buried right by the road. There was a big road in the\nmiddle of the cemetery. On both sides the Kohanim were buried. Why? So their children\ncould come closer to their graves. So my father's father which I am named after him was\nburied there, and my father always had a reserved place to be buried next to him. We knew\nabout it. So we decided, my brother and I that we would bury my father next to him.\nEven|though] the general said to make one common grave. So what we did, when we came a\nfew times to pick up the people. So then later we put our father so that his leg should stick\nout and I told my brother, my brother-in-law that when we will go through with the wagon,\nthey should wait by my grandfather's grave and pull him out and we'll make a grave near his\nfather, at least this to do for him that he should be buried near his father. We came. They\nwaited. We pulled him out. We started to make the common grave for everybody, but my\nfather was buried near my grandfather. The grave for all the people were made next to the\ncommon grave from the pogrom. As I told you, May the 6th, 1919, nine Jews were killed\nand all the nine were buried in a common grave. So we made the grave next to them for all\nthe rest of people. We didn't make a deep grave because it started to be dark so we just made\na shallow grave. We covered them, and we said we'll come back tomorrow to bury them. We\ncame home. I came home and my home. And my mother started...was sitting and crying. She\nsaid, \"They took away my crown...my crown,\" because he was the crown of the family. And\nwe were sitting a whole night, and the next day my brother, my brother-in-law and I and\nother people went back to make the proper burial. Everybody brought in for the parents a\ntallit. It means a prayer shawl. We brought in like shrouds. Now we didn't prepare shrouds,\nbut every Jew had a kittel, a white coat that he wore three times...twice a year. He wore it on\nYom Kippur. He wore it Passover to the Seder, and he was buried tn it. So we brought it for\nmy father to put him in in it. Also, we took a sack with wood because the wood where we\nwas shot in the wood shed was sprinkled, soaked with blood and we believe in the Jewish\ntradition, we believe that the blood is the soul of the person and we wanted this should be\nburied, so we took the wood and we put it in the grave. We opened the grave and made it\ndeep. We put in the kittel. We put in the prayer shawl, and we buried him next to my\ngrandfather. We did the same thing with the other people. Also there is a tradition that if\nsomebody is killed, when he is buried to put in a\n02:27:\nknife in his right hand. The belief is that this is for revenge. He should revenge his death. So\nwe brought knives and we put in everybody's hand a knife. We also put in a knife in my\nfather's hand. And we buried them, and when we came back I stopped by a tree. I didn't cry\nall the time. And I burst out and crying. I couldn't stop. And I with a such a loud a voice said,\n\"Why? Why? Why?\" And for about a half hour I was standing near a tree crying and crying.\nWell, I stopped. I couldn't cry anymore. We came home, and we sat down to Shivah, which\nis 7 days of mourning. Now when I sat down, my father he believed in Jahrzeit. Jahrzeit\nmeans that we on the day of the death we commemorate the dead person, and as we have this\ncommemoration we say Kaddish and other prayers. Also we light a candle, a Jahrzeit lamp, a\ncandle in a glass which lasted 24 hours. Now in the ghetto you couldn't buy candles for\nJahrzeit. Here you go in a supermarket, you can buy as many candles as you want. Ina\nghetto, you cannot buy candles. My father had Jahrzeit after his father 13 days in the month\nof Ijar. This was in the spring. This was in the spring...13 days, and he prepared a whole year\npieces of wax, pieces of paraffin, paraffin and he collected it and he wanted to make for his\nday to commemorate his death, this 24 hour glass with paraffin for his father 13 days in Jjar.\nIt took him a whole year to collect this paraffin. He never did it because he was shot 11 days\nof the month of Ijar, 2 days earlier. So when I came back, he was shot II days[in the month of\njar]. When I came back from the cemetery, it was 12 days in the month of Ijar. I went and I\nmade a wick, I melted the paraffin and I made this Yahrzeit candle for 24 hours, and when I\nlit it, I lit it for both of them. For my father who prepared it for his father, which was a day\nlater. And after my father was shot, the whole situation in our home changed. Because even\nhe was not active during the war, he was 60 years old, and the Germans made the list,\nbecause he was 60 years old, that means that he was unproductive. Because til 60 you were\nproductive. You could do something, where[as] by 60 you were not any more productive. So\nyou had to be killed. He was 60 years old. And the life changed completely. Our life, we had\nto go every day to pray. Well, there was no prayers, but in somebody's basement a few\npeople came together to have Minyan, to have 10 people, and we pray for it. So this was the\nfirst victim of my family that was killed. Now my brother, who was in the Judenrat in the\nfirst Judenrat, he was arrested also. And all of them were killed. My father was let out. He\nwasn't killed. Now I don't know if you want to know the reason why he wasn't killed. It...1t's\nnot necessary. Okay. So this he was, my father was the first victim from our family. After\nthis killing when they killed the 22 Jews in the ghetto, every day, every day something\nnew....and we felt in the air that something...the Germans are pushing too much, with too\nmuch orders...one order after the other that we couldn't finish the first one, a new order came\nin. Two weeks later, the Judenrat, the whole community...the leaders, were called to\nRzeszow who was the capitol of the state seat the Germans called it the Gauleihter. Gau was\nlike a state. And this...we belonged to them. They called all the presidents and all the\nmembers of the Judenrat to this town and there was a Dr.Ehrhaus. He was the\nKreishauptmann. Kreishauptmann was like head of state. And Dr. Ehrhaus was a major in\nthe SS, and he got together all the Jews...their leaders from all the State and he came in. He\nhad a paper and he read, \"As the Jews are filthy. Full of lice. And because they are so filthy,\nthere is an epidemic of a typhus in our state. I am putting in Polish . Kontributsia, means they\nhave to pay so much money. And he gave out Rzeszow a million zlotys. This town so\nmany...200,000 zlotys. Kolbuszowa 360,000 zlotys. And each town had to pay so much\nmoney. He said, \"In a week, you bring the money. If you will not bring the money, how\nmuch money you will be short, so much percent people who will take from your Judenrat,\nfrom your council, and we will shoot them. If there is 10 percent less, we will shoot 10\npercent. Twenty percent, we shoot twenty percent.\" Pashek Rappaport who was the Aelteste,\nwho was the president with all the members of the Judenrat came back to our town and they\ntold this, that they need 360,000 zlotys. Three hundred and sixty thousand zlotys after being\nin the war and the ghetto, people starved because at this time people started to starve. And\nevery day we find, did you hear this man starved...this man starved...this. Started to starve.\nThey didn't have what to eat. So to get together 360,000 slotas is impossible. We started to\ncollect. The next day they had to go back with the whole member|ship] and everybody from\nthe Judenrat knew that there is a shortage so much, so many will be killed. Again, they took\nthem in the same room and everybody had a burlap sack with money and asked them, \"How\nmuch you have? How much you have?\" Only our town, only Kolbuszowa, had the full\namount, 360,000 zlotys. All the other towns were missing. Like for instance, Rzeszow\nneeded a million zlotys. They only had 750,000. It means 25 percent was missing. Right\naway, he took out 25 percent from their members of the Jewish council, put them in aside.\nThe other town, the same thing. And I had a list, exactly Rzeszow, Barzava. I remember all\nthe names, and in the book I have every amount and they took out so many people, they took\nthem out in the yard, and in the yard they took out the machine gun and they shot them...25\npercent or how much was this. After they were shot, they got together what was remaining.\nEhrenhaus came back again with a new list and he said, \"Within a week, you go back. Every\ncommunity has to pay taxes from 1914 til today, if some Jew owes taxes.\u201d Now there were\nJews who were killed in the first world war fighting for their fatherland. There were Jews\nwho left for America. There were Jews who died, didn't leave no nobody. The community\nwas responsible. Every Jew...the Jewish community\n02:36:\nhad to pay up the taxes from 1914. Not only this, every Pole can put in a claim that a Jew\nowes him money without any documentation that he owes him money and the Jewish\ncommunity has to pay him within a week. And again what percentage will be missing, so\nmuch will be shot. They come back and this was a terrible thing. Here we got 360,000\nzlotys. We didn't know how it was collected. People are starving, and here they want we\nshould pay off taxes from 1914 til today for people who don't exist anymore. Right away the\nDirector of Internal Revenue was notified. He had to dig out books who were laying,\ncovered with dusk and he started to add and to add. We figured out, I say we the Jews\nfigured out that we will have a half a million slotas to pay for those things which was\nimpossible to collect. But this we figured. And the Poles were notified that everybody can\nclaim their debt what the Jews owed them. Imagine if they had a free hand to claim money\nand the way they loved us, imagine how many claims came in, without documentation. One\nepisode I remember. There was a man. His name was Fritz. Jan Fritz. He had a small store in\nthe village and he used to buy by my father. He always used to owe my father money. I\nremember when the war broke out he owed us thousand zlotys. He never paid it. He came in\nand had a claim that my father owed him 5,000 slotas. As I could go out from the ghetto and\nI knew him, I went to him. And I said, \"Fritz, you owed us money. How could you come in\nand to say that my father owes you 5,000 zlotys. You know this 1s a lie.\u201d He said, \"If you\nwill not go out this minute, I will raise it to 10,000 slotas.\u201d\u2019 And he could do it. I didn't say\nanything. I went out. Well, anyway, the claims from the Poles with the taxes came out to a\nmillion zlotys. Now how can you collect from the poor, wretched Jews who are in the ghetto,\nwho are already 1n the war 2 years, starving, to get a million slotas. Again, got together and\nthis time they used force. They beat up some people, but anyway, in a week it had to be\ndone. In a week they went back. Only Kolbuszowa, only our town, had a million slotas. The\nrest didn't have. Again the same story. How much it was missing, they were shot. We came\nback. After\n02:39:\nthey paid, and they were shot, he came out a house, again, with a new list. He said, \"This\ntime, within 7 days, every Jew had to leave the ghetto to Rzeszow. I'm sorry, not 7 days, 3\ndays. \"After 3 days, within 3 days, you have time 3 days, to leave Kolbuszowa to the town of\nRzeszow to the ghetto. And then all the towns from all the sections had to be relocated to\nRzeszow and to clear out of our ghettos. Of course, later we find out this was their methods.\nThey wanted to have the Jews in one place. So when they came back, this was the worst\nthing. The money somehow they sold the last thing, and we sold it to the Polish people for\nnothing. Like everything what we had, we sold it just to get money. And they got everything\nfor nothing. But the last order was the worst order. We will leave our town. In our town\nsomehow, everybody had somebody, acquaintances. Some people who could smuggle in.\nWe even had peasants we knew. Here we'll go to some place. Nobody knows nobody. How\nwill we survive with the children? And this was the worst thing that would happen til now.\nWe had to leave our home. And we started to leave. The peasants were notified that they\nshould come the next day with wagons, line up outside the ghetto. Eight in the morning the\ndoors of the ghetto were opened. They came in, and everybody could pick up a peasant.\nThey said you can take along anything you want. And they gave us wagons. The reason\nwhy, they wanted we should take along anything...only not furniture, because they wanted to\naccumulate, to assemble all the things that Jews have in one place, to be easier for them to\ntake it away. So the peasants were lined up and we started to load the people the\nmerchandise. Now I went out and I picked out two wagons with two horses each, peasants\nthat I knew from my family to load everything what we had. Now we decided to go the first\nday because my brother when he was released from jail, he became friendly with one\nGerman policeman. And this German policeman helped him to get out of jail. So he asked\nhim, \"What should we do? Should we go with the last day or the first day?\" He said, \"Go\nwith the first day, because it's 1n the hands of the Gestapo, and you never know what they\nwill do. Maybe there will be too many people in the other ghetto. They will come and they\nwill kill everybody. So go the first day.\u201d So my family went the first day. We loaded the\nsacks with everything we had. And there was a line, and they moved, we went 31 kilometers\nto Rzeszow. Now nobody could sit on their wagon. Old people, children, everybody had to\nwalk on the right side of the wagon. Walk the 31 kilometers to Rzeszow. You want me to\nstop now?",
        "Q: No. That's okay.",
        "A: Okay. So this how we were chased out from our town. There was one episode that I have to\ntell you. There was a man. He actually was from Germany. He was a Jew from Germany. He\ncame back to our town, and he walked with his wife, with his son, and with his mother-in-\nlaw, and father-in-law, after the wagon. But in one moment he made a mistake. Instead to be\non the right side, he was on the left side. A German policeman which was from our town. I\nremember even his name, Barthelmus, took a rifle and shot him. He fell down. His wife and\nhis child, he had a 12 year old child, couldn't even stop for a moment to go and to see what\nhappened with him. He was left laying on the street. They had to go forward. Now I went to\nthe third day, not the first day. The reason I went the third day because we still had things\nand merchandise and I wanted to be there two days to give it out during the night to friendly\nPoles. Maybe we'll come back. Maybe we'll retrieve it. So after the Jews went out with their\nwagons, we went and we took this men on the hand wagon and we brought him to the\ncemetery and we buried him. And I remembered he wore a grey suit, a grey suit with blue\nstripes, and he had yellow shoes. Usually by us, Jews didn't wear this kind of clothing, but he\nwas from Germany. He had modern clothes. So I remember the grey suit with blue, not\nstripes, blue squares. And we buried him. About a week later or 2 weeks later when we came\nback, I had to go to the cemetery because they killed somebody and I went to bury them.\nYou see, before my father was killed, I never saw a dead person. The minute my father was\nkilled, I don't know, every time they had to bury somebody, it pulled me. I wanted to do it. I\nwanted to do it. And before I never saw it. So somebody was killed, so I took him to the\ncemetery. When I took him to the cemetery, the caretaker of the cemetery, he was an old\nPolish man, I saw him wearing a grey suit with blue squares with yellow shoes. So we buried\nhim. I knew that he wouldn't let it go. He uncovered him and he took it out and he wore it.\nNow we were in Rzeszow. They brought into Rzeszow Jews. In Rzeszow were in this time\nabout 30,000 Jews. They brought into Rzeszow from this town maybe other 40,000 Jews\nfrom all the little towns. There was not enough place...I'm not talking about apartments or to\nhave a roof over your head. There was not enough place in the alley ways, on the streets, for\nall the Jews to put some place. And they came with those wagons. They brought their things,\nsome better, some worse. Every peasant who came to do the service was told that if he brings\nthe Jews to Rzeszow, if he has two horses the Jew must pay him 200 zlotys for\ntransportation. If he has one horse, the Jew must pay him 100 zlotys for the transportation. In\ncase the Jew doesn't have the money or doesn't give him the money, because sometimes they\ndidn't have, he shouldn't let unload the sacks. This was his pay. He can go home what they\nput on the wagon and take it for himself because they didn't pay him. So a lot of people didn't\nhave the 200 slotas so they took away right away which didn't make a difference. The\nGermans took it away later. So I came to Rzeszow the third day, and Rzeszow\nwas...sometimes if you talk about tower of Babel how the people couldn't understand [one\nanother]. This was the tower of Babel. People were running around like crazy. Children lost\ntheir parents. Parents lost their\n02:47:\nchildren. They tried to find themselves. Imagine to bring in so many people from different\nplaces. And on the way so many people were killed. Like this woman lost her husband. And\nthen a woman with children, the husband was killed because he did something wrong. He\nwent on the left side instead of the right side. Everybody was lost. And then to feed those\npeople. It was impossible to feed so many people who came in in one day. Because they all\nhad to come in within 3 days from all the towns around. To have places, I'm not talking\nsanitary places, but for anything, it was impossible. It was the worst sight that a person can\never imagine; some horror story, some horror picture, the people were put together. This was\nit. When they were there, came out an order that the 7th of July and this was a week later, the\npeople from this and this section have to assemble in this and this place, and they will be\nrelocated. Nobody knew that there are death camps. Nobody knew in this time that there are\ncrematoriums. Would the people know that they are death camps, like my family and my\nsisters, we could run away. We had peasants that we knew. I don't know if we would\nsucceed to survive, but at least we would try. Like those Jews I later joined them in the\nwoods, what they never went with this transport. We didn't know. We figured they would\nsend us in camps to work or something. The rumor was they're going to send us to the east to\nthe Ukraine to work in camps. We didn't know about it. They assembled...in one day, they\nassembled 30,000 Jews or 25,000 Jews. This was the first day on the Umschlagplatz be taken\nto the railroad station. Jews could take only one bundle with them. Now everything they told\nthem to take along to Rzeszow they were allowed...this was a calculated thing, so if they had\nto leave in their house. Now, what they did, there was a big ghetto. In every town, there was\na big ghetto, and later made it a small ghetto. This was a big ghetto. So they took the people\nfrom this and this streets. They cleaned them out. They left everything home. This way they\nhad a chance to go 1n and to clean out everything. The people came to the Umschlagplatz.\nThe Umschlagplatz was a terrible, a terrible scene. I wasn't there, but later I was told. Before\nthe Jews came in, they had to leave their bundle. Then later they took 2 girls, 3 girls,\nbeautiful girls and they told them to go around and collect all valuables from the people, to\ncollect money, to collect gold, to collect watches, and they did baskets. They brought them\nover where the Gestapo was standing, where the SS were standing. They were SS men, all\ndrunk. Later, they still didn't believe that Jews gave everything. So they went and they\npointed out young girls. It so happens that they pointed out one of my friends. A beautiful\ngirl. Her name was Susza Fein, and they put her and they undressed her and they started to\nlook in every place if she didn't conceal something. She was in this time 19 years old. And\nthey did it so cruel that they used instruments that they cut open her belly. And they looked\nthat the Jews didn't hide something. The Kolbuszowa Rabbi, an old man of about 75 years\nwas standing and he was blind. So they came to him and they asked him something and he\ncouldn't understand. So they took out a revolver and they went to shoot him. He had two\ngranddaughters. One was 16 and one was 18. Beautiful girls. They started to beg this SS\nmen. He's our grandfather. He was the Rabbi of the town. Please don't shoot him. He will go\nwith us. So they shot him, and they shot the two girls in the same time. Well, anyway, they\ntook away 6,000 Jews, elderly, crippled, children and they took them away and they had to\nwalk to a town near ??., They had prepared ditches in the woods, and those people were\nkilled in those ditches. The rest they took to the railroad and they were transported to Belzec.\nOn the way to the railroad, they were shooting in the columns that a few hundred people\nremained dead on the street laying where they were shooting. They put in the people in the\nrailroad trains. In the trains before they put in the people, they put on the floor untreated\nlime. I don't know...lime if it is not treated and if it's mixed with water, it starts to boil and it\nstart to give out gas. So those were untreated lime, because they knew that soon the floor will\nbe wet and then the gases will come out and then people will choke. Instead to take from\nRzeszow to Belzec by train would take 3 hours, it took them 3 days. When the people came\nto Belzec, they opened the railroad cars. More than 50 percent were dead. And then they had\nto wait. We find this out later. We, at this time we didn't know...we...well, I jumped a little\nbit. I...I will tell you",
        "Q: I need you to stick to what you saw.",
        "A: Okay. Alright. Okay. So when we came to Rzeszow...when I came the third day, and when I\nsaw those things what's going on there with the people. So Farding gave out an order that he\nneeds...you see, our town...there were four towns belonged to our town...our county...that he\nneeds hundred young boys for each town to go back, and he will make a camp, a labor camp.\nThe reason...we should destroy, taking apart the ghetto. To Sokolov, Glogov, ?? , and ?? . I\nvolunteered with my brother to go back. The reason I volunteered because I thought I will be\nback. I have peasants that I know. I will be able to buy food somehow to send it to our family\nto the ghetto, Rzeszow, because in Rzeszow they would starve. But without sending them\nsomehow, we would. So we went back. We walked a whole night back. In the morning we\nwere taken into the Shul, to the temple, to the Houses of Study, and this became our\nbarracks, and this became our new life to be in a labor camp in Kolbuszowa. Meanwhile the\npeople were taken to Belzec, and they were made four transports from the people. In the four\ntransports within every week two transports, and they cleared up the big ghetto, the large\nghetto and everybody was left who had a card to work, they put in the small ghetto. And the\nsmall ghetto, and they liquidated the big ghetto, and we were 1n this time in the camp. And\nwe started to work as a labor camp. What we did in the beginning we started to destroy the\nhouses, taking apart. We saved everything for the Germans. For the Germans was very\nimportant to have old material, scrap, because they could make new material. So we picked\nout one house, and one room was paper, and one was brass and lead and so on and so on.\nAnd we destroyed this ghetto. Destroying the ghetto was a very painful thing because we\nknew the people. And we destroyed 300 years of a continuation of people who lived in this\ntown for 300 years, they were conceived in those houses. They died in those houses. They\nwere married in those houses. And now the people are gone, and the houses are being\ndestroyed. We threw down from the attics things that you would never believe that people\nsaved those things. And you could see the poverty of the people. They never throw out\nanything. Old iron beds, old iron stoves, barrels. Everything we threw it out. And then later\nthe house came down. We knocked it down. You could see the dust, and the dust went up\nand then you could see 300 years of life in this little Stetl, that it was destroyed. We cleared\nthe ghetto. We made a field out of it. And we still didn't know what happened to our people.\nSo we sent...we took a Pole. We paid him money, and we send him to go with the road\nwhere the trains went and then he came back and he told us the story. That they were taken\nto Belzec, and then we find out that they are death camps. This was the first time that they\nsent to death camps, which Belzec was. They tried out how to do it, so Belzec...it was not a\ncrema...it was not gas chambers like in Auschwitz, sophisticated with Zyklon. In Belzec,\nthey had old motors, and then with the gas, with the carbon monoxide and then later they\nburied the people. They burned them. This how we find out that our people are dead. We\nworked in this camp, and we knew that the end will be soon because we almost destroyed\nthe ghetto and there was not any more work. Why would they keep us. So they get us...we\nhad a river in our town. So he get us to regulate the river, to make it straight the banks. So we\nworked there. But soon we knew that we will what will they need? Farding played around\nwith us. We were like his small army. We had between our people a man. His name was\nLampel. He was a sergeant in the Austrian army. He was a drill sergeant. So he told them to\ndrill us, and we used to march like soldiers.\n02:58",
        "Q: Excuse me. This is a good place for us to stop and change tapes.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We worked in this camp. And we had [it] quite good. The reason why? We didn't have no\nGerman guards. All the towns around us were Judenrein. There were no Jews around\nanymore because all the Jews were taken away. We had in our section, we had a few labor\ncamps, which the German organized. One was in Breshatka, and one was in Hutta\nKomarovska, and one was in Mielec. Mielec was quite known, because this was the second\nplace that they tattooed people. They didn't give numbers, but they had on their head a KL.\nKL it means Konzentrations Lager. Now if some people had the KL, I know they were in\nMielec. And this was very close to us. And we didn't have no guards. It means that we were\non our own. But Farding got us together, and he said, \"If one of us will escape, 10 of us...10\nwill be hanged.\u201d He made us responsible for everybody, to make sure nobody will escape.\nAnd every day we went to work. Then later, suddenly, I became friendly with Farding, and it\nwas very...there was one town, Sokolow. Sokolow belonged to us....to our county. The night\nof the expulsion of the Jews in Sokolow, when they told them to go to Rzeszow ghetto,\nFarding came to Sokolow drunk. And he said he wants Jews. So they started to bring him old\nJews, because they figured the old Jews will not survive the trips or something. He wanted\nand so they brought them...and he started to kill them. And he killed 1n this night...he killed\n49 Jews by himself with his own hand. He was drunk. He had a bottle of vodka. He drank\nVodka, and he killed. They brought him Jews and he killed. There was a pile of Jews. But he\nwas such a sadist, and he knew everything about Jewish religion because they...like I told\nyou before he spoke Polish. He said, \"He's going to kill the Jews to make them kosher. They\nshould go straight to heaven because they will be kosher.\u201d And he told them he's going to do\nwith the Jews the same thing as Jews did with chickens before the war. If a chicken had to be\nmade kosher, and if it had to be soaked 1n water, then later put in salt on all sides, and then\nlater this had to be done in the night with candles, two candles...had to be held near the\nchicken to see if everything is correct. So he got the two Jews holding candles. He had there\na bag of salt. And every time he shot a Jew, he took salt and he put it on the wound and he\nsaid, \"You see, now I make it kosher, and now the Jew go straight to Heaven.\u201d Those were\nthe things to add to all that terrible things they did. They played with us, like a cat plays with\na mouse before...before it [kills]... So this Farding suddenly became friendly with me. Now\nthe reason why he became friendly with me...I knew why. Because he liked to have\nsomebody who should confident...who should get confident and later to find out all kind of\nstories that he wants to know. Like he had there a young boy and I write about him a lot...a\nboy from 16 years, and he promoted him in the Rzeszow ghetto to be the assistant\ncommandant of the Police. A 16 year old boy...his name was Isaac Silber. He was from our\ntown. And if you speak to a Rzeszow Jew about Issac Silber, you will know a lot. Issac\nSilber was from my town. He was born by my town. And before the war, his mother...he\ndidn't have a father...his mother used to be the one...she wished to work in the public baths.\nVery low people. And this Isaac Silber was very smart, and he started to be a friend with\nFarding. Farding kept him, and he found out from him everything he wanted, and for this\nreason when the Jews were sent to Belzec, he promoted him. And he make him the assistant\ncommandant in Rzeszow. A young boy from 16 years old. So he became the famous Isaac\nSilber. We used to call him Itschele. Itschele was his name. So he became friendly ...\nProbably he thought that becoming friendly with me, maybe he would get a second Itschele\nor something. Now the reason how I got together with him is when we came back, he found\na warehouse with hundreds of crates with all kind of merchandise. And on the crates was\nwritten Isaac Salsitz. I don't know if you remember, when my father...1n the beginning of the\nwar, somebody squealed, and the Germans came and took away all the merchandise. It took\nthem three days to take out everything we had. This was never used. They put in a\nwarehouse, and it was laying there. Now Farding finds out...they found it, so he needed\nsomebody who knew about this merchandise. So he came to our commandant of our camp,\nwhich was a Jewish man from Krakow. His name was Henry Mundt, and he said, Mundt I\nneed somebody to clear out this warehouse. So he said what you need better. I have here a\nson from Isaac Salsitz. Who knows better? So he went...took me. He sent me home with him,\nand I come in and I see our merchandise was laying there. And what he wanted...I should\nmake packages...to unpack everything, and make packages from soap, from coffee, from\nchocolate, from tea, from cocao. All those things what they don't have in Germany, I made\npackages and I send it away. I made ready to send it to his home. So I worked there. And\nwhile I was working there every day in the morning they took me in this room. I worked\nthere, and then in the afternoon, they let me out for lunch. They let me out. They searched\nme if I don't steal anything. Steal my own stuff. And they let me back for lunch. And this I\nwent every day. The other boys worked to demolishing the houses or regulating the river,\nand I worked there. He used to come in every time, and he used to discuss with me things.\nAnd his biggest pleasure was to speak to me about girls. And somehow he told me stories\nthat since he was a young boy he was with girls. And he wanted to hear stories from me, and\nI had invent stories to tell him what womanizer I was. I didn't know her, but I had to tell him\nbecause he loved it. He even taught me all kind of expressions. He said do you remember\nMartin Luther famous saying, not the Martin Luther King, but Martin Luther, so his famous\nsaying was (in German) . It means twice a week it wouldn't hurt him, it wouldn't her, and it\nmakes in a year 102, what 1s right. This was his famous saying. And then every time he\ntalked different things and he asked me... One time he came in and he said to me, \"Do you\nknow what happened to your family?\" We knew already in this time that our family is dead.\nSo I said, \"No, I would like to know.\u201d He said, \"Yes, I saw your family last week in the\nUkraine.\u201d They were already dead 3, 4 months. He said, \"If you want, I can take you...if I\nhave my few days off, I go to Lwow with my car. I will take you along and I will take you to\nyour family where they work in a Kolkhoz. They work on a farm.\u201d So I knew the family is\ndead. I said, \"This would be nice.\u201d He said, \"I will do it.\u201d This...I don't know....he played\naround like this. One day we came out, 12 o'clock from this warehouse. I had a other man\nworking with me. And we stopped in a place where they used to distribute milk for free.\nThere was a milk factory, but they got the skim milk. They brought it over there, and the\nPoles used to stand in line and get milk for their family. So we made out that they gave for\nour kitchen...we had a kitchen there in our camp...that they gave for our kitchen every day 50\nquarts of milk. We made sour milk, other things. But we didn't have time to stand in line\nbecause there was always a long line. So I made up with a person who was in charge. So in\nthe morning we went to work. On the way I left the container. And when we came, lunch\ntime, I took the container, brought it to the kitchen and went back to work. One day I come\nfor the milk . There was a big line. There was one woman from our town. She was pretty\ngirl...but she was not the nicest person. She was a very loose woman, and during the war she\nhad a lot of German lovers. Anyway. So she said to me, \"You cannot go and take the milk\nwithout standing in line. You're not better than we. You have to stand in line.\u201d So I explained\nto her...I knew her from before the war...so I explained to her I cannot stay in line because\nonly I have is a half hour to go and eat and go back. She said, \"I don't care. If you don't stand\nin line, I will take the milk and I will pour it out.\u201d I didn't think she would do it, so I took the\nmilk without, and she run to me, took the milk, and she poured it out. So we came back\nwithout milk. So I told her something. I said, \"You shouldn't do it. And don't worry the war\nwill not last forever. I will remember you this.\u201d And...and that's it. And I went back to work.\nWhen I came home about 6, 7 o'clock a Polish commandant from the Polish police with a\nmustache going up like a typical Pole, he stands there and waits for me. And he says to me,\n\"You're Naftali Salsitz?\" I said, \"Yes.\u201d \"I want to tell you something. Tomorrow morning,\nwe'll have to shoot you. We got orders from Farding to shoot you. So what should I do?\n\"You run away.\u201d I thought he maked a joke. I said, \"Why?\" He said, \"Don't ask questions. I\nwant you should live.\u201d\u201d And he was known not to be a very tremendous Jew lover, so why\ndoes he tell it to me? So he said to me and I came and I told it to my friends what he told me.\nAnd everybody thought that I will escape and people were afraid because if I will escape, 10\nothers will be shot. So I said to my brother, I told him. He says, \"You know what' go speak\nto the Mayor.\u201d The Mayor was a very good friend of my father, because my father was\nassistant mayor before the war. So I went to him and I told him this. Go to Farding and see if\nyou can see he shouldn't. He said, \"I cannot go. I can't intervene for a Jew.\u201d So what should I\ndo? Escape. Everybody... Then he said to me, \"You know what? There is a man. His name is\nHalitski. He is the commandant of the Kripo, criminal policei, and he was a Ukrainian, but\nthe Germans made his this. \"Are you on good terms with Hailitski?\" I said, \"Very good\nterms.\u201d Now Halitski we were on good terms. Why? Because before the war, he was like a\nplain detective. And every holiday, he used to come to my father and he used to give him\nflour and sugar. You know just to be on good terms. So we were good to him. So I went to\nHailitzski, and I said to Halitzski, if I can...you see, I could work. I had a pass to work. So I\ncame to Halitzski, and he was a commandant of the Kripo, and I said to him, \"Can I talk to\nyou?\" He said, \"Yes.\u201d \"T have to tell you something.\u201d He said, \"What do you want to tell\nme? That tomorrow you will be shot?\" I said, \"Yes.\u201d \"I know about it.\u201d He already knew\nabout it. So I said, \"I came to you. Maybe you can help me. You were a friend with my\nfather.\u201d He said, \"Look, I cannot help you. You are a Jew. I cannot help you. But I want you\nshould live.\u201d \"So what should I do?\" \"Run away.\u201d I said, \"You're the commandant of the\nKripo should tell me to run away.\u201d He said, \"Yes.\u201d I said, \"They will hang 10 others.\u201d He\nsaid, \"What do you care. You will save your life.\u201d I said, \"What it is this, I have my brother\nhere.\u201d So he said, 'Take your brother and run away. I don't want to know about it. You run\naway.\u201d And he cannot help. I came back. Everybody was afraid that I run away and then\nwhose turn will be to be shot. Well, I didn't run away. I told them I will not because I don't\nwant they should kill 10 for I. The next day they went to work. I said goodbye to everybody.\nI put on very torn clothing. I took it from my friend, and I gave him my good clothing\nbecause if I be shot, let them have good shoes, good pants. And I came to my work, where I\nwork in the warehouse. Like nothing happened. Two policeman standing there, two Polish\npoliceman and they said to me, \"You come with me.\u201d I said, \"Why?\" And I already knew\nwhat it is so I came to them. They took me to the Polish police. I come in to the Polish\npolice. By the desk is sitting Patik was his name, the commandant who told me this. When\nhe saw me, he got pale. He saw me that I didn't run away. And there in the corner was\nstanding a shovel and they said, \"Take the shovel.\u201d So I took the shovel and he looked at me\nand I walked out. They took me about 200 yards away and they...one of them with the rifle,\nthe other with a rifle. They said, \"Start to dig.\u201d \"Dig for what?\" \"Don't ask questions? DIg.\u201d\nSo I started to dig. It was already a foot high. I said, \"Well, I'm digging, but tell me why am I\ndigging?\" \"Don't ask questions? Dig.\u201d\u2019 And I dug...I was already til here. \"What it was\nalready quite deep, so I said, \"Tell me the truth. Who you going to shoot here?\" \"Don't ask.\u201d\n\"It's me?\" They said, \"Yes.\u201d There were two. I said, \"Why?\" He said, \"Don't ask questions.\u201d\nSo standing there two policemen with rifles, I am digging my own grave. Now what went\nthrough my mind? My whole life from the first minute I remember to the family this and that\nwent through. People ask, \"What is the taste of death?\" Does somebody know the taste of\ndeath? Nobody knows the taste, because if somebody is dead he cannot tell you the story the\ntaste of death. But I know the taste of death. But usually the taste of death takes a second,\ntwo seconds, and somebody's shot. But me the taste of death took more than an hour because\nI had to stay there in the grave and I knew I will be killed. This was the taste of death. I can\ntell you how the taste of death feels. Not only once, I can tell you seven times how the taste\nof death is from other episodes. So what should I do? Should I throw sand? How can I\nthrow? One stands in this side, one stands in this side, with the rifles. So if I throw the other\none, so I told the one, one was very vicious, so I said to him, \"You know I ask you one favor.\nIf you know how to shoot. You're teaching me how to shoot. If you will shoot me, please kill\nme with one bullet. Shoot me through the head. I don't want...because I was thinking...I was\nafraid I will be buried alive. Until today when I have dreams, I have dreams from this day,\nand they shot me. They didn't kill me. I was buried alive. And then takes a long time to\nsuffocate. What can I do? And I had an idea. And I said to that man, \"You're going to shoot\nme anyway. Why don't you go to bring Farding to tell Farding I want to see him. Farding\nwas very shrewd. And I knew on every little thing, he wants to make out something of it.\nThey said, \"I don't want to go to Farding. If I got to Farding, I don't shoot you. He will kill\nme. He's a vicious man. He was very bad for the Poles too. I said, \"Go and tell him. You\nhave nothing to lose.\u201d \"You run away.\u201d I said, \"How can I run away? The other man stands\nhere?\" He didn't want to do it. Farding had a secretary. Her name was Shusa Kotaleska. She\nwas a girl from my town, and I knew her from before the war. So I told him, \"Go and tell\nShusa Kotaleska, I want to talk to her.\u201d They didn't want and one agree. He said, \"I will\nbring Shusa Kotaleska.\u201d They brought Shusa Kotaleska. She was Polish. When she saw me,\nshe started to cross herself and said, \"Oh Jesus, What's going on?\" I said, \"I don't know.\nThey're going to shoot me.\u201d She says, \"Why?\" I said, \"I don't know.\u201d I said, \"I need a favor.\nGo tell Fardring,.is Farding in the office?\" She said, \"Yes.\u201d \"Go tell Farding I want to see\nhim. I have very important things to tell him.\u201d And I knew this would be the\nvery...uh...things he will...\u201d \"I cannot go to Farding. You know him...\u201d I said, \"Go.\u201d She\nwent. Comes back in a few mnutes, and she told Farding...she said I want to tell him\nsomething very important. So she comes back and she said he wants to see you. I went back,\nso the policeman didn't have a choice, and they with the rifles on both side, go up to\nFardring. Fardring comes out of the office. In the office thre were about 10 girls. He said,\n\"Hey, verfluchter Jude, you there. You're crazy. He wasn't my friend anymore. You, what\nyou coming to see me? So I said, \"I have something very important to tell you.\u201d \"Alright,\nwhat is it?\" I said, \"Well, I cannot speak to you when all the people are here. I want to go in\nthe other room.\u201d He took out his revolver and he started to curse me. He said, \"Jude. Turn\naround. Going to shoot you like a dog.\u201d So I started to...you see, in this time, I was very\ncalm. You see by me, if I am very scared, I will become very calm. And I was...and I started\nto smile. I said, \"You threaten me to shoot in there. I dug my own grave. And you tell me...so\nhere at least I'll be shot under a roof.\u201d So he . Alright. He took me to the other room. And he\nsaid, \"What do you want to tell me? Want to tell me that the Jews have money? What you\ntell me?\" I said, \"No.\u201d Said, \"What do you want to tell me?\" \"You're going to shoot me. I\nknow you like Bohnenkaffee. You like coffee beans.\u201d You see my brother who was with\nme...he was known. He was specialist in roasting coffee beans. And before the war we used\nto roast our own coffee beans, and it was the best coffee beans we made. And he knew about\nit. And he didn't have too much coffee beans in the warehouse, and he needed it. And by\nGermans, coffee beans was everything. I had hidden by a peasant 100 kilo coffee beans\nbefore the war. Not roasted, green coffee beans. And if my brother will roast it, it is fresh. It's\nvery good. I had it hidden. We never took it out. Figured maybe someday we'll need it. I\nsaid, \"If you let me go, I give you coffee beans.\u201d As I told him this, he got red. He started to\nsqueak with his squeaky voice. His...his shaved head started to perspire and looked at me\nwith his eyes like a pig and he...he went to me. He slapped me in the face. He said, \"You are\nbribing me?\" I said, \"Who's bribing you? I don't bribe you. I will give you coffee. You can\nshoot me later. What's the difference. You can always shoot me.\u201d So then later he quieted\ndown. He said, \"Where will you take the coffee beans? You want to say that the Jews in\nRzeszow have coffee beans because there were still 2,000 Jews. I said, \"No, I don't even\nknow the Jews in Rzeszow. I know peasants I know storekeepers. They used to buy from me\nbefore the war. They're in the stores. I will go and buy.\u201d \"Okay. How much coffee beans will\nyou give me?\" I said, \"How much is my life worth?\" So he said, \"50 kilo.\u201d I said, \"50 kilo. In\nthe whole general government you cannot have 50 kilo coffee beans. From where?\" So I\nsaid, \"I'll give you 5 kilo\" \"10 Kilo\" Well, we bargained and bargained. Then we agreed on\n25 kilo. I said, \"25 kilo.\u201d \"When can you bring it to me? Tomorrow?\" \"What do you mean,\ntomorrow? Where can I buy 25 kilo?\" Then later I spoke to him like an equal because he\nalready made a deal with me. So I said, I have to go and buy. I will buy 10 here, I will buy\n10 here. I will put it together. I need a Passierschein signed. I need a pass to go.\u201d He called in\nShusha Kotaleska, \"Make him out a pass.\u201d And this pass I have. \"How long you want the\npass? For a week?\" I said, \"Oh, No. I need the pass at least for 6 months.\u201d So he started to\njump again. Well, anyway, he gave me a pass for a month. Then he said to go out from the\nghetto. I said, \"No. I need a pass to Rzeszow.\u201d Because I had to go to Rzeszow to other\nstores. And then later when he agreed to Rzeszow. I said, '\"Rzeszow and the whole state.\u201d\nBecause I wanted to be free. So he wrote down in the whole state. And this Passieschein I\nhave. He gave it to me and he wrote down in the book 25 kilo coffee beans. Then I asked\nhim...yes...sorry.....he said to me, \"I hope you will not escape before you give me the coffee\nbeans.\u201d So I told him, \"TI will not escape because if I would lie to escape I would have\nescaped yesterday. I knew yesterday I'll be shot.\u201d So he said, \"You knew this. Who told you\nthis?\" \"Well, if somebody wanted to save my life, I wouldn't tell you now who told me this.\u201d\n\"You knew yesterday and you didn't escape? Why didn't you escape, he asked. So I said,\n\"How can I escape when I know that if I escape you will kill 10 others. So why should you\nkill 10 Jews when you had only | Jew. He said, \"You want to say you didn't escape because\nyou wanted to save the other nine?\" So I said, \"Tell me, Herr Landkommissar, wouldn't you\ndo this for your friends?\" I said, \"You would do this for your friends too. I did it for my\nfriends.\u201d He didn't say anything. So he said, \"Okay, okay, okay.\u201d Then later I asked him\nanother thing. I said, \"Now, if we made a deal, tell me why did you tell the police to shoot\nme.\u201d So he said, \"Yesterday, you went for milk.\u201d I said, \"Yes.\u201d \"And you had an argument\nwith this woman.\u201d I said, \"Yes.\u201d \"And you threatened a woman, said 'You are a communist\nand when the Russians will come in, you will be the first one to shoot her. You told her this.'\nBecause this what she told her boyfriend, and they told him. So I asked him, Herr\nLandkommissar, Do you think that I am so stupid that I should, in a public place, even if I\nwould think of it, do you think I would be so stupid to tell it openly?\" So he said, \"No, I don't\nthink so you so stupid,\" and he laughed. And I walked home. But the main thing 1s after this,\nand I told you the story about the coffee beans. The main thing when older\npeople...yal...so...the Germans if there was a grave open, the grave could never be left open\nwithout killing somebody, so he went out to the policeman. They were waiting with the\nsecretaries. He said, \"You know Vinoski\" There was a Pole Vinoski. \"You go and bring him\nand shoot him and bury him there.\u201d And he said to me, \"You wait because you'll be the one\nto bury him. So they went and brought Vinoski. Why? And they shot him, and I covered\nhim. The shots were heard. Vinoski he shot because the day before Farding had a little dog.\nAnd Vinoski went through and the dog bit him. So Vinoski complained, said the dog bit him.\nBecause the dog bit him and he complained, he had to be killed. So they brought Vinoski.\nThey killed him, and I covered him. And I went back with the shovel to the office, and there\nwas sitting this Pappek, this commander. And when he saw me putting back\nthis...uh...shovel, he looked at me. He couldn't understand it. Here he hears a shot. I had to be\nkilled and here I am but knew he knew I wasn't shot. All the boys who worked heard the\nshots, so they were sure I was shot. So there happened a thing that I cannot forget this thing.\nSo I was waiting til they will come back from work. And when they came back from work,\nthis drill sergeant drilled them that they walked like a army with the shovels on their back,\nand when I was standing there on the steps and they saw me from a distance standing, they\nwere so thrilled, so happy that I'm alive that this Lampel gave an order to them and they say\nAchtung which means attention, and they told him...it's like a review, and they start...and he\ntold them to march with their feet like the Germans, you know, like the , and they started to\nmarch through me and everybody looked at me that I'm alive. And then later everybody\nstarted to hug me and they kissed me that I'm alive. This moment every time I tell this story,\nI break down because you cannot imagine that they knew that I was shot and I'm alive. So\nthis is the story from the coffee beans. We worked in the camp, and I went every day to\nwork. And there were episodes and episodes and episodes.",
        "Q: Talk about how you escaped.",
        "A: We don't have time. Okay. So. Escape. Okay. So I will not tell you those episodes because\nthey killed once 400 people. We were there, but this 1s not for now. We were there till the\n18th of November. And it started to be cold. And we knew that we will be liquidated. The\nreason why we knew that we will be liquidated when we took apart the houses, the houses\nwere from logs...from beams. So we cut the beams, and he always told us, \"Well, you better\nput them in a safe place because for the winter you will need them for fuel.\u201d Then later one\nday he came and he said, \"There will come Poles with papers and we should give them out\nthe wood.\u201d And when we saw that the wood has to be given away, so we knew that we will\nnot be there in the winter. So I started to prepare the escape. As I had papers to go out. So I\nstarted to speak to each one to convince him to escape. Some wanted, some didn't have\nmoney, some didn't have a place; some were afraid. Somehow I went to their acquaintances,\nand I made contacts and I tried to have...and I wanted to live the day when Farding will come\nin and to take us away, and from the hundred, not one will be left. And this what I wanted.\nLater, we will be shot. But to see him that we run away. Well anyway, I tried and I went and\nI convinced and the commandant was very much against me...the Jewish commandant,\nbecause he couldn't escape. And he didn't want to make a commotion because he knew that\nthe rest will be killed if somebody will escape. So we were there until November and I was\nclose...I already had 55 people to escape. I needed 45 more to escape. This was the 18th of\nNovember. It started to be cold. I come home from work. Who waits outside? Poppek. This\npolish commandant with the long mustache. He waits outside. He calls me out back, he says,\n\"Listen, you didn't listen to me last time. But you were lucky.\u201d Later, he find out how I told\nhim how I saved myself. \"You were lucky. This night we got orders to surround the ghetto\nwith the German police and to take you away.\u201d And I didn't know to kill on the spot, but to\ntake you way. This was enough. I said, \"I hope.... He said, \"I hope this time you will listen to\nme, and you will save yourself.\u201d So I said, \"Yes, I believe you.\u201d I went in and I started to tell\nit to our people. The one who wanted to escape believed me. The other didn't believe me.\nThere started to be a commotion and this and that. And I begged them, and you could see\neverybody prepared a knapsack ready to escape. Meanwhile, this commandant took two\npoliceman, put them by the doors, not to let out nobody. But so happens that the two\npolicemen were my friends who we were together and they were one of the escapees...who\nwanted to escape. So they said to him, \"Don't put us in because we gonna to escape.\u201d They\nwent out and I went to see. \"Go, go, go, go,\" and I said, \"I will be the last one.\u201d I was waiting\nthere til about...uh...2, 3 o'clock in the morning. Nothing happened. And I started to think,\n\"Maybe it's not true, and maybe they went away and the rest will be shot.\u201d But I waited. And\nabout 3 in the morning one of our boys came in and they said, \"Well, it's bad. We are\nsurrounded.\u201d But I didn't escape. I was there. I go out. Two Polish policemen were standing.\nThe German policemen were on the other side. And I go into one...I go next to one and I...I\nknew him. His name was Yashemik. And I go to him and I said, \"What...what you doing\nhere?\" He said, \"Well, we surround the camp.\u201d I said, \"You mean I cannot go out.\u201d He said,\nNo.\u201d I said, \"But I can go out.\u201d He said, \"How?\" \"If you turn around, I can go away.\u201d Before\nthis there was a fence. I went and I loosened a few boards from the fence because I wanted to\nbe ready. So he turns around the way I said it. And I was there with my friend. I pulled my\nfriend, and we jumped through the road into the fence. He didn't say anything. I was there in\nthis yard and later we had to go over the road. There were German with lights. But anyway, I\nescaped. From the 100, 55 escaped. From the 55, 30 were caught the next 2, 3 days by\n03:30:\nPoles, and they were killed. Twenty-five of us reached the woods. We had two other camps\nin our section. I told you when they made our camp, Sokolov. Before I escaped I had a\nmessenger...a Polish guy on a bicycle to go to both camps to notify them that we going to be\ntaken away. He reached one camp, that 18 escaped. The other camp I don't know and I didn't\nfind out even today, because I didn't find nobody alive from them. But from this camp, they\njoined me in the woods. One was the Charlie what I want this..... So we came and we\nescaped. When we came to the woods, I found there about 35 Jews. We had there three\nwomen, and those were Jews from the villages when they had to go to the ghetto, they never\ncame to the ghetto, and they were 1n the woods. They had peasants, food and everything. We\njoined them, and little by little, we got more Jews coming to us, who escaped from the camp,\nwho escaped from hiding. They find out about us. In the height of our strength, we were 125\nJews. And we started to buy guns. We had a few revolvers. We had two rifles. We had hand\ngrenades. And we paid a lot of money for it. Like, for instance, my gun I bought, I paid\n3,000 zlotys. The going rate was 300 slotas, but because I wanted it, but we were happy to\nget it. And little by little we started to melt. The Polish peasants started to kill us. When we\nwent for food, when we want...they made man hunts, and one time we lost lost 29 people.\nAnd there was a little boy even born in the woods. And we named him Tarzan, because he\nnever wore anything, and the father and the mother were there, and he wasn't their boy. He\nwas our boy. Everybody considered this boy as his. And we loved him so much because we\nsaw a continuation through this boy. And one night the peasants made a manhunt and they\nwere in a bunker. They were underground. He and his mother, his father was out with me\nand there we had a 70 year old woman, and one night they killed all the inhabitants of the\nbunker. They took them out and they all hacked them with axes, and they killed them all.\nAnd we come, I saw the mother laying there with her...with the little baby with the split head\nin her arms. And her father came with me. So little by little, we saw that we cannot survive\nthis way because we didn't have no connections with Russia, no connections with anybody\noutside, and then the AK started to become stronger and stronger and stronger because the\nminute Stalingrad changed, the whole fortune of war and the Germans started to lose, they\nbecame big big, they went into the woods and once they were in the woods, they started to\nhunt Jews. If they find out that there is a Jew, Jews are hiding, them came in and they killed\nthem. No Jew could join them. They didn't accept Jews. And if somebody would come to\nthem, they say, \"I want to join you,\" they would kill them right away. They were very, very\nanti-Jewish. And even they were Polish patriots, and I can never understand. We had the\nsame enemy. We fight the same enemy. Instead to join,\n03:34:\ninstead to be together, when it came to Jews, they would kill faster than the German.",
        "Q: Take it easy.",
        "A: Okay. So. You know, you say slow down, it reminds me a story. My mother used to knit, to\nmake sweaters, with a needle...uh...",
        "Q: Crochet.",
        "A: Crochet. She didn't have too much wool then. So she crocheted it very fast. So they asked\nher, \"Why you rushing things.\u201d She said, \"I wanted to finish before I'm out of wool.\u201d So the\nsame thing. I want to tell you the story before we're out of time.",
        "Q: We have time.",
        "A: Well, anyway. Okay. So we started to be in very bad [shape]. Instead of go[ing] together to\ndo something against the Germans, to destroy something, to blow up trains, our most energy\nwas to be on the watch for the peasants and for the AK. In the book, I'm describing episodes\npractically from so many who were killed, but now it's no time..",
        "Q: I would like to hear it. No, I would like an episode.",
        "A: So I will give you for instance one episode. I find out that one of my friends who went with\nme to school for seven years. His name was Fascick Augustin. His father was a very good\nfriend of my father. They were very wealthy peasants. They had an estate. But his father was\nthe president of all kinds of monopoly from the Polish government. Like kerosene, salt,\nmatches. This was Polish monopoly, and we had to buy it through him. So they became very\nfriendly. Even he was on the board of the same bank as my father was, and they became very\nfriendly. And with this boy I was friendly. We went to school, was sitting next to each other.\nI find out that this boy...this Fascick Augustin became commandant from the AK in our\nsection. Now, I don't have to explain now the AK. You know it, but if there it needs some\nexplanation, this was the underground which was directed from the London government in\nexile. And AK means in Polish \"Armia Krajowa\". It means the home army. So when I find\nout, here the Ak is killing us and Fascick is my friend and he's the commandant, the best\nthing would be to go to him to see if he wouldn't take me in with my group. This was the\ntime when our leader was killed, and I became the commandant from our group. So I said I\nwill come to him and maybe I can convince him to take us in. Not only that we will be able\nto fight the Germans, but we will be safe from them that they shouldn't kill us. I sent over a\ngirl who belonged to the organization. This is the woman whom I brought over last year.\nAnd we made an appointment, and he wanted to see me. He prepared there a place, a\nmeeting place. We came to the meeting place. This 1s complicated, how and what, when.\nBut, anyway, I came there with my brother. And he was very happy to see me. The meeting\nplace was made in a stable between the section of cows and the section of horses and there\nwhere the animals ate the hay, this was removable. We could go in that nobody could see.\nThey cut the locks and this was a small place about, I would say about 8 by 12. And then we\ncame in, and they were very happy to see us. He grabbed me and kissed me. He said we will\nkill Germans. We'll survive the war. And the next day he went to...so he said right away...we\nwere infested with lice. In the woods, we didn't have no changes. So he said, \"Take off those\nrags.\u201d And he brought me fresh underwear. I put on the fresh underwear. My brother put on\nthe fresh underwear. And then they brought us food. Then we made plans. And then his...he\nhad an older brother. The older brother was Yashik was his name. It was a little complicated.\nStashik and Yashik. There were two brothers. And his brothers also was in the underground,\nso he came in and he said to me, \"You know what? There is somebody who wants to sell a\nrevolver. You want to buy it?\" I said, \"Sure, Fred.\u201d\u2019 Because I was ready to buy. \"Go and buy\nit.\u201d And he went and he came back about an hour later, and he said, \"He doesn't want money.\nHe wants to have a suit or two suits.\u201d I said, \"No problem. I have two suits still left by\nsomebody in town. I will send for it, and I will give him. Bring me the revolver.\u201d He went.\nHe came back. He said, \"Oh, he's not home.\u201d And when he came in, I saw him holding the\nhand in his right pocket. And I had there a knapsack that I brought, and I had there shoes, not\nboots, shoes and short, half shoes. And I didn't need in the woods . I said to him, \"You know\nwhat? I have those shoes,\" and I dragged them, \"I don't need. It's the same size as you. Why\ndon't you take the shoes?\" So he went and he opened the knapsack with the left hand. And\nhis hand was filled in the pack...I didn't suspect him, but some intuition....I don't know. Then\nI asked him...he used to be contributor to the Polish underground newspaper and every\nTuesday the newspaper came out, and this was a Tuesday. I asked him, \"Tell me, Yasha,\ntoday the newspaper came out. What is there news.\u201d Because from the underground\nnewspaper, we could find out more than from the German newspaper. \"What is the news.\u201d\nHe said, \"I forgot.\u201d To me, it was something. He 1s a contributor and I ask him about the\nnews, but he says I forgot. He opens the knapsack with the left hand. He doesn't take...so\nintuition, and I was in this time already in a bundle of straw with my brother covered with a\nmilitary blanket because we want to rest. Something told me and I lifted up the blanket and I\ntook out my revolver. I always had my revolver with me even if I slept. I had a belt, and on\nthe belt I had a revolver, a hatchet, hand grenades, a flashlight, the whole arsenal I had\naround me. So I took out the revolver, and I lifted the blanket and I had a long barrel\nrevolver, and I lifted it he shouldn't see that I'm holding and I cocked the revolver. I held it\nstraight to him. In this moment and he was still standing in front of me holding his hand in\nthe package, in this moment, my brother didn't know what I'm doing. He wanted to go down.\nHe opened the blanket. And he saw and he left me exposed with my revolver pointed to him.\nThe minute he saw it he walked out. Then I said to my brother, \"What did you do?\" And he\ncouldn't...he said to me, \"Why didn't you trust them. Those are people want to save us.\u201d\n\"Well, it was done. It's too late.\u201d About 10 minutes after he left, we heard knocks on the\nwall. Later, we find out, those knocks were a signal for him to do something. Because this\nwas near the road, and on the road was a German patrol. So they had to let them and this\nlater we found out, to let them know that the German patrol was far away that he could start\nto shoot. But we didn't know about it. But when he saw me ready, he walked out. The next\nday we didn't know what to do, how to face them. We were embarrassed. But they didn't\nmention anything. I didn't mention anything. They went to town. He brought me\nmedicine. He brought me this. About 5 o'clock, they came in and he brought a German\nnewspaper and he wanted I should translate him about the front, where the front is. We\nlooked, we had a little kerosene lamp. My brother started to eat, and I looked in the paper\nand he said to me, \"Well, I lost something. Why don't you lend me your flashlight.\u201d I took\noff the flashlight, and I gave it to him. Soon as I gave him the flashlight 1t became dark. He\nturned off the kerosene lamp. And as it became dark, I hear a shots. One, two, three, four. I\ndidn't know what, when. And I fell down. I fell down. I was [old you see??], and my head\nstarted to spin around. In this moment...you see, I am telling you this...this takes a few\nseconds, a few minutes maybe. But this took a split of a second and I fell. And I fell down. I\nsaid, \"This is it.\u201d They took us in to be shot. But I'm glad that somebody shot me from\nbehind because I was always afraid to be caught by the Germans alive. I didn't want they\nshould torture me. So we always had a rule in our unit that if the last bullet we cannot shoot,\nthe last bullet we had to leave for ourself. But here, I fell down. I said, \"Fine, this is it. We\nwent through so much. The whole family doesn't live. Everybody I loved doesn't live. It's\nenough.\u201d And while I was laying there, I was thinking...but I'm still alive. Why should he\nshoot me? Why shouldn't I kill him? Laying on the floor, somehow I took out my revolver,\nand it was dark, and I wanted to put in my index finger to pull the trigger, it was like a piece\nof wood. I got a bullet, he shot me, I got three bullets in my neck and went through. I...then\nwhen I caught myself I got a bullet here, and the bullet traveled through the finger, ripped the\nfinger apart, but didn't touch the bone. So when I wanted to put in this finger, I couldn't\nbecause it didn't move. Now [1.e. today] in winter, I cannot move this finger. In winter, it gets\nstiff. But during the day ??.. Right away, I had enough. I put in the other finger. I put in this\nfinger. And it was dark. I shot once in the air, and I had a big caliber. So from the shot, I\ncould see from the glare of it, and I could see this brother standing in the doorway because it\nwas very small where they made the extension the door to go in. So I still saw him. It went\nso fast that I still saw him standing pointing at his revolver to me. It went so fast. So when I\nshot once, I saw him. Right away, I shot him the third to him and right the third time. By the\nthird time because I didn't know that I will hit him with the first bullet. When I shot him the\nfirst time I saw him already laying stretched out. With my second bullet, one I shot in the air,\nwith the second bullet, I pierced his heart and I killed him. And by the third bullet, I saw him\nstretched out. When his brother saw what happened because he saw by the glare the same\nthing as I and his brother start to shot to my brother. When he saw what happened he ran out.\nAnd this was an emergency door. When he run out I shot after him, and I hit him in the\nspine, and he fell down. Now we are naked. My brother didn't know what's going on. So he\nstarted to yell to them, \"What you playing with firecrackers? Because he couldn't understand,\nit went so fast. So I said to him, \"No.\u201d And we had our things on the attic, and there was no\nladder to the attic. But we had to climb through the beams. Took the revolver in my teeth, I\nstarted to climb and I wanted to take boots. I wanted to take the medicine, and also the most\nimportant thing I wanted to take, I had a diary what my sister started the first day of the war.\nAnd every day she wrote in the diary. But because we came to him, I figured I will be able to\nsit and I will enter for a few days. So I wanted to get the diary. But in the dark, scared, you\n[are] hit, I don't know where I'm hit. So when I took one boot out of the 2? I took this and\nthat. I left everything. I jumped out. I called my brother. He wasn't there anymore. What\nhappened? He find a door. He ran out the door. And his friends, there\n03:46:\nwere about 6 friends waiting outside. They grabbed him. When I came in, I remember I\nstepped on this dead body. It was so soft. So I came in...in the openings. I saw a few guys.\nAnd I knew the guys. They were my school friends. They're holding my brother. And a few,\nstanding...laying over this other brother was wounded. So I was standing in the doorway. I\nstill had three bullets in my revolver, and I said to them, \"If you don't let him go this minute,\nthree of you will be killed.\u201d I said, \"I never miss. I have three bullets left in the revolver.\nThree will be killed.\u2019 And the minute I said it they let him go and they run away. I remember\nI even still had enough brain, I went back and I took out from the hand of this dead guy his\nrevolver. And I said to my brother let's run we ran, it was the 18th of January. Two yards\nhigh snow. All we had is our underwear. No shoes. Nothing! And we run and we didn't\nknow where. We had to run up the hill. We had to cross a river. And in a village, and this\nwas about 6 o'clock in the afternoon. In the village when one dog starts to bark, all dogs\nbark, so you could hear not one, the whole village barking. And you could [see] lights and\nnaturally, we are running. We don't know where we are. We're going up the hill. The snow\nwas so frozen. From the moon you could see millions of diamonds in the snow. Everything\nwas so sparkling. We run. We didn't stop. And we run, I would say about a kilometer to the\nfirst house. We stopped at a house. I look at my brother. My brother looks at me. And here it\nwas, blood running from my neck, and the blood was, we didn't know what happened\nbecause the blood from the cold, it got thick and it became clustered, but it still was running.\nThe hand was swollen. We could see a trail in the snow from our walking from drops of\nbloods. I said, \"Well, if somebody will come, they will come and they will catch us.\u201d Well,\nand if it's a snowy terrain in the winter, you don't know where you are, because everything\nlooks the same. I said, \"Where are we?\" We don't know. This was 6 o'clock. But one thing, I\nknew that every 6 o'clock a autobus a bus came from Rzeszow to Kolbuszova at 6 o'clock. I\nsaid, \"If we would be lucky, and if we would see the bus coming I will know the direction\nwhere to go.\u201d And as I said it, we saw from a distance two reflectors from the bus. It's not\nlike here you have thousands of cars. There was only one bus that came only once a day.\nAnd so, more or less I figured out that I will go this way and there was a house that I knew\nthis house, and this peasant was friendly. I said, \"If we would be lucky, and if I would hit this\nhouse, we would be saved.\u201d Now imagine if peasants will see us in the middle of the winter,\ntwo people naked without shoes. Well, anyway, we started to go down, so I had my two\nrevolvers. I had everything on me. I said to my brother, \"If something will happen, you\nshould know I will open the hand grenade and we're killing each other.\u201d He had his revolver.\nAnd we went down and it so happens that I hit the house I wanted to hit. Exactly 1t was, this\nwas a Sure thing. We run up here, and this house was here. So I had to go like this. I hit it\nexactly and I knew the house. And from there I knew exactly how to go back to the woods. It\ntook me a whole night. I reached our friends about 5 in the morning. Now on the way, we\nstopped...but this is not for now...I was wounded. I didn't know what. I went to a doctor. The\ndoctor, you see, the doctor I went to [was from] a different section because I didn't...and I\nhad to go right away he shouldn't find out that something happened to those two guys. I went\nto him and he checked me. He said, \"Here the bullets went through. It was a small caliber.\nBy here the bullets went through. He gave me an injection against blood poison. I came back\nto our group. The Germans heard the shots. And this was the patrol. When the patrol came,\nthey shot. So they told them a story that bandits came. They wanted money, and they didn't\ngive them the money, so they shot them. And they took it for an answer. The next day they\nmade a report to the police. When the police came to investigate. And the police didn't take\nthis answer. They started to search. And they find this little room, and they find the wall\ncovered with blood when I tried to climb. And they went upstairs and they found then my\nboots, they find there the...the case with the medicines, with\n03:51:\nthe instruments. And they find my sister's diary. And they knew it is not bandits. And they\ntook out the second boy, and they shot him right there. So the second boy was also shot. The\nGermans finished him off. This was an episode. Now this happened. Then later it was very\nwell known. Then later they caught me. They gave me poison. This is a long story. But this\nepisode, I couldn't show my face. Everybody knew about it, they gave a price on my head in\nthe underground paper. So once I went to a peasant to a different village. And he knew that\nI'm Jewish because the other Jew took me over to buy something. So he said in the papers it\nwas that they will pay 100,000 zlotys for my head. So he said to me, \"Listen, there is that\nboy here.\u201d He said the name Salsitz. \"I would like to help him because I knew his father.\nMaybe you know where he is. Tell him to come to me. I will give him bread. I will give him\nbutter. I would like to help him. I want to save this boy.\u201d And I knew the reason why he tells\nme. So I said, \"Listen, if I would know where he is, I could get the 100,000 zlotys. Why\nshould I tell you? I want to know myself.\u201d He asked me about me because he wanted to\nmake and to get this money. So this went on for a few weeks til I joined the Ak. Well I saw I\ncouldn't, so I joined the AK in a different section, and I had papers and they accepted me\nwhen everything was healed.",
        "Q: Slow down. What kind of papers? How did you get papers?",
        "A: Okay. Alright. Before I left this camp. The first day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New\nYear, no, the second day of Rosh Hashanah. The Jews in 1942, they killed in our town\nand(?) Novasans they got together people from Rzeszow who wanted to run away to\nHungary. There was a place,Bokhnia, that they made false papers for Jews and Poles, and\nthey went to Hungary, and Hungary was easier to survive. And they caught those people,\nthey didn't catch those people. They caught this girl who was their runner, and but once I'm\ntelling you this, I want to tell you about this girl. I think she should be remembered.",
        "Q: We may not have much time, so if you can condense it a little.",
        "A: See, this girl was the runner, and she was caught on the list of 45 people with false papers,\nthat they should run away to Romania, and she was caught. And she was tortured. She was\nkilled. The Germans knew those people because they had the documents. And they arrested\nthose people, and they brought them to us in jail when we were in the camp. During the night\nI find out about it, and I went to the jail, and through a window, they told me those things\nwhat happened to them, that this girl was caught. But there 1s a other list of 200 that she had\nto prepare documents. They didn't know if they got the list. But if they got the list, they will\npick up the 200 too. What was necessary is to go to Rzeszow which was 31 kilometers and\ngo to Rzeszow and to warn the people that they are arrested and they should do something\nand to hide. So soon as they told me, I told...I took the wagon with the horse what Farding\ngave me to bring the old junk to Rzeszow and I always had it ready packed because I never\nknew when I will have to go in a hurry. This was at night, and I took the horse and I went to\nRzeszow, 31 kilometers, because even if the Germans would catch me, I had a pass to go and\nI went officially because I had to bring those things. So I went to Rzeszow and I came into\nthe ghetto with these things, and I had to notify someone I know to notify that they were\narrested. And they are worrying about the 200 other people. And they told me who to\ncontact. I contact this person, and he notified the 200 people they should go into hiding who\nwere on the list. But what the Germans did, they came and they couldn't find nobody from\nthe 200, so they took 200 other Jews, and they brought them to us with them and in this day,\nthe second day of Rosh Hashanah, they killed in Novasans(??). this village not far from us,\nthey killed 400 Jews. They brought Jews from Hutta Kaminski (??), from ?? . Young girls,\nbeautiful girls, Jews who had scabs, cuts, and they reported they cannot go to work, so they\ntook them and they killed them. Now there are so many details, but it is not for now. But you\nask me about the other details.",
        "Q: The papers",
        "A: So when they killed the 400 people, I became very hysterical and I went into a Polish\nwoman, was very friendly with my father. This was the woman I gave all the merchandise\nwhen I was left, when they took away our people to Rzeszow, so I gave her the merchandise\nover the fence. So I went to her and started to cry very hysterical. I said, \"I want to live. I\nwant to live. Do something. Do something.\u201d She said, \"What can I do.\u201d She said, \"What can\nI do?\" I said, \"I need papers. I want to run away.\u201d She said, \"I can help you out with it. lama\nvery good friend of the Monseigneur, from the Catholic Church...in Polish Dekan (dean). I\nwill ask him if he can give you papers.\u201d So I told her, \"You know, I had a friend who went\nwith me to school. His name was ?.. He looked a little like me. And he went me to school.\nAnd he was killed in 1939. He was in the Polish army. He was killed. Maybe he can give me\nhis paper, and then if there would be a picture we look very much alike.\u201d She went to the\nMonseigneur, and the Monseigneur gave me a birth certificate which I have with me, which\nthey made a copy of it. And he gave me this birth certificate. With this birth certificate, I\ncould show that that I was ?.. So through this girl, she was a runner between two groups. So\nshe went to the group which was farther away from my town and she made a contact and\nwith her I went and I was accepted and she introduced me to their commandant, she was\nvery friendly with and he liked me. He took me in, and so then I became a member of this\ngroup. And this was a very important group because this group was not like from people\nwho belonged to the underground, and they were staying in their homes. This was a group\nwho was a combat group in the woods. And I was very happy to be with them because with\nthem, we destroyed police stations, we blew up trains. We did so many things because they\nwere a force. You see when I was in the woods as a Jew, I only could go out when there was\na blizzard, when there was a rain. I was a fugitive. Everybody would give me out. I have to\nhide the gun. But when I was with them, I was a hero. I came out to the village with the rifle\nopen. I put in a beret with a Polish eagle. I put on a band with a white and red as a Polish\npatriot. The girls even waited for us, to kiss us. The people used to bring us vodka and food.\nI was the same man, fighting the same enemy. But here because I was a Jew, I was fugitive.\nAnd here because I was Pole, I was a hero. So with them, it gave me the opportunity to take,\nand every night there was some action because they were so strong and they could do it. And\nwith them I had the opportunity to do it.\n03:59",
        "Q: Okay. We're going to have to change tapes and make a decision.",
        "A: Okay. But this way if you can make a decision that is a few from the woods, I would like to\ntell you a few episodes how we made...uh...a",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: Okay. The tape is started. You wanted to take us back.",
        "A: Right. I want to go back when we were quite strong yet in the woods with our Jewish group.\nNow, our leader was a Jew who was forester, which is very unusual for a Jew to be this\nprofession. Was a very intelligent man, but mostly he was a forester because he specialized\nin artificial raising [of] fish. He had artificial lakes...not artificial...had man made lakes, and\nthey raised carps, and this belonged to a very rich Jew in Rzeszow and his name was Bank,\nand the forester's name was Pinya. Well, anyway, and Froelich, Pinya Froelich, and he was\nthe organizer of this group who was there before I came and he still was our leader. Then\nlater he was killed, and also it was a very unfortunate thing how he was killed. Uh...He could\nbe saved, but...uh... because the men who surrounded the house were peasants from his\nvillage, and he didn't to use his gun, he didn't want to shoot, because they were his friends.\nThey were people who he knew all his life, so he didn't want to harm them. But nevertheless,\nthey took him with his wife, and they took him to a barn and they killed him. After this I\nbecame, I took over his place, and I became the leader. Now, we wanted to do something\nagainst the Germans. It was very hard for us because our main thing was to protect ourselves\nfrom the Poles who were so hostile towards us. There was, as I told you before, the Poles\nused to get skim milk for free, but there was a factory not far from the woods when in, a milk\nfactory, and all the peasants used to bring their milk and there they produced cheese, butter,\nand this was sent to Germany. And from the whole section, all the Poles used to bring their\nmilk there. So we thought that we want to disrupt these things. I had there a man that I knew,\nand he was working there. And he gave me all the information when the work starts, stops,\nwho is the guard, and how. So one dark night six of us went over there and we disarmed the\nguard, and we went in and we destroyed the whole place. It took us about an hour. We broke\nall the equipment, and there was special equipment brought from Germany, and all the\nmachines where they used to produce the cheese and the butter, and everything was\ndestroyed. After everything was destroyed we packed our knapsacks full of cheese, that we\nhad it enough for about 2, 3 months and we left. The next day the Germans came and they\nsurrounded the village, and they arrested some Poles. They accused them that they did some\nsabotage, but then later they let them out because they had proof that some partisans, they\ndidn't know that we did it, but some partisans came and they did the damage. And it was\nquite a big damage. It was a big help for the peasants, because for months they didn't have to\ngive the milk. They didn't know what to do with the milk because there was not a facility to\nmanufacture the cheese and the butter. But then later, they rebuilt 1t and it by them 3 months\nand they started again. But this was a very big satisfaction what we did. Also, once a week\nthey collected the cows from the peasants. Each calf when it was born, they put in a ear ring\non the calf, and this was registered. And eventually they had to give over the cow to the\nGermans and they also had an evidence how much milk the peasant has to bring in from the\ncow. They delivered the cows, once a week they were driven or they were taken to the\nrailroad station so we always waited when they were taken to the railroad station they\nchased...not by cars, but on foot. So we waited on the edge of the forest and we lured always\none or two or three cows into the woods, and we took them away. So this was a very big help\nfor us because 1n the winter, usually, we sold some cows and then we we killed one so we\nhad meat enough for weeks. So this was also a way of trying to do some damage. And, there\nwas an other case that we were in a place that there was a search for Poles, but not for Jews\nanymore, but the search for Poles for taking the Poles to Germany. And we were in the attic\nand we were hidden in the hay, and they searched even the attic, but they didn't find us, and\nthey left the house and they took the owner from this place that we were hiding. He didn't\nknow we were there. And then he escaped, so in the evening a Polish policeman came to\ntake him back. And we saw it, so we waited for him outside, and we killed him. We took\naway his gun, his rifle, his bicycle. So those were things that we tried to do as much as\npossible. But when I joined the AK, then it was a different story because the Ak was openly\nmore loyal, in the village they were open and they could do a lot of things. They were very\nstrong. They received drops from planes, ammunition, money, medicine, and guns,\neverything, from England. They used to drop in special assigned places in the woods, and\nthey had all those things. So we did other things like there was a police station in Glogel for\ninstance. So we surrounded the police station one night and we disarmed the policemen.\nThey were not killed, but we took away everything they had there, rifles and guns, revolvers.\nWe took it away, and we completely demolished the police station. Then there was a very\nimportant railroad line which went from Rzeszow to Senjisuv (??). This was not far from the\nforest what I described you before. So a few times those railroad tracks\nwere blown up, and the supplies... It was not so much the supplies, but in this time the\nGermans started to pull out a large quantity of soldiers in the army from the eastern part in\nPoland. And the railroads were blown up with the soldiers, and this we did about 5, 6 times,\nthose railroad lines, which was easy to do because the railroad lines were not actually\nguarded so much and we were not afraid for peasants. There was once an ammunition dump\nand not far from Rzeszow...before Rzeszow...were big forest, dense forests. So once we went\nover there and this was everything with the Polish AK and we blew up one ammunition\ndepot there. The Germans later retaliated, but this group we knew we did it, so the same\nnight we disappeared in the other section and actually, they didn't catch nobody. But they\nretaliated towards the local population. They didn't know exactly who did it. Now one\nepisode I want to tell you this is what we did on our own. But I have to go back to that camp\nwhere we were after the destruction, after taking away our people from our town when we\nwere in this labor camp in Kolbuszowa when we destroyed the houses of the ghetto. So we\nwere working there, a Sharfuehrer came from the SS with a Polish boy, which he was his\nadjudant, his helper. And this Sharfuehrer was very vicious and we knew about him that he\nkilled and he beat and always he was always drunk. He always was red in his face and nose\nwas like...from a drunkard. And he came to us while we were working, and it so happened\nthat I loaded in this time some furniture. And I had a mirror in my hand, a big large mirror.\nHe said to me, \"Look in this mirror.\u201d So I looked in his mirror. He said, \"Look what good\ncannon fodder you are, because this what you will be.\u201d\u2019 And I didn't answer, because you\ncouldn't answer this man. And he came to see what we are doing, and there was one of my\nfriends. His name was Motek Weiss. He was from Krakow, a very nice boy, fragile boy. And\nhe said to his adjudant, his name was Volstick, a Polish boy from the neighboring village and\nhe said to him to take a 2 by 4 and to start to beat this boy. And he started to beat him. He\nfell down. We put him on his feet. He beat him again. And he beat him so that he just was a\npiece of black flesh lying on the floor. And later we brought him back to our barracks, and\nthe same day he died. And just he did it for fun. Uh...Later, he pointed out I should go with\nhim. So I thought he was going to give me the same treatment as with this boy, but I couldn't\nsay anything so I went with them and he said to me that he wants to get some brass. He\nneeds brass. And we had brass from the old houses, from old candlesticks, and in one room\nin this warehouse we kept only brass. I took him to show him the brass. While we went there\nto see the brass, we went through a room where there was paper collected. Now they were\nmostly old books. You know, by Jews, we don't throw away books. Books were always\nsaved. We put them on the attic of the synagogue and if it was full, so we took the books into\nthe cemetery and we wrapped them in prayer shawls, and they were buried like human\nbeings. So in this time when we cleaned out the attic from the synagogue, there was full of\nold books. Books that were hundred, two hundred years old. They were yelllow. We piled\nthem (up). We put them in this room. It was stacks till the attic. And he came in and he start,\nhe always had such a hoarse voice like a drunkard, and he asked me what's here. I told him\npaper, books. \"What kind of books?\" I told him, \"Religious books. Jewish books.\u201d And the\nbooks were stacked on both sides of the room that in the middle was just a passageway. And\nfrom the top there was a little window. And the window, through the window, rays of the sun\ncame in. And because there were books, old books there was a lot of dust, and the rays...the\nray illuminated the dust that you could see through this window came like a column of light\non the one spot. And in this moment, it reminded me that this column is the same column as\nGod showed to the Israelites when they left Egypt so they should know their way in the\ndesert. So in the evening, in the night, he had a column of light; in the day a column of dust.\nAnd this was to show them the way how to go. So in this moment, I remembered from the\nBible, and I said, \"This is the same column as God had it when the Israelites left Egypt.\u201d And\nthis Scharfuehrer s, did everything what God forbid probably the way he killed and he saw\nthe spot from the ray on the floor, and he stood in the spot and he looked up and he started to\nyell with his hoarse voice. And he said, \"Yehovah, Yehovah. Wo bist Du.\u201d Means,\n\"Yehovah, Yehovah, Where are you? Yehovah, Warum hilfst Du nicht Deine Kinder?.\n\"Y ehovah, why don't you help your children?\" And he looked at me, and he said to me,\n\"You see, Your Yehovah is old. Your Yehovah is dead. He cannot even hear what I am\nsaying. Now, here you are. What we are doing to the Jews, and he doesn't do anything.\u201d And\nhe spat on the floor, and he walked out. In this moment, I was sure that God would punish\nhim. That God will make him lame or something will kill him. After all, he said something\nbad about my God. Maybe I had doubts of my God in this time that he didn't help us, but I\nthink I had a right to have doubts because I was a Jew and I believed in God. But he was a\nstranger, and he had no right to insult my God, and I was very angry. And I said to myself, \"I\nhave to survive the war. Even if I have to kill this guy, because he insulted my God.\u201d This\nwas in this time when I was in the camp. Naturally, there was a thing that I knew that it could\nnever happen. How could I do it? But..still I had in my mind. Two years later...was it two\nyears later?...almost two years later, a year and a half later I was in the woods, I found out\nthat this man., this Sharfuehrer, is in charge of Polish farms in the section where it was\nPrzeworsk (\u00b0?). Przeworsk, the section I described before, belonged to the SS and he was in\ncharge of the farms. Because they didn't want to have Poles in this section, so they chased\nout all the Poles because this was where they perfected the V-1, V-2 rockets. But they\nwanted to have something from the farms, so the farmers used to go over there to work, and\nat night they went away. And he was in charge of it. And I found out about it, and I was told\nalso that every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, they have like drinkings with girls, playing\ncards, dancing in the substation from this Przeworsk camp. Now we had in our group two\nJews who came from this vicinity. One was a manager in an estate, which knew very well\nthe village and there was another one from this vicinity. And also the father of the girl who\nhelped me join the A, her name was Stashka Hodora. She married later and her\nmarried...marriage name is Bargike . She lives now in Warsaw, and 2 years ago I brought her\nover for a visit. So this Stashka's father used to go and he used to work in the house where\nthey had those gatherings every Saturday and every Sunday. And he was like a worker there.\nHe took care of the horses. He took care of... So through him I find out that he takes care on\nall those things on this farm. And he told me and I had in my mind that something has to be\ndone. And I approached our group a few times and I said, this was an obsession with me that\nI had to do something towards him, but always my friends told me, \"We cannot do it. We're\nnot strong enough and to go and make a raid on SS group and we will be killed.\u201d And I gave\nup the idea. When I left the AK and I came back, I still find out that through this Hodora,\nthat he works there and this man is still there in charge. Then I find out that not far from us\nthere was a group of Russian partisans. You see, the front came closer to us, so also the\npartisans came closer to us. I find out where they are, and I went over to them, and I\nintroduced myself that I am a leader from a partisan group. I didn't tell them that we were\nJews because we never knew how they will accept us, and there were a lot between the\nRussians...there were a lot of Ukrainians also. And so I didn't say that we were Jews, but we\nwere group and I have an idea that I want they should help us. And I told them that I want to\nmake a raid on\n04:18:\nthis substation, and I explained to him why and that this man is there in charge. He was very\nbad. He killed a lot of people, and we can have a good job killing SS men. And the head, the\ncommandant of this group liked the idea, and it took us about two weeks. He gave me two\nfrom his group, and I went over with...with them at night to see the roads, to see the\ntopography, and to have the preparations how to do it. And when we came back, we picked\nout a dark night and we had all the information from this Jan Hodora. Him I told what we're\ngoing to do. I wasn't afraid that he would betray us because this was against the Germans,\nand he hated the Germans. And this night, it was a Saturday night, we didn't have horses.\nThey had horses. So I took from my group, I took five people. And they gave us 15 people\nand 5 of them took us as passengers on their horses, and everything was planned and we\ncame over. Now five of us wore German uniforms. I wore a German uniform, and four from\nthe Russian partisans, and they gave me a submachine guns for us, and we came to the place.\nAnd we cut the telephone wires, and we sneaked through the front, they were illuminated,\nthe windows where they were sitting, playing, dancing. They had girls. And we started to\nthrow in grenades through the front windows. And meanwhile, the other people came from\nboth sides and from the rear. Now in the beginning it was a resistance. They started to shoot\nback from revolvers because they didn't expect something like this. And later their firing got\nless and less and after it stopped, we burned the house where they were, and then later we\ntook away the horses. They had horses. There was a car in the front, and there were a few\nmotorcycles. We burned the car. We burned the motorcycles. We took the horses, and we\nleft. Not one of them, we estimated that were about 35 SS men in this time. When we\nlooked in the windows, more or less we estimated so many, not one escaped. Because it was\nsuch a surprise attack. And from us, we came back. All of us came back and nothing\nhappened to us. Now when we came back and it was a wonderful feeling when I was there,\nand they gave me a submachine gun and I could shoot and shoot and shoot and I didn't feel\nanymore in this time like a fugitive. I felt very, very good about myself, but we knew that\nsomething will happen that they would be seeking reprisals. Right away the Russian group\nleft. They went to an other place. They went more north. We disappeared. We were in this\ntime...our group...with the five...we disappeared. The next day the Germans came and they\nknew that this Russian group, Russian partisan group did it, and they surrounded the forest,\nand they searched and searched, but they didn't find nobody. They didn't suspect the native\nPoles of helping us, so this was a very good feeling to do something now in this time and\nwhen I came back, so I said to myself I didn't do it so much for myself as I did it for insulting\nmy God and this was a very, very good feeling. Then later the rumors, not the rumors, the\ntalk between the people, they told the story that this guy was killed in this raid, which we\nsaw him through the window anyway. But he was well known also. Also this Scharfuehrer,\nwho was so vicious, he also spoke Polish. For this reason, if\nthey were like mixtures, they were even more vicious. And the reason they used him because\nhe spoke Polish. He could hire the peasants. He could work with them. They should work in\nthe fields, and he was in charge of this. So those were the things that we did that it was very\ngratifying. We wanted to do more, but we were hampered by the Polish population. And I\nhave to tell you what happened the last night. This was the last night before the liberation.\nNow people ask you survived; it's a miracle or you are lucky or something. A thousand times\nyou could be lucky. Somehow you outwitted the Germans. Sometimes you made the right\ndecision. Instead to go left, you went right. You had to be quick. But if one time it didn't\nwork, you didn't have a second chance. The one time didn't work and that's it. Now we don't\nknow from all the people who were hiding and hiding and how many times they did things to\nthe Germans. We don't know because they are not here to tell the story. Now, if I will not be\nhere now from the whole group that we were, hundred twenty five people, from the whole\ngroup when we were liberated, only six were alive, from the hundred twenty five. And the\nrest were killed, very few by the Germans, mostly were killed by the Poles. Because the\nGermans didn't venture into the woods. And mostly by the end six were alive. Now from the\nsix, two from my people before the war, they were Rabbinical students and they were very\nnice boys and they were very capable, went back to our town, to Kolbuszowa, because they\nsaid we are now free. We are liberated. We'll come back. We'll be considered heroes. We\nsurvived the war. So they went back 3 days after the liberation. Two were very prominent\npeople from my town Poles, one was a Director of Internal Revenue. His name was Kissel.\nThe other one had a bus company...had buses going. His name was Shilenski. Took them to\nthe cemetery and they killed them. Three days after the liberation! So imagine going through\nso much, going through camps and ghettos, losing the whole family, starvation, and torture,\nbeing 2 years in the woods, and somehow they made it. They survived the war. And the\nGermans were gone. Here we are. There is already liberty. Now the Poles supposed to be\nour......we lived with them for thousand years. Now they took the two boys and they killed\nthem. Why I will never know. Why? What did they harm somebody? And they were killed.\nSo from all our group, there were four left. My brother and I and two brothers who were also\nfrom the village, and they survived. Six months later, one of them was poisoned so he died.\nMy brother died here about 15 years ago. The second brother went to Israel and he died\nthere. So I'm the only one who survived from the whole group. Now I have to speak in the\nname of all of them because nobody can tell any stories. They are dead. So my responsibility\nis to tell their stories. Now I'm preparing episodes of everybody, the circumstances how he\nwas killed. And I remember more or less about everyone who was killed, how he was killed\nand when and by whom. So I'm preparing stories for each one how he was killed from the\nhundred twenty six people. Looking back on all those things, we cannot understand how a\npeople like Polish people could do a thing like this. I want to tell you then the last night and I\nwent through so many things. I didn't tell you how I was poisoned because there 1s not too\nmuch time about it.",
        "Q: No. No. No. Let's hear how you were poisoned.",
        "A: So I want to tell you...I want to tell you about this last night. If we will have time, we'll come\nback. The last night I was back with my with my group. There were only six left of us. So I\nwent to the same peasant Hodora what he gave me the information, and his daughter was...\nSo I went to see how the situation is. Because the front was already by us. The Germans\nwent back and back, and we knew that we could hear the detonations and the shootings and\ncame closer and closer. When we came to Hodora that night nobody was home. The house\nwas empty. It was open. It was empty. The cows were not there. So we understood. Because\nthey are afraid, the front comes close...near, so they went into the woods because to be safer.\nNobody was there, so we decided to stay over the next day and the next night we'll see what\nto do. Now there was in\nthe barn was full with hay because this was after the harvest, so we buried ourselves in the\nhay. During the night we could hear that a unit of calvary is going through the road, and the\nroad was very close to the house because you could hear horses, the chains ringing. And then\na few came in the yard and they came into the barn where we were hiding. And they started\nto take out hay for the horses. Now we didn't know how much hay they would take out\nbecause if there could be a lot of horses, they could empty the barn, and then later we'll be\nexposed, but as they took out the hay, we buried ourselves more and more and more. Then\nlater we heard them speaking that this night they will go. Then later we came out and they\nwere already gone, so I said to my friend, Leiba, I said, \"We cannot stay here because this is\nthe territory that the German front is establishing. We have to go over to the east and to cross\nover probably the Russians\nare on the side.\u201d So we went to a place where there was a clearing. This side the Germans\nwere, and the other side the Russians. And we were...this was a clearing. So I said, \"We have\nto move through the clearing.\u201d So he found a little brook and with this brook we started to\ncrawl to go over to the other side. But somebody spotted us and they started to shot on us\nfrom both sides. You see when one side started to shoot, so the other side started to shoot. So\nwe knew here are the Germans, and here are the Russians and we're on the middle. We\njumped out from this little brook and they were haystacks and we buried ourselves in the\nhaystacks. Then from a distance we saw a horse with two riders on it galloping, going about\n200 yards away from us, coming from one side of the forest to the other. Now this man, he\nwas from a village, and he said to me, \"I cannot go out and ask him what's going on because\nthey know me. But they don't know you. Go and ask them. And I know those peasants.\u2019 He\neven told me the name. His name 1s Poslusne. He said, \"I know them because they are from\nmy village. I even recognize the horse because I sold them the horse before I left the\nvillage.\u201d And he recognized. Well, I thought he knows. I came out from the haystack and I\nrun after them, and I started to yell, Panie Poslusne. And this was at night and they, finally,\nthey heard me. And they slowed down. When they slowed I came closer to them. Now I saw\nit wasn't Poslusne. It was two SS man, on one horse. And this was from this unit of the\nhorses what they sent them over as a patrol to go to the other side to find out what's going on.\nHere I'm standing there close to them. The liberation is almost here. Freedom is almost here.\nAnd I am standing. And they jumped out from the horse, both of them, took out their\nrevolvers, pointing at me, and I looked like a peasant. I was barefoot. And I had a jacket, a\nlong jacket covered, and underneath the jacket I had my arsenal. I had two revolvers, with a\nbayonet, with a hatchet, with a flashlight, bullets, everything I had underneath, but it was\ncovered. And when they jumped down, I didn't know what to say...what to start. I couldn't\nshow them I speak German, because Polish people didn't speak German. So I started to yell\nand to cry in Polish and I told them what will I do. My wife and my children went to the\nwoods with the cows. Now they say the Russians are coming and there are rumors the\nRussians are raping the women and killing the children, taking away the cows. What will I\ndo? What will I do? Please help me. Help me. And I said to them, \"We are four or five years\nwith the Germans. Nothing happened to us.\n04:31:\nNow the Russians are coming, and there are so many rumors. And then I figured I'm yelling\nto them. I'm crying, but they don't understand. They are Germans. Then one of them started\nto translate in German to the other one what I am saying. You see, you say luck, you say\nmiracles. Everything had to be, otherwise... So he started to translate. When I see that he's\ntranslating, so I started to yell a little louder and cry a little more and tell him a little story\nbecause he understood. And then he stopped me and he spoke to me in a very, very broken\nPolish. Probably he was from Silesia, from Posen, something. So he in very broken Polish,\nhe ask me if I am from this village. I said, Yes.\u201d So he said to the other one in German,\nwhich I understood, he said, \"Good, we don't have to go to the other side,\" because they were\nafraid to go deeper because they will be killed because they knew the Russians are there. So\nhe said, \"We will take him to our commandant, and let him question him. Maybe he can give\nus the information we want to know. So he told me in Polish not to worry. They will take me\nfor questioning and then later they will go with me to find my wife and the children. Well, he\nsaid it. So then they said to me to go in front of them. And I went in front of them. And they\nboth put back their revolvers. And they had rifles on their back and they climbed on their\nhorse. They went back on the horse and I started to walk slowly in front of them and they\nbehind me. Now I started to realize, ...here the whole war I went through. Here the liberation\ncoming. Now I have to be shot, because if they will take me over there. Now listen, if they\nwill open my vest, they will see. How can I survive? So what...what should I do? I have to\ndo something. I always\n04:33\nhad a long barrel revolver in my belt. I never had it in my holster. I had it always ready. So\nby going in the front so a little, I put in my hand and I cocked the revolver. I pulled it out\nslowly, and suddenly I turned around. In a split second I emptied it and I shot seven bullets\nin them and they fell down dead from the horse. Because I knew I had to. And they fell\ndown. The minute I started to shoot on them so bullets, millions of bullets from both sides\ncame in my direction because the Germans were here. The Russians were here. They didn't\nknow what's going on. So they started to shoot. So I took the horse as a shield and I started to\nwalk slowly toward the Russian side, and I call...yal...I bent down, and first thing I took out\nthe revolvers again. This was very important. I put them in my belt to take away, and I went\nto the side from the Russians. I was about hundred feet away from the forest. A few jumped\nout and they surrounded me and they said in Russian I should lift my hands. So they spoke to\nme in Russian. I was very relieved and I came in and they asked me what happened. So I\ntold them what happened, that the two Germans and I shot them and the revolvers. First\nthing they relieved me...they took away everything I had, and they said, \"Let's wait til our\ncommandant comes.\u201d About a half a hour later, the commandant came, a young fellow on a\nhorse and he asked me, so I told him. He asked me, \"Who are you.\u201d I said to him, \"I have a\ngroup of partisans in the other side. Again I didn't say Polish or Jewish because you never\nknew because even then they killed a lot of Jews. And those I didn't know they're Ukrainian\nor Russians, so they and I spoke a little Russian because I was in Russia a few months. He\nwas very surprised that I speak Russian. So when I told him the whole story except , first they\ntook the horses. Oh, I like the horse. This will be my horse. They took away. So I said, \"I'm\ngoing back for my group. I have there a group about 60 people.\u201d He said, \"Don't go back to\nthe group, because if you will come back they will probably shoot you, all of you on the way\ncoming out from the German line.\u201d He said, \"You are already here. Stay with us. We\nare...we accepting you. We will take you in. Come with me.\u201d So I even told them, \"When I\ngo back to show the people that that I met Russian partisans, why don't you give me your\nsubmachine guns.\u201d It's called in Russian papetsha. \"Why don't you give me your papetsha,\nand I will go up and I will show them that I have met the Russians.\u201d He said, \"Oh, no. When\nyou come back to me, you get it from me. But to make sure, to show them that you met the\nRussians, he took off his hat and he took off the star with the sickle and and hammer and\nsaid, \"Show them this and this will be proof enough.\u201d And he said, \"Go and bring them. We\nwill wait til morning for you.\u201d He asked me, \"How long will it take to bring them over.\u201d I\nsaid, \"Maybe 2 hours.\u201d He said, \"That will be enough time. Bring them over.\u201d Now when he\ntold me this and when I walked away I was sure he doesn't believe me the story. Because he\nwas too lenient and he let me go. Now why should I go back? Why should I be so stupid go\nback to the German line and bring over people? He probably thought that I am sent out from\nthe German side to find out if there are people, how many, and I was sure that the minute I\nwould turn around, when I went away, he took away my two revolvers from the two\nGermans but he gave me back mine. And I was sure that I would turn around that in the back\nI will be shot. So when I started I walk like I was walking like on air. I couldn't move my\nlegs, but I start and farther I went I was more sure for myself and when I was already about\n200 feet so I figured well now maybe, I'm safe. They will not shoot me. And then I started to\nrun. I run back to the haystack where my friend was lying there. Naturally, he grabbed me.\nHe kissed me. He was sorry. He thought that I am dead, that I'm shot. He didn't know that I\nkilled the Germans. So I said, \"Let's go. This is not for us.\u201d So we went the same way and we\nwent where the two Germans were laying dead. So going through...so then we helped\nourselves to their two rifles because...we took off the two rifles, and we went over the other\nside. We went there to a peasant hut, and we were waiting there a whole night. In the\nmorning somebody opened the barn door and I see a Russian soldier comes in with some pot\nand he came in. He wanted to milk a cow to get some milk. I jumped down and I asked him,\n\"What's going on?\" He said, \"Well, we liberated this village this night.\u201d I grabbed him and I\nhugged him and I danced around and this was my liberation. So the reason why I told you\nthis story, this was the last night. Now the last night I would if I wouldn't have the quick\nmind to turn around to kill them or something like this, I would be dead. It so happens that\nevery day something else happened and every day, oh, you had to outsmart somebody or you\nhad to be quick about something. And this is the way that mostly survivors survived. See, if\nsomebody survived in a camp, he couldn't do anything. If he didn't die of typhus, and he\ndidn't die of starvation, he wasn't picked out in a selection to be gassed, he survived because\nhe didn't have to fight himself...by himself to outwit...to do something. He had to be strong to\nwait and not to be gassed. But when you were on your own in the woods or like my wife on\nillegal papers, every day was a challenge. Every day you had to do something to live another\nday. Now you were asking me a question. I didn't tell you this before. Why do I tell all those\nstories? There are people, survivors who don't want to open their mouths, and they will shut\nup and they don't tell because the pains come back and they cannot sleep nights. You don't\nsleep nights. You dream about it. The next day you think about it. And this 1s a vicious\ncircle. It goes day after day after night. I think every survivor survived for a reason. I\nsurvived for two reasons. I had two legacies why I survived. And this gave me strength. One\nlegacy was when my father was shot (I told you this before) the last words was, \"Revenge,\nrevenge, revenge. Take revenge.\u201d And I wanted to survive. I wanted to join a special unit.\nFor this reason, I joined right away the army, and I wanted to join a unit that could give me\nthe possibility of revenge. I took revenge as much as I could. Looking back, some people say\nwell revenge is not sweet because it doesn't bring anybody to life. But if you will ask a\nperson who went through so much and you will say if you have a chance to take revenge\nmaybe not so much for me because I'm alive and this what I went through doesn't mean\nanything, but for the people who are not alive, the people who are killed. And if I took\nrevenge for my father, I did it gladly. Now after so many years, we live in America. It's a\nnormal life. We have to live like human beings, not to be like animals. Like in this time\neverybody was an animal. This gave me strength. The second strength gave me when my\nmother was\ntaken to Belzec. She somehow sent to somebody a letter to me when I was in the\nKolbuszowa camp. And she wrote me in the letter and she said, \"You are the youngest. You\nare young. You are my youngest. You are young. You are healthy, and you are a witness.\u201d\n\"So go on,\" and she said, \"Let the thing that you are an orphan and let it not break you. You\ngo on and live. Live. Go to Palestine and tell 1t to David.\u201d David was my brother. \"Go to\nAmerica and tell it to Albert.\u201d Albert was my brother. \"Go in the world and tell it to the\nworld what the Germans did to us. How they murdered us. What they did to us.\u201d\u2019 And this is\na legacy that my mother gave me. Not to be quiet. To go out and tell and retell everybody the\nstory, and not to let it die. Because this what the Germans did, we can talk as much as want.\nWe will not even scratch the surface\nbecause the cruelty, the barbarism (of) what they did. Not only the killing. To kill a Jew was\na salvation for the Jew. This was the best thing they did, because they relieved him from the\nmisery. But if you take a town like Warsaw, like other big towns, starvation day after day,\nthe children who are left without their parents, and they had to go out and beg for a crumb of\nbread and they couldn't get and they died from hunger. The cruelties. Take a tree. You start\nto cut branches. The tree will die. Here you took a family. You killed a daughter. You killed\na son. You killed a son-in-law. You killed a grandchild. Now the parent, even if he was\nalive, he was dead because everything was chopped up. So the people have to know about\nthe cruelties, and for this reason the Museum, the books, the telling, the testimonies,\neverything is important because everybody has to tell a different story. And a different story\nabout the cruelties what a human being can do, what a German can do. I will never call them\nNazi because I don't know who was Nazi. A Nazi belonged to the party. There were only,\nnot even 2 million, but the whole nation, 99 and a half percent did it. And they with their\nhelpers, with their collaborators. So for this reason, I will never say the Nazis did it. I say the\nGermans did it. With their helpers. Helpers, the Poles, the Ukrainians, the Latvians, the\nLithuanians. They were helping. The Hungarians. Some countries more, some countries less.\nBut the worse thing was in Poland. I can never understand how people who lived with us for\nso many years and were an underdog by the Germans could be so helpful even the Jew who\nsomehow sneaked through the Germans' finger, run away from a transport. Run away to a\nsewer in Warsaw by the opening, a Pole was waiting. This I could never understand and I\nwill not understand. Sure, there were people who helped. But a very small percentage. If in\nPoland there was | percent in Poland who helped Jews, it was a lot.\n04:44",

        "Q: Because I'm not always clear on the groups you were with. You were with the Jewish group\nfirst?",
        "A: First, we had the Jewish group. Right?",
        "Q: Then the second group was AK?",
        "A: The AK. Yes. With the AK, I was quite long. I was a few months with AK.",
        "Q: And the third group?",
        "A: Was the Russian. But you see, with the Russians I didn't stay. The Russians I only came to\nthem and I asked them for help. I asked them for help to do this thing with this Scharfuehrer,\nwhich they agreed. So I was with them altogether about 2 weeks. Til we prepared those\nthings. And then later after, they wanted me to stay with them. But I figured the war 1s\nclosing and closing and I had enough and I wanted to be liberated. Then I said to myself I\nwill join the army. I don't want to be in the woods anymore. But the main thing, the longest\ntime I was with the Jewish group, but unfortunately, there was very, very few left of us.",
        "Q: Okay. If you can, tell me about when you were poisoned.\n04:45:",
        "A: Okay. This was after we were shot by...when I was shot by the Agustins by the two brothers\nwhat I killed them. And I went to the AK. But my brother, as we run away from them, it was\na very high snow. We stopped on the way by a friendly peasant and he gave us some old\nclothing and also he gave me a pair of shoes which fitted me. But for my brother he didn't\nhave shoes because they didn't fit my brother...the too large foot. So we had to run away.\nAnd we went through a meadow which was low and it was covered with snow and\nunderneath it was water, but was it covered with a very thin layer of ice. And as we walked,\nhe broke the ice and the ice was so sharp that it cut his feet and it cut off the skin. He didn't\nfeel it because it was very cold. When we came to our group, we saw that his feet are without\nskin. Naturally, we washed. We couldn't go to a doctor. We washed, and we put in some\nbandages. And he had to put some place to recuperate. So we brought him back to the same\nvillage where this shooting went on, but to a peasant. His name was Avisha...that he used to\nwork for my father. He used to bring merchandise to my father. And we trusted him. And I\ndidn't want to show that I am there. Because even my brother would be there, they would be\nafraid to do something to him I should remain as a witness. So my brother...I left him on the\nroof [attic?] in the stable and when he came to milk the cows he told them he's there. And he\nused to bring him every day about 5, 6 o'clock a quart of soup. And this was his food that he\nate, that he brought him. Every evening he brought him a hot quart of soup. One day I came\nover there. And he noticed me. And I was afraid that he should see me there. Even I trusted\nhim, but I figured those two boys were his friends and they belonged to the same group.\nWhen he noticed me, the same day, he didn't bring us food. And I told him, \"I am here, but I\nwant to tell you one thing.\u201d I asked him, what's going on in this village?\" He said, \"Nothing,\nNothing.\u201d And I didn't believe him because it was not nothing. I killed two of the best boys\nin this village.\n04:48:\nHow could be nothing nothing? He didn't tell me this. And everybody knew that I did it. So\nwhen it was dark he didn't bring the food like every evening. Usually he brought the food\nabout 5, 6 o'clock. It was 7 o'clock. He didn't bring the food. It was 8 o'clock. He came over\nand he brought a quart, he brought a pot with soup. Usually, it was hot. This time it was cold.\nAnd he left. Usually, he waited til my brother would finish the soup, and he would take back\nthe pot. This time he gave it and he run away. He went away. So I said to my brother, I said,\n\"Don't eat it because I don't trust it for a few reasons. The first thing I'm here with you. They\nknow they got us both together. The second thing he usually brought it between 5 and 6.\nNow it's already 8. Why so different? Always, it was hot. Now it's cold. He always waited\nfor the empty pot. Now he didn't wait. He went away. So he said, \"Oh, we can trust him.\nDon't think that he will do something.\u201d I said, \"No, I will not eat it. And you don't eat it. I\nadvise you.\u201d He started to eat it. And when he start to eat, after a while he started to\nscream...he said, \"I don't feel good. I have pains. I have cramps. I think I'm poisoned.\u201d So I\npoured out the soup. I said, \"Wait.\u201d And I jumped on downstairs the stable, and I started to\nmilk the cow. And I milked a full pot of milk and I came up and I said to him, \"Drink the\nmilk, the whole thing and then later, try to throw up \" So he drink the milk, put in his finger\nin his mouth and his throat and he threw up. I said, \"Now, let's go.\u201d Now he still had trouble\nwith his feet, but we went down. I said, \"I want to wait. I want to see who is coming for our\nbodies.\u201d So we were waiting there on the opposite side. Was very cold. And this I remember\nhow cold it was. And it took about 20 minutes. Four guys came 1n with flashlights and I saw\nthem going in in the stable and there was a loft, came up the ladder with a flashlight, took a\nsecond there. They came down and they started to run. They run away, and then said to him,\n\"Now, we can go.\u201d But I knew...I knew who came so I said to him, \"We will wait about a\nweek or two and we will burn their houses.\u201d This, Franek Zavishes house I didn't touch.\nBecause he really was nice, and maybe they forced him to do it. But others I said, \"After a\nfew weeks, we will burn their houses.\u201d See they were afraid to come and to shoot because I\ntold them, \"Anybody who will come up on the attic and he will show his head, I will blow\n04:51:\nhis head off.\u201d So after the war, after the liberation, I invited this Franek when I was a big\nshot in Krakow, so I invited Franek to come to Krakow, and he came. And I asked him in\nthis time, I said, \"Tell me the truth. What happened this night?\" So he tells me there was a\ndoctor who belonged to his group. His name was Vosna Volski. After they told him that I am\ncoming there, he gave them four pills of poison. And the four pills he suppose to put in in\nour food, but he didn't want to kill us. This what he told me. He didn't want to kill us. He\nonly wanted to threaten us. So he only put in one pill. And later I find out that one pill could\nkill 25 people, not two. But he wanted to scare us we should run away so he put in only one\npill and three he didn't put in. This he told me after we were liberated and he came. And my\nwife\n04:52:\nwas sitting there because I knew her in this time. And then then I knew which doctor and\nhow it was.",
        "Q: Very briefly in about three minutes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Tell me. After liberation, you joined the Polish Army. Tell me about that.",
        "A: After the liberation, the same week, I joined the Polish Army.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I went and I joined. I didn't have to go, but I joined and I wanted to be a part of the Polish\nArmy, and I volunteered to join the air force. Because I wanted they should teach me and I\nshould be a pilot and maybe I will be able to bomb Germany. And the school for officers for\nthe air force was in Kuibichov. This was in Siberia in Russia. So when I waited for a\ntransported, then I met a young Polish officer. She was a beautiful, nice girl in that uniform.\nShe went through us, and we waited for the transport for the train to come. And we started to\ntalk. And she said, \"What're you doing here?\" And I told this. She said, \"Well, you're going\nto be a pilot. It takes 2 years.\u201d The war wouldn't last 2 years anymore. So why don't you\ncome with me and you join our unit. We have a special unit, and if you want to take revenge,\nyou will take plenty of revenge.\u201d And I said, \"How can I do it. I have already the orders to\ngo.\u201d She said, \"Don't worry.\u201d And she took me to her colonel and she showed him the\norders. He took the orders and he ripped them up and he said, \"From now on, you will be\nwith us.\u201d And I joined them, and this is how I joined, this is how I met my wife. Because\nafter six months, when we had to liberate Krakow, so I was already a big shot in this time\nand I came to Krakow and then when I find out about my wife and I came to have her killed.\nAnd this is a different story and this my wife probably will tell the story. Because Krakow\nhad to be destroyed completely. And my wife was the secretary of the company who made\nthe barricades and before we entered Krakow, we had to find somebody to get the plans to\ndismantle those barricades and through channels and channels we find out that it's her and\nthree were sent out to get those plans. And I was one of the three. This was one day before\nKrakow was liberated. So I entered Krakow January the 18th 1945 and officially Krakow\nwas liberated January the 19th. And my wife will tell you the rest story. I thought she's\nGerman. I hated her. She was beautiful. I saw my five sisters in here and we made up that\nafter we get the plans, we'd kill her. And then she looked at me. When I came in, I started to\ninterrogate her. She thought I am the biggest anti-Semitic Pole. She said, \"You're a snob,\"\nbut later she told me, \"You're a snub nose and you're slavic, slavic face features.\u201d But\nanyway I find out that she's Jewish. She find out I am Jewish. She was very happy. And this\nwas our meeting. And we had to still go through in the war...January, February, March,\nApril, May...This was still war. And then later in November, we got married.",
        "Q: When did you come to the United States?",
        "A: We came to the United States January 1947. After I was transferred I escaped. I was in the\nGerman zone in Germany about 6 months, and then we came to the United States. We\nwanted to go to Palestine in this time, but it was impossible. So we came to the United States\nwith the thought of going from here to Palestine. And this is other story. This is the other\nchapter and another book. But we are here, and we are very happy to be in America.\nAmerica did for me more than I expected. I never dreamed that American can do this for me\nwhat actually I achieved. And now we had a daughter. We are very happy. My daughter has\nthree little boys. And this is the most important thing is to show that Hitler didn't\ncompletely succeed. He wanted to erase every European Jew in the Jewish race, and we are a\ncontinuation. Now one I want to tell you. After the war, we contemplated...we didn't know\nwhat to do. I was already a Pole. I had established position. My wife was Polish, an\nestablished position. And we didn't know. She started to study medicine in Poland after the\nwar. So we didn't know what should we do. Should we become Jews and run away or should\nwe stay and be Poles and maybe to save our future generations the heartache and the\nproblems that we had. And we started to think about it. What should we do? And we decided\nno. Because we cannot do it. For two reasons. My wife couldn't do it because she had her\nfamily and her grandmother, uncles and her sister in Palestine. I couldn't do it because, it so\nhappens we spoke yesterday about Kohanim. I am from the line of Kohanim. Now we know\nby Jews are very strict to follow male after male, and our lineage goes back til Aaron the\nhigh priest, the brother of Moses. And I said, \"Who am I to cut this chain. My father was\nkilled because he was a Jew. Maybe his forefathers were killed because they were Jews. I\nhave no right to come to me...1t reached me after 2...after three and and a half thousand years.\nBecause since Aaron is between three and and half thousand years and four thousand. Who\nam I that I should cut this line? So I said, \"For this reason, we have to remain Jews, and we\nshouldn't be the one to say this 1s it.\u201d If we would do it, 1t means that Hitler succeeded. We\nwill resign from being Jews. For this reason, we had to continue.\"",

My father was a Hasidic Jew, very religious, my\nmother...the whole family was very religious. He had a long grey beard and my mother was\nvery religious. She wear a Sheitel, which means a wig. And everything was around Jewish\ntradition, Jewish religion. I attended when I was 3 years, I started heder, which means a\nschool for boys. Til 3 years I had my hair. By 3 years, they cut off my hair, but they left side\nlocks. And after this heder when I was 6 years, I attended a small Yeshiva. They called it\nYeshiva for the young boys. I also started public school, regular public schools for which\nwas together with the Polish boys. And when I was 15 years I was sent out to a Yeshiva to a\nvery famous Rabbi in the town named Tarnow, a larger town and which my father was a\ndisciple of this Rabbi. He was a follower, so he send me to his Yeshiva. And then when I\ncame back...I wasn't there too long, because I wasn't very happy with it, I started to work in\nmy father's business. And my father had a wholesale store in which we sold everything. Now\nthe stores in the villages used to come to us and they bought the merchandise for their stores.\nSo here you could call it a general store. We had there everything what was needed for a\nhousehold, we sold it. And it was quite a prosperous business. Our town mostly, they were\nvery poor Jews. I would say 50 percent were poor, and 40 percent made a living, and 10\npercent were rich Jews. My father was considered to be among the 10 percent rich Jews.\nAnd this how we lived. It was a very close family. My sisters, when they were married, my\nfather saw to it that they would remain in our town. He gave them a dowry. He bought them\na house, and he established a business for them. What he used to do, he used to take a branch\nfrom our business and he gave it over to him and he took care of this on a wholesale level for\nthis business. And this we lived quite happily til the war. My oldest brother went to America\nin 1919 one year before I was born because in 1919 we had the pogrom. The Poles came and\nthey killed nine Jews, wounded 200, and this pogrom was for the celebration of gaining\nindependence. So what 1s a better way to celebrate independence after so many years than to\nhave a little pogrom. Not a big one, but at least nine people killed. So after this, my oldest\nbrother left and he came to America. So he didn't know me because I was born a year later.\nIn 1933, my second brother left. He became a Zionist which all family was always in. There\nwere Hasidic, but they always were, all the sisters belong to Zionist organizations and even\nmy father was enough up-to-date that he was a Zionist. And my brother left in 1933 as a\nChalutz, as a pioneer in this time. So those brothers were out from our town, but the rest\nwere living in our town til the war started. And it was a happy life. I was never satisfied with\nthis life in this little stetl because I looked for something else. I wanted to go to school. I\nwanted to study. I wanted to go to gymnasium. My dream was to become a doctor, but I was\ntoo young and I was maybe too weak to say to my father, \"I want to take off this Hasidic\nclothing,\" which I always hated, \"and to be like everybody else, to be a modern man.\u201d But it\ndidn't come til a year before the war. I joined the Zionist organization which was the Hanoar\nHatzioni. It was the young movement and I was very happy because this was the tie that\ngave me a chance to belong to organization together with girls, which before I couldn't speak\nto her. There was special one girl which I fell in love when I was 12 years old, and I had a\nchance to be with her together with our other friends, and this was quite a happy time for me\nthat I could get out of this burden of what my father wanted me to be a Hasidic boy to sit in\nthe temple, in the synagogue and to study from morning til night.",
        "A: Well, then before the war we started to feel when the things happened to Germany, we felt it\nin Poland. We felt it because the climate started to be...the Poles started to show their anti-\nSemitism a little more openly. Til 1935 was not so bad because til 1935, Pilsudki was the\nmarshall in Poland, and he was quite good for Jews. And the minute Pilsudski died, a lot of\ntihngs happened. It changed. Smidli took it over and then special laws came out against\nJews. The businesses started to be bad for Jews. They opened cooperatives and slogans were\nall over and they used to say in Poland, [polish] [polish] means everybody to his own for his\nown. The small businesses lost everything because those cooperatives started small\nbusinesses in the villages. So what they did. peasants didn't sell their produce to Jews, so\nusually used to buy them, but they brought them to the cooperatives and they used to\nexchange them for merchandise they needed. So they cut out the Jew who bought the\nproduce and they cut out the Jew who sold them their merchandise. But we, our family didn't\nsuffer because they were not enough advanced to have wholesale places to supply the\nstorekeepers in the villages. So even there were more storekeepers in the villages, our\nbusiness improved because they had to come to us for this merchandise to sell to the\npeasants in the villages. So we didn't feel it. But my father always said that this is only for a\ntime being because eventually they will be enough advanced to start their own wholesale\nstores and their own manufacturing, that they will cut out even the wholesale letting the\nmanufacture which was mostly in Jewish hands. So we knew this is only...in a short time,\nour business will go down also. And then the climate was so bad that everything what\nhappened in Germany from the papers we started to see, it started to happen in Poland. There\nwas a time that they tried to forbid ritual slaughter for kosher meat which in the time of\nPilsudski would never happen, but it happened, but the Jews fought back and it didn't come\nto be that the slaughters should be forbidden. Also, they organized ,they established a\nconcentration camp on the system that it was in Germany tn this time because in Germany\neven before the war, they had a few concentration camp, which starting with Dachau,\nBuchenwald. So they had in Poland, a concentration camp in Breizakotuska . This was in the\nnorthern part in Poland. And what they brought in mostly, supposedly to be for communists\nwhich were enemies of the state, but also Jews who they thought didn't do such business,\nthey did something wrong. Instead to put them to jail or instead they give them fine, they\nbrought them over to this concentration camp, which was a very notorious concentration\ncamp. So all those things were prepared against the Jews. Like for instance, there was the\nPrime Minister. His name was Slatkovski ?. He was a general, so he even was a very famous\nexpression, when there was a debate about Jews and people say the Jews have to go out of\nPoland, be thrown out of Poland, beaten up in Poland, so he said to beat up Jews no, but to\ndestroy them economically he said ofshun. In Polish ofshun means by all means. So this was\na very famous saying, ofshun, Prime Minister said that we have to do it. Now, for instance,\nthe...",
        "A: Alright. Well, this I give you just a feeling how the situation and this was so in this time, I\ndecided that I have to leave Poland, that this Poland was not for me, so I had to leave. Now\nto leave Poland wasn't so easy because where would you go to? I wanted to go to Palestine\nbecause I became a Zionist and this was my dream. But to go to Palestine wasn't so easy. I\nwas little too young, and then later you had to have a certificate from the English\ngovernment and only a few got and a few were lucky in that. And so I decided to go illegal\nto Palestine. So in 1938, I joined a groups that we paid in money and we're supposed to be\nsmuggled to Romania, and Romania to take a boat illegal to enter Palestine. So we had to\npay 500 zlotys for it; 500 zlotys was quite a lot of money. I decided with a friend of mine, he\nwas a very close friend. Now this boy didn't have the 500 zlotys, so I remember the day\nwhen the letter came that we should pay it in, I paid in my 500 zlotys, and he didn't have it.\nSo his mother had two silver candlesticks, probably from her mother, so she went and she\nhad to sell the two candlesticks and still he didn't have the 200...the 500 zlotys. He was short\n200, so I remember I gave him the 200 zlotys, and he said he would pay it back to me in\nPalestine. And we paid in and we were prepared and we waited to go, but this never came to\nbe and the war in the middle started and we supposed to go in August and the war started in\nSeptember, the Ist of September. And this dream fell through. Also I wanted to come to\nAmerica because I had here a brother, and all my father's brothers and sisters were here. My\nfather was the only one who remained home. So I wrote them letters and I begged them to\nsend me papers. But none of them sent me papers. Only what they had to do 1s to invest 25\ncents to go to another Republic and send me affidavit. But they didn't do it. And when they\ndidn't do it, so America was out. Palestine was out. So I had to stay there til the Germans\ncame in. Now, Ist of September the war broke out. And it was a very bad feeling because we\nknew that this something terrible will happen. Everybody there were rumors that the Polish\narmy is strong. We have a strong calvary, and they mobilized people, the older people. Now\nthe Polish government, I don't know if they did it purposefully, if they had traitors there,\nbecause they mobilized old people. People who used to serve in the Austrian army in the first\nworld war. The young people they didn't mobilize. And so I felt that my duty, I felt myself as\na Polish patriot. I wanted to be part of Poland. I lived in Poland. So I went and I volunteered\nto the army soon as the war broke out. They didn't accept me because they said they don't\nhave enough uniforms for the regular army. How would they take me? So my parents\nnaturally didn't know that I went and I volunteered. The feeling was that something terrible\nwill happen and we awaited it. Now the Ist of September, the war broke out right a day, 2, 3\ndays later. Thousands of refugee came through our town. And most refugee who fled from\nthe western part of Poland came to us and the reason why they came to us is because we\ndidn't have a railroad. And there was a short cut from Tarnow to cut through to the east, and\nusually when there was a railroad the Germans used to bomb the railroad and to shoot, so\nthis way because there were fields so they used to go through this route, thousands and\nthousands, every day more and more. And then later you could see the army broken up,\nbroken units, and they came through our town. And Saturday, the 9th of September, the\nGermans came in. And as we were never a lucky town, like we had a pogrom; we had other\nthings always happen in our town. So Saturday morning the town was clear. There were no\nPolish soldiers, so we figured there would not be no battle and the Germans will come and\ntake the town. So it happens at 12 o'clock, a new regiment came in that had run away and\nthey said they're going to make a line in our town. And the Germans came in about 3 o'clock,\nand there was a battle and there were 65 Germans killed and about 200 Polish soldiers, and\nthere were about 150 Jewish civilians. Why Jewish? They didn't kill when there was a battle\npicking out Jews, but the Jews were the refugees. They didn't know where to hide. They\nmostly were Jews, because Poles didn't run away. They were not so much afraid so they\nwere caught in the middle 1n a strange town and they were killed. And the atrocities started\nright away. They took us out in a open place, and they burned half of the town. And we were\nin the middle and they came and they said that the battle, the fight was done by Jews, not by\nPolish soldiers, and for this reason they're going to burn alive all the Jews from our town.\nAnd they burned, they purposely started to burn the town, the houses around where we were\nlocated. And we saw that maybe they will do these things, which they did not at the time.\nBut it so happened in the evening, somebody came and they said, \"No. They will let us go.\u201d\nAnd they kept us for a whole night in the fields. The next day we came home, and all the\nhouses were plundered, the houses which were not burned were plundered. The Germans\nstayed in there a half day. They went in and took out everything they wanted. And we started\nto live under German occupation.",
        "A: When I was watching where we were in this place, surrounded and when they started to burn\nthe houses around us and I saw there the young soldiers standing there and watching us and I\nlooked at them and in this time I imagined myself being him. Being 1n a uniform, having a\nrifle in my hand, and he should be the victim. And I was thinking, \"Would I let him die, to be\nburned alive?\" Because there were children started to cry and I wanted to compare myself\nwhat I would do in that case like this and I couldn't understand that they came and they\noccupy a town and take civilian people and kill them. Because we were sure that they would\nkeep their promise and they would burn us. So then later, the next day they started to take us\nto work. And every day they came and they took out everybody and there was a lot of work.\nThe whole Polish army was broken up and we had to clean the weapons and used shells from\ncannons and we used to load it on trucks to take away. Also, we had maybe a hundred dead\nhorses because it happened that this unit which came to our town this day, this was a cavalry\nunit and when the fighting started, the horses were killed. And the horses were laying dead,\nand this was still hot summer, so it start that we had to clean them up. Now Jews were not\nused to such kind of work, bury horses. They were not strong enough for this. So we had to\ndig holes and pull the horses and bury them because we were afraid of an epidemic. And so\nthere were a case I remember that one Jew when we dug the horses, one officer came and he\nsaid to the Jew he didn't [like] him for some reason or other. And he said to go in in the hole\nwith the horse and we had to burn him too alive. And we started to cover and with the dirt.\nThen in the last minute his wife found out and she came and she screamed and begged and\ncried. Finally, he was almost buried completely. He said, \"Alright, you can dig him out.\u201d In\nthose [days] they started to harass the Jews. They used to take old Jews with long beards and\nthey used to harness them to wagons, and they used to sit on the wagons and they used to\npull them. Just to show and make pictures and make a film. Everything to insult. In the\nbeginning those insults were very bad, because we didn't know what awaits us. But everyday\nsomething else happened. And we got used to the yesterday's insults, but the next day there\nwere more severe insults. So we forgot already what happened yesterday because we had to\ncope with the new one. And then later they gave out the curfew that Jews can only walk out\nfrom their houses between 10 in the morning til 12 noon, and then from 4 in the afternoon till\n6. So you imagine only for the 2 hours to go out and to do everything what you had to do for\nthe family. Naturally, nobody did business anymore. They confiscated the merchandise.\nThey took away everything. And in the 2 hours you could see everybody was running,\nrunning, running because you wanted to do, to accomplish in the 2 hours what he could do in\na whole day. And then later he was in a hurry to go home, not to be caught in the middle. So\nthose were the harassments. Then later it came the harassments which couldn't walk on the\nsidewalk. We had to walk on the road, on the street. The first day it was terrible. What you\nmean I cannot walk on the sidewalk? But later we got used to it. We got used to it, so we\nwalked on the street and if somebody walked on the sidewalk in the beginning they didn't\nshoot us, but they arrested them. Then later came out a order that every Jew who saw a\nGerman on the street had to take off his hat. He had to greet him. Now, so they were cases\nlike in my father for instance, I remember, there came a young German policeman, so he\ntook off his hat. So he went to him. He started to beat him up. And he beat him up and he\nsaid, \"Why do you beat me?\" He says, \"Well, because why you taking off the hat. Why you\ngreeting me? What am I? Your friend? You are a dirty, lousy Jew and I'm a German. Why\nam I your friend. Why you greeting me?\" So the next day, when he saw a German, he didn't\ntake off the hat. So he went and he beat him up. And he said, \"How long do we have to teach\nyou when you see a German you should take off up your hat, take off your hat and bow\nbecause you are subhuman and..... So everything what they did, 1t was only to make life\nmiserable. And then the war, of course, very bad because every day they caught the same\npeople and they took them away to all kind of work, to clean the streets. And then the Poles\nwere standing and laughing and enjoying because they didn't touch them and they were\nvery[helpful?] and if sometimes the Germans didn't know where the Jews lived, the\nPoles...usually the young Polish boys used to go with the Germans. They couldn't speak\nGerman. One word they learned very fast. Jude. Jude. So they went with the Germans and\nthey used to show the houses. Jude. Jude. Jude. That there lives a Jew. So the Germans went\nin and took out everybody and dragged them to work. Now the work was done and they\ndidn't pay for it. The people were hungry. They couldn't make a few zlotys 1n their\nprofession or something like this. They had to go from morning til night to work. And the\nworst time was in the winter. In the winter we had to clear the streets. From far away,\nkilometers away, for the Germans that their cars and trucks should be able to travel. So we\nhad to stay in the snow from morning til night. Even when the snow was falling down, we\nstill had to clean. So we sometimes asked, \"What's the use to clean up? In 5 minutes they\nwill be covered with snow again?\" But nevertheless, we had to do it. And I was with the\nGermans about a month. Then something happened to my father, somebody, one of his\nfriends denounced him to the Germans that we had hidden merchandise and the Germans\ntook away everything we had from our warehouses. They cleared out everything. They didn't\nleave anything. And I said to this man...I threatened him and I said to him, \"Someday, I will\npay you back for it.\u2019 And he went to the Germans and he told them that I'm a very\ndangerous. I was at this time 19 years old. I was a boy from the Yeshiva from a Rabbinical\nschool. Before the war, I wore the long peijes. And he told them that I belonged before the\nwar to a communist party which was against...and that I'm dangerous to the Germans, and I\nalso said that I will go and to do some sabotage. This what he told the Germans. Now, they\ndidn't know me, so they said that tomorrow we're gonna arrest him and we shoot him. I find\nout about it and I run away to Russia. To the Russia zone because Poland was divided. The\nwestern part was taken over by the Germans, and the eastern part was taken over by the\nRussians. So I went over to the Russian zone and I went to Lemberg [Lwow]. And I was\nvery happy in Lemberg because there I joined a gymnasium which I always dreamed about\nit. And I also joined a Jewish theatrical group. There was a Jewish theatre and I always I\nsaid, \"If I cannot be a doctor, I want to be an actor.\u201d I always had it in my blood. And even in\nhome before the war when we used to make like plays for a holiday for Hanukkah for Purim,\nevery year our school made the play. And I always had the lead in this play and I used to\nsing by a cantor. I had a voice soprano, so the cantor liked me and I used to sing solos. So I\ncame to Lemberg and my dream was fulfilled. I went to a gymnasium and I joined a theater\nso I could play...be a part of it. So I said, \"Well, the war will last maybe a year or two, and I\nwill meanwhile do what I want to do.\u201d Meanwhile, I found out, I was there 3 months. I find\nout that my girlfriend which I liked...her mother is gravely ill and she was only with her\nmother because her father and brother and sister were on the Russian side. So I find out\nabout it. I decided to come home. And I came back to the Germans. And I will never forget,\nthis was already in January. We had to put white sheets over us to camouflage the snow and\nwe went through the border and we were caught. Those are long stories. I don't want to dwell\non how we were caught by the Russians, and then they had to take us to jail to Lemberg,\nback to Russia. We knew once we are in the jail, so after from the jail, they send us to\nSiberia. So during the night, we overpowered the guards and we tied them down with\nblankets. We took away their rifles, and we went back to the border and this time we\nmanaged to cross the border.",
        "A: Well, there was one man. Before the war, he was a horse dealer. And he lived in the section\nwhere the border is. The town's name was Jarloslaw. It was known that every week he takes\na group of people who want to go to back. And when we came back he took a group of\npeople who want to run away from the German side. So he was like a smuggler. He was a\nJewish man. And he took at this time 15 boys from our town who wanted to go back.\nBecause 1n the beginning they couldn't make a living in Lemberg. It was very bad. There\nwere thousands and thousands of refugees. They didn't have where to live, where to sleep. So\nhere somebody told us that the Jews live in their houses. It's bad under the Germans. They\nhave to work. They have to do certain things. But the atrocities didn't start night in the\nbeginning, so they figured they will come home. I came home because on account of this\ngirl. Maybe subconsciously I wanted to be with the family too. And I will never forget the\nday that I came home, my father was sitting in our kitchen studying some Talmud, and I\ncame in and he saw me and I said, \"I'm back.\u201d And he didn't lift his eyes. While looking still\nin the book, he said, \"As much as I am happy to see you, you made the biggest mistake in\nyour life that you came back.\u201d Those were his words when he saw me when I came back.\nAnd naturally when I came back the first week, I was hiding because I was afraid that\nsomebody would say, \"The police.\u201d because I remembered that they wanted me. But this\nwas already new police, and nobody remembered and I joined the Jews with their misery in\nour town going to work and starting to do business and my father still had this little store, but\nit was little in this time. But he didn't come in in the store, because he was a Jew with a long\nbeard and it was like a red cloth when you want to aggravate a bull. So my sisters were in the\nstore and I started to travel to different towns, and brought in merchandise, mostly black\nmarket. And this how we started to make a living. And I was the young in the family, so I\nhad to do it, and I did it to support all my sisters because I had the three married sisters. Their\nhusbands were not capable to do it. They were very religious Jews with the beards and I was\nyoung. They didn't speak so good Polish. So I used to travel every day someplace else and to\nbring in merchandise and to sell it and to make money. And we worked like this til about\nspring of 1940. Spring of 1940, they made a registration, so all the Jews had to be registered.\nAnd then they used to make like...there came a few high officers from Rzeszow, and they\ntook us in a big building and they made like a selection. From the people who were\nregistered, they picked out at this time 200 young boys and we had to come to the places\nwhere trucks were waiting. And they send us to a labor camp. This was the first time they\nmade this registration. And the labor camp was in a town...in a village called Leipyia. This\nwas near a town Novisanz. This was near the southern border this was in the Carpathian\nmountains. Our work was that we had to break rocks. It was like a quarry where we had to\nbreak rocks, but the problem was that what we did...when we broke up the rocks we had to\ntransport them to a place on hand wagons, on wheel barrels, and the next day we took the\nsame rocks and we brought them back to the first place. And this was our work. It was very\nhard work. And they gave us very little food. But 1t wasn't so bad because in this time, this\nwas in 1940, our people in our town still lived in their homes. They still had what to eat. And\nthe post office could send...we could send packages. So the community from our town used\nto send every week a package to every prisoner. And they send it to the community of\nNovasanz, of this town. And this Jewish community brought it us to the camp. So we had\nenough. After 2 or 3 months, we started to run away. And all of us run away. And the\nGermans didn't even look for us even run away. What did they do? When everybody run\naway, they had from different towns, also young people, so they went to other town and\nbrought in other transport. So they didn't bother looking for us. So I came back from this\ncamp and I started to work by the Germans. So they took me and we started to build garages\nfor the Wehrmacht. And they accepted me. They also made us register, they looked us over\nwho is young and strong, so because of my work. So everyday I went to work. They didn't\npay us for the work, but I was glad to go to work for them so they wouldn't catch me to work\ndifferent work like cleaning the streets, cleaning the buildings. Because I had to go work\nanyways. At least I went in the morning. I had a pass that nobody should grab me from the\nstreet. And we worked there. And once being with those Germans or working in the garages,\nso I used to buy for them a quart of kerosene, a loaf of bread. I used to bring to the Germans\na few eggs, and we exchanged this. And it was there where I worked. And sisters were 1n the\nstore, and they did some business buying this from peasants and selling some produce. It was\nnot like before the war, but we thought it 1s bad, but somehow we will survive. They didn't\nkill at this time. But Jews for every little things were arrested. They were harassed. And they\ncaught the slaughter the Shochet who used to slaughter for a kosher meat, so they arrested\nhim. After 2 weeks, they paid a lot of ransom...they paid money, they let him out. And\neverything was done with money, you could buy yourself out by the German police. And we\nstill lived in our houses, so it wasn't so bad. But we knew that we are under German\noccupation, and also we heard stories from other towns about atrocities. There was a town\nMielec, for instance, not far from my town, so when the Germans came in, they took about\n200 Jews and they put them in in the shul, in the temple, and also in the public bath and they\nclosed the doors and they burned the people with the buildings.",
        "A: No. No. No. This I didn't see, but this was in the next town. So we heard about atrocities\nfrom different towns, but they asked...1t was just arresting contribution...we had to pay\nmoney, but nothing terrible happened. Until in the fall of 1940, they came, they established a\nvery notorious camp near us named Pruszkow, and Pruszkow was an SS camp. Now\nPruszkow was established because this was the place where they started experiments for the\nV-1, V-2, rockets. This is the first what they did it, and they picked out this place because\nthere were a lot of woods. In Poland, there was a section, it was called Pushun Sandomerska\n. It means the wilderness of Sandomierz, the town. Before the 18th century practically,\nnobody could go through it. It was old, virgin forest. Later, people started to make villages,\ntowns. In this section of Pruszkow Sandomerzko, they made the first experiments. They\nbrought in Jews and Poles too, and they worked there for a certain time. Later, they killed the\npeople. They were afraid that they would run away and they would start to tell stories about\nthose experiments. I remember that during the day, three or four times you could hear a\nboom, a noise, but you didn't see a airplane. You didn't see anything. You could hear it. It\nsound like something is flying then noise, then it was an explosion in the air. You could see a\nball of fire and it disappeared. And this happened a few times a days, so this were the\nexperiments that they used to shoot the rockets, but they exploded. Then later when the\nrockets exploded, then on the places pieces of cast aluminum used to fall on the ground.\nNow the peasants used to collect it and they used to make utensils, spoons, jars, cups,\neverything they used to make from this. So the Germans didn't want it should be, and they\nused to send out special police to go and collect those items. And this came from Pruszkow.\nSo in 1941, at the end of 40, I was taken to Pruszkow. Again, there came a commission, and\nthey took the young people and they looked through and while they picked out the people,\nthey beat up everybody. And I remember I was beaten up terrible. I was standing in line,\nthen somebody and I didn't move so fast, so SS men with their rifle butt hit me in the back\nand I flew to the front and I feel down and I was all bleeding. So the man who was in charge,\nhis name was Schmidt. He was a Feldwebel, I mean a Scharfuhrer from the SS. And he saw\nme on the floor, so they picked me up, and I was bleeding from my mouth, from my nose. So\nhe came out and he said, \"Hey, what happened to you?\" Like not...he joked around. So he\ntook out a handkerchief and he gave the handkerchief I should wipe the blood. So I wiped\nthe blood. He said, \"Now, clean my boots.\u201d So with my blood, I had to take and I had to\nwipe his boots with the blood.\u201d So those were the things that they were terrible in this time,\nbut looking back those were things that you could survive. They were terrible, but it was not\nextermination. It was not killing off everybody. But in this time, those were the bad things.\nSo I was taken to Pruszkow. They were so vicious that when they took us on open trucks and\nthey took in this maybe 100 from our town in the open trucks, when we traveled, they took\nus by the trucks to Pruszkow. The driver purposefully, in Poland on the road, on both sides,\nthere were trees. Now trees were not high so he purposely drove the truck under the trees\nwhere the branches were sticking out and the people should be hurt, and a few of them were\nhurt. It cut open their heads and all that because the truck went in the branches. I was in\nPruszkow about 6 weeks. During the time, every night was there a ritual. When there was the\nappell, this Schmidt picked out somebody and he was hanged. We all had to watch by the\nappell how the man was hanged. And usually he picked out somebody of us, and he was the\nhangman. Now there were times in the books that I am writing there and I give more details,\nso there was a times that he picked somebody who didn't want to hang the other Jew. So he\ntook a knife and he cut his throat because he didn't want to hang him. And also this Schmidt\nhad a habit, when we walked to work we cut trees because they wanted to make the camp a\nlittle larger, so he used to shoot just in our rank, in our column. Not aiming. So once I was hit\nin my right arm. And it was very difficult to work because the hand, but he didn't do no\ndamage and I with somebody's help, I was transferred to other detail to put up telephone\npoles through the town of Tarnow. And one time when I lifted a telephone pole, I dislocated\na disc in my neck and I couldn't straighten out. And then I knew that if I would be there and\nthey would find out that this happen, they would shoot me because what do they need a man\nwith a dislocated disc? And then with the help of somebody I escaped, and I came back\nhome.\n01:40",
        "A: Well, when I was shot, so the Germans, they didn't know would be tied down to 1, 10 men. I\nwent to work. It was hard too, because we worked there cutting the trees. So it was hard, but\nwith the help with others, they covered me. You know, in a camp the comradeship, the\nfriendship was so big that everybody would do everything for his friend. Even we were\nstrangers we became so friendly that at times even they would endanger their lives to help\ntheir other friend. So they covered, but when I dislocated a disc it was very bad for me. I\nused to hold on to two guys when we worked I should be a little straight. And I knew that I\nwould not be able to hide this a long time. So there was a man who was in charge of the\nJewish columns. It so happens that this man was a cousin of my girlfriend. And I told him\nthis. His name was Kleinhandler from Tarnow. And he was the head, he was like a middle\nman between the workers of Tarnow in this Pruszkow camp. So through him, he\nrecommended me to somebody else and through the other man helped me to escape. He\nopened a truck when I went to work...a truck went to a town Bembitza. And he told me to\ngo on the truck, and they took me away. Because the truck was a SS truck, but he had to pick\nout so many workers to go to this town so he picked me out. He knew that I have his name, I\nremember even was Immergluck . And he was not very much liked, because he did things\nthat he didn't have to do to the Jewish workers. But to me, he was good because this other\nfriend told him to do it, so he picked me up and they helped me go on the truck and they took\nme to work supposedly to the Bembitza to bring some merchandise or to bring some\nsupplies. So I went to Bembitza, the Jews were still there, so I didn't go back. And that's it.\nThey didn't look for me. I came home and I started to wear a brace. And then later after a few\nweeks, it healed. I had problems later, but I could walk out. I came back home. The situation\nstarted to be much worse, every day, every day, you could see that the situation 1s worse.\nThen later we received, we got in our town a Land Kommissar which is the head of the\ncounty, because our town was the county seat, and there came a Land commissar, and his\nname was Farting. And he was the biggest sadist ever lived. And he was a German, but he\nalso was a Polish guy, because he spoke German and Polish. And this was very bad, because\nhe could speak to the Polish people and he could find out a lot of things which was not\nhealthy for us. So this Farding came to us as a LandKommissar._Before he used to be in the\nGestapo in Rzeszow. So they said and we used to say he is so bad because he has all bad\nthings from both nations, the bad things from the Germans and the bad things from the Poles,\nand he combined it in one person. He looked like a caricature. He was short, very fat, with a\nbig belly, a shaved head which in the sun it was gleaming like a mirror, small little eyes like\na pig, very small piercing eyes, and he had a voice that it was like a shrilled voice, like it\ncame from animal or something, very shrill you say, and he was very shrewd, very smart.\nAnd he wanted to outsmart everybody, but he was very vicious. So when he came he\norganized a ghetto in our town. And our ghetto was organized before large towns had ghetto\nbecause we already had a ghetto in June 1941, which was very early. And he pushed into the\nghetto, where before used to be 70 Poles, he put in 2,000. And it was very cramped. And we\nlived in the ghetto. And then we had an old man who was the President of the Judenrat,\nwhich was a Doctor Unterman. And I think this Doctor Unterman should be remembered. If\nthe Jews would have in their religion to make a saint of somebody, I think he should have\nbeen the first saint. Because being that president of the Judenrat, he actually sacrificed his\nlife for the Jews. Before the war, this Doctor Unterman didn't consider himself a Jew. He\nwas a assimilated Jew. He never bothered with Jews. He never belonged to a temple. He\nnever even stepped in a Jewish temple. Only had his friends with the Polish people because\nhe was a Polish officer, and was a Polish patriot, and he was considered by them that he was\none of the most important people in our town. But with Jews he never had anything to do. He\nhad Jewish, had Jewish patients, but that's all. When the war started he saw that he can speak\nto the Germans different than a Jew with a long beard. He was clean shaven. He was a\ncaptain in the Austrian army. He\nstudied medicine in Vienna, spoke beautiful German, and he could stand up to them. Now,\nagain, he couldn't understand that the Germans will be so vicious and he thought with him\nthey will think twice. So he agreed to become the president, which before he said, \"What I\nhave nothing to do with Jews?\" But later, we convinced him and he said he will become\npresident if he would pick out 12 people which he liked with him. And he picked out 12\nyounger people, Jews without beards, people who were outstanding citizens before the war.\nHonest people. Fine people. And he said, \"If they will be with me in the Judenrat, then I will\nbe come the Hauptman. And they agreed. As a matter of fact, between the 12 people, he\npicked out my older brother and my brother-in-law he was one of the 12. And he ran this\nJudenrot that I don't think so that any Judenrot was run like this. He was so honest. I don't\nknow if we should go in details, but Linda, I'll give you two examples. Once they brought in,\nthey gave to the Jews to divide pieces of soap, to give every family a piece of soap. And the\nJudenrat divided the soap. And then about 5 kilo soap was left. It was more than they...so the\nJudenrat, the man who was in charge of dividing the soap, he made 13 packages to give\nwhat's left over to each member of the Judenrat to take home. And one was for Dr.\nUnterman. And Dr. Unterman came in, and they said, \"This is for you.\u201d He said, \"What is\nit?\" He said, \"Well, this is the soap.\u201d He says, \"But I already got soap, what I suppose to\nget.\u201d \"Well, this was left.\u201d And they explained it. And he said, \"It was left and how much?\"\nAnd they said, \"We made 13 packages.\u201d He said, \"I want to see the 13 packages.\u201d So they\nbrought back what everybody took for himself. He opened it and he said, \"Give me a list of\n13 poorest Jews in our town.\u201d So they picked out 13 poor Jews. \"I want everybody should\nget a package. Not you. Not I.\u201d And he divided...this kind of man way he was. Like to the\nGermans he spoke to them like to equals. Like this Farding who came in, he wanted to take\nover Unterman's house because he built this house a year before the war. And because he\nwas a physician he was well off. And he built a beautiful house, and this was the only house\nin our town that had electricity. He had his own generator. The only one in town that he had\nindoor plumbing. He made it a beautiful house. So naturally, Farding wanted this house. So\nhe asked him, \"I want to move in. Why don't you move in into the ghetto.\u201d So he told him,\n\"In the ghetto I will move 1n til the last Jew will have a roof over his head. So long as the last\nJew doesn't have a roof over his head, I will not move in.\u201d Then later this Farding said, \"The\nJudenrat will have to pay 10,000 zlotys to me to renovate the house.\u201d He said, \"Renovate? I\njust built 1t. And besides if I could live 1n it, you can live in it. And then why should you\nrenovate. After the war will end, I will come back to my house. You will go back to\nGermany.\u201d Now he didn't like this thing, we were in the ghetto about 2 weeks, he took the\nwhole Judenrat with Dr. Unterman and he arrested them and they were sitting in jail in\nKolbuszowa about a week or 2 weeks. They they were sent to Rzeszow and from\nRzeszowize they were sent to Auschwitz. In Auschwitz, there were orders was right in the\nbeginning. This was in the fall of 1941. In this time, you hardly knew that Auschwitz exists.\nAnd then they were sent to Auschwitz, and after 2, 3 weeks, telegrams started to come to the\nfamilies, and the telegram said that your husband died on cancer. Other one your husband\ndied on heart attack. Your husband died while he was running away. And then it was a letter\nthat the widow had to sign that her husband suffered for cancer for 2 years, that her husband\nhad heart trouble for 4 years. Why they did it, why this evidence they needed, I don't know.\nBut they had to sign a letter that he actually was sickly and to add salt to the wound,\neverybody received a bill for the cremation. They said people were cremated and the\ncremation cost so and so much, and you will have to pay the money. So every widow had to\npay money for the cremation. Now when the Judenrot was liquidated, naturally, Fardring\norganized a new Judenrot. But [for] this Judenrat he already picked out people who he liked.\nAnd this Judenrat, I wouldn't say that they were murderers, but they were more to the liking\nof the Germans than Dr. Unterman. That the old man of this Judenrat wouldn't go out and\nwouldn't, if there was left there 13 packages of soap, he wouldn't say divide it to the poor. He\nprobably would say I want the whole 13 packages. This was a different. And then it was life\nstarted to be more and more terrible. Another [thing] I want to tell you about is Dr.\nUnterman. When he saw that the Jews are so poor and they cannot afford a doctor, so he\norganized an ambulatorium. And every day he gave 2 hours, he was sitting in the\nambulatorium, and this was in my sister's apartment, and everybody who was sick who\ncouldn't pay could come to him, and he treated the people. And then later the Judenrat had to\npay for medicine what they received. Because he liked me, so he took me in the\nambulatorium I should be his assistant. As I mentioned before, I always wanted to be a\ndoctor. So I worked with him and he taught me how to open wounds, how to clean wounds,\nhow to put in all kinds of ointments, how to bandage, all those things. And I worked with\nhim every day and he showed me all these things. This gave me opportunity when we were\nlater in our camp, which we come to it, and we were in the woods I became the doctor, the\nso-called doctor. We had to do some medically, I always had that little suitcase with all kind\nof instruments which I inherited after he was killed. And I had this and I used to treat the\npeople as much as I could, as much as he taught me. So this Doctor Unterman got killed, and\nthe Judenrat got killed. He had a wife with a son, and his wife, after he was arrested, the wife\nwith the son escaped to Warsaw and they lived as Aryans, illegal people, Poles, illegal\npapers which they could very easily survive because they didn't look Jewish, and their\nlanguage was only Polish. And during the uprising, not the ghetto uprising, but the general\nuprising in Warsaw, her son was a officer of the AK, the Polish underground, and he was\nkilled. She survived and came to America, and after the war and since then she died. So men\nlike this should be remembered because we didn't have too many people like this. Actually,\nthe Poles begged him to escape from jail in Kolbuszowa, and they wanted to take him and\nhide him and do anything for him. And he said, \"I cannot do it, because I cannot leave the\nJews, because nobody will stick up for them.\u201d And he thought that he would be able to speak\nup, and then later they got rid of him. Now once he was killed yes, also under his\nadministration, because you asked me I should tell about me. Because I before the war, I\n01:55\nworked in my father's store and I used to go to different towns buying all kind of\nmerchandise for our store, I knew the suppliers. I knew the ways how to buy and bring in the\nstuff. And also when I left our ghetto, we had to wear the arm band, a white arm band with a\nblue star of David. Every time I left the ghetto, the first thing I took off my arm band. And I\ntraveled, nobody stopped me and it so happens that I was never, never stopped for\nquestioning that I'm a Jew. I look so Polish, more than the Polish people. So I never was\nsuspected, so it was easy for me to go because and then later to bring in merchandise as a\nnon-Jew. So Unterman picked me out and I was the one who used to go to different towns\nand to bring in merchandise for the ghetto. Now, we later organized a kitchen for the people\nto come in to have a warm meal once a day. Now when we had to buy those things we didn't\nreceive as for the ghetto on card, but we had to buy like potatoes, flour and other things. So I\nused to go out to the peasants and used to buy it and bring it in. And I did it for the Judenrat.\nNow, also the ghetto received flour for baking bread, and each family recetved so much.\nSometimes two\n01:57:\nloaves a week, sometimes | loaf a week. This had to brought in. So I used to go to the flour\nmills and bring it in. This was officially I brought it in. We used to get sugar. We used to get\nmarmalade. We used to get other things...supplies what the Germans get. And this we used\nto get in Rzeszow. So I went twice a week, once a week, with wagons and I brought this in\nand this was my job. Instead to go and work on the streets and clean the streets, so this was\nmy job that Unterman assigned me to. And for me, it was very good because when I went to\nbuy all those things, I always brought something on the black market. Paid extra money, and\ntogether with this merchandise, I could bring it in and then later to supply my family and to\nsell something like this. This went on til he was arrested. When the new old man [Aeltester] .\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: So when the second Judenrat came into power...meanwhile, we had all kind of new orders.\nOrders like to give up all the furs, and if somebody would have a fur, and they would be\ncaught with a piece of fur in the ghetto and would be shot. So naturally most of the Jews\ngave the Germans the furs. I remember there came a truck.",
        "A: Fur. Fur. Fur. And then they had collars and fur, they gave them. And it was not a rich town,\nso you could see somebody had there a coat with a fur lining, it was maybe a 100 years [old]\nor so. It was all falling apart. But they brought it over. Everybody was afraid. Some younger\nwoman had Persian Lamb coats because this was the style. So some didn't give the Persian\nLamb coats because it was valuable, so we used to hide it or give it to peasants to hide. I\nremember one of my sisters had a Persian Lamb coat, so she gave it to me and I brought it\nout from the ghetto to somebody who we trusted and they should hide it for us, which by the\nway they never gave it back to us. And then there were other contributions. Once this\nFarding came in and he said he wants to have 10 kilo of gold. Ten kilo of gold in our\ntown...they were poor Jews...how could they could, but I knew how. But this new president\nfrom the Judenrot, his name was Pashek Rappaport. He was very energetic. And people were\nsometimes afraid of him. So he somehow managed to get together the 10 kilo gold to give it\nto Farding. And when they gave it to Farding, so he said, \"You know, you saved 20 Jewish\nlives with it because I was prepared to kill 20 people if you wouldn't give that 20 kilo gold.\u201d\nI remember to the gold, everybody gave what he had, a wedding band, a pair of earrings, but\n10 kilo is a lot. So I remember there was still missing, this night I will never forget that my\nfather came and he brought a package and he opened it and he had there, he said I'm going to\ngive this too to save lives, so he opened it and there was a gold watch on a long chain like in\nthis time the women used to wear a gold chain with a watch and also he had in this package a\ncigarette box from gold. So he said, \"I'm going to give it. You see when I was engaged with\nyour mother,\" he told me, \"I gave her this watch, and she gave me this cigarette and I saved\nit through the first world war. I had it hidden, and now I'm going to give it.\u201d And he gave it.\nAnd now the Jews gave...and we came up with the 10 kilo gold and then he said we saved so\nmany lives. And every day new atrocities a new one on top of one [that] was not finished,\nthe other came up. The other came up. We lived in this time in the ghetto. We were fortunate\nthat my brother's apartment was in the ghetto, so we could move into his, so he had two\nrooms, SO we moved in in one room and he had one room. I had three married sisters, so one\nof my sisters lived in the place where the ghetto was with the other two sisters moved in. So\nsomehow I was appointed by the new Judenrot to my old job to go to other towns and to\nbring in the merchandise which was very helpful. But in December of 1941, I went once to\nRzeszow, and Rzeszowi was a epidemic of dysentery. And a lot of people died. And I ate\nthere. I remember I bought two tomatoes, and I ate the two tomatoes and I came home and I\nhad dysentery. And this was very dangerous because with the Germans, because this was\nvery contagious and when the Germans find out that there is somebody with dysentery,\nprobably they would have me killed. So we didn't tell nobody. I went to the attic, and my\nyounger sister which was the dearest to me because we were the closest in age. She was 3\nyears older. Her name was Rachel. And we decided I would be on the attic. We wouldn't tell\nnobody, and she was with me during all the time. She used to give me food, what I could eat,\nand she used to take away from me what was necessary because it had to buried because the\nGermans. And I somehow survived this dysentery. We didn't have no injections. We didn't\nhave no doctor. And as I recuperated I got middle ear infection, and\nI started to have terrible pain. And, again, no doctor so home remedies. We used to put in oil\nand this and that and it went on and on and got worse and worse and worse. And after 3\nweeks, the pains were so terrible, I cannot describe the pains because everything was\ninfected. So this was in the winter. Somehow my brother got a sleigh with somebody, and\nthey took me out from the ghetto, and they brought me to the ghetto in Rzeszow, to Dr.\nHeller. He was a. It was a specialist for ear, throat and nose. And he said that I have to have\nan operation right away. If I wouldn't have operation, I would die because all the puss was\naround the brain, but he cannot operate. There is no facilities. There are no Jewish hospital in\nRzeszow, and I cannot go to a non-Jewish hospital. So I went there with my sisters. I was\nthere with my sisters. So I have to go to Krakow. How can you go to Krakow? Jews are not\npermitted to ride by train. So my brother went back to Kolbuszowa and somehow he\nmanaged to get a false...from this Rappaport some that he had, a pass signed by this Earding,\nby this Land Kommissar, but it was not made out to nobody, so he made out my name with\nmy sisters and they took me, with the train, to Krakow. On the train, a young Polish boy\ncame up and he saw that there are three Jews, my two sisters and myself. He said, \"What are\nJews doing on the train?\" He said, \"I'm coming now from Germany. I work in Germany. In\nGermany, they wouldn't allow Jews on the train.\u201d And he started to speak to the rest of the\npeople. He said, \"We cannot have Jews on the train. We have to throw them out.\u201d And they\ncame to us and they wanted to throw us out from the running train. So my sister started to\ncry and to beg. They said, \"Look this man...this boy is almost dead. He's so sick. He needs an\noperations.\u201d My head was all with bandages. So some people they said, \"Well, Let's...let's\nwait til a station.\u201d There was a station. So this man went down. He brought up two\npolicemen, German policemen, and he said, \"I want you should throw them down because\nthey are Jews.\u201d So we showed him the papers. So the policeman said, \"What...we cannot do\nanything. They have the Passier Schein.\u201d That means they have a pass for travel. So again\nthey started to yell, \"Oh, we don't want to travel with Jews. So we will throw them out.\u201d\nAgain the same story, and my sisters begged them so they said okay. We'll not throw you\nout, but the next stop you have to go out. So we had to choice. The next stop. Meanwhile,\nthey caught the other Jew, and they threw him out from the running station. Not the\nGermans, the Poles. So the next station we stopped. So happens that it was in Tarnow. And\nTarnow was quite a big town. I knew Tarnow because I went to the Yeshiva in Tarnow, and\nwe had there a cousin. We came to the cousin and we were very lucky that in Tarnow there\nwas a doctor. His name was David Rabinowitz. And this David Rabinowitz, he was the chief\nsurgeon in Lodz in a hospital in the name of Poznanski, a very rich manufacturer. And he\nwas thrown out from Lodz and he came to Tarnow. So we came to him, and he looked at me\nand he said, \"I don't think so we can do anything to this boy because it's too long. Everything\nis already full with puss.\u201d But anyway, they made an operation. The operation took 8 hours,\nand he operated and he said, \"Well, he will be deaf or blind or something or he will die.\u201d But\nanyway, he operated so that after 3, 4 weeks my hearing came back and when he operated he\neven cut the drum for the puss to come out, and then later he sew it. He was a wonderful man\nand I became alright and I came home with my head all bandaged and in our town they\nalready spoke about it that I'm dead already. Now I want to tell you what happened to this\nDavid Rabinowitz. He was such a wonderful surgeon, such a wonderful man;a Jewish doctor\ncouldn't operate on a Gentile. But there was a case that somebody was very sick on the same\nthing and there was not a Polish doctor he should do this operation because it was a very\ndelicate operation. They came to him, and he told them, \"I cannot operate on a non-Jew.\u201d So\nthey said, \"Listen, you have to save this man.\u201d He went and he operated.\u201d And he saved him.\nAbout a week later, a brother-in-law of the man who was operated...a Polish guy also, went\nto the Germans and he told them that this Rabinowitz operated on his brother-in-law. They\ncame to the hospital, and from the hospital they they dragged him out to the yard, and they\nshot him. They shot him because he operated a non-Jew. And he saved him. Well, those\nwere the times. So when I came home, the whole situation in Kolbuszowa was already\ndifferent. During the 3 months, everything was pushed toward the end and we didn't know in\nthis time that are\ndeath camps, gas chambers. This was in April 1942, and this time you didn't have any\ntransports yet, but we could feel from the Germans' behavior that every day something else\ncame up. When I came back so I got back my job. Instead to go to work, I got back my job to\ngo for merchandise from the other towns, and I got the pass. I took over the ambulatorium\nfrom Dr. Unterman and I got all his instruments and I got medicine. I already knew what\nmedicines applied to this and which medicine applied to his, and I bought in the Apotheke\nmore medicine so I got a pass that I am in Gesundheitsdienst, which means a health service,\nthat I could go out from the ghetto if it's needed, which was very helpful. And we lived again\nin the ghetto. And this was the 28th of April, the 28th of April, 1942, we were sitting home\nand we had dinner cause dinner was not at night, but dinner was around 12, | o'clock. And\nwhat the dinner was, probably a tomato soup, a potato soup, something very austere. So we\nwere sitting, and then we hear somebody knocking on the door downstairs, and from the\nknocking we right away knew it's Germans because this was their knocking. Not knocking,\nbanging. And somebody looked through the window. They saw two Gestapo men standing,\nbecause their uniforms, the Gestapo had uniforms with SS, and we knew their banging. So\nthe first thing my sisters bolted the door from the inside, and the first thing was to hide the\nmen, because in this time we thought the men are most vulnerable. So my brother and I we\nwere home, so we ran out through the back door through the yard. We run out to a neighbor,\nand we run to the attic. We thought maybe they come to us, they will not go to them. My\nsister took my father and they put him in the outhouse in the yard and put in a padlock on the\ndoor to make believe that nobody is there because the padlock is on the outside. And he was\nthere. They were banging and banging. When they saw that not nobody opens and they\ncannot break down the door, one of the Gestapo went around the houses to see to go from\nthe back entrance. And then my sister was afraid that maybe it's not a good place for my\nfather to be there because they keep banging. Maybe he should go where I am hiding, so she\nwent and she opened the\n02:14:\nouthouse and let out my father. In this moment, the other Gestapo came from the back and he\nfaced my father. He first thing, he had a list and he asked my father, \"What's your name?\"\nMy father knew that if somebody would be on the list, he would be on the list. So he said,\n\"My name is Salich.\u201d\u201d Was Salsitz, but Salich. He looked. He didn't see no Salich.\nMeanwhile, they dragged out the other...you know when that men from the front broke down\nthe door, he took out the other man with him. His name was Hoofer. He was not on the list.\nAnd he took him to the yard, and he asked this Hoofer, \"What is this man's name?\" And he\nsaid, \"Salsitz.\u2019\u2019 He didn't know why, what, so he said, \"Salsitz.\u201d Well, so they had him on the\nlist, so they told the other man to go back and they took my father and started to push him\ntowards a wood shed which was in the yard. And, naturally, we knew, they took out the\nrevolvers, we knew what it is. So my two sisters, my single two sisters were with him. They\nstarted to scream and they runned to the Gestapo men to try to take out their revolvers. Why\nthey didn't shoot them I don't understand til now. So one [sister], the older one, Maddle, went\nto one and she grabbed his hand and she tried to pull out the revolver from him so he took\nthe revolver and hit her over the head and the head started to bleed and she fell down. When\nmy second sister, the youngest sister, she was 3 years older than I, saw this. She run to the\nsecond one and started to twist his hand and take out the revolver. He did the same thing. He\nhit her til she fell down. And they took my father and they pushed him in this wood shed and\nI could hear two shots. Now those shots were the loudest shots I ever heard in my life. They\nwere something so loud that til today, I hear them. Til today when I wake up at night, I could\nhear those two shots. It was something, and I saw them going in the woodshed from this attic\nwindow, but I didn't see what they're doing. And when they shot and my sisters were there,\nand they ran in and the two Gestapo men walked out from the wood shed after the two shots.\nThen you could hear the screams of my father. But the screams were not human screams.\nThey were screams like they would come from heaven or from an unnatural animal.\nSomething...not a human scream. He started to scream so loud I could hear it in the attic. The\nfirst thing he screamed, he said...he started to say Vidui. Vidui is a prayer when religious\nJews say before death. And then he ended with Shema Yisrael. He said the Shema so loud\nthat I could...it rings in my...in my ears. Then later he started to yell Nekuma, nemt Nekuma.\nIt means revenge, revenge. Take revenge. And he didn't stop yelling this word revenge and\nwhen this...when he started to yell this, the two men, the two Gestapo heard it because they\nwere in the next yard. They came back because they heard him still yelling. They came back\nand they shot him five times more and he became quiet. During all the time I was 1n this\nattic, I...I couldn't...I said to hear my father's being shot....I see it. I hear it. I don't do\nanything? Why don't you do anying. Now what could I do? I wanted to say something. I\ncouldn't. I wanted to move. I couldn't. I was like a piece of stone. After it was quiet I said to\nmy brother, \"I'm going down.\u201d And when I came down, so the two Gestapo men and I\nremember, they were young, tall, blond, handsome, and one's name...I remember his\nname...because I saw him before. His name was Norman. Norman. I'm trying to get now his\npicture. And they were still standing with their revolvers in their hand. And when they saw\nme and they saw my head was all full of with bandages because this was from the operation,\nso they thought maybe I was wounded today because there was so much shooting. And\nusually somebody was wounded, they finished him off. So they came...one came into me,\ntook out his revolver. And with him was a young Jewish policeman. So he asked him,\n\"Where was he wounded?\" He said, \"No, he wasn't wounded. He just came back from the\nhospital. He had an operation on his head.\u201d So he put back his revolver, and I went back to\nsee where my father was shot. And then I saw my mother, with the sister, and those little\nbabies, 3 years old, my nieces, beautiful babies like angels were sitting there and crying.\nThey probably didn't know what the crying 1s for, but everybody is crying, they were crying.\nAnd I could see my mother, my sisters laying over my father and kissing his face and\ncaressing him and he was dead. One hand was ripped, broken off because when they shot\nhim they hit the hand and the bullets hit the bones and the hand was...you could see the hand\nlaying in the side.\n:\nAnd he was laying there and they were crying and kissing him. One thing I want to tell you\nbefore...before this day. About a week before, this Pasha Rappaport, the new president from\nthe Judenrat came, to the Judenrat and he had a list of about 15 Jews who had long beards\nand he gave a note that the Jews should cut off their beards, that Farding, the\nLandkommissar told him that when he brings his friends to visit the ghetto, he's very much\nembarrassed to see so many Jews with beards. So he wants the beards should be cut off. And\nmy father was on the list that they had to cut off the beard. For my father to cut off the beard\nwas the worse thing because since his beard started to grow, he never touched a hair, even in\nthe first world war in the army, he never touched the beard. So we called a young boy a\nbarber to our home to cut his beard. So he begged him to leave him a little bit here. And\nwhen he cut it, my father was sitting, he was pale like it was white, and after he finished he\ngot up and in Yiddish he said, \"Jetzt hob Ich gefielt dem Ta'am miesse\".. It means now I felt\nthe taste of death when he cut this beard. And when we looked on my father we didn't\nrecognize him. He looked like a strange person because we were always used to seeing him\nwith a full grey beard. And here he's shaven. It looked like a different person. This a week\nbefore he was shot. After he was shot, the Gestapo came back and they told me with this\nyoung Jewish policeman and they said, \"We want you should go and gather together all the\ndead people and bring them to the cemetery, to the Jewish cemetery to be buried.\u201d So he\ntook me and we went to somebody who had a wagon, and the men were shot, and you could\nhear from different houses screaming, yelling. This day they came and they had a list of 20\nJews. Because they said they're going to kill one percent of the Jews. There were two\nthousand Jews. So they had a list of 20 Jews, the most prominent Jews from before the war\nto be shot. But the end was they they killed 22. I don't know by mistake or just for good\nmeasure. You know, when you buy something, you add...but they killed 22. So we went and\nwe started to get together those dead people on the wagons to take them to the Jewish\ncemetery. I went alone. I didn't feel anything in this time even my father was shot. But my\nfather always had a reserved place on the cemetery near his father. Now we are Kohanim. I\ndon't know if you know, Kohanim means from the priestly family. And this goes over from\nfather to son from father to son, father son. Because the Kohanim cannot go on the cemetery,\nso usually the Kohanim, the priests were buried right by the road. There was a big road in the\nmiddle of the cemetery. On both sides the Kohanim were buried. Why? So their children\ncould come closer to their graves. So my father's father which I am named after him was\nburied there, and my father always had a reserved place to be buried next to him. We knew\nabout it. So we decided, my brother and I that we would bury my father next to him.\nEven|though] the general said to make one common grave. So what we did, when we came a\nfew times to pick up the people. So then later we put our father so that his leg should stick\nout and I told my brother, my brother-in-law that when we will go through with the wagon,\nthey should wait by my grandfather's grave and pull him out and we'll make a grave near his\nfather, at least this to do for him that he should be buried near his father. We came. They\nwaited. We pulled him out. We started to make the common grave for everybody, but my\nfather was buried near my grandfather. The grave for all the people were made next to the\ncommon grave from the pogrom. As I told you, May the 6th, 1919, nine Jews were killed\nand all the nine were buried in a common grave. So we made the grave next to them for all\nthe rest of people. We didn't make a deep grave because it started to be dark so we just made\na shallow grave. We covered them, and we said we'll come back tomorrow to bury them. We\ncame home. I came home and my home. And my mother started...was sitting and crying. She\nsaid, \"They took away my crown...my crown,\" because he was the crown of the family. And\nwe were sitting a whole night, and the next day my brother, my brother-in-law and I and\nother people went back to make the proper burial. Everybody brought in for the parents a\ntallit. It means a prayer shawl. We brought in like shrouds. Now we didn't prepare shrouds,\nbut every Jew had a kittel, a white coat that he wore three times...twice a year. He wore it on\nYom Kippur. He wore it Passover to the Seder, and he was buried tn it. So we brought it for\nmy father to put him in in it. Also, we took a sack with wood because the wood where we\nwas shot in the wood shed was sprinkled, soaked with blood and we believe in the Jewish\ntradition, we believe that the blood is the soul of the person and we wanted this should be\nburied, so we took the wood and we put it in the grave. We opened the grave and made it\ndeep. We put in the kittel. We put in the prayer shawl, and we buried him next to my\ngrandfather. We did the same thing with the other people. Also there is a tradition that if\nsomebody is killed, when he is buried to put in a\n02:27:\nknife in his right hand. The belief is that this is for revenge. He should revenge his death. So\nwe brought knives and we put in everybody's hand a knife. We also put in a knife in my\nfather's hand. And we buried them, and when we came back I stopped by a tree. I didn't cry\nall the time. And I burst out and crying. I couldn't stop. And I with a such a loud a voice said,\n\"Why? Why? Why?\" And for about a half hour I was standing near a tree crying and crying.\nWell, I stopped. I couldn't cry anymore. We came home, and we sat down to Shivah, which\nis 7 days of mourning. Now when I sat down, my father he believed in Jahrzeit. Jahrzeit\nmeans that we on the day of the death we commemorate the dead person, and as we have this\ncommemoration we say Kaddish and other prayers. Also we light a candle, a Jahrzeit lamp, a\ncandle in a glass which lasted 24 hours. Now in the ghetto you couldn't buy candles for\nJahrzeit. Here you go in a supermarket, you can buy as many candles as you want. Ina\nghetto, you cannot buy candles. My father had Jahrzeit after his father 13 days in the month\nof Ijar. This was in the spring. This was in the spring...13 days, and he prepared a whole year\npieces of wax, pieces of paraffin, paraffin and he collected it and he wanted to make for his\nday to commemorate his death, this 24 hour glass with paraffin for his father 13 days in Jjar.\nIt took him a whole year to collect this paraffin. He never did it because he was shot 11 days\nof the month of Ijar, 2 days earlier. So when I came back, he was shot II days[in the month of\njar]. When I came back from the cemetery, it was 12 days in the month of Ijar. I went and I\nmade a wick, I melted the paraffin and I made this Yahrzeit candle for 24 hours, and when I\nlit it, I lit it for both of them. For my father who prepared it for his father, which was a day\nlater. And after my father was shot, the whole situation in our home changed. Because even\nhe was not active during the war, he was 60 years old, and the Germans made the list,\nbecause he was 60 years old, that means that he was unproductive. Because til 60 you were\nproductive. You could do something, where[as] by 60 you were not any more productive. So\nyou had to be killed. He was 60 years old. And the life changed completely. Our life, we had\nto go every day to pray. Well, there was no prayers, but in somebody's basement a few\npeople came together to have Minyan, to have 10 people, and we pray for it. So this was the\nfirst victim of my family that was killed. Now my brother, who was in the Judenrat in the\nfirst Judenrat, he was arrested also. And all of them were killed. My father was let out. He\nwasn't killed. Now I don't know if you want to know the reason why he wasn't killed. It...1t's\nnot necessary. Okay. So this he was, my father was the first victim from our family. After\nthis killing when they killed the 22 Jews in the ghetto, every day, every day something\nnew....and we felt in the air that something...the Germans are pushing too much, with too\nmuch orders...one order after the other that we couldn't finish the first one, a new order came\nin. Two weeks later, the Judenrat, the whole community...the leaders, were called to\nRzeszow who was the capitol of the state seat the Germans called it the Gauleihter. Gau was\nlike a state. And this...we belonged to them. They called all the presidents and all the\nmembers of the Judenrat to this town and there was a Dr.Ehrhaus. He was the\nKreishauptmann. Kreishauptmann was like head of state. And Dr. Ehrhaus was a major in\nthe SS, and he got together all the Jews...their leaders from all the State and he came in. He\nhad a paper and he read, \"As the Jews are filthy. Full of lice. And because they are so filthy,\nthere is an epidemic of a typhus in our state. I am putting in Polish . Kontributsia, means they\nhave to pay so much money. And he gave out Rzeszow a million zlotys. This town so\nmany...200,000 zlotys. Kolbuszowa 360,000 zlotys. And each town had to pay so much\nmoney. He said, \"In a week, you bring the money. If you will not bring the money, how\nmuch money you will be short, so much percent people who will take from your Judenrat,\nfrom your council, and we will shoot them. If there is 10 percent less, we will shoot 10\npercent. Twenty percent, we shoot twenty percent.\" Pashek Rappaport who was the Aelteste,\nwho was the president with all the members of the Judenrat came back to our town and they\ntold this, that they need 360,000 zlotys. Three hundred and sixty thousand zlotys after being\nin the war and the ghetto, people starved because at this time people started to starve. And\nevery day we find, did you hear this man starved...this man starved...this. Started to starve.\nThey didn't have what to eat. So to get together 360,000 slotas is impossible. We started to\ncollect. The next day they had to go back with the whole member|ship] and everybody from\nthe Judenrat knew that there is a shortage so much, so many will be killed. Again, they took\nthem in the same room and everybody had a burlap sack with money and asked them, \"How\nmuch you have? How much you have?\" Only our town, only Kolbuszowa, had the full\namount, 360,000 zlotys. All the other towns were missing. Like for instance, Rzeszow\nneeded a million zlotys. They only had 750,000. It means 25 percent was missing. Right\naway, he took out 25 percent from their members of the Jewish council, put them in aside.\nThe other town, the same thing. And I had a list, exactly Rzeszow, Barzava. I remember all\nthe names, and in the book I have every amount and they took out so many people, they took\nthem out in the yard, and in the yard they took out the machine gun and they shot them...25\npercent or how much was this. After they were shot, they got together what was remaining.\nEhrenhaus came back again with a new list and he said, \"Within a week, you go back. Every\ncommunity has to pay taxes from 1914 til today, if some Jew owes taxes.\u201d Now there were\nJews who were killed in the first world war fighting for their fatherland. There were Jews\nwho left for America. There were Jews who died, didn't leave no nobody. The community\nwas responsible. Every Jew...the Jewish community\n02:36:\nhad to pay up the taxes from 1914. Not only this, every Pole can put in a claim that a Jew\nowes him money without any documentation that he owes him money and the Jewish\ncommunity has to pay him within a week. And again what percentage will be missing, so\nmuch will be shot. They come back and this was a terrible thing. Here we got 360,000\nzlotys. We didn't know how it was collected. People are starving, and here they want we\nshould pay off taxes from 1914 til today for people who don't exist anymore. Right away the\nDirector of Internal Revenue was notified. He had to dig out books who were laying,\ncovered with dusk and he started to add and to add. We figured out, I say we the Jews\nfigured out that we will have a half a million slotas to pay for those things which was\nimpossible to collect. But this we figured. And the Poles were notified that everybody can\nclaim their debt what the Jews owed them. Imagine if they had a free hand to claim money\nand the way they loved us, imagine how many claims came in, without documentation. One\nepisode I remember. There was a man. His name was Fritz. Jan Fritz. He had a small store in\nthe village and he used to buy by my father. He always used to owe my father money. I\nremember when the war broke out he owed us thousand zlotys. He never paid it. He came in\nand had a claim that my father owed him 5,000 slotas. As I could go out from the ghetto and\nI knew him, I went to him. And I said, \"Fritz, you owed us money. How could you come in\nand to say that my father owes you 5,000 zlotys. You know this 1s a lie.\u201d He said, \"If you\nwill not go out this minute, I will raise it to 10,000 slotas.\u201d\u2019 And he could do it. I didn't say\nanything. I went out. Well, anyway, the claims from the Poles with the taxes came out to a\nmillion zlotys. Now how can you collect from the poor, wretched Jews who are in the ghetto,\nwho are already 1n the war 2 years, starving, to get a million slotas. Again, got together and\nthis time they used force. They beat up some people, but anyway, in a week it had to be\ndone. In a week they went back. Only Kolbuszowa, only our town, had a million slotas. The\nrest didn't have. Again the same story. How much it was missing, they were shot. We came\nback. After\n02:39:\nthey paid, and they were shot, he came out a house, again, with a new list. He said, \"This\ntime, within 7 days, every Jew had to leave the ghetto to Rzeszow. I'm sorry, not 7 days, 3\ndays. \"After 3 days, within 3 days, you have time 3 days, to leave Kolbuszowa to the town of\nRzeszow to the ghetto. And then all the towns from all the sections had to be relocated to\nRzeszow and to clear out of our ghettos. Of course, later we find out this was their methods.\nThey wanted to have the Jews in one place. So when they came back, this was the worst\nthing. The money somehow they sold the last thing, and we sold it to the Polish people for\nnothing. Like everything what we had, we sold it just to get money. And they got everything\nfor nothing. But the last order was the worst order. We will leave our town. In our town\nsomehow, everybody had somebody, acquaintances. Some people who could smuggle in.\nWe even had peasants we knew. Here we'll go to some place. Nobody knows nobody. How\nwill we survive with the children? And this was the worst thing that would happen til now.\nWe had to leave our home. And we started to leave. The peasants were notified that they\nshould come the next day with wagons, line up outside the ghetto. Eight in the morning the\ndoors of the ghetto were opened. They came in, and everybody could pick up a peasant.\nThey said you can take along anything you want. And they gave us wagons. The reason\nwhy, they wanted we should take along anything...only not furniture, because they wanted to\naccumulate, to assemble all the things that Jews have in one place, to be easier for them to\ntake it away. So the peasants were lined up and we started to load the people the\nmerchandise. Now I went out and I picked out two wagons with two horses each, peasants\nthat I knew from my family to load everything what we had. Now we decided to go the first\nday because my brother when he was released from jail, he became friendly with one\nGerman policeman. And this German policeman helped him to get out of jail. So he asked\nhim, \"What should we do? Should we go with the last day or the first day?\" He said, \"Go\nwith the first day, because it's 1n the hands of the Gestapo, and you never know what they\nwill do. Maybe there will be too many people in the other ghetto. They will come and they\nwill kill everybody. So go the first day.\u201d So my family went the first day. We loaded the\nsacks with everything we had. And there was a line, and they moved, we went 31 kilometers\nto Rzeszow. Now nobody could sit on their wagon. Old people, children, everybody had to\nwalk on the right side of the wagon. Walk the 31 kilometers to Rzeszow. You want me to\nstop now?",
        "A: Okay. So this how we were chased out from our town. There was one episode that I have to\ntell you. There was a man. He actually was from Germany. He was a Jew from Germany. He\ncame back to our town, and he walked with his wife, with his son, and with his mother-in-\nlaw, and father-in-law, after the wagon. But in one moment he made a mistake. Instead to be\non the right side, he was on the left side. A German policeman which was from our town. I\nremember even his name, Barthelmus, took a rifle and shot him. He fell down. His wife and\nhis child, he had a 12 year old child, couldn't even stop for a moment to go and to see what\nhappened with him. He was left laying on the street. They had to go forward. Now I went to\nthe third day, not the first day. The reason I went the third day because we still had things\nand merchandise and I wanted to be there two days to give it out during the night to friendly\nPoles. Maybe we'll come back. Maybe we'll retrieve it. So after the Jews went out with their\nwagons, we went and we took this men on the hand wagon and we brought him to the\ncemetery and we buried him. And I remembered he wore a grey suit, a grey suit with blue\nstripes, and he had yellow shoes. Usually by us, Jews didn't wear this kind of clothing, but he\nwas from Germany. He had modern clothes. So I remember the grey suit with blue, not\nstripes, blue squares. And we buried him. About a week later or 2 weeks later when we came\nback, I had to go to the cemetery because they killed somebody and I went to bury them.\nYou see, before my father was killed, I never saw a dead person. The minute my father was\nkilled, I don't know, every time they had to bury somebody, it pulled me. I wanted to do it. I\nwanted to do it. And before I never saw it. So somebody was killed, so I took him to the\ncemetery. When I took him to the cemetery, the caretaker of the cemetery, he was an old\nPolish man, I saw him wearing a grey suit with blue squares with yellow shoes. So we buried\nhim. I knew that he wouldn't let it go. He uncovered him and he took it out and he wore it.\nNow we were in Rzeszow. They brought into Rzeszow Jews. In Rzeszow were in this time\nabout 30,000 Jews. They brought into Rzeszow from this town maybe other 40,000 Jews\nfrom all the little towns. There was not enough place...I'm not talking about apartments or to\nhave a roof over your head. There was not enough place in the alley ways, on the streets, for\nall the Jews to put some place. And they came with those wagons. They brought their things,\nsome better, some worse. Every peasant who came to do the service was told that if he brings\nthe Jews to Rzeszow, if he has two horses the Jew must pay him 200 zlotys for\ntransportation. If he has one horse, the Jew must pay him 100 zlotys for the transportation. In\ncase the Jew doesn't have the money or doesn't give him the money, because sometimes they\ndidn't have, he shouldn't let unload the sacks. This was his pay. He can go home what they\nput on the wagon and take it for himself because they didn't pay him. So a lot of people didn't\nhave the 200 slotas so they took away right away which didn't make a difference. The\nGermans took it away later. So I came to Rzeszow the third day, and Rzeszow\nwas...sometimes if you talk about tower of Babel how the people couldn't understand [one\nanother]. This was the tower of Babel. People were running around like crazy. Children lost\ntheir parents. Parents lost their\n02:47:\nchildren. They tried to find themselves. Imagine to bring in so many people from different\nplaces. And on the way so many people were killed. Like this woman lost her husband. And\nthen a woman with children, the husband was killed because he did something wrong. He\nwent on the left side instead of the right side. Everybody was lost. And then to feed those\npeople. It was impossible to feed so many people who came in in one day. Because they all\nhad to come in within 3 days from all the towns around. To have places, I'm not talking\nsanitary places, but for anything, it was impossible. It was the worst sight that a person can\never imagine; some horror story, some horror picture, the people were put together. This was\nit. When they were there, came out an order that the 7th of July and this was a week later, the\npeople from this and this section have to assemble in this and this place, and they will be\nrelocated. Nobody knew that there are death camps. Nobody knew in this time that there are\ncrematoriums. Would the people know that they are death camps, like my family and my\nsisters, we could run away. We had peasants that we knew. I don't know if we would\nsucceed to survive, but at least we would try. Like those Jews I later joined them in the\nwoods, what they never went with this transport. We didn't know. We figured they would\nsend us in camps to work or something. The rumor was they're going to send us to the east to\nthe Ukraine to work in camps. We didn't know about it. They assembled...in one day, they\nassembled 30,000 Jews or 25,000 Jews. This was the first day on the Umschlagplatz be taken\nto the railroad station. Jews could take only one bundle with them. Now everything they told\nthem to take along to Rzeszow they were allowed...this was a calculated thing, so if they had\nto leave in their house. Now, what they did, there was a big ghetto. In every town, there was\na big ghetto, and later made it a small ghetto. This was a big ghetto. So they took the people\nfrom this and this streets. They cleaned them out. They left everything home. This way they\nhad a chance to go 1n and to clean out everything. The people came to the Umschlagplatz.\nThe Umschlagplatz was a terrible, a terrible scene. I wasn't there, but later I was told. Before\nthe Jews came in, they had to leave their bundle. Then later they took 2 girls, 3 girls,\nbeautiful girls and they told them to go around and collect all valuables from the people, to\ncollect money, to collect gold, to collect watches, and they did baskets. They brought them\nover where the Gestapo was standing, where the SS were standing. They were SS men, all\ndrunk. Later, they still didn't believe that Jews gave everything. So they went and they\npointed out young girls. It so happens that they pointed out one of my friends. A beautiful\ngirl. Her name was Susza Fein, and they put her and they undressed her and they started to\nlook in every place if she didn't conceal something. She was in this time 19 years old. And\nthey did it so cruel that they used instruments that they cut open her belly. And they looked\nthat the Jews didn't hide something. The Kolbuszowa Rabbi, an old man of about 75 years\nwas standing and he was blind. So they came to him and they asked him something and he\ncouldn't understand. So they took out a revolver and they went to shoot him. He had two\ngranddaughters. One was 16 and one was 18. Beautiful girls. They started to beg this SS\nmen. He's our grandfather. He was the Rabbi of the town. Please don't shoot him. He will go\nwith us. So they shot him, and they shot the two girls in the same time. Well, anyway, they\ntook away 6,000 Jews, elderly, crippled, children and they took them away and they had to\nwalk to a town near ??., They had prepared ditches in the woods, and those people were\nkilled in those ditches. The rest they took to the railroad and they were transported to Belzec.\nOn the way to the railroad, they were shooting in the columns that a few hundred people\nremained dead on the street laying where they were shooting. They put in the people in the\nrailroad trains. In the trains before they put in the people, they put on the floor untreated\nlime. I don't know...lime if it is not treated and if it's mixed with water, it starts to boil and it\nstart to give out gas. So those were untreated lime, because they knew that soon the floor will\nbe wet and then the gases will come out and then people will choke. Instead to take from\nRzeszow to Belzec by train would take 3 hours, it took them 3 days. When the people came\nto Belzec, they opened the railroad cars. More than 50 percent were dead. And then they had\nto wait. We find this out later. We, at this time we didn't know...we...well, I jumped a little\nbit. I...I will tell you",
        "A: Okay. Alright. Okay. So when we came to Rzeszow...when I came the third day, and when I\nsaw those things what's going on there with the people. So Farding gave out an order that he\nneeds...you see, our town...there were four towns belonged to our town...our county...that he\nneeds hundred young boys for each town to go back, and he will make a camp, a labor camp.\nThe reason...we should destroy, taking apart the ghetto. To Sokolov, Glogov, ?? , and ?? . I\nvolunteered with my brother to go back. The reason I volunteered because I thought I will be\nback. I have peasants that I know. I will be able to buy food somehow to send it to our family\nto the ghetto, Rzeszow, because in Rzeszow they would starve. But without sending them\nsomehow, we would. So we went back. We walked a whole night back. In the morning we\nwere taken into the Shul, to the temple, to the Houses of Study, and this became our\nbarracks, and this became our new life to be in a labor camp in Kolbuszowa. Meanwhile the\npeople were taken to Belzec, and they were made four transports from the people. In the four\ntransports within every week two transports, and they cleared up the big ghetto, the large\nghetto and everybody was left who had a card to work, they put in the small ghetto. And the\nsmall ghetto, and they liquidated the big ghetto, and we were 1n this time in the camp. And\nwe started to work as a labor camp. What we did in the beginning we started to destroy the\nhouses, taking apart. We saved everything for the Germans. For the Germans was very\nimportant to have old material, scrap, because they could make new material. So we picked\nout one house, and one room was paper, and one was brass and lead and so on and so on.\nAnd we destroyed this ghetto. Destroying the ghetto was a very painful thing because we\nknew the people. And we destroyed 300 years of a continuation of people who lived in this\ntown for 300 years, they were conceived in those houses. They died in those houses. They\nwere married in those houses. And now the people are gone, and the houses are being\ndestroyed. We threw down from the attics things that you would never believe that people\nsaved those things. And you could see the poverty of the people. They never throw out\nanything. Old iron beds, old iron stoves, barrels. Everything we threw it out. And then later\nthe house came down. We knocked it down. You could see the dust, and the dust went up\nand then you could see 300 years of life in this little Stetl, that it was destroyed. We cleared\nthe ghetto. We made a field out of it. And we still didn't know what happened to our people.\nSo we sent...we took a Pole. We paid him money, and we send him to go with the road\nwhere the trains went and then he came back and he told us the story. That they were taken\nto Belzec, and then we find out that they are death camps. This was the first time that they\nsent to death camps, which Belzec was. They tried out how to do it, so Belzec...it was not a\ncrema...it was not gas chambers like in Auschwitz, sophisticated with Zyklon. In Belzec,\nthey had old motors, and then with the gas, with the carbon monoxide and then later they\nburied the people. They burned them. This how we find out that our people are dead. We\nworked in this camp, and we knew that the end will be soon because we almost destroyed\nthe ghetto and there was not any more work. Why would they keep us. So they get us...we\nhad a river in our town. So he get us to regulate the river, to make it straight the banks. So we\nworked there. But soon we knew that we will what will they need? Farding played around\nwith us. We were like his small army. We had between our people a man. His name was\nLampel. He was a sergeant in the Austrian army. He was a drill sergeant. So he told them to\ndrill us, and we used to march like soldiers.\n02:58\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: We worked in this camp. And we had [it] quite good. The reason why? We didn't have no\nGerman guards. All the towns around us were Judenrein. There were no Jews around\nanymore because all the Jews were taken away. We had in our section, we had a few labor\ncamps, which the German organized. One was in Breshatka, and one was in Hutta\nKomarovska, and one was in Mielec. Mielec was quite known, because this was the second\nplace that they tattooed people. They didn't give numbers, but they had on their head a KL.\nKL it means Konzentrations Lager. Now if some people had the KL, I know they were in\nMielec. And this was very close to us. And we didn't have no guards. It means that we were\non our own. But Farding got us together, and he said, \"If one of us will escape, 10 of us...10\nwill be hanged.\u201d He made us responsible for everybody, to make sure nobody will escape.\nAnd every day we went to work. Then later, suddenly, I became friendly with Farding, and it\nwas very...there was one town, Sokolow. Sokolow belonged to us....to our county. The night\nof the expulsion of the Jews in Sokolow, when they told them to go to Rzeszow ghetto,\nFarding came to Sokolow drunk. And he said he wants Jews. So they started to bring him old\nJews, because they figured the old Jews will not survive the trips or something. He wanted\nand so they brought them...and he started to kill them. And he killed 1n this night...he killed\n49 Jews by himself with his own hand. He was drunk. He had a bottle of vodka. He drank\nVodka, and he killed. They brought him Jews and he killed. There was a pile of Jews. But he\nwas such a sadist, and he knew everything about Jewish religion because they...like I told\nyou before he spoke Polish. He said, \"He's going to kill the Jews to make them kosher. They\nshould go straight to heaven because they will be kosher.\u201d And he told them he's going to do\nwith the Jews the same thing as Jews did with chickens before the war. If a chicken had to be\nmade kosher, and if it had to be soaked 1n water, then later put in salt on all sides, and then\nlater this had to be done in the night with candles, two candles...had to be held near the\nchicken to see if everything is correct. So he got the two Jews holding candles. He had there\na bag of salt. And every time he shot a Jew, he took salt and he put it on the wound and he\nsaid, \"You see, now I make it kosher, and now the Jew go straight to Heaven.\u201d Those were\nthe things to add to all that terrible things they did. They played with us, like a cat plays with\na mouse before...before it [kills]... So this Farding suddenly became friendly with me. Now\nthe reason why he became friendly with me...I knew why. Because he liked to have\nsomebody who should confident...who should get confident and later to find out all kind of\nstories that he wants to know. Like he had there a young boy and I write about him a lot...a\nboy from 16 years, and he promoted him in the Rzeszow ghetto to be the assistant\ncommandant of the Police. A 16 year old boy...his name was Isaac Silber. He was from our\ntown. And if you speak to a Rzeszow Jew about Issac Silber, you will know a lot. Issac\nSilber was from my town. He was born by my town. And before the war, his mother...he\ndidn't have a father...his mother used to be the one...she wished to work in the public baths.\nVery low people. And this Isaac Silber was very smart, and he started to be a friend with\nFarding. Farding kept him, and he found out from him everything he wanted, and for this\nreason when the Jews were sent to Belzec, he promoted him. And he make him the assistant\ncommandant in Rzeszow. A young boy from 16 years old. So he became the famous Isaac\nSilber. We used to call him Itschele. Itschele was his name. So he became friendly ...\nProbably he thought that becoming friendly with me, maybe he would get a second Itschele\nor something. Now the reason how I got together with him is when we came back, he found\na warehouse with hundreds of crates with all kind of merchandise. And on the crates was\nwritten Isaac Salsitz. I don't know if you remember, when my father...1n the beginning of the\nwar, somebody squealed, and the Germans came and took away all the merchandise. It took\nthem three days to take out everything we had. This was never used. They put in a\nwarehouse, and it was laying there. Now Farding finds out...they found it, so he needed\nsomebody who knew about this merchandise. So he came to our commandant of our camp,\nwhich was a Jewish man from Krakow. His name was Henry Mundt, and he said, Mundt I\nneed somebody to clear out this warehouse. So he said what you need better. I have here a\nson from Isaac Salsitz. Who knows better? So he went...took me. He sent me home with him,\nand I come in and I see our merchandise was laying there. And what he wanted...I should\nmake packages...to unpack everything, and make packages from soap, from coffee, from\nchocolate, from tea, from cocao. All those things what they don't have in Germany, I made\npackages and I send it away. I made ready to send it to his home. So I worked there. And\nwhile I was working there every day in the morning they took me in this room. I worked\nthere, and then in the afternoon, they let me out for lunch. They let me out. They searched\nme if I don't steal anything. Steal my own stuff. And they let me back for lunch. And this I\nwent every day. The other boys worked to demolishing the houses or regulating the river,\nand I worked there. He used to come in every time, and he used to discuss with me things.\nAnd his biggest pleasure was to speak to me about girls. And somehow he told me stories\nthat since he was a young boy he was with girls. And he wanted to hear stories from me, and\nI had invent stories to tell him what womanizer I was. I didn't know her, but I had to tell him\nbecause he loved it. He even taught me all kind of expressions. He said do you remember\nMartin Luther famous saying, not the Martin Luther King, but Martin Luther, so his famous\nsaying was (in German) . It means twice a week it wouldn't hurt him, it wouldn't her, and it\nmakes in a year 102, what 1s right. This was his famous saying. And then every time he\ntalked different things and he asked me... One time he came in and he said to me, \"Do you\nknow what happened to your family?\" We knew already in this time that our family is dead.\nSo I said, \"No, I would like to know.\u201d He said, \"Yes, I saw your family last week in the\nUkraine.\u201d They were already dead 3, 4 months. He said, \"If you want, I can take you...if I\nhave my few days off, I go to Lwow with my car. I will take you along and I will take you to\nyour family where they work in a Kolkhoz. They work on a farm.\u201d So I knew the family is\ndead. I said, \"This would be nice.\u201d He said, \"I will do it.\u201d This...I don't know....he played\naround like this. One day we came out, 12 o'clock from this warehouse. I had a other man\nworking with me. And we stopped in a place where they used to distribute milk for free.\nThere was a milk factory, but they got the skim milk. They brought it over there, and the\nPoles used to stand in line and get milk for their family. So we made out that they gave for\nour kitchen...we had a kitchen there in our camp...that they gave for our kitchen every day 50\nquarts of milk. We made sour milk, other things. But we didn't have time to stand in line\nbecause there was always a long line. So I made up with a person who was in charge. So in\nthe morning we went to work. On the way I left the container. And when we came, lunch\ntime, I took the container, brought it to the kitchen and went back to work. One day I come\nfor the milk . There was a big line. There was one woman from our town. She was pretty\ngirl...but she was not the nicest person. She was a very loose woman, and during the war she\nhad a lot of German lovers. Anyway. So she said to me, \"You cannot go and take the milk\nwithout standing in line. You're not better than we. You have to stand in line.\u201d So I explained\nto her...I knew her from before the war...so I explained to her I cannot stay in line because\nonly I have is a half hour to go and eat and go back. She said, \"I don't care. If you don't stand\nin line, I will take the milk and I will pour it out.\u201d I didn't think she would do it, so I took the\nmilk without, and she run to me, took the milk, and she poured it out. So we came back\nwithout milk. So I told her something. I said, \"You shouldn't do it. And don't worry the war\nwill not last forever. I will remember you this.\u201d And...and that's it. And I went back to work.\nWhen I came home about 6, 7 o'clock a Polish commandant from the Polish police with a\nmustache going up like a typical Pole, he stands there and waits for me. And he says to me,\n\"You're Naftali Salsitz?\" I said, \"Yes.\u201d \"I want to tell you something. Tomorrow morning,\nwe'll have to shoot you. We got orders from Farding to shoot you. So what should I do?\n\"You run away.\u201d I thought he maked a joke. I said, \"Why?\" He said, \"Don't ask questions. I\nwant you should live.\u201d\u201d And he was known not to be a very tremendous Jew lover, so why\ndoes he tell it to me? So he said to me and I came and I told it to my friends what he told me.\nAnd everybody thought that I will escape and people were afraid because if I will escape, 10\nothers will be shot. So I said to my brother, I told him. He says, \"You know what' go speak\nto the Mayor.\u201d The Mayor was a very good friend of my father, because my father was\nassistant mayor before the war. So I went to him and I told him this. Go to Farding and see if\nyou can see he shouldn't. He said, \"I cannot go. I can't intervene for a Jew.\u201d So what should I\ndo? Escape. Everybody... Then he said to me, \"You know what? There is a man. His name is\nHalitski. He is the commandant of the Kripo, criminal policei, and he was a Ukrainian, but\nthe Germans made his this. \"Are you on good terms with Hailitski?\" I said, \"Very good\nterms.\u201d Now Halitski we were on good terms. Why? Because before the war, he was like a\nplain detective. And every holiday, he used to come to my father and he used to give him\nflour and sugar. You know just to be on good terms. So we were good to him. So I went to\nHailitzski, and I said to Halitzski, if I can...you see, I could work. I had a pass to work. So I\ncame to Halitzski, and he was a commandant of the Kripo, and I said to him, \"Can I talk to\nyou?\" He said, \"Yes.\u201d \"T have to tell you something.\u201d He said, \"What do you want to tell\nme? That tomorrow you will be shot?\" I said, \"Yes.\u201d \"I know about it.\u201d He already knew\nabout it. So I said, \"I came to you. Maybe you can help me. You were a friend with my\nfather.\u201d He said, \"Look, I cannot help you. You are a Jew. I cannot help you. But I want you\nshould live.\u201d \"So what should I do?\" \"Run away.\u201d I said, \"You're the commandant of the\nKripo should tell me to run away.\u201d He said, \"Yes.\u201d I said, \"They will hang 10 others.\u201d He\nsaid, \"What do you care. You will save your life.\u201d I said, \"What it is this, I have my brother\nhere.\u201d So he said, 'Take your brother and run away. I don't want to know about it. You run\naway.\u201d And he cannot help. I came back. Everybody was afraid that I run away and then\nwhose turn will be to be shot. Well, I didn't run away. I told them I will not because I don't\nwant they should kill 10 for I. The next day they went to work. I said goodbye to everybody.\nI put on very torn clothing. I took it from my friend, and I gave him my good clothing\nbecause if I be shot, let them have good shoes, good pants. And I came to my work, where I\nwork in the warehouse. Like nothing happened. Two policeman standing there, two Polish\npoliceman and they said to me, \"You come with me.\u201d I said, \"Why?\" And I already knew\nwhat it is so I came to them. They took me to the Polish police. I come in to the Polish\npolice. By the desk is sitting Patik was his name, the commandant who told me this. When\nhe saw me, he got pale. He saw me that I didn't run away. And there in the corner was\nstanding a shovel and they said, \"Take the shovel.\u201d So I took the shovel and he looked at me\nand I walked out. They took me about 200 yards away and they...one of them with the rifle,\nthe other with a rifle. They said, \"Start to dig.\u201d \"Dig for what?\" \"Don't ask questions? DIg.\u201d\nSo I started to dig. It was already a foot high. I said, \"Well, I'm digging, but tell me why am I\ndigging?\" \"Don't ask questions? Dig.\u201d\u2019 And I dug...I was already til here. \"What it was\nalready quite deep, so I said, \"Tell me the truth. Who you going to shoot here?\" \"Don't ask.\u201d\n\"It's me?\" They said, \"Yes.\u201d There were two. I said, \"Why?\" He said, \"Don't ask questions.\u201d\nSo standing there two policemen with rifles, I am digging my own grave. Now what went\nthrough my mind? My whole life from the first minute I remember to the family this and that\nwent through. People ask, \"What is the taste of death?\" Does somebody know the taste of\ndeath? Nobody knows the taste, because if somebody is dead he cannot tell you the story the\ntaste of death. But I know the taste of death. But usually the taste of death takes a second,\ntwo seconds, and somebody's shot. But me the taste of death took more than an hour because\nI had to stay there in the grave and I knew I will be killed. This was the taste of death. I can\ntell you how the taste of death feels. Not only once, I can tell you seven times how the taste\nof death is from other episodes. So what should I do? Should I throw sand? How can I\nthrow? One stands in this side, one stands in this side, with the rifles. So if I throw the other\none, so I told the one, one was very vicious, so I said to him, \"You know I ask you one favor.\nIf you know how to shoot. You're teaching me how to shoot. If you will shoot me, please kill\nme with one bullet. Shoot me through the head. I don't want...because I was thinking...I was\nafraid I will be buried alive. Until today when I have dreams, I have dreams from this day,\nand they shot me. They didn't kill me. I was buried alive. And then takes a long time to\nsuffocate. What can I do? And I had an idea. And I said to that man, \"You're going to shoot\nme anyway. Why don't you go to bring Farding to tell Farding I want to see him. Farding\nwas very shrewd. And I knew on every little thing, he wants to make out something of it.\nThey said, \"I don't want to go to Farding. If I got to Farding, I don't shoot you. He will kill\nme. He's a vicious man. He was very bad for the Poles too. I said, \"Go and tell him. You\nhave nothing to lose.\u201d \"You run away.\u201d I said, \"How can I run away? The other man stands\nhere?\" He didn't want to do it. Farding had a secretary. Her name was Shusa Kotaleska. She\nwas a girl from my town, and I knew her from before the war. So I told him, \"Go and tell\nShusa Kotaleska, I want to talk to her.\u201d They didn't want and one agree. He said, \"I will\nbring Shusa Kotaleska.\u201d They brought Shusa Kotaleska. She was Polish. When she saw me,\nshe started to cross herself and said, \"Oh Jesus, What's going on?\" I said, \"I don't know.\nThey're going to shoot me.\u201d She says, \"Why?\" I said, \"I don't know.\u201d I said, \"I need a favor.\nGo tell Fardring,.is Farding in the office?\" She said, \"Yes.\u201d \"Go tell Farding I want to see\nhim. I have very important things to tell him.\u201d And I knew this would be the\nvery...uh...things he will...\u201d \"I cannot go to Farding. You know him...\u201d I said, \"Go.\u201d She\nwent. Comes back in a few mnutes, and she told Farding...she said I want to tell him\nsomething very important. So she comes back and she said he wants to see you. I went back,\nso the policeman didn't have a choice, and they with the rifles on both side, go up to\nFardring. Fardring comes out of the office. In the office thre were about 10 girls. He said,\n\"Hey, verfluchter Jude, you there. You're crazy. He wasn't my friend anymore. You, what\nyou coming to see me? So I said, \"I have something very important to tell you.\u201d \"Alright,\nwhat is it?\" I said, \"Well, I cannot speak to you when all the people are here. I want to go in\nthe other room.\u201d He took out his revolver and he started to curse me. He said, \"Jude. Turn\naround. Going to shoot you like a dog.\u201d So I started to...you see, in this time, I was very\ncalm. You see by me, if I am very scared, I will become very calm. And I was...and I started\nto smile. I said, \"You threaten me to shoot in there. I dug my own grave. And you tell me...so\nhere at least I'll be shot under a roof.\u201d So he . Alright. He took me to the other room. And he\nsaid, \"What do you want to tell me? Want to tell me that the Jews have money? What you\ntell me?\" I said, \"No.\u201d Said, \"What do you want to tell me?\" \"You're going to shoot me. I\nknow you like Bohnenkaffee. You like coffee beans.\u201d You see my brother who was with\nme...he was known. He was specialist in roasting coffee beans. And before the war we used\nto roast our own coffee beans, and it was the best coffee beans we made. And he knew about\nit. And he didn't have too much coffee beans in the warehouse, and he needed it. And by\nGermans, coffee beans was everything. I had hidden by a peasant 100 kilo coffee beans\nbefore the war. Not roasted, green coffee beans. And if my brother will roast it, it is fresh. It's\nvery good. I had it hidden. We never took it out. Figured maybe someday we'll need it. I\nsaid, \"If you let me go, I give you coffee beans.\u201d As I told him this, he got red. He started to\nsqueak with his squeaky voice. His...his shaved head started to perspire and looked at me\nwith his eyes like a pig and he...he went to me. He slapped me in the face. He said, \"You are\nbribing me?\" I said, \"Who's bribing you? I don't bribe you. I will give you coffee. You can\nshoot me later. What's the difference. You can always shoot me.\u201d So then later he quieted\ndown. He said, \"Where will you take the coffee beans? You want to say that the Jews in\nRzeszow have coffee beans because there were still 2,000 Jews. I said, \"No, I don't even\nknow the Jews in Rzeszow. I know peasants I know storekeepers. They used to buy from me\nbefore the war. They're in the stores. I will go and buy.\u201d \"Okay. How much coffee beans will\nyou give me?\" I said, \"How much is my life worth?\" So he said, \"50 kilo.\u201d I said, \"50 kilo. In\nthe whole general government you cannot have 50 kilo coffee beans. From where?\" So I\nsaid, \"I'll give you 5 kilo\" \"10 Kilo\" Well, we bargained and bargained. Then we agreed on\n25 kilo. I said, \"25 kilo.\u201d \"When can you bring it to me? Tomorrow?\" \"What do you mean,\ntomorrow? Where can I buy 25 kilo?\" Then later I spoke to him like an equal because he\nalready made a deal with me. So I said, I have to go and buy. I will buy 10 here, I will buy\n10 here. I will put it together. I need a Passierschein signed. I need a pass to go.\u201d He called in\nShusha Kotaleska, \"Make him out a pass.\u201d And this pass I have. \"How long you want the\npass? For a week?\" I said, \"Oh, No. I need the pass at least for 6 months.\u201d So he started to\njump again. Well, anyway, he gave me a pass for a month. Then he said to go out from the\nghetto. I said, \"No. I need a pass to Rzeszow.\u201d Because I had to go to Rzeszow to other\nstores. And then later when he agreed to Rzeszow. I said, '\"Rzeszow and the whole state.\u201d\nBecause I wanted to be free. So he wrote down in the whole state. And this Passieschein I\nhave. He gave it to me and he wrote down in the book 25 kilo coffee beans. Then I asked\nhim...yes...sorry.....he said to me, \"I hope you will not escape before you give me the coffee\nbeans.\u201d So I told him, \"TI will not escape because if I would lie to escape I would have\nescaped yesterday. I knew yesterday I'll be shot.\u201d So he said, \"You knew this. Who told you\nthis?\" \"Well, if somebody wanted to save my life, I wouldn't tell you now who told me this.\u201d\n\"You knew yesterday and you didn't escape? Why didn't you escape, he asked. So I said,\n\"How can I escape when I know that if I escape you will kill 10 others. So why should you\nkill 10 Jews when you had only | Jew. He said, \"You want to say you didn't escape because\nyou wanted to save the other nine?\" So I said, \"Tell me, Herr Landkommissar, wouldn't you\ndo this for your friends?\" I said, \"You would do this for your friends too. I did it for my\nfriends.\u201d He didn't say anything. So he said, \"Okay, okay, okay.\u201d Then later I asked him\nanother thing. I said, \"Now, if we made a deal, tell me why did you tell the police to shoot\nme.\u201d So he said, \"Yesterday, you went for milk.\u201d I said, \"Yes.\u201d \"And you had an argument\nwith this woman.\u201d I said, \"Yes.\u201d \"And you threatened a woman, said 'You are a communist\nand when the Russians will come in, you will be the first one to shoot her. You told her this.'\nBecause this what she told her boyfriend, and they told him. So I asked him, Herr\nLandkommissar, Do you think that I am so stupid that I should, in a public place, even if I\nwould think of it, do you think I would be so stupid to tell it openly?\" So he said, \"No, I don't\nthink so you so stupid,\" and he laughed. And I walked home. But the main thing 1s after this,\nand I told you the story about the coffee beans. The main thing when older\npeople...yal...so...the Germans if there was a grave open, the grave could never be left open\nwithout killing somebody, so he went out to the policeman. They were waiting with the\nsecretaries. He said, \"You know Vinoski\" There was a Pole Vinoski. \"You go and bring him\nand shoot him and bury him there.\u201d And he said to me, \"You wait because you'll be the one\nto bury him. So they went and brought Vinoski. Why? And they shot him, and I covered\nhim. The shots were heard. Vinoski he shot because the day before Farding had a little dog.\nAnd Vinoski went through and the dog bit him. So Vinoski complained, said the dog bit him.\nBecause the dog bit him and he complained, he had to be killed. So they brought Vinoski.\nThey killed him, and I covered him. And I went back with the shovel to the office, and there\nwas sitting this Pappek, this commander. And when he saw me putting back\nthis...uh...shovel, he looked at me. He couldn't understand it. Here he hears a shot. I had to be\nkilled and here I am but knew he knew I wasn't shot. All the boys who worked heard the\nshots, so they were sure I was shot. So there happened a thing that I cannot forget this thing.\nSo I was waiting til they will come back from work. And when they came back from work,\nthis drill sergeant drilled them that they walked like a army with the shovels on their back,\nand when I was standing there on the steps and they saw me from a distance standing, they\nwere so thrilled, so happy that I'm alive that this Lampel gave an order to them and they say\nAchtung which means attention, and they told him...it's like a review, and they start...and he\ntold them to march with their feet like the Germans, you know, like the , and they started to\nmarch through me and everybody looked at me that I'm alive. And then later everybody\nstarted to hug me and they kissed me that I'm alive. This moment every time I tell this story,\nI break down because you cannot imagine that they knew that I was shot and I'm alive. So\nthis is the story from the coffee beans. We worked in the camp, and I went every day to\nwork. And there were episodes and episodes and episodes.",
        "A: We don't have time. Okay. So. Escape. Okay. So I will not tell you those episodes because\nthey killed once 400 people. We were there, but this 1s not for now. We were there till the\n18th of November. And it started to be cold. And we knew that we will be liquidated. The\nreason why we knew that we will be liquidated when we took apart the houses, the houses\nwere from logs...from beams. So we cut the beams, and he always told us, \"Well, you better\nput them in a safe place because for the winter you will need them for fuel.\u201d Then later one\nday he came and he said, \"There will come Poles with papers and we should give them out\nthe wood.\u201d And when we saw that the wood has to be given away, so we knew that we will\nnot be there in the winter. So I started to prepare the escape. As I had papers to go out. So I\nstarted to speak to each one to convince him to escape. Some wanted, some didn't have\nmoney, some didn't have a place; some were afraid. Somehow I went to their acquaintances,\nand I made contacts and I tried to have...and I wanted to live the day when Farding will come\nin and to take us away, and from the hundred, not one will be left. And this what I wanted.\nLater, we will be shot. But to see him that we run away. Well anyway, I tried and I went and\nI convinced and the commandant was very much against me...the Jewish commandant,\nbecause he couldn't escape. And he didn't want to make a commotion because he knew that\nthe rest will be killed if somebody will escape. So we were there until November and I was\nclose...I already had 55 people to escape. I needed 45 more to escape. This was the 18th of\nNovember. It started to be cold. I come home from work. Who waits outside? Poppek. This\npolish commandant with the long mustache. He waits outside. He calls me out back, he says,\n\"Listen, you didn't listen to me last time. But you were lucky.\u201d Later, he find out how I told\nhim how I saved myself. \"You were lucky. This night we got orders to surround the ghetto\nwith the German police and to take you away.\u201d And I didn't know to kill on the spot, but to\ntake you way. This was enough. I said, \"I hope.... He said, \"I hope this time you will listen to\nme, and you will save yourself.\u201d So I said, \"Yes, I believe you.\u201d I went in and I started to tell\nit to our people. The one who wanted to escape believed me. The other didn't believe me.\nThere started to be a commotion and this and that. And I begged them, and you could see\neverybody prepared a knapsack ready to escape. Meanwhile, this commandant took two\npoliceman, put them by the doors, not to let out nobody. But so happens that the two\npolicemen were my friends who we were together and they were one of the escapees...who\nwanted to escape. So they said to him, \"Don't put us in because we gonna to escape.\u201d They\nwent out and I went to see. \"Go, go, go, go,\" and I said, \"I will be the last one.\u201d I was waiting\nthere til about...uh...2, 3 o'clock in the morning. Nothing happened. And I started to think,\n\"Maybe it's not true, and maybe they went away and the rest will be shot.\u201d But I waited. And\nabout 3 in the morning one of our boys came in and they said, \"Well, it's bad. We are\nsurrounded.\u201d But I didn't escape. I was there. I go out. Two Polish policemen were standing.\nThe German policemen were on the other side. And I go into one...I go next to one and I...I\nknew him. His name was Yashemik. And I go to him and I said, \"What...what you doing\nhere?\" He said, \"Well, we surround the camp.\u201d I said, \"You mean I cannot go out.\u201d He said,\nNo.\u201d I said, \"But I can go out.\u201d He said, \"How?\" \"If you turn around, I can go away.\u201d Before\nthis there was a fence. I went and I loosened a few boards from the fence because I wanted to\nbe ready. So he turns around the way I said it. And I was there with my friend. I pulled my\nfriend, and we jumped through the road into the fence. He didn't say anything. I was there in\nthis yard and later we had to go over the road. There were German with lights. But anyway, I\nescaped. From the 100, 55 escaped. From the 55, 30 were caught the next 2, 3 days by\n03:30:\nPoles, and they were killed. Twenty-five of us reached the woods. We had two other camps\nin our section. I told you when they made our camp, Sokolov. Before I escaped I had a\nmessenger...a Polish guy on a bicycle to go to both camps to notify them that we going to be\ntaken away. He reached one camp, that 18 escaped. The other camp I don't know and I didn't\nfind out even today, because I didn't find nobody alive from them. But from this camp, they\njoined me in the woods. One was the Charlie what I want this..... So we came and we\nescaped. When we came to the woods, I found there about 35 Jews. We had there three\nwomen, and those were Jews from the villages when they had to go to the ghetto, they never\ncame to the ghetto, and they were 1n the woods. They had peasants, food and everything. We\njoined them, and little by little, we got more Jews coming to us, who escaped from the camp,\nwho escaped from hiding. They find out about us. In the height of our strength, we were 125\nJews. And we started to buy guns. We had a few revolvers. We had two rifles. We had hand\ngrenades. And we paid a lot of money for it. Like, for instance, my gun I bought, I paid\n3,000 zlotys. The going rate was 300 slotas, but because I wanted it, but we were happy to\nget it. And little by little we started to melt. The Polish peasants started to kill us. When we\nwent for food, when we want...they made man hunts, and one time we lost lost 29 people.\nAnd there was a little boy even born in the woods. And we named him Tarzan, because he\nnever wore anything, and the father and the mother were there, and he wasn't their boy. He\nwas our boy. Everybody considered this boy as his. And we loved him so much because we\nsaw a continuation through this boy. And one night the peasants made a manhunt and they\nwere in a bunker. They were underground. He and his mother, his father was out with me\nand there we had a 70 year old woman, and one night they killed all the inhabitants of the\nbunker. They took them out and they all hacked them with axes, and they killed them all.\nAnd we come, I saw the mother laying there with her...with the little baby with the split head\nin her arms. And her father came with me. So little by little, we saw that we cannot survive\nthis way because we didn't have no connections with Russia, no connections with anybody\noutside, and then the AK started to become stronger and stronger and stronger because the\nminute Stalingrad changed, the whole fortune of war and the Germans started to lose, they\nbecame big big, they went into the woods and once they were in the woods, they started to\nhunt Jews. If they find out that there is a Jew, Jews are hiding, them came in and they killed\nthem. No Jew could join them. They didn't accept Jews. And if somebody would come to\nthem, they say, \"I want to join you,\" they would kill them right away. They were very, very\nanti-Jewish. And even they were Polish patriots, and I can never understand. We had the\nsame enemy. We fight the same enemy. Instead to join,\n03:34:\ninstead to be together, when it came to Jews, they would kill faster than the German.",
        "A: Okay. So. You know, you say slow down, it reminds me a story. My mother used to knit, to\nmake sweaters, with a needle...uh...",
        "A: Crochet. She didn't have too much wool then. So she crocheted it very fast. So they asked\nher, \"Why you rushing things.\u201d She said, \"I wanted to finish before I'm out of wool.\u201d So the\nsame thing. I want to tell you the story before we're out of time.",
        "A: Well, anyway. Okay. So we started to be in very bad [shape]. Instead of go[ing] together to\ndo something against the Germans, to destroy something, to blow up trains, our most energy\nwas to be on the watch for the peasants and for the AK. In the book, I'm describing episodes\npractically from so many who were killed, but now it's no time..",
        "A: So I will give you for instance one episode. I find out that one of my friends who went with\nme to school for seven years. His name was Fascick Augustin. His father was a very good\nfriend of my father. They were very wealthy peasants. They had an estate. But his father was\nthe president of all kinds of monopoly from the Polish government. Like kerosene, salt,\nmatches. This was Polish monopoly, and we had to buy it through him. So they became very\nfriendly. Even he was on the board of the same bank as my father was, and they became very\nfriendly. And with this boy I was friendly. We went to school, was sitting next to each other.\nI find out that this boy...this Fascick Augustin became commandant from the AK in our\nsection. Now, I don't have to explain now the AK. You know it, but if there it needs some\nexplanation, this was the underground which was directed from the London government in\nexile. And AK means in Polish \"Armia Krajowa\". It means the home army. So when I find\nout, here the Ak is killing us and Fascick is my friend and he's the commandant, the best\nthing would be to go to him to see if he wouldn't take me in with my group. This was the\ntime when our leader was killed, and I became the commandant from our group. So I said I\nwill come to him and maybe I can convince him to take us in. Not only that we will be able\nto fight the Germans, but we will be safe from them that they shouldn't kill us. I sent over a\ngirl who belonged to the organization. This is the woman whom I brought over last year.\nAnd we made an appointment, and he wanted to see me. He prepared there a place, a\nmeeting place. We came to the meeting place. This 1s complicated, how and what, when.\nBut, anyway, I came there with my brother. And he was very happy to see me. The meeting\nplace was made in a stable between the section of cows and the section of horses and there\nwhere the animals ate the hay, this was removable. We could go in that nobody could see.\nThey cut the locks and this was a small place about, I would say about 8 by 12. And then we\ncame in, and they were very happy to see us. He grabbed me and kissed me. He said we will\nkill Germans. We'll survive the war. And the next day he went to...so he said right away...we\nwere infested with lice. In the woods, we didn't have no changes. So he said, \"Take off those\nrags.\u201d And he brought me fresh underwear. I put on the fresh underwear. My brother put on\nthe fresh underwear. And then they brought us food. Then we made plans. And then his...he\nhad an older brother. The older brother was Yashik was his name. It was a little complicated.\nStashik and Yashik. There were two brothers. And his brothers also was in the underground,\nso he came in and he said to me, \"You know what? There is somebody who wants to sell a\nrevolver. You want to buy it?\" I said, \"Sure, Fred.\u201d\u2019 Because I was ready to buy. \"Go and buy\nit.\u201d And he went and he came back about an hour later, and he said, \"He doesn't want money.\nHe wants to have a suit or two suits.\u201d I said, \"No problem. I have two suits still left by\nsomebody in town. I will send for it, and I will give him. Bring me the revolver.\u201d He went.\nHe came back. He said, \"Oh, he's not home.\u201d And when he came in, I saw him holding the\nhand in his right pocket. And I had there a knapsack that I brought, and I had there shoes, not\nboots, shoes and short, half shoes. And I didn't need in the woods . I said to him, \"You know\nwhat? I have those shoes,\" and I dragged them, \"I don't need. It's the same size as you. Why\ndon't you take the shoes?\" So he went and he opened the knapsack with the left hand. And\nhis hand was filled in the pack...I didn't suspect him, but some intuition....I don't know. Then\nI asked him...he used to be contributor to the Polish underground newspaper and every\nTuesday the newspaper came out, and this was a Tuesday. I asked him, \"Tell me, Yasha,\ntoday the newspaper came out. What is there news.\u201d Because from the underground\nnewspaper, we could find out more than from the German newspaper. \"What is the news.\u201d\nHe said, \"I forgot.\u201d To me, it was something. He 1s a contributor and I ask him about the\nnews, but he says I forgot. He opens the knapsack with the left hand. He doesn't take...so\nintuition, and I was in this time already in a bundle of straw with my brother covered with a\nmilitary blanket because we want to rest. Something told me and I lifted up the blanket and I\ntook out my revolver. I always had my revolver with me even if I slept. I had a belt, and on\nthe belt I had a revolver, a hatchet, hand grenades, a flashlight, the whole arsenal I had\naround me. So I took out the revolver, and I lifted the blanket and I had a long barrel\nrevolver, and I lifted it he shouldn't see that I'm holding and I cocked the revolver. I held it\nstraight to him. In this moment and he was still standing in front of me holding his hand in\nthe package, in this moment, my brother didn't know what I'm doing. He wanted to go down.\nHe opened the blanket. And he saw and he left me exposed with my revolver pointed to him.\nThe minute he saw it he walked out. Then I said to my brother, \"What did you do?\" And he\ncouldn't...he said to me, \"Why didn't you trust them. Those are people want to save us.\u201d\n\"Well, it was done. It's too late.\u201d About 10 minutes after he left, we heard knocks on the\nwall. Later, we find out, those knocks were a signal for him to do something. Because this\nwas near the road, and on the road was a German patrol. So they had to let them and this\nlater we found out, to let them know that the German patrol was far away that he could start\nto shoot. But we didn't know about it. But when he saw me ready, he walked out. The next\nday we didn't know what to do, how to face them. We were embarrassed. But they didn't\nmention anything. I didn't mention anything. They went to town. He brought me\nmedicine. He brought me this. About 5 o'clock, they came in and he brought a German\nnewspaper and he wanted I should translate him about the front, where the front is. We\nlooked, we had a little kerosene lamp. My brother started to eat, and I looked in the paper\nand he said to me, \"Well, I lost something. Why don't you lend me your flashlight.\u201d I took\noff the flashlight, and I gave it to him. Soon as I gave him the flashlight 1t became dark. He\nturned off the kerosene lamp. And as it became dark, I hear a shots. One, two, three, four. I\ndidn't know what, when. And I fell down. I fell down. I was [old you see??], and my head\nstarted to spin around. In this moment...you see, I am telling you this...this takes a few\nseconds, a few minutes maybe. But this took a split of a second and I fell. And I fell down. I\nsaid, \"This is it.\u201d They took us in to be shot. But I'm glad that somebody shot me from\nbehind because I was always afraid to be caught by the Germans alive. I didn't want they\nshould torture me. So we always had a rule in our unit that if the last bullet we cannot shoot,\nthe last bullet we had to leave for ourself. But here, I fell down. I said, \"Fine, this is it. We\nwent through so much. The whole family doesn't live. Everybody I loved doesn't live. It's\nenough.\u201d And while I was laying there, I was thinking...but I'm still alive. Why should he\nshoot me? Why shouldn't I kill him? Laying on the floor, somehow I took out my revolver,\nand it was dark, and I wanted to put in my index finger to pull the trigger, it was like a piece\nof wood. I got a bullet, he shot me, I got three bullets in my neck and went through. I...then\nwhen I caught myself I got a bullet here, and the bullet traveled through the finger, ripped the\nfinger apart, but didn't touch the bone. So when I wanted to put in this finger, I couldn't\nbecause it didn't move. Now [1.e. today] in winter, I cannot move this finger. In winter, it gets\nstiff. But during the day ??.. Right away, I had enough. I put in the other finger. I put in this\nfinger. And it was dark. I shot once in the air, and I had a big caliber. So from the shot, I\ncould see from the glare of it, and I could see this brother standing in the doorway because it\nwas very small where they made the extension the door to go in. So I still saw him. It went\nso fast that I still saw him standing pointing at his revolver to me. It went so fast. So when I\nshot once, I saw him. Right away, I shot him the third to him and right the third time. By the\nthird time because I didn't know that I will hit him with the first bullet. When I shot him the\nfirst time I saw him already laying stretched out. With my second bullet, one I shot in the air,\nwith the second bullet, I pierced his heart and I killed him. And by the third bullet, I saw him\nstretched out. When his brother saw what happened because he saw by the glare the same\nthing as I and his brother start to shot to my brother. When he saw what happened he ran out.\nAnd this was an emergency door. When he run out I shot after him, and I hit him in the\nspine, and he fell down. Now we are naked. My brother didn't know what's going on. So he\nstarted to yell to them, \"What you playing with firecrackers? Because he couldn't understand,\nit went so fast. So I said to him, \"No.\u201d And we had our things on the attic, and there was no\nladder to the attic. But we had to climb through the beams. Took the revolver in my teeth, I\nstarted to climb and I wanted to take boots. I wanted to take the medicine, and also the most\nimportant thing I wanted to take, I had a diary what my sister started the first day of the war.\nAnd every day she wrote in the diary. But because we came to him, I figured I will be able to\nsit and I will enter for a few days. So I wanted to get the diary. But in the dark, scared, you\n[are] hit, I don't know where I'm hit. So when I took one boot out of the 2? I took this and\nthat. I left everything. I jumped out. I called my brother. He wasn't there anymore. What\nhappened? He find a door. He ran out the door. And his friends, there\n03:46:\nwere about 6 friends waiting outside. They grabbed him. When I came in, I remember I\nstepped on this dead body. It was so soft. So I came in...in the openings. I saw a few guys.\nAnd I knew the guys. They were my school friends. They're holding my brother. And a few,\nstanding...laying over this other brother was wounded. So I was standing in the doorway. I\nstill had three bullets in my revolver, and I said to them, \"If you don't let him go this minute,\nthree of you will be killed.\u201d I said, \"I never miss. I have three bullets left in the revolver.\nThree will be killed.\u2019 And the minute I said it they let him go and they run away. I remember\nI even still had enough brain, I went back and I took out from the hand of this dead guy his\nrevolver. And I said to my brother let's run we ran, it was the 18th of January. Two yards\nhigh snow. All we had is our underwear. No shoes. Nothing! And we run and we didn't\nknow where. We had to run up the hill. We had to cross a river. And in a village, and this\nwas about 6 o'clock in the afternoon. In the village when one dog starts to bark, all dogs\nbark, so you could hear not one, the whole village barking. And you could [see] lights and\nnaturally, we are running. We don't know where we are. We're going up the hill. The snow\nwas so frozen. From the moon you could see millions of diamonds in the snow. Everything\nwas so sparkling. We run. We didn't stop. And we run, I would say about a kilometer to the\nfirst house. We stopped at a house. I look at my brother. My brother looks at me. And here it\nwas, blood running from my neck, and the blood was, we didn't know what happened\nbecause the blood from the cold, it got thick and it became clustered, but it still was running.\nThe hand was swollen. We could see a trail in the snow from our walking from drops of\nbloods. I said, \"Well, if somebody will come, they will come and they will catch us.\u201d Well,\nand if it's a snowy terrain in the winter, you don't know where you are, because everything\nlooks the same. I said, \"Where are we?\" We don't know. This was 6 o'clock. But one thing, I\nknew that every 6 o'clock a autobus a bus came from Rzeszow to Kolbuszova at 6 o'clock. I\nsaid, \"If we would be lucky, and if we would see the bus coming I will know the direction\nwhere to go.\u201d And as I said it, we saw from a distance two reflectors from the bus. It's not\nlike here you have thousands of cars. There was only one bus that came only once a day.\nAnd so, more or less I figured out that I will go this way and there was a house that I knew\nthis house, and this peasant was friendly. I said, \"If we would be lucky, and if I would hit this\nhouse, we would be saved.\u201d Now imagine if peasants will see us in the middle of the winter,\ntwo people naked without shoes. Well, anyway, we started to go down, so I had my two\nrevolvers. I had everything on me. I said to my brother, \"If something will happen, you\nshould know I will open the hand grenade and we're killing each other.\u201d He had his revolver.\nAnd we went down and it so happens that I hit the house I wanted to hit. Exactly 1t was, this\nwas a Sure thing. We run up here, and this house was here. So I had to go like this. I hit it\nexactly and I knew the house. And from there I knew exactly how to go back to the woods. It\ntook me a whole night. I reached our friends about 5 in the morning. Now on the way, we\nstopped...but this is not for now...I was wounded. I didn't know what. I went to a doctor. The\ndoctor, you see, the doctor I went to [was from] a different section because I didn't...and I\nhad to go right away he shouldn't find out that something happened to those two guys. I went\nto him and he checked me. He said, \"Here the bullets went through. It was a small caliber.\nBy here the bullets went through. He gave me an injection against blood poison. I came back\nto our group. The Germans heard the shots. And this was the patrol. When the patrol came,\nthey shot. So they told them a story that bandits came. They wanted money, and they didn't\ngive them the money, so they shot them. And they took it for an answer. The next day they\nmade a report to the police. When the police came to investigate. And the police didn't take\nthis answer. They started to search. And they find this little room, and they find the wall\ncovered with blood when I tried to climb. And they went upstairs and they found then my\nboots, they find there the...the case with the medicines, with\n03:51:\nthe instruments. And they find my sister's diary. And they knew it is not bandits. And they\ntook out the second boy, and they shot him right there. So the second boy was also shot. The\nGermans finished him off. This was an episode. Now this happened. Then later it was very\nwell known. Then later they caught me. They gave me poison. This is a long story. But this\nepisode, I couldn't show my face. Everybody knew about it, they gave a price on my head in\nthe underground paper. So once I went to a peasant to a different village. And he knew that\nI'm Jewish because the other Jew took me over to buy something. So he said in the papers it\nwas that they will pay 100,000 zlotys for my head. So he said to me, \"Listen, there is that\nboy here.\u201d He said the name Salsitz. \"I would like to help him because I knew his father.\nMaybe you know where he is. Tell him to come to me. I will give him bread. I will give him\nbutter. I would like to help him. I want to save this boy.\u201d And I knew the reason why he tells\nme. So I said, \"Listen, if I would know where he is, I could get the 100,000 zlotys. Why\nshould I tell you? I want to know myself.\u201d He asked me about me because he wanted to\nmake and to get this money. So this went on for a few weeks til I joined the Ak. Well I saw I\ncouldn't, so I joined the AK in a different section, and I had papers and they accepted me\nwhen everything was healed.",
        "A: Okay. Alright. Before I left this camp. The first day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New\nYear, no, the second day of Rosh Hashanah. The Jews in 1942, they killed in our town\nand(?) Novasans they got together people from Rzeszow who wanted to run away to\nHungary. There was a place,Bokhnia, that they made false papers for Jews and Poles, and\nthey went to Hungary, and Hungary was easier to survive. And they caught those people,\nthey didn't catch those people. They caught this girl who was their runner, and but once I'm\ntelling you this, I want to tell you about this girl. I think she should be remembered.",
        "A: See, this girl was the runner, and she was caught on the list of 45 people with false papers,\nthat they should run away to Romania, and she was caught. And she was tortured. She was\nkilled. The Germans knew those people because they had the documents. And they arrested\nthose people, and they brought them to us in jail when we were in the camp. During the night\nI find out about it, and I went to the jail, and through a window, they told me those things\nwhat happened to them, that this girl was caught. But there 1s a other list of 200 that she had\nto prepare documents. They didn't know if they got the list. But if they got the list, they will\npick up the 200 too. What was necessary is to go to Rzeszow which was 31 kilometers and\ngo to Rzeszow and to warn the people that they are arrested and they should do something\nand to hide. So soon as they told me, I told...I took the wagon with the horse what Farding\ngave me to bring the old junk to Rzeszow and I always had it ready packed because I never\nknew when I will have to go in a hurry. This was at night, and I took the horse and I went to\nRzeszow, 31 kilometers, because even if the Germans would catch me, I had a pass to go and\nI went officially because I had to bring those things. So I went to Rzeszow and I came into\nthe ghetto with these things, and I had to notify someone I know to notify that they were\narrested. And they are worrying about the 200 other people. And they told me who to\ncontact. I contact this person, and he notified the 200 people they should go into hiding who\nwere on the list. But what the Germans did, they came and they couldn't find nobody from\nthe 200, so they took 200 other Jews, and they brought them to us with them and in this day,\nthe second day of Rosh Hashanah, they killed in Novasans(??). this village not far from us,\nthey killed 400 Jews. They brought Jews from Hutta Kaminski (??), from ?? . Young girls,\nbeautiful girls, Jews who had scabs, cuts, and they reported they cannot go to work, so they\ntook them and they killed them. Now there are so many details, but it is not for now. But you\nask me about the other details.",
        "A: So when they killed the 400 people, I became very hysterical and I went into a Polish\nwoman, was very friendly with my father. This was the woman I gave all the merchandise\nwhen I was left, when they took away our people to Rzeszow, so I gave her the merchandise\nover the fence. So I went to her and started to cry very hysterical. I said, \"I want to live. I\nwant to live. Do something. Do something.\u201d She said, \"What can I do.\u201d She said, \"What can\nI do?\" I said, \"I need papers. I want to run away.\u201d She said, \"I can help you out with it. lama\nvery good friend of the Monseigneur, from the Catholic Church...in Polish Dekan (dean). I\nwill ask him if he can give you papers.\u201d So I told her, \"You know, I had a friend who went\nwith me to school. His name was ?.. He looked a little like me. And he went me to school.\nAnd he was killed in 1939. He was in the Polish army. He was killed. Maybe he can give me\nhis paper, and then if there would be a picture we look very much alike.\u201d She went to the\nMonseigneur, and the Monseigneur gave me a birth certificate which I have with me, which\nthey made a copy of it. And he gave me this birth certificate. With this birth certificate, I\ncould show that that I was ?.. So through this girl, she was a runner between two groups. So\nshe went to the group which was farther away from my town and she made a contact and\nwith her I went and I was accepted and she introduced me to their commandant, she was\nvery friendly with and he liked me. He took me in, and so then I became a member of this\ngroup. And this was a very important group because this group was not like from people\nwho belonged to the underground, and they were staying in their homes. This was a group\nwho was a combat group in the woods. And I was very happy to be with them because with\nthem, we destroyed police stations, we blew up trains. We did so many things because they\nwere a force. You see when I was in the woods as a Jew, I only could go out when there was\na blizzard, when there was a rain. I was a fugitive. Everybody would give me out. I have to\nhide the gun. But when I was with them, I was a hero. I came out to the village with the rifle\nopen. I put in a beret with a Polish eagle. I put on a band with a white and red as a Polish\npatriot. The girls even waited for us, to kiss us. The people used to bring us vodka and food.\nI was the same man, fighting the same enemy. But here because I was a Jew, I was fugitive.\nAnd here because I was Pole, I was a hero. So with them, it gave me the opportunity to take,\nand every night there was some action because they were so strong and they could do it. And\nwith them I had the opportunity to do it.\n03:59",
        "A: Okay. But this way if you can make a decision that is a few from the woods, I would like to\ntell you a few episodes how we made...uh...a\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: Right. I want to go back when we were quite strong yet in the woods with our Jewish group.\nNow, our leader was a Jew who was forester, which is very unusual for a Jew to be this\nprofession. Was a very intelligent man, but mostly he was a forester because he specialized\nin artificial raising [of] fish. He had artificial lakes...not artificial...had man made lakes, and\nthey raised carps, and this belonged to a very rich Jew in Rzeszow and his name was Bank,\nand the forester's name was Pinya. Well, anyway, and Froelich, Pinya Froelich, and he was\nthe organizer of this group who was there before I came and he still was our leader. Then\nlater he was killed, and also it was a very unfortunate thing how he was killed. Uh...He could\nbe saved, but...uh... because the men who surrounded the house were peasants from his\nvillage, and he didn't to use his gun, he didn't want to shoot, because they were his friends.\nThey were people who he knew all his life, so he didn't want to harm them. But nevertheless,\nthey took him with his wife, and they took him to a barn and they killed him. After this I\nbecame, I took over his place, and I became the leader. Now, we wanted to do something\nagainst the Germans. It was very hard for us because our main thing was to protect ourselves\nfrom the Poles who were so hostile towards us. There was, as I told you before, the Poles\nused to get skim milk for free, but there was a factory not far from the woods when in, a milk\nfactory, and all the peasants used to bring their milk and there they produced cheese, butter,\nand this was sent to Germany. And from the whole section, all the Poles used to bring their\nmilk there. So we thought that we want to disrupt these things. I had there a man that I knew,\nand he was working there. And he gave me all the information when the work starts, stops,\nwho is the guard, and how. So one dark night six of us went over there and we disarmed the\nguard, and we went in and we destroyed the whole place. It took us about an hour. We broke\nall the equipment, and there was special equipment brought from Germany, and all the\nmachines where they used to produce the cheese and the butter, and everything was\ndestroyed. After everything was destroyed we packed our knapsacks full of cheese, that we\nhad it enough for about 2, 3 months and we left. The next day the Germans came and they\nsurrounded the village, and they arrested some Poles. They accused them that they did some\nsabotage, but then later they let them out because they had proof that some partisans, they\ndidn't know that we did it, but some partisans came and they did the damage. And it was\nquite a big damage. It was a big help for the peasants, because for months they didn't have to\ngive the milk. They didn't know what to do with the milk because there was not a facility to\nmanufacture the cheese and the butter. But then later, they rebuilt 1t and it by them 3 months\nand they started again. But this was a very big satisfaction what we did. Also, once a week\nthey collected the cows from the peasants. Each calf when it was born, they put in a ear ring\non the calf, and this was registered. And eventually they had to give over the cow to the\nGermans and they also had an evidence how much milk the peasant has to bring in from the\ncow. They delivered the cows, once a week they were driven or they were taken to the\nrailroad station so we always waited when they were taken to the railroad station they\nchased...not by cars, but on foot. So we waited on the edge of the forest and we lured always\none or two or three cows into the woods, and we took them away. So this was a very big help\nfor us because 1n the winter, usually, we sold some cows and then we we killed one so we\nhad meat enough for weeks. So this was also a way of trying to do some damage. And, there\nwas an other case that we were in a place that there was a search for Poles, but not for Jews\nanymore, but the search for Poles for taking the Poles to Germany. And we were in the attic\nand we were hidden in the hay, and they searched even the attic, but they didn't find us, and\nthey left the house and they took the owner from this place that we were hiding. He didn't\nknow we were there. And then he escaped, so in the evening a Polish policeman came to\ntake him back. And we saw it, so we waited for him outside, and we killed him. We took\naway his gun, his rifle, his bicycle. So those were things that we tried to do as much as\npossible. But when I joined the AK, then it was a different story because the Ak was openly\nmore loyal, in the village they were open and they could do a lot of things. They were very\nstrong. They received drops from planes, ammunition, money, medicine, and guns,\neverything, from England. They used to drop in special assigned places in the woods, and\nthey had all those things. So we did other things like there was a police station in Glogel for\ninstance. So we surrounded the police station one night and we disarmed the policemen.\nThey were not killed, but we took away everything they had there, rifles and guns, revolvers.\nWe took it away, and we completely demolished the police station. Then there was a very\nimportant railroad line which went from Rzeszow to Senjisuv (??). This was not far from the\nforest what I described you before. So a few times those railroad tracks\nwere blown up, and the supplies... It was not so much the supplies, but in this time the\nGermans started to pull out a large quantity of soldiers in the army from the eastern part in\nPoland. And the railroads were blown up with the soldiers, and this we did about 5, 6 times,\nthose railroad lines, which was easy to do because the railroad lines were not actually\nguarded so much and we were not afraid for peasants. There was once an ammunition dump\nand not far from Rzeszow...before Rzeszow...were big forest, dense forests. So once we went\nover there and this was everything with the Polish AK and we blew up one ammunition\ndepot there. The Germans later retaliated, but this group we knew we did it, so the same\nnight we disappeared in the other section and actually, they didn't catch nobody. But they\nretaliated towards the local population. They didn't know exactly who did it. Now one\nepisode I want to tell you this is what we did on our own. But I have to go back to that camp\nwhere we were after the destruction, after taking away our people from our town when we\nwere in this labor camp in Kolbuszowa when we destroyed the houses of the ghetto. So we\nwere working there, a Sharfuehrer came from the SS with a Polish boy, which he was his\nadjudant, his helper. And this Sharfuehrer was very vicious and we knew about him that he\nkilled and he beat and always he was always drunk. He always was red in his face and nose\nwas like...from a drunkard. And he came to us while we were working, and it so happened\nthat I loaded in this time some furniture. And I had a mirror in my hand, a big large mirror.\nHe said to me, \"Look in this mirror.\u201d So I looked in his mirror. He said, \"Look what good\ncannon fodder you are, because this what you will be.\u201d\u2019 And I didn't answer, because you\ncouldn't answer this man. And he came to see what we are doing, and there was one of my\nfriends. His name was Motek Weiss. He was from Krakow, a very nice boy, fragile boy. And\nhe said to his adjudant, his name was Volstick, a Polish boy from the neighboring village and\nhe said to him to take a 2 by 4 and to start to beat this boy. And he started to beat him. He\nfell down. We put him on his feet. He beat him again. And he beat him so that he just was a\npiece of black flesh lying on the floor. And later we brought him back to our barracks, and\nthe same day he died. And just he did it for fun. Uh...Later, he pointed out I should go with\nhim. So I thought he was going to give me the same treatment as with this boy, but I couldn't\nsay anything so I went with them and he said to me that he wants to get some brass. He\nneeds brass. And we had brass from the old houses, from old candlesticks, and in one room\nin this warehouse we kept only brass. I took him to show him the brass. While we went there\nto see the brass, we went through a room where there was paper collected. Now they were\nmostly old books. You know, by Jews, we don't throw away books. Books were always\nsaved. We put them on the attic of the synagogue and if it was full, so we took the books into\nthe cemetery and we wrapped them in prayer shawls, and they were buried like human\nbeings. So in this time when we cleaned out the attic from the synagogue, there was full of\nold books. Books that were hundred, two hundred years old. They were yelllow. We piled\nthem (up). We put them in this room. It was stacks till the attic. And he came in and he start,\nhe always had such a hoarse voice like a drunkard, and he asked me what's here. I told him\npaper, books. \"What kind of books?\" I told him, \"Religious books. Jewish books.\u201d And the\nbooks were stacked on both sides of the room that in the middle was just a passageway. And\nfrom the top there was a little window. And the window, through the window, rays of the sun\ncame in. And because there were books, old books there was a lot of dust, and the rays...the\nray illuminated the dust that you could see through this window came like a column of light\non the one spot. And in this moment, it reminded me that this column is the same column as\nGod showed to the Israelites when they left Egypt so they should know their way in the\ndesert. So in the evening, in the night, he had a column of light; in the day a column of dust.\nAnd this was to show them the way how to go. So in this moment, I remembered from the\nBible, and I said, \"This is the same column as God had it when the Israelites left Egypt.\u201d And\nthis Scharfuehrer s, did everything what God forbid probably the way he killed and he saw\nthe spot from the ray on the floor, and he stood in the spot and he looked up and he started to\nyell with his hoarse voice. And he said, \"Yehovah, Yehovah. Wo bist Du.\u201d Means,\n\"Yehovah, Yehovah, Where are you? Yehovah, Warum hilfst Du nicht Deine Kinder?.\n\"Y ehovah, why don't you help your children?\" And he looked at me, and he said to me,\n\"You see, Your Yehovah is old. Your Yehovah is dead. He cannot even hear what I am\nsaying. Now, here you are. What we are doing to the Jews, and he doesn't do anything.\u201d And\nhe spat on the floor, and he walked out. In this moment, I was sure that God would punish\nhim. That God will make him lame or something will kill him. After all, he said something\nbad about my God. Maybe I had doubts of my God in this time that he didn't help us, but I\nthink I had a right to have doubts because I was a Jew and I believed in God. But he was a\nstranger, and he had no right to insult my God, and I was very angry. And I said to myself, \"I\nhave to survive the war. Even if I have to kill this guy, because he insulted my God.\u201d This\nwas in this time when I was in the camp. Naturally, there was a thing that I knew that it could\nnever happen. How could I do it? But..still I had in my mind. Two years later...was it two\nyears later?...almost two years later, a year and a half later I was in the woods, I found out\nthat this man., this Sharfuehrer, is in charge of Polish farms in the section where it was\nPrzeworsk (\u00b0?). Przeworsk, the section I described before, belonged to the SS and he was in\ncharge of the farms. Because they didn't want to have Poles in this section, so they chased\nout all the Poles because this was where they perfected the V-1, V-2 rockets. But they\nwanted to have something from the farms, so the farmers used to go over there to work, and\nat night they went away. And he was in charge of it. And I found out about it, and I was told\nalso that every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, they have like drinkings with girls, playing\ncards, dancing in the substation from this Przeworsk camp. Now we had in our group two\nJews who came from this vicinity. One was a manager in an estate, which knew very well\nthe village and there was another one from this vicinity. And also the father of the girl who\nhelped me join the A, her name was Stashka Hodora. She married later and her\nmarried...marriage name is Bargike . She lives now in Warsaw, and 2 years ago I brought her\nover for a visit. So this Stashka's father used to go and he used to work in the house where\nthey had those gatherings every Saturday and every Sunday. And he was like a worker there.\nHe took care of the horses. He took care of... So through him I find out that he takes care on\nall those things on this farm. And he told me and I had in my mind that something has to be\ndone. And I approached our group a few times and I said, this was an obsession with me that\nI had to do something towards him, but always my friends told me, \"We cannot do it. We're\nnot strong enough and to go and make a raid on SS group and we will be killed.\u201d And I gave\nup the idea. When I left the AK and I came back, I still find out that through this Hodora,\nthat he works there and this man is still there in charge. Then I find out that not far from us\nthere was a group of Russian partisans. You see, the front came closer to us, so also the\npartisans came closer to us. I find out where they are, and I went over to them, and I\nintroduced myself that I am a leader from a partisan group. I didn't tell them that we were\nJews because we never knew how they will accept us, and there were a lot between the\nRussians...there were a lot of Ukrainians also. And so I didn't say that we were Jews, but we\nwere group and I have an idea that I want they should help us. And I told them that I want to\nmake a raid on\n04:18:\nthis substation, and I explained to him why and that this man is there in charge. He was very\nbad. He killed a lot of people, and we can have a good job killing SS men. And the head, the\ncommandant of this group liked the idea, and it took us about two weeks. He gave me two\nfrom his group, and I went over with...with them at night to see the roads, to see the\ntopography, and to have the preparations how to do it. And when we came back, we picked\nout a dark night and we had all the information from this Jan Hodora. Him I told what we're\ngoing to do. I wasn't afraid that he would betray us because this was against the Germans,\nand he hated the Germans. And this night, it was a Saturday night, we didn't have horses.\nThey had horses. So I took from my group, I took five people. And they gave us 15 people\nand 5 of them took us as passengers on their horses, and everything was planned and we\ncame over. Now five of us wore German uniforms. I wore a German uniform, and four from\nthe Russian partisans, and they gave me a submachine guns for us, and we came to the place.\nAnd we cut the telephone wires, and we sneaked through the front, they were illuminated,\nthe windows where they were sitting, playing, dancing. They had girls. And we started to\nthrow in grenades through the front windows. And meanwhile, the other people came from\nboth sides and from the rear. Now in the beginning it was a resistance. They started to shoot\nback from revolvers because they didn't expect something like this. And later their firing got\nless and less and after it stopped, we burned the house where they were, and then later we\ntook away the horses. They had horses. There was a car in the front, and there were a few\nmotorcycles. We burned the car. We burned the motorcycles. We took the horses, and we\nleft. Not one of them, we estimated that were about 35 SS men in this time. When we\nlooked in the windows, more or less we estimated so many, not one escaped. Because it was\nsuch a surprise attack. And from us, we came back. All of us came back and nothing\nhappened to us. Now when we came back and it was a wonderful feeling when I was there,\nand they gave me a submachine gun and I could shoot and shoot and shoot and I didn't feel\nanymore in this time like a fugitive. I felt very, very good about myself, but we knew that\nsomething will happen that they would be seeking reprisals. Right away the Russian group\nleft. They went to an other place. They went more north. We disappeared. We were in this\ntime...our group...with the five...we disappeared. The next day the Germans came and they\nknew that this Russian group, Russian partisan group did it, and they surrounded the forest,\nand they searched and searched, but they didn't find nobody. They didn't suspect the native\nPoles of helping us, so this was a very good feeling to do something now in this time and\nwhen I came back, so I said to myself I didn't do it so much for myself as I did it for insulting\nmy God and this was a very, very good feeling. Then later the rumors, not the rumors, the\ntalk between the people, they told the story that this guy was killed in this raid, which we\nsaw him through the window anyway. But he was well known also. Also this Scharfuehrer,\nwho was so vicious, he also spoke Polish. For this reason, if\nthey were like mixtures, they were even more vicious. And the reason they used him because\nhe spoke Polish. He could hire the peasants. He could work with them. They should work in\nthe fields, and he was in charge of this. So those were the things that we did that it was very\ngratifying. We wanted to do more, but we were hampered by the Polish population. And I\nhave to tell you what happened the last night. This was the last night before the liberation.\nNow people ask you survived; it's a miracle or you are lucky or something. A thousand times\nyou could be lucky. Somehow you outwitted the Germans. Sometimes you made the right\ndecision. Instead to go left, you went right. You had to be quick. But if one time it didn't\nwork, you didn't have a second chance. The one time didn't work and that's it. Now we don't\nknow from all the people who were hiding and hiding and how many times they did things to\nthe Germans. We don't know because they are not here to tell the story. Now, if I will not be\nhere now from the whole group that we were, hundred twenty five people, from the whole\ngroup when we were liberated, only six were alive, from the hundred twenty five. And the\nrest were killed, very few by the Germans, mostly were killed by the Poles. Because the\nGermans didn't venture into the woods. And mostly by the end six were alive. Now from the\nsix, two from my people before the war, they were Rabbinical students and they were very\nnice boys and they were very capable, went back to our town, to Kolbuszowa, because they\nsaid we are now free. We are liberated. We'll come back. We'll be considered heroes. We\nsurvived the war. So they went back 3 days after the liberation. Two were very prominent\npeople from my town Poles, one was a Director of Internal Revenue. His name was Kissel.\nThe other one had a bus company...had buses going. His name was Shilenski. Took them to\nthe cemetery and they killed them. Three days after the liberation! So imagine going through\nso much, going through camps and ghettos, losing the whole family, starvation, and torture,\nbeing 2 years in the woods, and somehow they made it. They survived the war. And the\nGermans were gone. Here we are. There is already liberty. Now the Poles supposed to be\nour......we lived with them for thousand years. Now they took the two boys and they killed\nthem. Why I will never know. Why? What did they harm somebody? And they were killed.\nSo from all our group, there were four left. My brother and I and two brothers who were also\nfrom the village, and they survived. Six months later, one of them was poisoned so he died.\nMy brother died here about 15 years ago. The second brother went to Israel and he died\nthere. So I'm the only one who survived from the whole group. Now I have to speak in the\nname of all of them because nobody can tell any stories. They are dead. So my responsibility\nis to tell their stories. Now I'm preparing episodes of everybody, the circumstances how he\nwas killed. And I remember more or less about everyone who was killed, how he was killed\nand when and by whom. So I'm preparing stories for each one how he was killed from the\nhundred twenty six people. Looking back on all those things, we cannot understand how a\npeople like Polish people could do a thing like this. I want to tell you then the last night and I\nwent through so many things. I didn't tell you how I was poisoned because there 1s not too\nmuch time about it.",
        "A: So I want to tell you...I want to tell you about this last night. If we will have time, we'll come\nback. The last night I was back with my with my group. There were only six left of us. So I\nwent to the same peasant Hodora what he gave me the information, and his daughter was...\nSo I went to see how the situation is. Because the front was already by us. The Germans\nwent back and back, and we knew that we could hear the detonations and the shootings and\ncame closer and closer. When we came to Hodora that night nobody was home. The house\nwas empty. It was open. It was empty. The cows were not there. So we understood. Because\nthey are afraid, the front comes close...near, so they went into the woods because to be safer.\nNobody was there, so we decided to stay over the next day and the next night we'll see what\nto do. Now there was in\nthe barn was full with hay because this was after the harvest, so we buried ourselves in the\nhay. During the night we could hear that a unit of calvary is going through the road, and the\nroad was very close to the house because you could hear horses, the chains ringing. And then\na few came in the yard and they came into the barn where we were hiding. And they started\nto take out hay for the horses. Now we didn't know how much hay they would take out\nbecause if there could be a lot of horses, they could empty the barn, and then later we'll be\nexposed, but as they took out the hay, we buried ourselves more and more and more. Then\nlater we heard them speaking that this night they will go. Then later we came out and they\nwere already gone, so I said to my friend, Leiba, I said, \"We cannot stay here because this is\nthe territory that the German front is establishing. We have to go over to the east and to cross\nover probably the Russians\nare on the side.\u201d So we went to a place where there was a clearing. This side the Germans\nwere, and the other side the Russians. And we were...this was a clearing. So I said, \"We have\nto move through the clearing.\u201d So he found a little brook and with this brook we started to\ncrawl to go over to the other side. But somebody spotted us and they started to shot on us\nfrom both sides. You see when one side started to shoot, so the other side started to shoot. So\nwe knew here are the Germans, and here are the Russians and we're on the middle. We\njumped out from this little brook and they were haystacks and we buried ourselves in the\nhaystacks. Then from a distance we saw a horse with two riders on it galloping, going about\n200 yards away from us, coming from one side of the forest to the other. Now this man, he\nwas from a village, and he said to me, \"I cannot go out and ask him what's going on because\nthey know me. But they don't know you. Go and ask them. And I know those peasants.\u2019 He\neven told me the name. His name 1s Poslusne. He said, \"I know them because they are from\nmy village. I even recognize the horse because I sold them the horse before I left the\nvillage.\u201d And he recognized. Well, I thought he knows. I came out from the haystack and I\nrun after them, and I started to yell, Panie Poslusne. And this was at night and they, finally,\nthey heard me. And they slowed down. When they slowed I came closer to them. Now I saw\nit wasn't Poslusne. It was two SS man, on one horse. And this was from this unit of the\nhorses what they sent them over as a patrol to go to the other side to find out what's going on.\nHere I'm standing there close to them. The liberation is almost here. Freedom is almost here.\nAnd I am standing. And they jumped out from the horse, both of them, took out their\nrevolvers, pointing at me, and I looked like a peasant. I was barefoot. And I had a jacket, a\nlong jacket covered, and underneath the jacket I had my arsenal. I had two revolvers, with a\nbayonet, with a hatchet, with a flashlight, bullets, everything I had underneath, but it was\ncovered. And when they jumped down, I didn't know what to say...what to start. I couldn't\nshow them I speak German, because Polish people didn't speak German. So I started to yell\nand to cry in Polish and I told them what will I do. My wife and my children went to the\nwoods with the cows. Now they say the Russians are coming and there are rumors the\nRussians are raping the women and killing the children, taking away the cows. What will I\ndo? What will I do? Please help me. Help me. And I said to them, \"We are four or five years\nwith the Germans. Nothing happened to us.\n04:31:\nNow the Russians are coming, and there are so many rumors. And then I figured I'm yelling\nto them. I'm crying, but they don't understand. They are Germans. Then one of them started\nto translate in German to the other one what I am saying. You see, you say luck, you say\nmiracles. Everything had to be, otherwise... So he started to translate. When I see that he's\ntranslating, so I started to yell a little louder and cry a little more and tell him a little story\nbecause he understood. And then he stopped me and he spoke to me in a very, very broken\nPolish. Probably he was from Silesia, from Posen, something. So he in very broken Polish,\nhe ask me if I am from this village. I said, Yes.\u201d So he said to the other one in German,\nwhich I understood, he said, \"Good, we don't have to go to the other side,\" because they were\nafraid to go deeper because they will be killed because they knew the Russians are there. So\nhe said, \"We will take him to our commandant, and let him question him. Maybe he can give\nus the information we want to know. So he told me in Polish not to worry. They will take me\nfor questioning and then later they will go with me to find my wife and the children. Well, he\nsaid it. So then they said to me to go in front of them. And I went in front of them. And they\nboth put back their revolvers. And they had rifles on their back and they climbed on their\nhorse. They went back on the horse and I started to walk slowly in front of them and they\nbehind me. Now I started to realize, ...here the whole war I went through. Here the liberation\ncoming. Now I have to be shot, because if they will take me over there. Now listen, if they\nwill open my vest, they will see. How can I survive? So what...what should I do? I have to\ndo something. I always\n04:33\nhad a long barrel revolver in my belt. I never had it in my holster. I had it always ready. So\nby going in the front so a little, I put in my hand and I cocked the revolver. I pulled it out\nslowly, and suddenly I turned around. In a split second I emptied it and I shot seven bullets\nin them and they fell down dead from the horse. Because I knew I had to. And they fell\ndown. The minute I started to shoot on them so bullets, millions of bullets from both sides\ncame in my direction because the Germans were here. The Russians were here. They didn't\nknow what's going on. So they started to shoot. So I took the horse as a shield and I started to\nwalk slowly toward the Russian side, and I call...yal...I bent down, and first thing I took out\nthe revolvers again. This was very important. I put them in my belt to take away, and I went\nto the side from the Russians. I was about hundred feet away from the forest. A few jumped\nout and they surrounded me and they said in Russian I should lift my hands. So they spoke to\nme in Russian. I was very relieved and I came in and they asked me what happened. So I\ntold them what happened, that the two Germans and I shot them and the revolvers. First\nthing they relieved me...they took away everything I had, and they said, \"Let's wait til our\ncommandant comes.\u201d About a half a hour later, the commandant came, a young fellow on a\nhorse and he asked me, so I told him. He asked me, \"Who are you.\u201d I said to him, \"I have a\ngroup of partisans in the other side. Again I didn't say Polish or Jewish because you never\nknew because even then they killed a lot of Jews. And those I didn't know they're Ukrainian\nor Russians, so they and I spoke a little Russian because I was in Russia a few months. He\nwas very surprised that I speak Russian. So when I told him the whole story except , first they\ntook the horses. Oh, I like the horse. This will be my horse. They took away. So I said, \"I'm\ngoing back for my group. I have there a group about 60 people.\u201d He said, \"Don't go back to\nthe group, because if you will come back they will probably shoot you, all of you on the way\ncoming out from the German line.\u201d He said, \"You are already here. Stay with us. We\nare...we accepting you. We will take you in. Come with me.\u201d So I even told them, \"When I\ngo back to show the people that that I met Russian partisans, why don't you give me your\nsubmachine guns.\u201d It's called in Russian papetsha. \"Why don't you give me your papetsha,\nand I will go up and I will show them that I have met the Russians.\u201d He said, \"Oh, no. When\nyou come back to me, you get it from me. But to make sure, to show them that you met the\nRussians, he took off his hat and he took off the star with the sickle and and hammer and\nsaid, \"Show them this and this will be proof enough.\u201d And he said, \"Go and bring them. We\nwill wait til morning for you.\u201d He asked me, \"How long will it take to bring them over.\u201d I\nsaid, \"Maybe 2 hours.\u201d He said, \"That will be enough time. Bring them over.\u201d Now when he\ntold me this and when I walked away I was sure he doesn't believe me the story. Because he\nwas too lenient and he let me go. Now why should I go back? Why should I be so stupid go\nback to the German line and bring over people? He probably thought that I am sent out from\nthe German side to find out if there are people, how many, and I was sure that the minute I\nwould turn around, when I went away, he took away my two revolvers from the two\nGermans but he gave me back mine. And I was sure that I would turn around that in the back\nI will be shot. So when I started I walk like I was walking like on air. I couldn't move my\nlegs, but I start and farther I went I was more sure for myself and when I was already about\n200 feet so I figured well now maybe, I'm safe. They will not shoot me. And then I started to\nrun. I run back to the haystack where my friend was lying there. Naturally, he grabbed me.\nHe kissed me. He was sorry. He thought that I am dead, that I'm shot. He didn't know that I\nkilled the Germans. So I said, \"Let's go. This is not for us.\u201d So we went the same way and we\nwent where the two Germans were laying dead. So going through...so then we helped\nourselves to their two rifles because...we took off the two rifles, and we went over the other\nside. We went there to a peasant hut, and we were waiting there a whole night. In the\nmorning somebody opened the barn door and I see a Russian soldier comes in with some pot\nand he came in. He wanted to milk a cow to get some milk. I jumped down and I asked him,\n\"What's going on?\" He said, \"Well, we liberated this village this night.\u201d I grabbed him and I\nhugged him and I danced around and this was my liberation. So the reason why I told you\nthis story, this was the last night. Now the last night I would if I wouldn't have the quick\nmind to turn around to kill them or something like this, I would be dead. It so happens that\nevery day something else happened and every day, oh, you had to outsmart somebody or you\nhad to be quick about something. And this is the way that mostly survivors survived. See, if\nsomebody survived in a camp, he couldn't do anything. If he didn't die of typhus, and he\ndidn't die of starvation, he wasn't picked out in a selection to be gassed, he survived because\nhe didn't have to fight himself...by himself to outwit...to do something. He had to be strong to\nwait and not to be gassed. But when you were on your own in the woods or like my wife on\nillegal papers, every day was a challenge. Every day you had to do something to live another\nday. Now you were asking me a question. I didn't tell you this before. Why do I tell all those\nstories? There are people, survivors who don't want to open their mouths, and they will shut\nup and they don't tell because the pains come back and they cannot sleep nights. You don't\nsleep nights. You dream about it. The next day you think about it. And this 1s a vicious\ncircle. It goes day after day after night. I think every survivor survived for a reason. I\nsurvived for two reasons. I had two legacies why I survived. And this gave me strength. One\nlegacy was when my father was shot (I told you this before) the last words was, \"Revenge,\nrevenge, revenge. Take revenge.\u201d And I wanted to survive. I wanted to join a special unit.\nFor this reason, I joined right away the army, and I wanted to join a unit that could give me\nthe possibility of revenge. I took revenge as much as I could. Looking back, some people say\nwell revenge is not sweet because it doesn't bring anybody to life. But if you will ask a\nperson who went through so much and you will say if you have a chance to take revenge\nmaybe not so much for me because I'm alive and this what I went through doesn't mean\nanything, but for the people who are not alive, the people who are killed. And if I took\nrevenge for my father, I did it gladly. Now after so many years, we live in America. It's a\nnormal life. We have to live like human beings, not to be like animals. Like in this time\neverybody was an animal. This gave me strength. The second strength gave me when my\nmother was\ntaken to Belzec. She somehow sent to somebody a letter to me when I was in the\nKolbuszowa camp. And she wrote me in the letter and she said, \"You are the youngest. You\nare young. You are my youngest. You are young. You are healthy, and you are a witness.\u201d\n\"So go on,\" and she said, \"Let the thing that you are an orphan and let it not break you. You\ngo on and live. Live. Go to Palestine and tell 1t to David.\u201d David was my brother. \"Go to\nAmerica and tell it to Albert.\u201d Albert was my brother. \"Go in the world and tell it to the\nworld what the Germans did to us. How they murdered us. What they did to us.\u201d\u2019 And this is\na legacy that my mother gave me. Not to be quiet. To go out and tell and retell everybody the\nstory, and not to let it die. Because this what the Germans did, we can talk as much as want.\nWe will not even scratch the surface\nbecause the cruelty, the barbarism (of) what they did. Not only the killing. To kill a Jew was\na salvation for the Jew. This was the best thing they did, because they relieved him from the\nmisery. But if you take a town like Warsaw, like other big towns, starvation day after day,\nthe children who are left without their parents, and they had to go out and beg for a crumb of\nbread and they couldn't get and they died from hunger. The cruelties. Take a tree. You start\nto cut branches. The tree will die. Here you took a family. You killed a daughter. You killed\na son. You killed a son-in-law. You killed a grandchild. Now the parent, even if he was\nalive, he was dead because everything was chopped up. So the people have to know about\nthe cruelties, and for this reason the Museum, the books, the telling, the testimonies,\neverything is important because everybody has to tell a different story. And a different story\nabout the cruelties what a human being can do, what a German can do. I will never call them\nNazi because I don't know who was Nazi. A Nazi belonged to the party. There were only,\nnot even 2 million, but the whole nation, 99 and a half percent did it. And they with their\nhelpers, with their collaborators. So for this reason, I will never say the Nazis did it. I say the\nGermans did it. With their helpers. Helpers, the Poles, the Ukrainians, the Latvians, the\nLithuanians. They were helping. The Hungarians. Some countries more, some countries less.\nBut the worse thing was in Poland. I can never understand how people who lived with us for\nso many years and were an underdog by the Germans could be so helpful even the Jew who\nsomehow sneaked through the Germans' finger, run away from a transport. Run away to a\nsewer in Warsaw by the opening, a Pole was waiting. This I could never understand and I\nwill not understand. Sure, there were people who helped. But a very small percentage. If in\nPoland there was | percent in Poland who helped Jews, it was a lot.\n04:44",
        "A: Well, I don't know...",
        "A: I beg your pardon.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: First, we had the Jewish group. Right?",
        "A: The AK. Yes. With the AK, I was quite long. I was a few months with AK.",
        "A: Was the Russian. But you see, with the Russians I didn't stay. The Russians I only came to\nthem and I asked them for help. I asked them for help to do this thing with this Scharfuehrer,\nwhich they agreed. So I was with them altogether about 2 weeks. Til we prepared those\nthings. And then later after, they wanted me to stay with them. But I figured the war 1s\nclosing and closing and I had enough and I wanted to be liberated. Then I said to myself I\nwill join the army. I don't want to be in the woods anymore. But the main thing, the longest\ntime I was with the Jewish group, but unfortunately, there was very, very few left of us.\n04:45:",
        "A: Okay. This was after we were shot by...when I was shot by the Agustins by the two brothers\nwhat I killed them. And I went to the AK. But my brother, as we run away from them, it was\na very high snow. We stopped on the way by a friendly peasant and he gave us some old\nclothing and also he gave me a pair of shoes which fitted me. But for my brother he didn't\nhave shoes because they didn't fit my brother...the too large foot. So we had to run away.\nAnd we went through a meadow which was low and it was covered with snow and\nunderneath it was water, but was it covered with a very thin layer of ice. And as we walked,\nhe broke the ice and the ice was so sharp that it cut his feet and it cut off the skin. He didn't\nfeel it because it was very cold. When we came to our group, we saw that his feet are without\nskin. Naturally, we washed. We couldn't go to a doctor. We washed, and we put in some\nbandages. And he had to put some place to recuperate. So we brought him back to the same\nvillage where this shooting went on, but to a peasant. His name was Avisha...that he used to\nwork for my father. He used to bring merchandise to my father. And we trusted him. And I\ndidn't want to show that I am there. Because even my brother would be there, they would be\nafraid to do something to him I should remain as a witness. So my brother...I left him on the\nroof [attic?] in the stable and when he came to milk the cows he told them he's there. And he\nused to bring him every day about 5, 6 o'clock a quart of soup. And this was his food that he\nate, that he brought him. Every evening he brought him a hot quart of soup. One day I came\nover there. And he noticed me. And I was afraid that he should see me there. Even I trusted\nhim, but I figured those two boys were his friends and they belonged to the same group.\nWhen he noticed me, the same day, he didn't bring us food. And I told him, \"I am here, but I\nwant to tell you one thing.\u201d I asked him, what's going on in this village?\" He said, \"Nothing,\nNothing.\u201d And I didn't believe him because it was not nothing. I killed two of the best boys\nin this village.\n04:48:\nHow could be nothing nothing? He didn't tell me this. And everybody knew that I did it. So\nwhen it was dark he didn't bring the food like every evening. Usually he brought the food\nabout 5, 6 o'clock. It was 7 o'clock. He didn't bring the food. It was 8 o'clock. He came over\nand he brought a quart, he brought a pot with soup. Usually, it was hot. This time it was cold.\nAnd he left. Usually, he waited til my brother would finish the soup, and he would take back\nthe pot. This time he gave it and he run away. He went away. So I said to my brother, I said,\n\"Don't eat it because I don't trust it for a few reasons. The first thing I'm here with you. They\nknow they got us both together. The second thing he usually brought it between 5 and 6.\nNow it's already 8. Why so different? Always, it was hot. Now it's cold. He always waited\nfor the empty pot. Now he didn't wait. He went away. So he said, \"Oh, we can trust him.\nDon't think that he will do something.\u201d I said, \"No, I will not eat it. And you don't eat it. I\nadvise you.\u201d He started to eat it. And when he start to eat, after a while he started to\nscream...he said, \"I don't feel good. I have pains. I have cramps. I think I'm poisoned.\u201d So I\npoured out the soup. I said, \"Wait.\u201d And I jumped on downstairs the stable, and I started to\nmilk the cow. And I milked a full pot of milk and I came up and I said to him, \"Drink the\nmilk, the whole thing and then later, try to throw up \" So he drink the milk, put in his finger\nin his mouth and his throat and he threw up. I said, \"Now, let's go.\u201d Now he still had trouble\nwith his feet, but we went down. I said, \"I want to wait. I want to see who is coming for our\nbodies.\u201d So we were waiting there on the opposite side. Was very cold. And this I remember\nhow cold it was. And it took about 20 minutes. Four guys came 1n with flashlights and I saw\nthem going in in the stable and there was a loft, came up the ladder with a flashlight, took a\nsecond there. They came down and they started to run. They run away, and then said to him,\n\"Now, we can go.\u201d But I knew...I knew who came so I said to him, \"We will wait about a\nweek or two and we will burn their houses.\u201d This, Franek Zavishes house I didn't touch.\nBecause he really was nice, and maybe they forced him to do it. But others I said, \"After a\nfew weeks, we will burn their houses.\u201d See they were afraid to come and to shoot because I\ntold them, \"Anybody who will come up on the attic and he will show his head, I will blow\n04:51:\nhis head off.\u201d So after the war, after the liberation, I invited this Franek when I was a big\nshot in Krakow, so I invited Franek to come to Krakow, and he came. And I asked him in\nthis time, I said, \"Tell me the truth. What happened this night?\" So he tells me there was a\ndoctor who belonged to his group. His name was Vosna Volski. After they told him that I am\ncoming there, he gave them four pills of poison. And the four pills he suppose to put in in\nour food, but he didn't want to kill us. This what he told me. He didn't want to kill us. He\nonly wanted to threaten us. So he only put in one pill. And later I find out that one pill could\nkill 25 people, not two. But he wanted to scare us we should run away so he put in only one\npill and three he didn't put in. This he told me after we were liberated and he came. And my\nwife\n04:52:\nwas sitting there because I knew her in this time. And then then I knew which doctor and\nhow it was.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: After the liberation, the same week, I joined the Polish Army.",
        "A: I went and I joined. I didn't have to go, but I joined and I wanted to be a part of the Polish\nArmy, and I volunteered to join the air force. Because I wanted they should teach me and I\nshould be a pilot and maybe I will be able to bomb Germany. And the school for officers for\nthe air force was in Kuibichov. This was in Siberia in Russia. So when I waited for a\ntransported, then I met a young Polish officer. She was a beautiful, nice girl in that uniform.\nShe went through us, and we waited for the transport for the train to come. And we started to\ntalk. And she said, \"What're you doing here?\" And I told this. She said, \"Well, you're going\nto be a pilot. It takes 2 years.\u201d The war wouldn't last 2 years anymore. So why don't you\ncome with me and you join our unit. We have a special unit, and if you want to take revenge,\nyou will take plenty of revenge.\u201d And I said, \"How can I do it. I have already the orders to\ngo.\u201d She said, \"Don't worry.\u201d And she took me to her colonel and she showed him the\norders. He took the orders and he ripped them up and he said, \"From now on, you will be\nwith us.\u201d And I joined them, and this is how I joined, this is how I met my wife. Because\nafter six months, when we had to liberate Krakow, so I was already a big shot in this time\nand I came to Krakow and then when I find out about my wife and I came to have her killed.\nAnd this is a different story and this my wife probably will tell the story. Because Krakow\nhad to be destroyed completely. And my wife was the secretary of the company who made\nthe barricades and before we entered Krakow, we had to find somebody to get the plans to\ndismantle those barricades and through channels and channels we find out that it's her and\nthree were sent out to get those plans. And I was one of the three. This was one day before\nKrakow was liberated. So I entered Krakow January the 18th 1945 and officially Krakow\nwas liberated January the 19th. And my wife will tell you the rest story. I thought she's\nGerman. I hated her. She was beautiful. I saw my five sisters in here and we made up that\nafter we get the plans, we'd kill her. And then she looked at me. When I came in, I started to\ninterrogate her. She thought I am the biggest anti-Semitic Pole. She said, \"You're a snob,\"\nbut later she told me, \"You're a snub nose and you're slavic, slavic face features.\u201d But\nanyway I find out that she's Jewish. She find out I am Jewish. She was very happy. And this\nwas our meeting. And we had to still go through in the war...January, February, March,\nApril, May...This was still war. And then later in November, we got married.",
        "A: We came to the United States January 1947. After I was transferred I escaped. I was in the\nGerman zone in Germany about 6 months, and then we came to the United States. We\nwanted to go to Palestine in this time, but it was impossible. So we came to the United States\nwith the thought of going from here to Palestine. And this is other story. This is the other\nchapter and another book. But we are here, and we are very happy to be in America.\nAmerica did for me more than I expected. I never dreamed that American can do this for me\nwhat actually I achieved. And now we had a daughter. We are very happy. My daughter has\nthree little boys. And this is the most important thing is to show that Hitler didn't\ncompletely succeed. He wanted to erase every European Jew in the Jewish race, and we are a\ncontinuation. Now one I want to tell you. After the war, we contemplated...we didn't know\nwhat to do. I was already a Pole. I had established position. My wife was Polish, an\nestablished position. And we didn't know. She started to study medicine in Poland after the\nwar. So we didn't know what should we do. Should we become Jews and run away or should\nwe stay and be Poles and maybe to save our future generations the heartache and the\nproblems that we had. And we started to think about it. What should we do? And we decided\nno. Because we cannot do it. For two reasons. My wife couldn't do it because she had her\nfamily and her grandmother, uncles and her sister in Palestine. I couldn't do it because, it so\nhappens we spoke yesterday about Kohanim. I am from the line of Kohanim. Now we know\nby Jews are very strict to follow male after male, and our lineage goes back til Aaron the\nhigh priest, the brother of Moses. And I said, \"Who am I to cut this chain. My father was\nkilled because he was a Jew. Maybe his forefathers were killed because they were Jews. I\nhave no right to come to me...1t reached me after 2...after three and and a half thousand years.\nBecause since Aaron is between three and and half thousand years and four thousand. Who\nam I that I should cut this line? So I said, \"For this reason, we have to remain Jews, and we\nshouldn't be the one to say this 1s it.\u201d If we would do it, 1t means that Hitler succeeded. We\nwill resign from being Jews. For this reason, we had to continue.\"",
