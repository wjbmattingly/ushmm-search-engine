        "Q: Would you tell us your name and where and when you were born?",
        "A: OK. My name 1s Isaac Danon. They call me Mike--my nickname. I was born in Split,\u2019\nYugoslavia in 1929. I lived there with my family, my mother and father. I have three sisters.\nOne is older than me, two years older, Blanka. And my two younger sisters, one 1s Sarah--\nshe is about two years younger than me. And the youngest sister, her name is Esther. She 1s\nabout five years younger than I am. Split is a small town on the Adriatic coast of Yugoslavia,\nabout 50,000 population before the war. We lived there with uh there was about 200 other\nJewish families in town. We had a rather active Jewish life. We had our synagogue, was one\nsynagogue. We had a social club. I think it was called \"Yarden\" [Hebrew meaning \"Jordan\"].\nAnd we had our regular Zionist clubs. We had a lot of friends. Uh, the kids were going to\nschool. I was going, at that time, before the war, the last year of school that I went to was\nfirst Gymnasium which was an equivalent to fifth grade. And we had a lot of friends, both\nJewish and non-Jewish friends. The, I don't remember any particular uh antisemitism being\npresent in our community. Maybe some individual cases here and there, but not organized\nand not uh surely, not uh legal type. Although as the things got worse in Europe, there was\nmore activity by some groups that were sympathetic to the Nazis, but uh I belonged to some\nuh clubs and some organizations like uh like you would have here, Boy Scouts, but it was\nmostly a national organization for sports and patriotism and there was no antisemitism that I\ncan remember. The war came to Yugoslavia in early 1941. We first were hit by that when\nmy father was drafted into the service, into the Army. They have like a general mobilization.\nHe was forty, but they took him anyway. And uh there was some kind of a palace coup, I\nguess. The King took over the reign of the government. He was a small boy, became 18,\ntook over the government and broke relations with Germany and the Axis and we knew\nthings were going to happen then. And sure enough about two, three weeks later, the\nGerman and Italian forces invaded our country. We were very lucky that we lived in the part\nthat has been claimed by Italy for a long, long time--Dalmatian Province, or the coast along\nthe Adriatic. And when...of course, when they [the Italians] attacked, they took the country\nover in less than two weeks; and the Italians occupied that part. So that's one good thing that\nhappened. When the Italians took over the country, that part of the country, I can describe\nthe occupation as being benign. We as Jews had the same difficulties or same lack of\nproblems as the rest of the local population. There were shortages of food and other\nmaterials and rationing which you expect with a war, but otherwise we didn't fare much\nworse than the rest of the population, with some exceptions, let me say. For one thing uh\nJews could not work in the public life. They couldn't be teachers or officials of any kind.\nThey couldn't work in the offices. And we, the kids, we were not allowed to go to school.\nBut a little ingenuity solved that problem. We took the Jewish teachers and we formed\nJewish schools and that took care of that. I unfortunately couldn't go to school because my\n' Also known as Spljet among some Dalmatian speakers of Serbo-Croatian, and Spalato among\nItalian speakers.\nfather needed me in our business. We had a, I guess you could call it a dry goods store. Very\nsmall one uh and most of the Jewish community was involved in either some type of small\ntrades or they were in some of the professions, although we did have some that were rather\npoor in the community. But anyway, uh during the Italian occupation our life was not too\nbad with some minor exceptions. As uh I think back, occasionally they would flood the city\nwith some \"antisemitic\" slogans. I remember some of the instances where my uncle who was\na barber, they came with a big sign says, \"Jews are not welcome here,\" and they wanted him\nto put it in his window. And he says, \"OK, you want me to put that. Fine. I'll put it and here\nare my keys and here are the scissors. You take over. I'm Jewish.\" So, we had these little\ninstances. One case that I remember and that was the worst case that happened was right\nafter my bar mitzvah was one Saturday and the following Friday; I guess there was some\nkind of activity. The Germans were coming to help the Italians celebrate, so they [the\nItalians] had to demonstrate how good they were as far as the Germans are concerned. So the\nlocal Fascists came to synagogue and asked everybody to leave, and as people were leaving,\nthey were hitting them with clubs of the uh rifles and kicking them and few little things like\nthat. Although I do remember in my, some older people that were there, they would go out,\nthen they wouldn't bother them. But the worst thing was next morning when we came, you\nknow, we saw what was happening, we were afraid that they might come and take us or\nsomething like that, but so we went early in the morning and we saw they had taken all the\nthings out of the synagogue, the torahs, the books and they put them in the public square and\nthey had a big bonfire. Uh the synagogue was 1n a section called the ghetto which was the\nreal ghetto, the type uh that, uh the word itself means, you know, where the Jewish were\nkept, but this was right outside the public square so most of the Jews didn't live there. I mean\nhardly anybody, but the synagogue was there because it was a very very old one. Uh\nanyway, when we came, we saw that, and then we went to our store and we saw somebody\nwas trying to break in, but our store was so small we didn't even have the glass plates, so\nnothing happened. But they did go around and broke the windows of the Jewish stores and\nthey looted the stuff, so that was our \"Kristallnacht.\" But the following day the life went on\nas though nothing happened and we just didn't have a synagogue anymore. But during the\nwhole period before that, like more than a year that the Italians had occupied the country...uh\nthat portion of the country, we lived uh peacefully and normally except for some of these\ninstances. In fact, uh a lot of immigrants--a lot of Jews that were able to escape from other\nparts of the country that were occupied by Germans and \"their quislings\"--they also came to\nthis town and this area. And they found a haven over there. Uh as I mentioned earlier, there\nwas about two hundred uh Jewish families in town. Well, after a few months the number\nswelled to four or five thousand, and then maybe up to ten thousand people that came from\nother places and at that point the Italians started getting panicky. The Italian authorities, they\nasked the Jewish community to disperse them throughout the area that they [the Italians]\ncontrolled, and then finally they started taking them away to, I guess we can call them\ninternment centers. Both, different areas along the occupied coast and also in Italy proper.\nUh I didn't think of this too much, but Italians were really, uh what shall I say, they helped\nmany people. They saved us for one thing, and they and many times when the Germans\nwere, their quislings, the Croatians, they wanted to occupy certain towns or they wanted to\ntake certain Jews away to concentration camps, the Italians would step in and say, \"This 1s\nour area and you can't cross.\" And it was, for them it was, you know, a territorial issue\nwhich for us it was a case of life or death. But our problems really started after the fall of\nItaly. That's when uh Mussolini fell, of course, and the Italians uh signed a, I guess uh - what\nis it - they capitulated to the Allied troops. Well, in these areas that were occupied by Italians\nbecame like uh free areas and it was free-for-all, who was going to grab what. The Partisans\u201d\ncame out of the mountains and they took over some. The, the Croatian quislings took some\nover. The Germans took some, but the town where we lived was taken over by the Partisans,\nuh the underground resistance. They came out and I guess they compromised themselves, the\nlocal population who helped them and who didn't. And I found out that my older sister, she\nhad been working in the underground which we didn't know about even though my sister\nand I were quite close. But at that time she was uh less than sixteen years old and but there\nwas things to do for everybody during the war. Anyway, uh my sister at that point joined the\nPartisans and so did many uh local youths. They, the Partisans were trying to get them to join\nthem and go into the mountains and uh I would say a lot of them did join, but we remained in\nthe city and the Partisans tried to hold that city. They had taken, they had uh disarmed the\nItalian Army. They had some, some arms now, and the new recruits that had joined them, so\nthey were going to defend the city, and they tried that for two, three weeks, but the German\ntroops just came over with their full armor and everything and they took over the city, but\nnot before they came in, we were, we [a]wakened in the middle of the night by neighbors\nbanging at the door and saying - I remember one lady yelling, \"Mr. Danon, Mr. Danon,\" to\nmy father--he was the mister--anyway, \"Mr. Danon, the Germans are coming.\" So we knew\nthat the Germans always take the men first and we were ready to escape. My father and I, we\nhad our backpacks all packed in advance. We put them on, said goodbye to my mother and\nmy sisters and we went away. That's the last time we saw our home. We went into the\nmountains. And uh we joined the Partisans there. At first not as fighters, but we just traveled\nwith them and did what ever could be done and we traveled with them for a couple of\nmonths through the mountains. This was, you, you hide during the daytime and you tippy-\ntoe at night crossing German lines maybe several times, you know, going from one place to\nanother until we arrived to one of the islands uh on the coast. Actually, what people were\ndoing, they were going to the mountains and they would come to the coast and they would\nuh maybe there would be a little uh rowboat or a little junk and in the middle of the night\nthey would go aboard one of these and go to the, one of the islands. Only the islands weren't\nsafe because Germans could always come over there too. Now we went to one of these\nislands and we were with the Partisans there and my father and I were, I guess I won't call it\nconscriptive--we were regular military unit at that time. Uh, I was assigned to a machine\nshop where we repaired ammunition and other equipment, automotive and what not, and my\nfather was uh, I remember they called this the, the duty that they assigned to him--\"ekonom,\"\nwhich, uh, meant supply sergeant. And uh we were there for four, five months, I guess. Time\njust, it's not too clearly in my mind right now.",
        "Q: What island was that?\n* Communist resistance forces led by Joseph Broz Tito.",
        "A: Well, the island's called Hvar, H - V - A-R. I can't pronounce 1's too well. Uh and it's a\nrelatively large island. It had two little cities and the one where we were in was called\nStarigrad, which means old city. Uh, anyway one time the Germans did invade that island\nand there was fear because there was not too much in the way of defense. Uh, and this was in\nthe middle of the war. The Allies were uh stuck down southern Italy. Uh, there was, uh I\nguess we all read about the Monte Cassino\u2019 or wherever they were, they couldn't move\nforward and uh there was nothing happening anywhere else. Even the Russians, the Russian\nfront had stalemated, been stalemated for a while, so this was middle of the war and it could\nhave gone either way and we were pretty fearful at the time. Well, anyway, my father and I\nguess he wasn't having a very easy time of it. Uh, first the work was hard for him and and\nthere wasn't enough food and the people who depended on him to obtain food, like supply\nsergeant meant getting flour and making sure the bread was made and uh you know other\nfood uh was provided and clothing and what not--they were always complaining and uh they\nwere blaming him for all the shortages and so I remember uh he somehow disappeared or--I\ndidn't see him for several days and they kept pestering me, uh you know--\"Where is your\nfather? What happened?\" This and that. I didn't know. And I guess my father had left. He\nhad uh gone some other route. But two weeks later I received a very official uh teletype\ntelling me to report to another island and report myself to the command of the hospital unit. I\nhad no idea what that was all about. Well, I made arrangements to go there, and this was\nanother island called Vis, V - I - S. And this island was uh formed into a strong point by the\nPartisans. It was the furtherest [farthest] island from Yugoslavian coast and closest to Italian\ncoast, closest to the point where the Allied troops were. So this was used by the Allied troops\nto help the Partisans. At this point, if I can introduce a little politics here, uh the Allies had\nstarted recognizing the Partisans as the fighting force as opposed to other, there was a fellow\nby the name of Dra_a Mihailovi_,* who was left by the King uh to, I guess, to organize\nresistance, but he evidently didn't do the job that they expected, or maybe there were political\ndifferences and the Partisans were communist-oriented and the other ones were uh for\nmonarchy and so there was a lot of internal struggle, but let me get away from that. But uh\nanyway the Allies had started recognizing and helping the Partisans. So, this uh island was\nmade into a fortress. They used that to bring the supplies and also there was another point\nthat the Allies were trying to convey a message to the Germans that they were going to open\na new front, a second front, at the Balkans and come through there, so they were\nencouraging the local population to escape, and the local population had developed like an\nunderground railroad you can almost call it. They would get themselves to the coast and\nfrom the coastline they would come by junks to these, to this particular island and the uh\nBritish Navy would come and pick them up there and take them to Italy, where they had like\n* Monte Cassino was the strong point of a German defensive line that delayed the Allied advance\non Rome until June 1944.\n* Dragoljub (Dra_a) Mihailovi_ (also Mihajlovi_) was the leader of the _etniks, an anticommunist\nSerbian resistance force loyal to the royal Yugoslav government-in-exile.\nI would call it regroupment points. They would create uh units of uh refugees, I guess by\nlocation, and take them to Egypt, to the desert to wait for the end of the war. Well, uh when I\ncame, I gotta go back now to my tele... telegram that I received. When I presented myself\nthere, that actually my father had sent it to get me to come there and I met him there again\nand he told me that he has, he had joined this group that was going to Egypt and he was\ngoing to go with the troops and he told me to sign up for it also at the first opportunity and\nwe'll meet there. And I did that and I know he went one time and uh the first opportunity that\nI had when the British uh ship came--uh, they were small PT boats or something that would\npick up thirty, forty people, uh you know, pile us up and go across the Adriatic and we went\nuh over there. I went there with the British to a...the town was called Bari, B - A - R - I.\nThere was a big city, where all the refugees were coming but from there they would ship us\nby trucks or trains, mostly trucks, to the other side and further [farther] down south, southern\ntip of Italy where there were a lot of uh summer homes from the rich northern Italian people.\nThis was in the winter. So they would organize these groups and from there they would take\nthem to Naples and to Egypt from there. Well, anyway, that's where I, I was taken and I met\nmy father there again and we were in those camps uh, waiting for our shipment to Egypt.\nWhile we were there, uh there were many people incidentally. By the thousands they were\ncoming from all over. While we were there, we learned that my mother's two sisters were\nalso there in the vicinity and my mother's brother was in Bari uh, with his family, so we had\nsome family that was still alive. Uh, if, if 1 can go back a little bit, uh--this was about my\nfamily, my parent's family. My parents' family, both of them came from a town called\nSarajevo in Yugoslavia. Well, my mother's parents came in the early '90's. They came down\nto Split which was our home town, and they settled there and they had uh whatever they did-\n-I don't remember now--but as I remember my grandfather, he was the \"shamas\" [sexton] at\nour synagogue. That was his occupation. But as the children grew up they got married and\nsome went to different locations, and one of my, two of my mother's sisters went back to\nSarajevo. Uh so when the war broke out, they were in Sarajevo. So one of them was able to\ncome down to Split and stay with the rest of the family, and they were saved. The other one\nperished in the war. On my father's side, he had his parents and five brothers. They were also\nin Sarajevo but some of them lived right outside Sarajevo, in a little town and and none of\nthem were saved. They all perished with one exception, my Uncle David, my father's brother\nwho was in the [Yugoslav] Army during the mobilization and the Germans captured them\nand they shipped them someplace wherever they had their Army prisoners and I guess he\npassed as a non-Jew and that's how when the war ended when some of them were\nrepatriated, he was still alive. So when we were talking about who was able to be saved and\nwho wasn't, my father counted twenty-eight of his relatives that died. Relatives meaning\nmother, father, brothers, sister-in-laws [sic] and their children. So but anyway, back to where\nwe were in Italy. We lived there uh for a couple of weeks and then when it was time to go to\nEgypt my father got cold feet and he says I'm not going to the desert. So in the morning\nwhen they were gathering us all to go to Egypt, my father got me out of bed and we left the\ngroup. We booked, uh took a horse and buggy from a local uh farmer. He took us to the\nnearest train station, we boarded the train station and we went to the town where he dropped\nus off. It's a town called Lecci [Lecce], L - E- C- C - I [E], in Italy. It's near Bari but maybe\nabout fifteen miles or so. Anyway, and that's where we settled and my father got a job there\nwith the Allied occupation forces as a uh censor, uh read the mail, and I was just hanging\naround the streets. I had friends. I had, uh don't forget I was thirteen years old there and then.\nI had a uniform that I brought with me which was an American or British soldier's uniform,\nlike an Eisenhower jacket, a military thing you know and I would parade there with my\nfriends enjoying life, you know, uh, uh as a thirteen year old would, uh showing off my\nclothes, you know. Well anyway uh there was very uneventful at the time and then, this was\nJune '44, the end of June. Uh, they [the Western Allies] already had, they opened a new front\nin Normandy\u201d and all that and we heard that there was an invitation from the American\ngovernment for a thousand people, a thousand displaced persons to come to United States\nand uh OK, we said, \"Let's go. Shall we go, yeah.\" We signed up and this was quick like\nyou know. They took our names. I understand there was a lot of people who signed up but\nonly a thousand could go. Uh we didn't know for sure whether it was just Jewish or not, but\nanyway we signed up and we were getting ready to go and three days before we were ready\nto leave, we learned that my mother and two sisters had come to Bari also. Now this is a\nstory in itself the way the refugees would uh--it's almost like uh telephone lines, you know.\nYou would go into the group and you say, \"Is anybody here from such and such a place?\"\nAnd they say, \"No, we are not, but we know somebody who is,\" you know, and we know so\nand so and oh yeah, but he knows somebody who knows somebody. And that's how we all\nmet you know, after the war. And that's how my mother when she came with one of the\ngroups uh, you know, the British naval vessel, and they told her that we know somebody\nwho is also from Split who may be related to you, you know. And they said, \"Well, his name\nis so and so,\" and he says, \"That's my brother,\" you know. So we all, we got together and\nwithin the next three days the miracle of bureaucracy--they were able to clear my mother and\nmy two sisters and we, uh we were picked up at one point in Bari and we boarded trains, uh\ndifferent people are coming from different parts of southern Italy and we went to Naples uh\nin trucks. Well, we stopped off for three days for delousing sessions and all that. Boarded a\nship and one of the ships, uh I forgot its name, uh Henry something or other, but it was a ship\nthat was taking the American soldiers back and it was one of the regular troop ships and we\nwere given one little corner with uh, uh, what do you call these sleeping quarters, hammocks,\nyeah, five deep, yeah. And uh we waited in Naples for enough ships so they can form a\nconvoy; and we departed from there near the end of July. Thirteen days uh on the sea.\nSeveral times they thought they saw the German U- boats, and they went through the routine\nof putting that fog, artificial fog. We as kids, we enjoyed all that. I was fourteen by that time.\nOn August 3rd, 1944, we landed in New York Harbor. I believe it's Bayonne or some place,\nwherever the troop shipments were uh being unloaded. And we got into trains there and we\nwent overnight. Train stopped in front of a military camp. We got out; and this was upstate\nNew York, near a town called Oswego. This was an old Army base called Fort Ontario. And\nthat's where we spent next year and a half. Uh I can tell you about our life over there, if you\nwant to hear it. Well, uh first, uh well, this was summer time of course, August then. In\nSeptember was when the schools opened. We were invited to join the schools in the United\nStates. None of us knew any English at the time. I speak a few foreign languages but English\n\u00b0 Anglo-American-Canadian forces landed on the Normandy Peninsula of France on June 6, 1944.\nwas not one of them. But anyway we started going to school, and our, our parents were uh\njust staying there. What bothered us mostly was the fence. We were not allowed to go out\nexcept to go to school. We had little passes and we had to return, sign in and out. That was a\nlittle disappointing. But basically that's uh what happened. And we spent there until the war\nwas over actually, and then I guess there was a lot of discussion whether we should go back\nor not. Uh we had signed that we, before we came we had signed uh what kind of agreement\nwith the American government that we were going to stay there for the duration of the war,\nand then go back. And uh, when the war was over I guess we were being asked whether we\nwanted to go back. Some people did go immediately because they left their, part of their\nfamilies. But uh many of us, most of us, wanted to stay in the United States. So there was a\nlot of politicking and this is another story altogether and this was documented in this uh book\nthat uh was written, let's see, the book is called \"Haven,\" \"The Haven,\" and it was written by\nRuth Gruber.\u00b0 She was closely involved in that so she would know more about that.",
        "Q: Can you--was your father involved in the politicking at all?",
        "A: No, my father was, uh actually what happened to my father - he was demoralized at the end\nof the war. Uh he had this little business that he ran in Split during the war and uh he, when\nwe left, he knew that everything was gone. All the lifetime's work. And his family was all\ngone. They were killed. And he just gave up on everything. So even when we came out, uh\nafter we were allowed to remain in United States, he couldn't do anything. He didn't work or\nanything else. It was uh, he was psychologically drained. I wanted to mention something else\nabout my sisters and my mother. After my father and I had left, we didn't know what has\nhappened or how they were going to manage. All we knew is that Germans usually take the\nmen first and women hopefully uh later or whatever, but anyway we were hoping that things\ncould work out. Well, my sisters and my mother told me later their story and maybe I can\nbring out some of those points. Uh, my mother was in a panic and had these two younger\nsisters as I mentioned: my next younger sister, Sarah, she was nine year old and then this\nwas the youngest one, Esther, six years old. And I understand that my nine-year old sister\nwas the hero of the family. She led everybody along. She says, \"OK, this is not the place. It's\nnot safe here. Let's go into hiding.\" And she forced my mother to make arrangements to go\ninto hiding. First they stayed wherever our apartment was. Then somebody else took them\nin, similar to the story of Anne Frank, while the Germans were around, you know. They\nwere still hiding and they would go outside in the streets and see what was happening, and\nuh that wasn't too safe. Uh then they talked to a person who had a farm like a--this was lots\nof vineyards in that part of the country. They had a big uh vineyard, maybe about thirty, forty\nmiles from the city, so they had friends who had friends and they took them to this farm\nwhich is, you know, you're away from civilization. Nobody comes there. So they were safe\nthere for a while and my mother had some money that uh we were able to save up and I\nremember when my father and I left, they split up the money, hopefully uh in case either side\n\u00b0 Ruth Gruber, Haven: The Unknown Story of 1,000 World War II Refugees (New York:\nCoward-McCann, 1983).\nneeded you know. So uh my mother was paying them whatever, and then after a while these\npeople were also afraid, so they wouldn't keep my parents any more so my sister, she took\nmy other sister by one hand and my mother by another, and they went into the mountains\nand they traveled on foot without shoes, you know--that's the kind of stuff--through, well\nthere were no roads. Even today Yugoslavia doesn't have any roads to speak of, but you\nknow, you go through the donkey trails and uh they ended up the same way that we did. The\nsame spot, only nine months later. That's my mother and my two younger sisters. My older\nsister, she, after the fall of Italy, she joined the Partisan fighting unit and she was uh she's,\nright now she is 4'10\" in high heels (laughter), so she's a little girl but anyway she was there\ncarrying her load and uh she tells a story about how they would attack from one side and\nthey went around the other side of the mountain and attacked the Germans from the other\nside to give the impression that there was more of them. And she got wounded in the leg and\nshe still has problems with that leg. Uh I, occasionally I would ask her stories about uh the\nwar, you know, and they had all these what they called German offensive. First offensive,\nsecond offensive, sixth offensive, and she was in all of them as a fighting Partisan. They had\nboth men and women. There was no distinction at the time. Incidentally this sister of mine,\nher name is Blanka, she never came to United States. She stayed there, but I guess she had a\npretty pleasant life after the war. The first wasn't so, and then she got married and they\ntraveled throughout the world and she lived in India and Cairo and uh, uh some place in\nAfrica--I just couldn't keep track of all the places. She studied in Moscow and in Italy and\nshe's been to Israel a few times. She comes here every other year, so she didn't have such a\nbad life after that, but anyway .. .",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about your life in Fort Ontario? What the kind of\nrestrictions were like? Uh, what your daily life was like?",
        "A: Oh, OK. Sure. In Fort Ontario, that was when we first came, we were a bunch of, oh what\nshould I say, proud kids. We were not going to let anybody give us the impression that we\nare poor and uh we needed help from anybody. See, it was little thing psychologically that\nwhen we came here, we were greeted, welcomed and all that. But Americans are the most\ngenerous people in the world is beyond question. But they are also naive, so they would ask\nus questions like uh, \"You see this--this is bread. Did you ever eat this before?\" You know\nkind of thing--I mean it's mind-boggling. And that puts us on the defensive. So we would\nsay, \"Oh, sure, we had it good on the other side,\" and uh we were a little bit--what should I\nsay--snotty kids. Anyway so we had this fence that prevented us from going outside and that\nbothered us a little bit. And this was a military camp. There was uh ample opportunity for\nsports and uh food uh like we hadn't seen before. I mean quantities, you know. We were just\ncoming from the hungry Europe, so life was pretty good.",
        "Q: Was it run by the American military?",
        "A: Uh, no. What they did--this was put under what they called War Relocation Authority.\u2019 They\n\u2019 The War Relocation Authority was charged with administering Fort Ontario under the overrall\ncreated a unit called Emergency Refugee Shelter under the War Relocation Authority which\nwas part of the Department of the Interior. This is the very same group that interned the\nJapanese during the war, if you are familiar with that story.\u00ae Well, anyway, they were in\ncharge of us. The, the military brought us over to the United States, but then it was handed\nover to the War Relocation Authority. And they had a civilian administrator that was\nappointed by this unit, uh by the Authority. Uh, it was a very democratically-run\norganization. One thing they did teach us was democracy at its best. You know, we elected\nrepresentatives and we were voting on everything from uh what kind of menu we were going\nto have to uh who was going to do what, uh, we even were required to take jobs, you know,\nthe grown-ups, not--the kids went to school. That, that was a well-organized uh little town of\none thousand people. Uh...",
        "Q: What were the living conditions like?",
        "A: The living conditions were barracks which were boarded up to fit family units. In other\nwords, they would take one large barrack and sub it into maybe three or four units. For\ninstance, there was five of us. My mother, father and myself and two sisters. And we were\ngiven two rooms and uh they had sink, one sink. You know they had put in some plumbing\nin there and uh we uh had no problems with that. The only thing that bothered some of us\nwas the snow. It would pile up ten ten feet high, you know. I had come from Adriatic coast\nwhich even in winter it's a very mild climate, and here this was snow covers the ground the\nend of September and you don't see the ground until late April or early May. So, this was uh\na little bit different for us. But I looked back on those two years that we spent there, uh a year\nand a half, as some of the very pleasant part of my youth. Uh in school we, most of us\nexcelled because we were really used to uh stringent demands on our academic performance,\nand we came to the United States here and the only, the only difficulty that we had was\nlearning the language. Well you learned the language under total immersion in six weeks,\nyou know. So we were doing pretty good and we made friends with some local people. Not\ntoo much because simply we were not allowed to go in and out. We just go to school and\nback. And later they would give us passes; Saturday afternoon we could go to a local movie,\nbut heck, they had movies inside for us, you know. Only, maybe not first-run movies but\nthere was something going on every night recreation-wise. It was really a pleasant life all\naround. . .",
        "Q: Did it turn out that most of the people there were Jewish?\ndirection of the War Refugee Board, which was established by executive order on January 22, 1944\nand active in transferring refugees from southern Italy to camps in North Africa and to a so-called\n\"free port\" at Fort Ontario in Oswego, New York.\n*In early 1942 more than 100,000 Japanese-Americans living along the West Coast of the United\nStates were deported to concentration camps 1n the interior.",
        "A: Yeah. There was, out of a thousand people when after all was said and done, some dropped\nout so there was about nine hundred and ninety-two people,\u2019 I would say nine hundred and\nfifty were Jewish and the thirty or so, forty were not. But we had people from I forget how\nmany countries, seventy countries. They were from all over. Oh, that was an interesting\nthing. You want to make an announcement like they would say there's going to be a movie\ntonight - and they would come and you have to say it first in German, because I guess\nGerman was the most widely understood language. And Serbo-Croatian is the language of\nYugoslavia. And there was about three hundred people from Yugoslavia. And logically so,\nbecause they, the route that people came, but uh, let's see, they, uh they were not too\npowerful I guess in our politicking within the camp but there was Italian was spoken because\nwe came from Italy. Yiddish was a very prominent language. Serbo-Croatian. Uh there were\na lot of Polish people that had left Poland and gone to Belgium, you know, through their uh\nwater route from Danzig and what not. And they spoke French and Polish and Yiddish. And\nuh it was like a United Nations walking on the streets there, except for the kids who spoke\nEnglish, and we tried not to speak our own languages. Anyway, that's, in a nutshell. . . .",
        "Q: .. the Jewish life was there in the camp?",
        "A: Oh, in the camp we had uh Jewish life of course. There were uh two synagogues. Like\nanything else, you have two Jews; you have three different opinions. And we had one\nconservative and the other one was ultra-orthodox and uh we had uh services, regular\nservices and we had a uh choir. I am pretty observant, I would say, and my family was, and\nuh I guess many people were not, so you knew there were always services at the Orthodox\n\"Shul\" [synagogue]. But ours was strictly Friday night or Saturday morning and it was a\nmilitary chapel and uh the way the chapel doors were made they had crosses on them, so\nsome people objected to worshiping there because they didn't feel comfortable with it. So\nthey started their own, you know, internal, but 1t was, Jewish life was not restricted or not\npromoted any more than anywhere else, but we had, Jewish uh papers were coming from\nNew York and uh I would say in camp the life was absolutely, uh was not only congenial but\nit was conducive to uh culture, uh cultural development and everything else. Educational\nprograms galore, you know. Recreation. It just uh, it was fantastic. Uh for some people who\nwere professionals this was a delay in their advancement, but for me I was moving right\nalong. I had finished fifth grade in Yugoslavia, and during the war like three years I hadn't\ngone to school, so five grades you don't retain very high education. So they put me here in\nseventh grade, and not only all that period that transpired that I didn't do anything\nacademically but also I was with uh older people, so six months I was moved to eighth grade\nand in the next six months I was in the ninth grade and so I was getting what they called high\nhonors and uh we were all pretty good. I wasn't the best. I mean there was, my friends, each\none was competing who was going to do better.",
        "Q: We have just a few minutes left. Uh, is there anything specific that you remember, any\n\u201d The official number was 982, 368 of whom were from Yugoslavia.\nincident from your time with the Partisans uh that you would like to share, or anything else\nthat you have not yet talked about?",
        "A: You know, let me see. There could be a few points. First of all, I--as we were talking earlier,\nI tried to remember--there there were some people who were uh compassionate and who\nwere good and helpful and did something for us. For one thing, the neighbors who came in\nthe middle of the night, knocked at the door and told us about the Germans coming; how\nthey knew it I don't know. I think they were connected uh with the local Nazi groups in some\nway. Uh the neighbors above us, they were strictly Nazis from way back, but anyway, these\nother people, they must have learned from them. They told us so, that may have saved our\nlives, my father's and mine. Also the Italian uh people whoever they were at the time, like if\nit weren't for them, I mean all these Jews who came from other parts of Europe that were\nsaved, if 1t weren't for them I don't know how many more would have perished. Uh but there\nwas an interesting episode uh during the Partisans. Uh, my father, I told you, he wasn't\nhandling it too well; the work was hard and all that, but he had a bad experience uh one time.\nUh, he's religious and every morning he would say his prayers. Well, uh he would go outside\nthe farm where we were living and do it, say it out loud, his prayer, and he would cover his\nhead with a kerchief, and he would put it around his ears to hold the kerchief like this, and a\nfarmer must have seen him, and he reported [him] to the Partisans. Now to put it in the\nperspective, there was a lot of problems with uh people uh, I mean the Partisans were never\nsafe because somebody would report them to the Germans and they would come and, you\nknow, the, the spies were all over, so this peasant thought that he was uncovering somebody\nthat was talking. He looked at my father and he noticed the ears. There was a a hanky over\nhis head, so he reported him and they came and took my father away, and this was a\nkangaroo court kind of thing, and uh they say, \"OK, admit that you were talking on the\nearphones and reporting to Nazis.\" He said, \"I'm Jewish. What do I need to tell them?\" And\nthey said, \"Comrade Danon, we know everything. We know it all. It's been told to us so you\ncan't hide it anymore. Admit it. It will be easier on you.\" And this is the thing that broke the\ncamel's back I guess, the straw that broke the camel's back, but there were incidents like that.\nUh a few of them you know, and that's why he left.",
        "Q: He just ran away at that point?",
        "A: Sort of, yeah.",
        "Q: Can you tell me anything about how the Jewish community coped with all these refugees\ncoming in?",
        "A: Oh yeah, that was interesting. Uh, the, all these refugees that were coming in--at first they\nwere on their own, but then later many of them just had no means of uh support, I think the\ninternational uh Jewish uh community stepped in, and I think it's B'nai B'rith was one of the\ngroups. Another one was uh Societ\u00e9 Isra\u00e9lite Mondiale--something like that--from\nSwitzerland. They were uh sending uh some money to the Jewish community in Split to\ndistribute. Third way was that the people who were coming in, they were, we, our family\nwas assigned two different families that would come and get their lunch. Uh, one family\nwould come three times a week, and another one would come three other days a week. You\nknow, in other words we would cook instead of for five people or six people, we would cook\nfor eleven people. And uh that's how it worked. That's how some sustained themselves.\nOthers had some, uh something that they had brought with them. Some had some gold coins\nand there would be a lot of trading and and some would go into some kind of business, uh\nbusiness meaning that they would go to one store and say, \"What are you selling? Maybe\nyou give me some samples,\" and they would go offer to another. I know one guy was uh\ntaking peanuts and roasting them and making little bags and selling them, you know. And it\nwas a meager existence, but they managed and of course this little support that they would\nget every two weeks and I remember there was once or twice that the money didn't come\nfrom Switzerland, so we, the locals, were asked to make a heavy contribution. Uh what 1s\nheavy, I don't know the numbers, but you know, enough so we can make the distribution at\nleast until something comes from Switzerland.",
        "Q: Where did these people live?",
        "A: Uh, that's the thing--some had families but uh after a while, you know, there's just no room\nand uh where the synagogue was, there was some--not synagogue, I'm sorry--where our club\nwas uh the social club was, the social club was filled with uh mattresses and uh blankets and\nthey slept on the floors and I guess they would rent a farm someplace and they would fill\nthirty, forty people in there.",

    "answers": [
        "A: OK. My name 1s Isaac Danon. They call me Mike--my nickname. I was born in Split,\u2019\nYugoslavia in 1929. I lived there with my family, my mother and father. I have three sisters.\nOne is older than me, two years older, Blanka. And my two younger sisters, one 1s Sarah--\nshe is about two years younger than me. And the youngest sister, her name is Esther. She 1s\nabout five years younger than I am. Split is a small town on the Adriatic coast of Yugoslavia,\nabout 50,000 population before the war. We lived there with uh there was about 200 other\nJewish families in town. We had a rather active Jewish life. We had our synagogue, was one\nsynagogue. We had a social club. I think it was called \"Yarden\" [Hebrew meaning \"Jordan\"].\nAnd we had our regular Zionist clubs. We had a lot of friends. Uh, the kids were going to\nschool. I was going, at that time, before the war, the last year of school that I went to was\nfirst Gymnasium which was an equivalent to fifth grade. And we had a lot of friends, both\nJewish and non-Jewish friends. The, I don't remember any particular uh antisemitism being\npresent in our community. Maybe some individual cases here and there, but not organized\nand not uh surely, not uh legal type. Although as the things got worse in Europe, there was\nmore activity by some groups that were sympathetic to the Nazis, but uh I belonged to some\nuh clubs and some organizations like uh like you would have here, Boy Scouts, but it was\nmostly a national organization for sports and patriotism and there was no antisemitism that I\ncan remember. The war came to Yugoslavia in early 1941. We first were hit by that when\nmy father was drafted into the service, into the Army. They have like a general mobilization.\nHe was forty, but they took him anyway. And uh there was some kind of a palace coup, I\nguess. The King took over the reign of the government. He was a small boy, became 18,\ntook over the government and broke relations with Germany and the Axis and we knew\nthings were going to happen then. And sure enough about two, three weeks later, the\nGerman and Italian forces invaded our country. We were very lucky that we lived in the part\nthat has been claimed by Italy for a long, long time--Dalmatian Province, or the coast along\nthe Adriatic. And when...of course, when they [the Italians] attacked, they took the country\nover in less than two weeks; and the Italians occupied that part. So that's one good thing that\nhappened. When the Italians took over the country, that part of the country, I can describe\nthe occupation as being benign. We as Jews had the same difficulties or same lack of\nproblems as the rest of the local population. There were shortages of food and other\nmaterials and rationing which you expect with a war, but otherwise we didn't fare much\nworse than the rest of the population, with some exceptions, let me say. For one thing uh\nJews could not work in the public life. They couldn't be teachers or officials of any kind.\nThey couldn't work in the offices. And we, the kids, we were not allowed to go to school.\nBut a little ingenuity solved that problem. We took the Jewish teachers and we formed\nJewish schools and that took care of that. I unfortunately couldn't go to school because my\n' Also known as Spljet among some Dalmatian speakers of Serbo-Croatian, and Spalato among\nItalian speakers.\nfather needed me in our business. We had a, I guess you could call it a dry goods store. Very\nsmall one uh and most of the Jewish community was involved in either some type of small\ntrades or they were in some of the professions, although we did have some that were rather\npoor in the community. But anyway, uh during the Italian occupation our life was not too\nbad with some minor exceptions. As uh I think back, occasionally they would flood the city\nwith some \"antisemitic\" slogans. I remember some of the instances where my uncle who was\na barber, they came with a big sign says, \"Jews are not welcome here,\" and they wanted him\nto put it in his window. And he says, \"OK, you want me to put that. Fine. I'll put it and here\nare my keys and here are the scissors. You take over. I'm Jewish.\" So, we had these little\ninstances. One case that I remember and that was the worst case that happened was right\nafter my bar mitzvah was one Saturday and the following Friday; I guess there was some\nkind of activity. The Germans were coming to help the Italians celebrate, so they [the\nItalians] had to demonstrate how good they were as far as the Germans are concerned. So the\nlocal Fascists came to synagogue and asked everybody to leave, and as people were leaving,\nthey were hitting them with clubs of the uh rifles and kicking them and few little things like\nthat. Although I do remember in my, some older people that were there, they would go out,\nthen they wouldn't bother them. But the worst thing was next morning when we came, you\nknow, we saw what was happening, we were afraid that they might come and take us or\nsomething like that, but so we went early in the morning and we saw they had taken all the\nthings out of the synagogue, the torahs, the books and they put them in the public square and\nthey had a big bonfire. Uh the synagogue was 1n a section called the ghetto which was the\nreal ghetto, the type uh that, uh the word itself means, you know, where the Jewish were\nkept, but this was right outside the public square so most of the Jews didn't live there. I mean\nhardly anybody, but the synagogue was there because it was a very very old one. Uh\nanyway, when we came, we saw that, and then we went to our store and we saw somebody\nwas trying to break in, but our store was so small we didn't even have the glass plates, so\nnothing happened. But they did go around and broke the windows of the Jewish stores and\nthey looted the stuff, so that was our \"Kristallnacht.\" But the following day the life went on\nas though nothing happened and we just didn't have a synagogue anymore. But during the\nwhole period before that, like more than a year that the Italians had occupied the country...uh\nthat portion of the country, we lived uh peacefully and normally except for some of these\ninstances. In fact, uh a lot of immigrants--a lot of Jews that were able to escape from other\nparts of the country that were occupied by Germans and \"their quislings\"--they also came to\nthis town and this area. And they found a haven over there. Uh as I mentioned earlier, there\nwas about two hundred uh Jewish families in town. Well, after a few months the number\nswelled to four or five thousand, and then maybe up to ten thousand people that came from\nother places and at that point the Italians started getting panicky. The Italian authorities, they\nasked the Jewish community to disperse them throughout the area that they [the Italians]\ncontrolled, and then finally they started taking them away to, I guess we can call them\ninternment centers. Both, different areas along the occupied coast and also in Italy proper.\nUh I didn't think of this too much, but Italians were really, uh what shall I say, they helped\nmany people. They saved us for one thing, and they and many times when the Germans\nwere, their quislings, the Croatians, they wanted to occupy certain towns or they wanted to\ntake certain Jews away to concentration camps, the Italians would step in and say, \"This 1s\nour area and you can't cross.\" And it was, for them it was, you know, a territorial issue\nwhich for us it was a case of life or death. But our problems really started after the fall of\nItaly. That's when uh Mussolini fell, of course, and the Italians uh signed a, I guess uh - what\nis it - they capitulated to the Allied troops. Well, in these areas that were occupied by Italians\nbecame like uh free areas and it was free-for-all, who was going to grab what. The Partisans\u201d\ncame out of the mountains and they took over some. The, the Croatian quislings took some\nover. The Germans took some, but the town where we lived was taken over by the Partisans,\nuh the underground resistance. They came out and I guess they compromised themselves, the\nlocal population who helped them and who didn't. And I found out that my older sister, she\nhad been working in the underground which we didn't know about even though my sister\nand I were quite close. But at that time she was uh less than sixteen years old and but there\nwas things to do for everybody during the war. Anyway, uh my sister at that point joined the\nPartisans and so did many uh local youths. They, the Partisans were trying to get them to join\nthem and go into the mountains and uh I would say a lot of them did join, but we remained in\nthe city and the Partisans tried to hold that city. They had taken, they had uh disarmed the\nItalian Army. They had some, some arms now, and the new recruits that had joined them, so\nthey were going to defend the city, and they tried that for two, three weeks, but the German\ntroops just came over with their full armor and everything and they took over the city, but\nnot before they came in, we were, we [a]wakened in the middle of the night by neighbors\nbanging at the door and saying - I remember one lady yelling, \"Mr. Danon, Mr. Danon,\" to\nmy father--he was the mister--anyway, \"Mr. Danon, the Germans are coming.\" So we knew\nthat the Germans always take the men first and we were ready to escape. My father and I, we\nhad our backpacks all packed in advance. We put them on, said goodbye to my mother and\nmy sisters and we went away. That's the last time we saw our home. We went into the\nmountains. And uh we joined the Partisans there. At first not as fighters, but we just traveled\nwith them and did what ever could be done and we traveled with them for a couple of\nmonths through the mountains. This was, you, you hide during the daytime and you tippy-\ntoe at night crossing German lines maybe several times, you know, going from one place to\nanother until we arrived to one of the islands uh on the coast. Actually, what people were\ndoing, they were going to the mountains and they would come to the coast and they would\nuh maybe there would be a little uh rowboat or a little junk and in the middle of the night\nthey would go aboard one of these and go to the, one of the islands. Only the islands weren't\nsafe because Germans could always come over there too. Now we went to one of these\nislands and we were with the Partisans there and my father and I were, I guess I won't call it\nconscriptive--we were regular military unit at that time. Uh, I was assigned to a machine\nshop where we repaired ammunition and other equipment, automotive and what not, and my\nfather was uh, I remember they called this the, the duty that they assigned to him--\"ekonom,\"\nwhich, uh, meant supply sergeant. And uh we were there for four, five months, I guess. Time\njust, it's not too clearly in my mind right now.\n* Communist resistance forces led by Joseph Broz Tito.",
        "A: Well, the island's called Hvar, H - V - A-R. I can't pronounce 1's too well. Uh and it's a\nrelatively large island. It had two little cities and the one where we were in was called\nStarigrad, which means old city. Uh, anyway one time the Germans did invade that island\nand there was fear because there was not too much in the way of defense. Uh, and this was in\nthe middle of the war. The Allies were uh stuck down southern Italy. Uh, there was, uh I\nguess we all read about the Monte Cassino\u2019 or wherever they were, they couldn't move\nforward and uh there was nothing happening anywhere else. Even the Russians, the Russian\nfront had stalemated, been stalemated for a while, so this was middle of the war and it could\nhave gone either way and we were pretty fearful at the time. Well, anyway, my father and I\nguess he wasn't having a very easy time of it. Uh, first the work was hard for him and and\nthere wasn't enough food and the people who depended on him to obtain food, like supply\nsergeant meant getting flour and making sure the bread was made and uh you know other\nfood uh was provided and clothing and what not--they were always complaining and uh they\nwere blaming him for all the shortages and so I remember uh he somehow disappeared or--I\ndidn't see him for several days and they kept pestering me, uh you know--\"Where is your\nfather? What happened?\" This and that. I didn't know. And I guess my father had left. He\nhad uh gone some other route. But two weeks later I received a very official uh teletype\ntelling me to report to another island and report myself to the command of the hospital unit. I\nhad no idea what that was all about. Well, I made arrangements to go there, and this was\nanother island called Vis, V - I - S. And this island was uh formed into a strong point by the\nPartisans. It was the furtherest [farthest] island from Yugoslavian coast and closest to Italian\ncoast, closest to the point where the Allied troops were. So this was used by the Allied troops\nto help the Partisans. At this point, if I can introduce a little politics here, uh the Allies had\nstarted recognizing the Partisans as the fighting force as opposed to other, there was a fellow\nby the name of Dra_a Mihailovi_,* who was left by the King uh to, I guess, to organize\nresistance, but he evidently didn't do the job that they expected, or maybe there were political\ndifferences and the Partisans were communist-oriented and the other ones were uh for\nmonarchy and so there was a lot of internal struggle, but let me get away from that. But uh\nanyway the Allies had started recognizing and helping the Partisans. So, this uh island was\nmade into a fortress. They used that to bring the supplies and also there was another point\nthat the Allies were trying to convey a message to the Germans that they were going to open\na new front, a second front, at the Balkans and come through there, so they were\nencouraging the local population to escape, and the local population had developed like an\nunderground railroad you can almost call it. They would get themselves to the coast and\nfrom the coastline they would come by junks to these, to this particular island and the uh\nBritish Navy would come and pick them up there and take them to Italy, where they had like\n* Monte Cassino was the strong point of a German defensive line that delayed the Allied advance\non Rome until June 1944.\n* Dragoljub (Dra_a) Mihailovi_ (also Mihajlovi_) was the leader of the _etniks, an anticommunist\nSerbian resistance force loyal to the royal Yugoslav government-in-exile.\nI would call it regroupment points. They would create uh units of uh refugees, I guess by\nlocation, and take them to Egypt, to the desert to wait for the end of the war. Well, uh when I\ncame, I gotta go back now to my tele... telegram that I received. When I presented myself\nthere, that actually my father had sent it to get me to come there and I met him there again\nand he told me that he has, he had joined this group that was going to Egypt and he was\ngoing to go with the troops and he told me to sign up for it also at the first opportunity and\nwe'll meet there. And I did that and I know he went one time and uh the first opportunity that\nI had when the British uh ship came--uh, they were small PT boats or something that would\npick up thirty, forty people, uh you know, pile us up and go across the Adriatic and we went\nuh over there. I went there with the British to a...the town was called Bari, B - A - R - I.\nThere was a big city, where all the refugees were coming but from there they would ship us\nby trucks or trains, mostly trucks, to the other side and further [farther] down south, southern\ntip of Italy where there were a lot of uh summer homes from the rich northern Italian people.\nThis was in the winter. So they would organize these groups and from there they would take\nthem to Naples and to Egypt from there. Well, anyway, that's where I, I was taken and I met\nmy father there again and we were in those camps uh, waiting for our shipment to Egypt.\nWhile we were there, uh there were many people incidentally. By the thousands they were\ncoming from all over. While we were there, we learned that my mother's two sisters were\nalso there in the vicinity and my mother's brother was in Bari uh, with his family, so we had\nsome family that was still alive. Uh, if, if 1 can go back a little bit, uh--this was about my\nfamily, my parent's family. My parents' family, both of them came from a town called\nSarajevo in Yugoslavia. Well, my mother's parents came in the early '90's. They came down\nto Split which was our home town, and they settled there and they had uh whatever they did-\n-I don't remember now--but as I remember my grandfather, he was the \"shamas\" [sexton] at\nour synagogue. That was his occupation. But as the children grew up they got married and\nsome went to different locations, and one of my, two of my mother's sisters went back to\nSarajevo. Uh so when the war broke out, they were in Sarajevo. So one of them was able to\ncome down to Split and stay with the rest of the family, and they were saved. The other one\nperished in the war. On my father's side, he had his parents and five brothers. They were also\nin Sarajevo but some of them lived right outside Sarajevo, in a little town and and none of\nthem were saved. They all perished with one exception, my Uncle David, my father's brother\nwho was in the [Yugoslav] Army during the mobilization and the Germans captured them\nand they shipped them someplace wherever they had their Army prisoners and I guess he\npassed as a non-Jew and that's how when the war ended when some of them were\nrepatriated, he was still alive. So when we were talking about who was able to be saved and\nwho wasn't, my father counted twenty-eight of his relatives that died. Relatives meaning\nmother, father, brothers, sister-in-laws [sic] and their children. So but anyway, back to where\nwe were in Italy. We lived there uh for a couple of weeks and then when it was time to go to\nEgypt my father got cold feet and he says I'm not going to the desert. So in the morning\nwhen they were gathering us all to go to Egypt, my father got me out of bed and we left the\ngroup. We booked, uh took a horse and buggy from a local uh farmer. He took us to the\nnearest train station, we boarded the train station and we went to the town where he dropped\nus off. It's a town called Lecci [Lecce], L - E- C- C - I [E], in Italy. It's near Bari but maybe\nabout fifteen miles or so. Anyway, and that's where we settled and my father got a job there\nwith the Allied occupation forces as a uh censor, uh read the mail, and I was just hanging\naround the streets. I had friends. I had, uh don't forget I was thirteen years old there and then.\nI had a uniform that I brought with me which was an American or British soldier's uniform,\nlike an Eisenhower jacket, a military thing you know and I would parade there with my\nfriends enjoying life, you know, uh, uh as a thirteen year old would, uh showing off my\nclothes, you know. Well anyway uh there was very uneventful at the time and then, this was\nJune '44, the end of June. Uh, they [the Western Allies] already had, they opened a new front\nin Normandy\u201d and all that and we heard that there was an invitation from the American\ngovernment for a thousand people, a thousand displaced persons to come to United States\nand uh OK, we said, \"Let's go. Shall we go, yeah.\" We signed up and this was quick like\nyou know. They took our names. I understand there was a lot of people who signed up but\nonly a thousand could go. Uh we didn't know for sure whether it was just Jewish or not, but\nanyway we signed up and we were getting ready to go and three days before we were ready\nto leave, we learned that my mother and two sisters had come to Bari also. Now this is a\nstory in itself the way the refugees would uh--it's almost like uh telephone lines, you know.\nYou would go into the group and you say, \"Is anybody here from such and such a place?\"\nAnd they say, \"No, we are not, but we know somebody who is,\" you know, and we know so\nand so and oh yeah, but he knows somebody who knows somebody. And that's how we all\nmet you know, after the war. And that's how my mother when she came with one of the\ngroups uh, you know, the British naval vessel, and they told her that we know somebody\nwho is also from Split who may be related to you, you know. And they said, \"Well, his name\nis so and so,\" and he says, \"That's my brother,\" you know. So we all, we got together and\nwithin the next three days the miracle of bureaucracy--they were able to clear my mother and\nmy two sisters and we, uh we were picked up at one point in Bari and we boarded trains, uh\ndifferent people are coming from different parts of southern Italy and we went to Naples uh\nin trucks. Well, we stopped off for three days for delousing sessions and all that. Boarded a\nship and one of the ships, uh I forgot its name, uh Henry something or other, but it was a ship\nthat was taking the American soldiers back and it was one of the regular troop ships and we\nwere given one little corner with uh, uh, what do you call these sleeping quarters, hammocks,\nyeah, five deep, yeah. And uh we waited in Naples for enough ships so they can form a\nconvoy; and we departed from there near the end of July. Thirteen days uh on the sea.\nSeveral times they thought they saw the German U- boats, and they went through the routine\nof putting that fog, artificial fog. We as kids, we enjoyed all that. I was fourteen by that time.\nOn August 3rd, 1944, we landed in New York Harbor. I believe it's Bayonne or some place,\nwherever the troop shipments were uh being unloaded. And we got into trains there and we\nwent overnight. Train stopped in front of a military camp. We got out; and this was upstate\nNew York, near a town called Oswego. This was an old Army base called Fort Ontario. And\nthat's where we spent next year and a half. Uh I can tell you about our life over there, if you\nwant to hear it. Well, uh first, uh well, this was summer time of course, August then. In\nSeptember was when the schools opened. We were invited to join the schools in the United\nStates. None of us knew any English at the time. I speak a few foreign languages but English\n\u00b0 Anglo-American-Canadian forces landed on the Normandy Peninsula of France on June 6, 1944.\nwas not one of them. But anyway we started going to school, and our, our parents were uh\njust staying there. What bothered us mostly was the fence. We were not allowed to go out\nexcept to go to school. We had little passes and we had to return, sign in and out. That was a\nlittle disappointing. But basically that's uh what happened. And we spent there until the war\nwas over actually, and then I guess there was a lot of discussion whether we should go back\nor not. Uh we had signed that we, before we came we had signed uh what kind of agreement\nwith the American government that we were going to stay there for the duration of the war,\nand then go back. And uh, when the war was over I guess we were being asked whether we\nwanted to go back. Some people did go immediately because they left their, part of their\nfamilies. But uh many of us, most of us, wanted to stay in the United States. So there was a\nlot of politicking and this is another story altogether and this was documented in this uh book\nthat uh was written, let's see, the book is called \"Haven,\" \"The Haven,\" and it was written by\nRuth Gruber.\u00b0 She was closely involved in that so she would know more about that.",
        "A: No, my father was, uh actually what happened to my father - he was demoralized at the end\nof the war. Uh he had this little business that he ran in Split during the war and uh he, when\nwe left, he knew that everything was gone. All the lifetime's work. And his family was all\ngone. They were killed. And he just gave up on everything. So even when we came out, uh\nafter we were allowed to remain in United States, he couldn't do anything. He didn't work or\nanything else. It was uh, he was psychologically drained. I wanted to mention something else\nabout my sisters and my mother. After my father and I had left, we didn't know what has\nhappened or how they were going to manage. All we knew is that Germans usually take the\nmen first and women hopefully uh later or whatever, but anyway we were hoping that things\ncould work out. Well, my sisters and my mother told me later their story and maybe I can\nbring out some of those points. Uh, my mother was in a panic and had these two younger\nsisters as I mentioned: my next younger sister, Sarah, she was nine year old and then this\nwas the youngest one, Esther, six years old. And I understand that my nine-year old sister\nwas the hero of the family. She led everybody along. She says, \"OK, this is not the place. It's\nnot safe here. Let's go into hiding.\" And she forced my mother to make arrangements to go\ninto hiding. First they stayed wherever our apartment was. Then somebody else took them\nin, similar to the story of Anne Frank, while the Germans were around, you know. They\nwere still hiding and they would go outside in the streets and see what was happening, and\nuh that wasn't too safe. Uh then they talked to a person who had a farm like a--this was lots\nof vineyards in that part of the country. They had a big uh vineyard, maybe about thirty, forty\nmiles from the city, so they had friends who had friends and they took them to this farm\nwhich is, you know, you're away from civilization. Nobody comes there. So they were safe\nthere for a while and my mother had some money that uh we were able to save up and I\nremember when my father and I left, they split up the money, hopefully uh in case either side\n\u00b0 Ruth Gruber, Haven: The Unknown Story of 1,000 World War II Refugees (New York:\nCoward-McCann, 1983).\nneeded you know. So uh my mother was paying them whatever, and then after a while these\npeople were also afraid, so they wouldn't keep my parents any more so my sister, she took\nmy other sister by one hand and my mother by another, and they went into the mountains\nand they traveled on foot without shoes, you know--that's the kind of stuff--through, well\nthere were no roads. Even today Yugoslavia doesn't have any roads to speak of, but you\nknow, you go through the donkey trails and uh they ended up the same way that we did. The\nsame spot, only nine months later. That's my mother and my two younger sisters. My older\nsister, she, after the fall of Italy, she joined the Partisan fighting unit and she was uh she's,\nright now she is 4'10\" in high heels (laughter), so she's a little girl but anyway she was there\ncarrying her load and uh she tells a story about how they would attack from one side and\nthey went around the other side of the mountain and attacked the Germans from the other\nside to give the impression that there was more of them. And she got wounded in the leg and\nshe still has problems with that leg. Uh I, occasionally I would ask her stories about uh the\nwar, you know, and they had all these what they called German offensive. First offensive,\nsecond offensive, sixth offensive, and she was in all of them as a fighting Partisan. They had\nboth men and women. There was no distinction at the time. Incidentally this sister of mine,\nher name is Blanka, she never came to United States. She stayed there, but I guess she had a\npretty pleasant life after the war. The first wasn't so, and then she got married and they\ntraveled throughout the world and she lived in India and Cairo and uh, uh some place in\nAfrica--I just couldn't keep track of all the places. She studied in Moscow and in Italy and\nshe's been to Israel a few times. She comes here every other year, so she didn't have such a\nbad life after that, but anyway .. .",
        "A: Oh, OK. Sure. In Fort Ontario, that was when we first came, we were a bunch of, oh what\nshould I say, proud kids. We were not going to let anybody give us the impression that we\nare poor and uh we needed help from anybody. See, it was little thing psychologically that\nwhen we came here, we were greeted, welcomed and all that. But Americans are the most\ngenerous people in the world is beyond question. But they are also naive, so they would ask\nus questions like uh, \"You see this--this is bread. Did you ever eat this before?\" You know\nkind of thing--I mean it's mind-boggling. And that puts us on the defensive. So we would\nsay, \"Oh, sure, we had it good on the other side,\" and uh we were a little bit--what should I\nsay--snotty kids. Anyway so we had this fence that prevented us from going outside and that\nbothered us a little bit. And this was a military camp. There was uh ample opportunity for\nsports and uh food uh like we hadn't seen before. I mean quantities, you know. We were just\ncoming from the hungry Europe, so life was pretty good.",
        "A: Uh, no. What they did--this was put under what they called War Relocation Authority.\u2019 They\n\u2019 The War Relocation Authority was charged with administering Fort Ontario under the overrall\ncreated a unit called Emergency Refugee Shelter under the War Relocation Authority which\nwas part of the Department of the Interior. This is the very same group that interned the\nJapanese during the war, if you are familiar with that story.\u00ae Well, anyway, they were in\ncharge of us. The, the military brought us over to the United States, but then it was handed\nover to the War Relocation Authority. And they had a civilian administrator that was\nappointed by this unit, uh by the Authority. Uh, it was a very democratically-run\norganization. One thing they did teach us was democracy at its best. You know, we elected\nrepresentatives and we were voting on everything from uh what kind of menu we were going\nto have to uh who was going to do what, uh, we even were required to take jobs, you know,\nthe grown-ups, not--the kids went to school. That, that was a well-organized uh little town of\none thousand people. Uh...",
        "A: The living conditions were barracks which were boarded up to fit family units. In other\nwords, they would take one large barrack and sub it into maybe three or four units. For\ninstance, there was five of us. My mother, father and myself and two sisters. And we were\ngiven two rooms and uh they had sink, one sink. You know they had put in some plumbing\nin there and uh we uh had no problems with that. The only thing that bothered some of us\nwas the snow. It would pile up ten ten feet high, you know. I had come from Adriatic coast\nwhich even in winter it's a very mild climate, and here this was snow covers the ground the\nend of September and you don't see the ground until late April or early May. So, this was uh\na little bit different for us. But I looked back on those two years that we spent there, uh a year\nand a half, as some of the very pleasant part of my youth. Uh in school we, most of us\nexcelled because we were really used to uh stringent demands on our academic performance,\nand we came to the United States here and the only, the only difficulty that we had was\nlearning the language. Well you learned the language under total immersion in six weeks,\nyou know. So we were doing pretty good and we made friends with some local people. Not\ntoo much because simply we were not allowed to go in and out. We just go to school and\nback. And later they would give us passes; Saturday afternoon we could go to a local movie,\nbut heck, they had movies inside for us, you know. Only, maybe not first-run movies but\nthere was something going on every night recreation-wise. It was really a pleasant life all\naround. . .\ndirection of the War Refugee Board, which was established by executive order on January 22, 1944\nand active in transferring refugees from southern Italy to camps in North Africa and to a so-called\n\"free port\" at Fort Ontario in Oswego, New York.\n*In early 1942 more than 100,000 Japanese-Americans living along the West Coast of the United\nStates were deported to concentration camps 1n the interior.",
        "A: Yeah. There was, out of a thousand people when after all was said and done, some dropped\nout so there was about nine hundred and ninety-two people,\u2019 I would say nine hundred and\nfifty were Jewish and the thirty or so, forty were not. But we had people from I forget how\nmany countries, seventy countries. They were from all over. Oh, that was an interesting\nthing. You want to make an announcement like they would say there's going to be a movie\ntonight - and they would come and you have to say it first in German, because I guess\nGerman was the most widely understood language. And Serbo-Croatian is the language of\nYugoslavia. And there was about three hundred people from Yugoslavia. And logically so,\nbecause they, the route that people came, but uh, let's see, they, uh they were not too\npowerful I guess in our politicking within the camp but there was Italian was spoken because\nwe came from Italy. Yiddish was a very prominent language. Serbo-Croatian. Uh there were\na lot of Polish people that had left Poland and gone to Belgium, you know, through their uh\nwater route from Danzig and what not. And they spoke French and Polish and Yiddish. And\nuh it was like a United Nations walking on the streets there, except for the kids who spoke\nEnglish, and we tried not to speak our own languages. Anyway, that's, in a nutshell. . . .",
        "A: Oh, in the camp we had uh Jewish life of course. There were uh two synagogues. Like\nanything else, you have two Jews; you have three different opinions. And we had one\nconservative and the other one was ultra-orthodox and uh we had uh services, regular\nservices and we had a uh choir. I am pretty observant, I would say, and my family was, and\nuh I guess many people were not, so you knew there were always services at the Orthodox\n\"Shul\" [synagogue]. But ours was strictly Friday night or Saturday morning and it was a\nmilitary chapel and uh the way the chapel doors were made they had crosses on them, so\nsome people objected to worshiping there because they didn't feel comfortable with it. So\nthey started their own, you know, internal, but 1t was, Jewish life was not restricted or not\npromoted any more than anywhere else, but we had, Jewish uh papers were coming from\nNew York and uh I would say in camp the life was absolutely, uh was not only congenial but\nit was conducive to uh culture, uh cultural development and everything else. Educational\nprograms galore, you know. Recreation. It just uh, it was fantastic. Uh for some people who\nwere professionals this was a delay in their advancement, but for me I was moving right\nalong. I had finished fifth grade in Yugoslavia, and during the war like three years I hadn't\ngone to school, so five grades you don't retain very high education. So they put me here in\nseventh grade, and not only all that period that transpired that I didn't do anything\nacademically but also I was with uh older people, so six months I was moved to eighth grade\nand in the next six months I was in the ninth grade and so I was getting what they called high\nhonors and uh we were all pretty good. I wasn't the best. I mean there was, my friends, each\none was competing who was going to do better.\n\u201d The official number was 982, 368 of whom were from Yugoslavia.\nincident from your time with the Partisans uh that you would like to share, or anything else\nthat you have not yet talked about?",
        "A: You know, let me see. There could be a few points. First of all, I--as we were talking earlier,\nI tried to remember--there there were some people who were uh compassionate and who\nwere good and helpful and did something for us. For one thing, the neighbors who came in\nthe middle of the night, knocked at the door and told us about the Germans coming; how\nthey knew it I don't know. I think they were connected uh with the local Nazi groups in some\nway. Uh the neighbors above us, they were strictly Nazis from way back, but anyway, these\nother people, they must have learned from them. They told us so, that may have saved our\nlives, my father's and mine. Also the Italian uh people whoever they were at the time, like if\nit weren't for them, I mean all these Jews who came from other parts of Europe that were\nsaved, if 1t weren't for them I don't know how many more would have perished. Uh but there\nwas an interesting episode uh during the Partisans. Uh, my father, I told you, he wasn't\nhandling it too well; the work was hard and all that, but he had a bad experience uh one time.\nUh, he's religious and every morning he would say his prayers. Well, uh he would go outside\nthe farm where we were living and do it, say it out loud, his prayer, and he would cover his\nhead with a kerchief, and he would put it around his ears to hold the kerchief like this, and a\nfarmer must have seen him, and he reported [him] to the Partisans. Now to put it in the\nperspective, there was a lot of problems with uh people uh, I mean the Partisans were never\nsafe because somebody would report them to the Germans and they would come and, you\nknow, the, the spies were all over, so this peasant thought that he was uncovering somebody\nthat was talking. He looked at my father and he noticed the ears. There was a a hanky over\nhis head, so he reported him and they came and took my father away, and this was a\nkangaroo court kind of thing, and uh they say, \"OK, admit that you were talking on the\nearphones and reporting to Nazis.\" He said, \"I'm Jewish. What do I need to tell them?\" And\nthey said, \"Comrade Danon, we know everything. We know it all. It's been told to us so you\ncan't hide it anymore. Admit it. It will be easier on you.\" And this is the thing that broke the\ncamel's back I guess, the straw that broke the camel's back, but there were incidents like that.\nUh a few of them you know, and that's why he left.",
        "A: Sort of, yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, that was interesting. Uh, the, all these refugees that were coming in--at first they\nwere on their own, but then later many of them just had no means of uh support, I think the\ninternational uh Jewish uh community stepped in, and I think it's B'nai B'rith was one of the\ngroups. Another one was uh Societ\u00e9 Isra\u00e9lite Mondiale--something like that--from\nSwitzerland. They were uh sending uh some money to the Jewish community in Split to\ndistribute. Third way was that the people who were coming in, they were, we, our family\nwas assigned two different families that would come and get their lunch. Uh, one family\nwould come three times a week, and another one would come three other days a week. You\nknow, in other words we would cook instead of for five people or six people, we would cook\nfor eleven people. And uh that's how it worked. That's how some sustained themselves.\nOthers had some, uh something that they had brought with them. Some had some gold coins\nand there would be a lot of trading and and some would go into some kind of business, uh\nbusiness meaning that they would go to one store and say, \"What are you selling? Maybe\nyou give me some samples,\" and they would go offer to another. I know one guy was uh\ntaking peanuts and roasting them and making little bags and selling them, you know. And it\nwas a meager existence, but they managed and of course this little support that they would\nget every two weeks and I remember there was once or twice that the money didn't come\nfrom Switzerland, so we, the locals, were asked to make a heavy contribution. Uh what 1s\nheavy, I don't know the numbers, but you know, enough so we can make the distribution at\nleast until something comes from Switzerland.",
        "A: Uh, that's the thing--some had families but uh after a while, you know, there's just no room\nand uh where the synagogue was, there was some--not synagogue, I'm sorry--where our club\nwas uh the social club was, the social club was filled with uh mattresses and uh blankets and\nthey slept on the floors and I guess they would rent a farm someplace and they would fill\nthirty, forty people in there.",
        "A: You're welcome. I enjoyed talking to you.\n"
