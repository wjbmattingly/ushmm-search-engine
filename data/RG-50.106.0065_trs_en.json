        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nHerbert Bitter, conducted by Gail Schwartz on May 19th, 1997, at the Holocaust\nMuseum. This is Tape Number 1, Side A: What is your full name?",
        "Answer: Herbert Jerome Bitter.",
        "Q: And where were you born and when were you born?",
        "A: Born in New York City, August 4th, 1919.",
        "Q: Let's talk a little bit about your family background. Where did your family come\nfrom?",
        "A: My parents came -- My biological parents came from Romania, which I understand\nis now Austria. And then my father remarried. My other mother came from Russia,\nMinsk in Russia. Both came over about \u2014 all three of them came over about the same\ntime, 1914, 1913, something like that.",
        "Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters? Do you have any?",
        "A: Ihave one brother, who 1s 84 years old, in Florida; I have a half sister who lives in\nNew York; and then I had a stepbrother who passed away about seven, eight years ago.",
        "Q: Let's talk right now a little bit about your childhood. When you said \"New York\nCity,\" whereabouts in New York?",
        "A: Manhattan.",
        "Q: And what kind of schooling did you have?",
        "A: I went through high school, and that's as far as I went. Abraham Lincoln High\nSchool in Brooklyn and James Monroe High School in the Bronx. Those were the two\nhigh schools I went to. My parents kept moving around because my father was a grocer,\nkept selling one store, moving to another borough, and so on and so forth.",
        "Q: How would you describe your family? Was it a very close family?",
        "A: Not close, but a loving family. My father -- my mother passed away when I was five\nyears old and my father remarried two years later. So there were two years that I was sort\nof kicked around from relative to relative. And some of them didn't want me because I\nwasn't a very nice child, actually.",
        "Q: What do you mean by that?",
        "A: Well, I was a little wild, a little cantankerous. As a matter of fact, my mother always\nused to say, \"Don't worry, you'll have children.\" I had a son who was just as wild as I\nwas.",
        "Q: How religious was your family?",
        "A: My mother -- my second mother was a Hebrew school teacher. And the truth is, I\ngot so much of religion that as soon as I graduated -- rather, had my bar mitzvah -- I quit\nthe synagogue. And that was it. That was the end of my Jewish education.",
        "Q: Did you have any other feelings about being Jewish at that time?",
        "A: I didn't like being Jewish. I really didn't. Only because I had so much of it. And I\nwent to a Hebrew school where the old people used to look at young kids as Americana\nfailed. I don't know if you understand Yiddish. Wild animals. Because we want through\nthe halls of the Hebrew school. And I just couldn't wait to get out of there. So my\nHebrew education was very, very nil until I got into the service. There, I found out that it\nwas pleasant. We discussed history with the chaplains and I began to find my religion --\nnot that I was ever religious, but I began to find out a little bit about Judaism at that time.",
        "Q: When you say you went to Hebrew school, was that an after-school Hebrew school\nand you went to regular elementary school?",
        "A: After-school Hebrew school.",
        "Q: What languages did you speak at home?",
        "A: My parents spoke Yiddish, and of course I never knew I could talk Yiddish until I\ngot into the service in Germany. And that's where I began to speak half German, half\nYiddish. That consists of my Yiddish today. And it was only because my parents used to\nspeak Yiddish in the house all the time that I sort of picked it up without realizing I could\ntalk Yiddish.",
        "Q: Did you have friends that were not Jewish?",
        "A: Some. Not too many. I lived in Jewish neighborhoods most of the time, but I did\nhave some.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism as a child?",
        "A: Not really, because living in a Jewish neighborhood, I thought the whole world was\nJewish.",
        "Q: Allright. Well, let's move on now. Did you have any other interests, any hobbies,\nany sports?",
        "A: Well, in school I was on track, baseball, the usual things. Nothing outstanding. I\nwas never a real good athlete, so to speak, but I enjoyed athletics.",
        "Q: Were you close to your siblings?",
        "A: No. My brother, who's six years older than I, lived his own life. He was always\nsingle. He just got married maybe 15 years ago. He was always with the social bit. And\nwe were never a close family. It was only after I got married that I began to have a\nfamily and a close family, my wife's family, my own family.",
        "Q: Now, you've graduated from high school?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what did you do?",
        "A: I went to work carrying the bags of a jewelry salesman. And it was quite an\nexperience, and I did that for about a year or two. And then I went to work for a jewelry\ncompany. And for the beginning of my life before the service, that's about all I did,\nworking for jewelry companies, because that's where my experience lie. And then I went\ninto the service.",
        "Q: We're talking now probably around 1937, I guess, when you graduated from high\nschool.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What was your knowledge of Hitler at that point, or what was your knowledge of\nwhat was happening in Europe?",
        "A: Very little or nothing at all. I only realized -- that's very interesting. I only realized\nwhat could be going on in Europe when I was in the service. And I remember sitting in a\nJeep and reading the Stars and Stripes newspaper that they found out \u2014 I think it was in\nPoland, that they realized that Jews were being tortured. And they began to explain to us\nas to how the torture was going to be. And I read it. And I'm Jewish. And I put the paper\naway and I went about my business. It never had any effect on me whatever, at all, until\nof course I went into the concentration camp. And then I became Jewish.",
        "Q: So you were not aware of restrictions in Europe on the Jews in the mid '30s?",
        "A: Some. I mean, I can't say I was completely ignorant of what was going on. I knew\nthat the Jews were having trouble. As a matter of fact, we had relatives in Europe, my\nfather did. I'm close to them today, as a matter of fact. And my father was trying to help\nthem come over and so on and so forth. But I don't know the details because I really\ndidn't care at that time. I was too young. And I was worried about myself. I was worried\nabout my well-being, so to speak, and finding a job. Those days, it was important to find\na job and support yourself and move out of the house, which is what I did.",
        "Q: How old were you when you moved out?",
        "A: Just before -- not long before I got married. I got married at 24. I must have moved\nout at 21, something like that.",
        "Q: All right. So now you had been working. And you said you moved out of the house.\nAnd then what happened?",
        "A: Then the draft came along. I just want to get my facts straight. The draft came\nalong, and I figured that's the greatest way out. That's the best thing for me. I didn't join\nbecause I was Jewish or because I looked to save the world. I joined to change my life.\nAnd this is the truth. I was rejected six times because I had a hernia. And each time I'd\ngo down there in the hopes that they would let me get in. Finally they wouldn't let me get\nin, so I went for an operation, a hernia operation. It cost me $250, which I saved up. And\nwas it the sixth time I went down there? I was rejected because of my eyesight. I was\nput on limited service. But the seventh time I got in. And as a matter of fact, I remember\nthat first night in the service. I had already met my wife. I was going with her and so on.\nMy first night in the service, they put me in a barracks with maybe 100 other guys, and I\nwas on the top bunk. And there I was, lying on the bunk. And I'm looking at the ceiling,\nwhich was like a foot or two away. And I'm saying, \"What am I doing here? Who needs\nthis? And I volunteered for this?\" And that was my introduction into the service.",
        "Q: What month and what year?",
        "A: 1943. I got out in'45. Two and a half years I was in. I'm trying to think of the\nmonth.",
        "Q: What time of year?",
        "A: I guess spring. Yeah, it must have been spring. Early spring or summer, something\nlike that. If I had my discharge in front of me, I could tell. But I don't really remember\nthe date.",
        "Q: And did you have any specific feelings about Hitler or what was happening at that\npoint?",
        "A: No, not really. I just heard about it but very vaguely from -- I read newspapers. I'm\nan avid reader in that context. And it didn't affect me one way or another.",
        "Q: So where did you first go when you were drafted?",
        "A: I went to Camp Upton, New York or New Jersey, I forget where. And we stayed\nthere -- I was in the states for less than six months. From there, we went to Plattsburgh,\nNew York, where I got married. And then we came down to Elkins, West Virginia. And\nthen we went right to the port of embarkation 1n a period of about six months. And I\nwent overseas to a place called Conington, England. Spent a nice time there. Never\nworrying about what the war was going to be like or anything like this.",
        "Q: Let's back up a little bit. Why did you try to keep volunteering?",
        "A: Iwasa patriotic American. That's the only reason. Not because -- I had heard\nthings, but it didn't affect me that much. I felt that 1t was my job. I had heard about\nHitler; I can't say that I didn't. But it didn't affect me that much only because I didn't pay\ntoo much attention to any of that. And I was in there because I wanted to change my life,\nfor one thing. And for another thing, I wanted to get into the service. I wanted\nsomething different. I wanted some adventure, so to speak.",
        "Q: Was your being Jewish a factor in volunteering?",
        "A: Very little. And it all goes back to my mother who kept drumming my being\nYiddish, my being Jewish, over and over and over again until I just couldn't take any\nmore. So I tried to be as -- not that I tried to be a goy, but I tried to be as non-Jewish as I\ncould possibly be. And I got along with most everybody. I never suffered any real\ndiscrimination, although some of the boys who were in my outfit were religious and they\ntook Fridays off and that sort of thing. And they were discriminated against, not me.",
        "Q: Had you talked in detail with your parents about what was happening -- this is before\nyou were drafted -- about what was happening?",
        "A: Never. This is solely my own doing. The only one I talked to really about it was my\ngirlfriend, who is my wife now. And my parents just wouldn't -- didn't understand. They\nwere European people. My mother, who is my second mother, was just as good to me as\nmy original mother, who I barely remembered. And we had no rapport with each other. I\ncouldn't talk to them. My father was busy in the grocery store. My second mother was\nthere helping him. And I never saw my father, really. He'd go into the store before I got\nup, come back from the store after I was in bed. As a matter of fact, I remember one time\nI walked into the house and I looked into their bedroom as I passed. It was a railroad flat.\nAnd I looked into the bedroom and there was my father in bed. I had never seen my\nfather in bed. And I looked in. I says, \"Hi, Pop. How are you?\" He says, \"Not so good.\"\nI says, \"What's the matter?\" And I sat down. And it was like almost the first time I ever\nsat down with him. I says, \"What's the matter?\" He says, \"I hurt my back and I can't\nmove.\" And then I said to him, \"Pop, this is the first time I have ever seen you in bed\nsick.\" I says, \"I've never seen you that way before.\" He says, \"Herbert,\" he says, \"I can't\nafford to be sick.\" What I'm trying to bring out 1s, that was my upbringing, the work ethic\nand so on and so forth. But close to my parents, I never was.",
        "Q: Let's jump ahead a little bit. You were drafted and you're now in England.",
        "A: England, a place Conington. We spent about three months there. Very, very\npleasant experience. And then we moved down to Southampton, which was a staging\narea for the invasion of Europe.",
        "Q: What unit were you in?",
        "A: 628th Light Equipment Engineers.",
        "Q: Of?",
        "A: Well, we were switched from army to army because we were a small outfit, about\n100 men. And we worked the shovels and the road graders and the bulldozers, and so on,\nclearing roads and so on. We were doing that in England as well. And we were moved\nfrom the -- we originally went over, I think it was the First Army. And then we were\ntransferred as we went down to the Third Army. And then in Europe, I think we wound\nup with the Seventh Army. I'm not quite sure of these details.",
        "Q: And now you're in Southampton?",
        "A: Southampton, waiting for the invasion. We were in Southampton I guess it must\nhave been about a month until the invasion. And we went over about D-plus 10, 12,\nsomething like that. D-Day plus 10. I wasn't part of the initial invasion. But it was a\nlittle harrowing. And we got stuck on a sand bar. And finally they got us off and they\nwere bombing us and so on and so forth. From there, we landed on Utah Beach. I didn't\neven remember the beach until I sort of looked it up for my company. Utah Beach. And\nthen from there, we sort of went inland through the hedgerows and so on.",
        "Q: At this point, did you know anything about what was happening to the Jews or did\nyou know anything about camps in general?",
        "A: Absolutely not. We were so busy embroiled in what we were doing because we were\nunder fire here and there, bombardments and so on. And I didn't have time to worry\nabout anybody else but myself, actually.",
        "Q: What was it like for you to see dead bodies at that point?",
        "A: Oh, that's when we went into Germany. We had gone into Germany through\nAachen. I remember that. And somebody said to us, \"Hey, fellows, you better get up to\nthis camp. There are a lot of dead bodies up there.\" A civilian told us. And we went\nthere. And those are the pictures that I show you of what we actually saw. They never\neven had a chance to pick up the bodies. The bodies didn't even smell yet because they\nwere so new. The Germans had left voluntarily because they were afraid of who was\ncoming. And they took off. And we got there about an hour after they had shot a lot of\nthe people. And we saw ovens -- I saw them myself -- with bodies piled in front of the\novens. The ovens seemed to be too small for the bodies. But then there was a ravine with\na bunch of bodies in that they had spread lime on. And then it began to dawn on me what\nI was looking at. And then I became a Jew.",
        "Q: We'll talk about Ohrdruf in a moment. Let's go back a little bit to France. Anything\nelse -- any other combat experiences or any fighting that you went through in France?",
        "A: Well, we were bombarded. And during the Bulge, the Germans were really shooting.\nWe weren't an infantry outfit; we were an engineer outfit. And we had to move back into\nFrance until the invasion was over, the German invasion was over. And then as they\ncleared it up, we began to move in. And when we first got into Germany, it was -- really,\nthere were snipers firing at us and so on and so forth. But I was never in any real hand-\nto-hand or person-to-person combat per se.",
        "Q: Did you see any dead bodies at that point?",
        "A: Oh, all along. In France we always saw dead bodies. I'm talking about dead bodies\nof Germans. And all the way through, we had seen dead bodies.",
        "Q: How did you feel about seeing a dead body?",
        "A: At first, I was appalled. And after that, strangely enough, you get used to seeing\nbodies. You don't pay any attention to them. And if there's an odor, you walk over to the\nother side, but you leave the bodies there. We were just -- it's a matter of survival, really,\nbeing in the service under those conditions. And you're worried about yourself. That is,\nuntil I got to the concentration camp.",
        "Q: Was your unit made up of other Jews?",
        "A: Wehad some. We had a few Jews there.",
        "Q: Did you stick together with them or did you mix with everybody else?",
        "A: Notreally. I had two basic friends who were Jewish -- three. One was the\nlieutenant. The other was -- the other two were buddies of mine. And we sort of -- the\nthree of us stuck out together. The lieutenant, he was sort of in another category. And\nwe went places together. We did things together and so on.",
        "Q: Did you ever talk among yourselves about what was happening to Jews?",
        "A: No. And that surprises me. I'm so dedicated now to that sort of thing. I wasn't\nbefore. I really wasn't. And it's been since the site of the holocaust, since being in the\nconcentration camp, that I really became Jewish. As a matter of fact, my son didn't want\nto be bar mitzvahed, but I made him become bar mitzvahed and so on. These two girls\nthat I brought with me are fairly religious.",
        "Q: All right. Now you've crossed over the border into Germany.",
        "A: Well, I think the first town I remember was Aachen. And then we moved past\nAachen and we were told about the concentration camp which I just told you about.",
        "Q: Who told you about the concentration camp?",
        "A: A German.",
        "Q: A German person or a German townsperson?",
        "A: Yeah. See, I can understand German a little bit because I spoke a little Yiddish. And\nI was amazed to find out that I could talk German. As a matter of fact, I became the\ninterpreter between the Germans and my outfit because the boy, \"Hey, Bitter, he talks\nGerman.\" I was really talking Yiddish. That's where we found out, and that's where we\nwent to the concentration camp. There were a few of us. I don't remember who they\nwere. I know that my two buddies were among them but I don't remember who else. And\nthen we saw the bodies --",
        "Q: Wait. Let's back up a little bit. All right. This German townsperson tells you that\nthere is acamp. And so what was the next thing that you did? Did you report this to your\nsuperior? What happened?",
        "A: No, no. We just -- a bunch of us went to where we -- he said there was a lot of dead\nbodies there. We didn't know whether they were Germans or Jewish or Americans or\nanything, so we went there.",
        "Q: How could you leave your unit?",
        "A: Well, we were all spread out. We were in various vehicles and so on. And\nremember, I was in an outfit with 100 men and we were attached to various divisions. So\nit was no problem. They just told us where it was, and we drove up there.",
        "Q: What was your rank at the time?",
        "A: Corporal. And we drove up there. And there was --",
        "Q: \"We\" being who?",
        "A: The two buddies that I had, Jewish boys, Elliot Bass and Abe Corn.",
        "Q: Why did you want to go there?",
        "A: Only to see what was there. We were told there were bodies. And we had to find out\nwhat they were, whether they were Americans, whether they were Germans, whether\nthey were -- we didn't know anything about, really, the concentration camps. We did not\nexpect a concentration camp per se.",
        "Q: What was the name or what were you told that the name of this location was?",
        "A: He just told us where it was. He didn't give us any name or anything like that.",
        "Q: How did he describe the location?",
        "A: He says, \"There's a camp with bodies 3 miles away up this road.\" He says, \"Why\ndon't you go up there and look at it.\" See, the Germans were terribly afraid of us. They\ndidn't want to be tortured. They thought that maybe we would come in and torture them.\nAnd of course, we weren't looking to cause any havoc. So we wanted to see what the\nbodies were that were up 1n this camp.",
        "Q: What date was this?",
        "A: I don't remember the date. It was right after we went into Germany, after the -- better\nstill, it was the day before Eisenhower, Bradley, and --",
        "Q: Patton?",
        "A: -- Patton were there. Of course, they came later.",
        "Q: So this must have been April 11th because they came on April 12th, 1945. Did you\nknow the name of the place before you went?",
        "A: I found out later. And that's one of the things that bugged me because we didn't\nknow where we were, just that we were past Aachen and that there was this camp. And\nthe pictures will show you exactly what we saw as we went through the fences. There\nwas no resistance.",
        "Q: Okay. You are three young soldiers in a Jeep?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you are driving up this road. What's the first sight that you see?",
        "A: We saw this fence, which was a barbed wire fence. And as we drove in, we saw\nbodies lying all over the area. And we couldn't believe it. We didn't even know they\nwere Jewish or anything like that. We just saw the bodies. And then we went in. And\nthere were a number of people who were alive. A number of people. And they began to\nyell in Yiddish to us. And I understood Yiddish. And I began to talk to them and they\nbegan to tell us what went on, what camp it was. And this was all new to us. We had\nnever experienced anything like this. And there was one Polish boy in that camp who\nspoke Yiddish. And surprisingly enough, he had a bicycle. And he held onto that\nbicycle. And he was the one that showed us around from place to place, showed us\nwhere they slept, showed us where the bodies were. And we were just absolutely\nappalled. That was a real revelation.",
        "Q: You had a camera with you?",
        "A: Yes. I always carried a camera.",
        "Q: And you so you took pictures?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. It was after an hour or two of being there that we took the pictures\nbecause this Polish boy wanted food or whatever he wanted. And he took us around to\nthe camp. And we wanted to see what it was. I had my camera with me all the time. And\nhe took us into a -- these long cottages where they slept. Unlike what I've seen in the\nmovies, these were like stalls for cattle, really. And there was a wooden bar in between\nthe stalls. And they were packed with hay. And that's where they slept. They slept one\nright next to another. You could barely move in the stalls. And we went up and down.\nAnd then we saw the bodies in the \u2014 outside the ovens. I didn't see a crematorium there. I\ndidn't know whether they were gassed or -- we didn't think of asking these questions.\nAnd then he took us to this pit where there must have been 500 bodies, something like\nthat, covered with lime. And what they were going to do with these bodies is throw them\ninto the pit because they couldn't burn all of them. They were going to throw these\nbodies into the pit, but they didn't have time. There was no time because the Americans\nwere there. And they didn't know who we were. All the Germans knew was that the\nAmericans are coming, let's get out of here. And there wasn't a German in that camp as\nwe walked in. But we see the Jews firsthand.",
        "Q: What was your feeling when you first heard Yiddish words from these prisoners?",
        "A: I'm just trying to think. It was -- I wasn't really affected yet, but I began to talk to\nvarious -- and of course, there was some communication problem because a lot of the\nYiddish that they spoke, I didn't speak. For example, one of the Jewish guys we had with\nus, we used him asa KP. And he said to me one day -- we gave him a room when we\ncame into this town. And he said to me, \"Do you do you speak Yiddish? All right.\nKomm zu mine Zimmer.\" He said, \"Come to my room.\" He wanted to show me\nsomething because we were Jewish, and so on and so forth. And I says, \"Okay. I says,\n\"But was is dat Zimmer?\" I had never heard of the word \"Zimmer.\" He says \"It's\nZimmer,\" and he showed us. And he took me up to the room that he was staying in. And\nI says, \"You mean a room?\" And this is the truth because there are certain idiomatic\nexpressions that pick up the language. I never knew that a room was a Zimmer. And so\nthat's the kind of Yiddish. I spoke a fractured Yiddish but enough to understand what\nwas going on.",
        "Q: How did you feel when they spoke Yiddish and you realized that these prisoners\nwere Jewish?",
        "A: It didn't quite hit me immediately or anything like that, but I began to feel it. And it\nwas only when I met these girls that I began to realize what had -- the bodies, of course,\nyou can't misinterpret. But I began to understand what was going on in this place, what\nwas going on in Germany.",
        "Q: What was the condition of the bodies? Had they looked like they had endured\nstarvation?",
        "A: We didn't look that closely. They were dead, and they weren't dead very long. We\nassumed that they had been shot. They may have been shot just before we came there.\nBut they couldn't get rid of all of them. And that was not a big camp. It was a small\ncamp. But there wasn't enough time to get rid of all of them.",
        "Q: When did you know the name of the camp?",
        "A: I'm not quite sure. I think it may have been while I was there somebody may have\nmentioned it or something like that. I'm not quite sure where I learned the name. But I\nnever heard the name after I left until I began to ask people and try to research and find\nout whether there was a camp like that.",
        "Q: And the name of the camp?",
        "A: Ohrdruf. O-D-H-R-U-F, something like that.",
        "Q: So you learned the name of it, you said, when you were there, that 1t was Ohrdruf?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: All right. You have seen these bodies. You walk around. Any other impressions\nthat you can talk about?",
        "A: Well, we were there just a good part of the day. Now, it wasn't our job to remove the\nbodies or do anything else. We had to contact I think it was the civil government of the\nU.S. Army. They would come in and take care of the government and so on and so forth.",
        "Q: But you said that there were a lot of other American soldiers already there?",
        "A: From my company. We were the first company to walk in there. There must have\nbeen -- in my company, there must have been 25, 40 guys. And of course, the word\nspread after that that there was this camp. And that's where Eisenhower must have found\nout about it and so on. But they came the next day.",
        "Q: How do you know that?",
        "A: Isaw them. I was there. In other words, we went back. We didn't stay far from\nthem because we were bivouacking, actually. And we went back. And we didn't know\nthey were coming. And all of a sudden the gates open up and an entourage comes in,\nmaybe 100 or 200 people. I don't know. And of course the bodies had remained there\novernight. There was nothing we could do. And they came in and they were looking\naround and the cameras and all that sort of jazz. And they went through the place. And\nsomebody was explaining to them what had happened and so on. In other words, the\nhierarchy of the military had come in, and they learned about what happened and they\nwere showing it to the general. And I believe that was the first camp, maybe the only one,\nthat the three generals were there.",
        "Q: So you actually saw General Eisenhower?",
        "A: General Eisenhower, General Bradley. I'm not quite sure about Patton. He was\nthere, but I didn't quite see him. He was sort of walking on his own, more or less. But\nEisenhower and Bradley were together. Wherever they went, they were together with a\nbunch of colonels and military muck-mucks or whatever they call them. And they were\nexplaining to the general what had happened there. They had heard it from one of the\nboys. So then they repeated to the generals exactly what kind of a camp it was, what it\nwas, and so on.",
        "Q: I'm sure you're aware of the famous quote from General Eisenhower that he wrote to\nChurchill -- and I'd just like to maybe read it a little bit and see what your reaction 1s to it\n-- that he sent in a letter to Churchill after he had been at Ohrdruf. \"The things I saw\nbeggar description. The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty,\nand beastiology were overpowering. I made the visit deliberately in order to be ina\nposition to give firsthand evidence of these things, if ever in the future there develops a\ntendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda.\" When he said he saw\nevidence of starvation, cruelty, and beastiology --",
        "A: I don't know about beastiology, but I know cruelty, starvation. That's something I\nhad never mentioned, the fact that they were emaciated people. These people were skin\nand bones. And we tried to help them, but we didn't have food with us. We had some K-\nrations and so on. We did the best we could. And that's why we decided to come back\nthe next day, to see if we could be of any -- we didn't know that the generals were\ncoming. And we brought back some food and so on and so forth, but it didn't amount to\nanything. And we were just appalled by what we had seen. And really, I can't honestly\nsay that it sunk in at that particular time. The bodies, had they not been Jewish I would\nhave felt the same way more or less at that time. And we went through. We were\ninterested in seeing. We couldn't believe that something like this existed, that people\ncould be so cruel as to shoot them, starve them, hang them, which is in those pictures.\nWe just couldn't believe it. And if anybody tells you he realized what it was -- maybe\nEisenhower did, but we didn't until it began to sink in.",
        "Q: What did you say and what did the Jewish prisoners say to you? What kind of\nthoughts?",
        "A: They were all anxious to tell me their stories. Strangely enough, Jewish people love\nto relate their problems and what had happened to them. And those that could -- a lot of\nthem were too weak to even talk. You know, they told us about where they came from,\nwhat had happened to them, and so on. But there were so many stories that one story ran\ninto another. There were so many terrible stories. And they're all most willing to talk\nAnd as a matter of fact, what I really found out more than anything else were the girls. I\ndon't want to get too far ahead. I really found out what really happened. They were\nexplicit and they were able to explain. But as far as I was concerned, we heard so many\nstories at the same time, all terrible stories. And it's like somebody pricking your finger\nhere, here, here, here, and you couldn't know where it hurts only because there are so\nmany different spots that it hurts. And we had heard so many terrible stories that there\nwere too many to affect us, so to speak. I don't know if you can understand that. But\nafter a while, we began to understand what was going on.",
        "Q: Did your other -- the other soldiers that you were with speak Yiddish, the two others?",
        "A: No. I was the only one that spoke Yiddish, so to speak. And therefore, I was able to\nrelate to some of these people better than some of the others. Of course, a lot of them just\ndidn't understand.",
        "Q: Did you touch any of them?",
        "A: Oh, sure. I held their hand. I spoke to them. I sat with them. We were there for\nhours. And then strangely enough, here are people who are dying, who -- we picked\nourselves up and we left. It's a terrible thing not to realize the degradation that went on\nand the cruelty that went on. After all, we were in a war. And yet we were able to pick\nourselves up and leave. I don't know if I could do that today, leave back to the bivouac\narea knowing that we were going to come back the next day with whatever we could.\nAnd it wasn't very much. But then the military government moved in right after we left,\nand I guess they took care of them.",
        "Q: How did you know that you were the first Americans to come in?",
        "A: There was nobody else there. I'm sorry. There was absolutely nobody else there.\nWe walked in through the gates, opened up the gates. They weren't locked. Rather, the\ngates -- the barbed wire gates. We opened them and walked right in. We could see the\nscenes of the dead from outside the gates. And we just went in. And there was absolutely\nnobody there.",
        "Q: Were you frightened when you first saw the piles of dead bodies?",
        "A: No. We had seen dead bodies all along. And we came in and we were just curious\nto know what it was that we were looking at. We really didn't know what we were\nseeing, at the beginning. And then we realized. I may be contradicting myself but the\nthoughts are coming so quick and so fast.",
        "Q: This is Tape 1, Side B, of the interview of Herbert Bitter. Before we continue, I'd like\nto clarify some facts that we talked about on the previous side. You had said that you had\ncome over the border into Germany into the town of Aachen.",
        "A: That's correct. And then from Aachen, I just don't remember where we went because\nI was completely unfamiliar with Germany.",
        "Q: And then you eventually got to the vicinity of the Ohrdruf camp, and you said you\nwere staying in a village and that a man told you there's a camp 3 miles down the road.\nDo you remember the name of the village?",
        "A: It might have been Erfurt or Aachen. I'm not quite sure.",
        "Q: Not Aachen. You mean --",
        "A: Excuse me. Erfurt or Ohrdruf.",
        "Q: Ohrdruf. And then the other point we should clarify are the dates when you got to\nOhrdruf camp and when you saw Eisenhower. Because it is understood that Eisenhower\nwas there on April 12th, which was the date that President Roosevelt died. Do you have\nanything to say about that, about when you were there?",
        "A: Icertainly do. I believe if I got there on April 4th, which I think I got there, the\nfollowing day, Eisenhower and Bradley came to that camp. That was the very next day\nbecause the bodies were still there as we saw them the day before. And they came and\nthey looked over, and they had a small contingent of people with them. I don't remember\nwho they were. And then they left. Now, the next thing I know 1s that I saw pictures of\nthe fact that Eisenhower was there. There seemed to be a lot of people there. And the\nday that Roosevelt died, he was supposed to have been there or Bradley and Patton were\nsupposed to have been there. Now, on the day that Roosevelt died, I was in Dresden.\nNow, I had seen the concentration camp on April 4th, I believe honestly, so that\nEisenhower and Bradley were there the day after I was there. And then they may have\ncome back with photographers and with whoever.",
        "Q: Okay. Before we leave Ohrdruf, I just wanted to ask you again some of your\nimpressions and other sites that you saw. Did you have a sense of the layout of the camp?",
        "A: More or less. As we came in, we saw the bodies. To the right of the gate -- I'm\ntrying to recall because these are things you really don't forget -- were the barracks where\nthe sleeping areas were laid out like in stalls, like cattle, only they were low 2-by-4s that\nseparated each bunk. And that's all they had. And they were filled with straw. And then\nwe went from there. We saw an oven, and there were a bunch of bodies piled up outside\nthe oven. However, the ovens seemed to be too small to handle the bodies. And as we\nwent further, we saw this long pit where there must have been hundreds of bodies\ncovered with lime. And evidently they were preparing to lay the bodies into the pit so\nthey could bury them and bodies above that and so on.",
        "Q: You are 25 years old, a young man, and obviously not prepared for this. How did\nyou handle this or do you remember what thoughts were going through your mind when\nyou saw piles of bodies and ovens and lime pits and so forth?",
        "A: Well, it didn't quite hit me at that time, only because going through France and the\ninvasion and everything, I had seen a lot of bodies. This was a terrible, terrible thing.\nAnd then of course we realized that they were Jews. We felt a little bad. But you must\nunderstand that it doesn't hit you suddenly. You're looking and you say \"That's a terrible\nthing.\" And then you go on and so on. It's only after visiting there, after being away from\nthere that I began to realize. And it was only after I spoke to some girls who told me\nwhat they had gone through that I began to realize that this is true. This is a holocaust.\nAnd it gradually over a period of time began to sink in.",
        "Q: Did you have any trouble sleeping that night after you saw these sites?",
        "A: No. Peculiar thing to say, I had no trouble at all. Because remember when you're in\nthe service you're worrying about your own being, and nothing is important as taking care\nof yourself. And I felt badly. I can't say that it just passed over me. We started to talk\nabout it, some of the boys and us, and then we began to realize how terrible a thing it\nwas. That's why when I see people who are not Jewish or people who don't care, they\ncan't believe it. And I can understand why they can't believe it because it's too much to\nbelieve. It's too much to take in at once.",
        "Q: Did you feel any kind of kinship with the Jewish prisoners?",
        "A: Always. Because I met Jews throughout Europe, I met refugees, I met a lot of Jews,\nand I spoke to some of them. As a matter of fact, we had one Jewish refugee that we took\nwith us, and he served as a KP, a kitchen police. He served as a KP for us. And I\nbefriended him and we talked quite a bit, but we never really talked about details. He may\nnot have known about all of these things. He was just a refugee. And we talked quite a\nbit because I spoke -- I was one of the only people in my outfit that spoke Yiddish, and\nthat's why I was able to communicate.",
        "Q: How old was he and where did you find him?",
        "A: He must have been about 35 years old. We found him walking along the road. And\nhe asked if he could be part of our outfit. He wanted to get to Israel. And we said, \"Well,\nwe're not going to Israel. We're going in the opposite direction.\" He says, \"Can I go with\nyou?\" He says, \"I have to eat.\" So we gave him an American uniform. We set him up.\nNobody knew who he was. And I communicated with him on a regular basis only\nbecause of the Yiddish.",
        "Q: And whereabouts did you find him? What country?",
        "A: I'm not quite sure. It may have been in France, but I'm not quite sure. It's just that he\nwas with us for quite a length of time. And actually, when we came back to Marseilles to\ngo over to the Philippines for the invasion, we had to get rid of him because we couldn't\ngo aboard ship with him. So we had some of the boys put him in a truck, took him down\nto the shipyards in Marseilles. They put him on a ship that was going to eventually wind\nup in Israel. And I never heard from him after that.",
        "Q: Do you remember his name?",
        "A: Meischer (phonetic). That's as much as I remember.",
        "Q: Had you heard of a place called Buchenwald when you were in Ohrdruf?",
        "A: No. Asa matter of fact, I didn't know it was a satellite until I went to Yad Vashem,\nand they told me it was a satellite of Ohrdruf.",
        "Q: Of Buchenwald?",
        "A: Of Buchenwald. Excuse me.",
        "Q: How many days were you at -- in the Ohrdruf area?",
        "A: Several days.",
        "Q: And how many times did you go back to the camp?",
        "A: We went back the next day and possibly once more. And then we had to move on.",
        "Q: Did you say that you had brought food back?",
        "A: Yes. We brought whatever we could bring back, but it certainly wasn't enough. It\nwas a drop in the bucket. And we knew that the civil police were coming behind us\nbecause they had been notified and they had been told about what we had found. I didn't\ndo the notifying myself, but somebody did. And I guess they eventually came.",
        "Q: So just to clarify, you're saying that you were one of the first to come into the camp\nbecause there were no other soldiers around?",
        "A: I think we were the first because there was nobody in that camp when we went in.\nWe opened the gates -- the barbed wire gates and we walked in. And this is what we\nsaw. Those pictures that I showed you are what we saw.",
        "Q: Were there any dead SS?",
        "A: No. Only civilians. Only people who were either shot or died in some way, and then\nthe few that were just wandering around the camp with no place to go and nothing to do.\nThey were sort of lost. They were in a fog.",
        "Q: Did you feel any differently after this experience at Ohrdruf than before?",
        "A: I felt a kinship and a compassion. But as I said, it didn't hit me until I had left the\ncamps and I had spoken to some -- the Jewish girls that I had met along the way.",
        "Q: Well, let's move on. So you then were ordered to leave that general area?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And where did you then move? Did you go eastward?",
        "A: Well, we went toward Cologne because I remember being in Cologne. And the war\nwas beginning to wind down. And on the way -- and I'm not quite sure where this factory\nwas -- we came across a factory. And really, I didn't come across the factory. One of the\nofficers came to the headquarters and said, \"Hey, Bitter, are you Jewish?\" I said, \"Yeah.\"\nHe says, \"Boy, you're going to have a good time.\" I says, \"What do you mean?\" He says,\n\"I found a factory full of Jewish broads,\" and that's exactly the way he put it. And he\nsays, \"They can't talk to anybody.\" He said, \"I can't talk to them.\" He says, \"Let me\ndrive you there and I'll pick you up.\" I say, \"Can I be there that long?\" He says, \"I'll pick\nyou up. I'll come and I'll wait for you.\" He says, \"But Have a good time.\" He was being\nvery facetious. And we went there and the picture that I brought with me, the picture of\nthe four girls standing outside this factory. And I went up to the, girls knowing that they\nwere Jewish. I said [Yiddish/German expression] which means, \"What are you doing,\ngirls?\" And they were so excited at the fact that there was a Jewish soldier there. They\nhad never seen an American-Jewish soldier. They had not seen anybody. They knew\nthey were liberated because the Germans had left. And they grabbed me, literally grabbed\nme, pulled me into the building, and took me to the second floor. And I heard screaming\nand yelling of the girls. And they put me up on a -- almost like a stage. And there were\ngirls coming from all over the building. I swear to you, there must have been 100 to 200\ngirls, all disciplined. All sat down. There was one girl who took charge, and she\nexplained to them who I was. And we spoke in sort of Yiddish. And then she said, \"I\nwant you to\" -- in Yiddish she said, \"I want you to hear the stories of some of these girls.\nI want you to know what we went through.\" And I says, \"All right.\" And I sat there for\nthe next two or three hours just listening. And each girl, she said, \"Yanni (phonetic), get\nup and tell your story. Myrtle, get up and tell your story.\" And one by one, there must\nhave been 20 girls, that had -- and they told how they had been raped and taken\nadvantage of and all of that. And I began to feel. I wanted to kill somebody after\nlistening to these girls. And finally they finished. They said, \"Do you want to hear\nmore?\" I says, \"No. That's enough.\" And of course, I had to get back. And the officer\nwas waiting forme. So I says, \"Maidloch (phonetic), I'll be back tomorrow.\" I says,\n\"What can I bring you,\" I says, \"in the way of food?\" She says, \"Food, we're all right on.\"\nShe says, \"But can you bring us a few sidurim,\" prayer books. And I says, \"Well, we\ndon't have many, but I'll pick up every one I can find.\" And I went back and I got about\nthree or four from the boys in the camp. And I went back the next day with some food,\nwhatever it was, and the girls just couldn't get over me. I was a hero. I was the first\nliberator that they saw. And I spent a good part of the day with them. I took my own Jeep.\nAnd we spent some time, and then I left. And of course, I took a picture with the girls or\nall the girls. Here is the Jewish girls liberated from the German factory, slave labor. And\nit was interesting.",
        "Q: Now, can you tell me again where this factory was?",
        "A: It was after Aachen. And I cannot remember the distance. I can't remember the\nfactory or what they did in the factory, as a matter of fact. But the whole building was\nfull of girls. Only girls.",
        "Q: How much later after Ohrdruf did you come across this factory?",
        "A: Several days.",
        "Q: And were you heading eastward or westward?",
        "A: We were heading eastward. We were heading eastward toward -- we wound up in a\nplace called Weida, Germany, which was in the Russian section. And we spent quite a\nbit of time there. And then of course we doubled back to go to Marseilles.",
        "Q: And you don't know what kind of factory it was?",
        "A: No, I have no idea what they made. They were so busy telling me about their\nexperiences, not what they were, not -- but they wanted people to know how they\nsuffered. And believe me, they let me know how they suffered. And it was then that the\nwhole thing was coming together, that I began to realize what was going on in there. It's\nnot one incident that sets you apart. It's all of these incidents together. And you begin to\nrealize there's a pattern there. And that's what I began to realize. As a matter of fact, I\nmyself -- I don't know if I told you, I was sitting in a Jeep in France. And they had\nliberated some camps. I think it was in Poland or somewhere else. I don't know. And I\nread the article in Stars and Stripes. And I read about how these people suffered. And I\nclosed the Stars and Stripes, put them away, and I went about my business like it didn't\naffect me in any way. It does affect me now.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in that area of the labor factory?",
        "A: Two days. I was there the first day. I had to go and get on with the outfit. So I was\nthere the first day. And then the second day I came back by myself with the sidurim.\nAnd I spent a good part of the day. I had my own Jeep. And then I went back to my\noutfit. And that was it.",
        "Q: Did you talk about this with the -- Was there a chaplain that you could talk things\nover with? And if so, did you?",
        "A: No, because we had to move on. There was nobody I could really talk to because we\nwere an individual outfit. We were -- we had to be attached to various armies to do the\nwork for them and so on and so forth. So there was nobody I could talk to. And I knew\nthat behind us was a civil and military governments who were cleaning up and taking\ncare of whatever we saw. And of course, the Germans didn't know any of this was going\non. None of it. And they were very, very happy to see the Americans because they didn't\nwant to see the Russians. So they were very, very happy to see us and welcome us. And\nthey had white flags outside of all the buildings. And it was a very, very nice thing.",
        "Q: Why do you say that your experience at the women's slave labor factory made an",
        "A: Because they were individual stories. \"It happened to me,\" they say. \"This is what\nhappened to me.\" And then another one said, \"This is what happened to me.\" And when\nyou hear so many individual stories, not a group of people talking with one story, there\nare a group of people talking with many, many stories, that has to affect you even if\nyou're not Jewish. And it affected me.",
        "Q: Were these women wearing yellow stars?",
        "A: Ihave to look at the picture. No, they weren't. Evidently the war or the Germans\nwere in such retreat that they weren't afraid any more because the Germans had left.\nThey were frightened, they didn't know what was going to happen to them, and they\nbegan to run. And basically, they weren't wearing stars.",
        "Q: And then you left this factory. And then where did your unit go?",
        "A: And then we went on to Dresden, as I mentioned before. And we wound up in a\nplace called Weida, W-E-I-D-A: And we were bivouacked in a schoolhouse, and we\nspent the balance of the war there. That's right. Because we had to go from there to\nMarseilles. And in Marseilles, we were going to be put aboard ships and go to the\nPhilippines for the invasion of Japan. And I had enough points to get out and I was very\nmad and we were very irritated and so on and so forth. But while we were there -- we got\naboard the ship, and we're all -- pardon me -- bitching. And the ship took off. And this\nwas after Roosevelt had died. And Truman took over. And while we were aboard the\nship, Truman declared all ships that are headed for foreign ports, military ships, to turn\nback and go to the nearest American port. And I was one of the first troops to get home",
        "after we hit Newport News, VirginiA: I was one of the first American soldiers that came\nin. Excuse me. The war in Japan had ended, so they felt they didn't need us there any\nmore and they didn't want to any more troops than they needed, so they sent us right back\nto Newport News. And I called my family and I told them I'm home. They never\nexpected me to be home. Only my mother said, \"Don't worry. He'll come home.\" And I\ndid. And I called the house and told them I would be home in a few days. They told us\nthey'd give us leave. So I said, \"I'll be home in about two or three days.\" Unfortunately, I\ngot what they call impetigo, which comes from dirt and filth. So they had to change my\nuniform and put me in quarantine. And my family had put up a sign, \"Welcome home,\nHerbie.\" And they had to change the sign because I didn't come back until a week later.\nAnd it said, \"Well, come home, Herbie.\" And that was it basically.",
        "Q: When you got home, did you talk about Ohrdruf with family? Did you talk about the\nlabor factory stories?",
        "A: No, we didn't talk about much of anything. It came out over a period of time. I may\nhave mentioned it but never any details. I didn't want to talk about my time in the\nservice. I had so many other things that I wanted to do that I wasn't going to start --\nactually a new life. I was already married. I was married in Plattsburgh while I was in the\nservice, which I didn't mention. And I was busy looking for a place to live because in\nthose days you couldn't find an apartment at all in New York. And it was only gradually.\nI never spoke about that to my parents, for some reason or another. Never. I sort of felt\nthey wouldn't understand. I may have mentioned one or two things, but I had spoken to\nmy wife. She would be the only one. And my children. My children were the ones that\nwere affected by this more than anybody else through me. And every time they went to\nschool and they spoke about the holocaust, they insisted on taking the pictures. That's\nwhy I have so few pictures left. And they were more affected. That's why my daughter\ncalled you because she had heard these stories over the years.",
        "Q: Did you show these photographs that you had? When you first got home, did you\nshow them to anybody\u201d?",
        "A: No, not really. The only people that saw them was when I went to Israel and we\nwent to Yad Vashem, they asked me -- when we found out that it was part of Buchenwald\nand so forth, they asked me whether I had pictures. And they said, \"Would you send me\npictures?\" And I made copies. Somebody had a machine that made copies, and I sent\nthem the copies.",
        "Q: Did you show your wife these pictures? I'm talking about in the 1940s. I'm not\ntalking about later. I'm saying when you first came home. Did you show your wife the\nphotographs?",
        "A: She had seen them, I'm sure. It's just that I don't know the period of time that had\nelapsed. I wasn't hesitant to talk about it. I just didn't want to go into any detail,\nbasically. So my wife saw all the pictures. And she speaks Yiddish pretty well so she\nunderstood basically what I went through. And I didn't talk about any gory details\nbecause I wasn't interested in my family reliving it with me or anything like that.",
        "Q: Why not?",
        "A: Because I had lived it. They had seen the pictures. They knew what I went through\nover a period of years. We had always been talking about it. And I didn't sit them down\nand tell them -- first of all, they were too young, but it was over a period of years that we\ntalked about it, we discussed it and so on. So they know everything that I went through.\nIt's just that we didn't do it in one session or anything like that.",
        "Q: Did what you go through affect -- you had alluded to this before -- affect your\nfeelings about being Jewish?",
        "A: I became more Jewish.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Because I began to realize what these people had gone through, and I began to see\nwith my own eyes. And I told you, over a period of time it just sort of built up in me until\nI really began -- any chance I had to help holocaust victims or whatever it is, we did. And\nwe're very active. We have our own chavurah, which is a group of friends that get\ntogether that are all Jewish. And my wife is very active in Hadassah, in all the Jewish\norganizations in Dallas. And it's a difficult place to be Jewish, in Dallas, a difficult thing\nto be Jewish in Dallas, especially when we first moved there. So she's very active there.",
        "Q: Can you just summarize what happened after the war, professionally what you did.",
        "A: After the war, I got myself a job and another job and a third job. You know, I was\nsort of trying to find myself. At the same time, I had a child a year after I came home.\nBut then I worked for a large jewelry organization, and then I got a job with the PXs in\nEurope. And we went to Japan with my family. We lived in Japan for several years,\nbelonged to the Jewish Community Center in Tokyo. And we lived in Yokohama, and\nwe spent three years in Japan. I came back, went to work for a company that was a\nmanufacturer's representative all over the world because I was used to traveling. I'm just\ntrying to think -- Let's see. Yeah. After that, I went into business for myself, made a\nsuccess of the business, and retired several years ago. And basically, that's the story of\nmy life.",
        "Q: Do you still think about what you saw, the sites that you saw?",
        "A: Always. It takes the slightest thing to remind me of what I saw.",
        "Q: Such as what kind of things remind you?",
        "A: Well, when I hear about the holocaust -- and in Dallas, in the Jewish Community\nCenter, they have a holocaust museum. Nothing like this. But I go down there once in a\nwhile and look at the pictures. And a friend of mine -- I have several friends who are\nrefuges who were in concentration camps. And they're constantly talking about it and so\non. And they make various talks throughout the schools in Dallas, trying to have people\nto be cognizant of what went on and so on, but there are still a lot of skeptics.",
        "Q: Are there any sights that trigger what you saw? Any sights that you see today that\nwould trigger anything about Ohrdruf?",
        "A: Excuse me. Mostly Europe. When I see certain areas in Europe, I think of the\nholocaust. I think of what I saw. I'll never forget what I saw. In fact, what I've told you\nthese are the only basic things that I remember, but so much more happened and so much\nmore that I went through that I can't remember. And I wish I could. That's why before I\ncame to see you I wondered what I'm going to say to you. I didn't realize I knew this\nmuch.",
        "Q: You said you had kept a diary when you were a soldier.",
        "A: Ihadadiary. [had a little desk that the carpenter in the outfit made for me. And\neach day I wrote into this diary. And then for some reason we had to leave quickly, so I\nlocked up the desk because I couldn't carry it with me. And they were supposed to be\npicked up by a truck. I never saw that desk again.",
        "Q: Where did you lose your desk and your diary?",
        "A: Probably in -- we left from Weida, Germany, I think. And it's with the -- whatever is\nleft of the 628th Light Equipment records. It should be within that, and written by me.",
        "Q: So you wrote about what you saw in Ohrdruf in this diary?",
        "A: I wrote a lot of what I saw. And I don't remember exactly when I stopped writing. I\njust remember the desk was gone. I thought I would see it when I got to Marseilles, but I\ndidn't.",
        "Q: Was it a release for you to be able to sit down and write about what you saw that\nday?",
        "A: Yes. I began to realize what I had saw -- seen, but for some reason or other it did not\nsink in until days, weeks later.",
        "Q: After the war and you were back here in the United States and word came out about\nthe camps and there were more and more pictures, how did you respond to that when you\nsaw the magnitude?",
        "A: That's when I began to realize. That's when I began to understand what was going\non. And the sights plus what I began to read about it all came together. And suddenly I\nbegan to realize what this was all about. You just can't look at it one time and say, well,\nthis is a terrible thing. It isn't that simple. It's something that has to build up within you.\nAnd now nobody can tell me it didn't happen or I don't believe it. I know I saw it. What\nI went through just trying to find out whether there was such acamp. At first I began to\nsay there had to be an Ohrdruf. I was in there. And everybody in Dallas, they told me\nno. The first trip to Israel they said they don't know of such a camp. And you know they\nhave all the camps laid out on a map. Never saw Ohrdruf until I went into the Yad\nVashem. Until they showed me the books. And they had the history of the camp there.",
        "Q: And it's a subcamp of Buchenwald and referred to as $3?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: The first photograph that one sees in the permanent exhibit here at the United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum is a picture of Ohrdruf. Do you feel that's appropriate?",
        "A: I don't quite understand you.",
        "Q: When the public comes to the permanent exhibit here at the United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum and they get off the elevator, the very first photograph is of General\nEisenhower at Ohrdruf and the scene of the bodies at Ohrdruf. How do you feel about\nthat?",
        "A: I didn't see the picture, number one.",
        "Q: But the idea that that's the first one.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, because I knew he was there. Nobody could deny it, the fact that\nEisenhower was there on the second trip, I believe. Nobody could believe that this thing\nwent on and yet people will still look at that picture and say, \"It can't be that bad.\" They\nstill do that today.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you would like to add?",
        "A: No, nothing. If my memory improves, maybe I'll come back again.",
        "Q: Do you think you could have been prepared by anybody else for the sights that you\nsaw?",
        "A: No, absolutely not. Nobody -- I've told you, I read it in the Stars and Stripes. Not\nthat I didn't believe it. It just didn't sink in. And that's what happens -- and I'm talking\nabout Jewish people as well. And everybody seems to say, \"Well, it's not that bad. It can't\nbe that horrible. There are a few bodies and there were some mean people there.\" But it\nexisted. And it existed on a mass scale because I saw how organized that was. And\nbelieve me, the Germans know how to organize anything. And they organized that.",
        "Q: You said something that was very touching, which was when you went into Ohrdruf\nand you spoke Yiddish to some of the survivors and you sat down with them and you\nheld their hand. Why did you do that?",
        "A: Well, only because I was curious to know what went on. We knew so little. There\nwas no history, you know, when I went in there. We knew so little. So as I spoke to\nthem, I was holding one of them and because he was an individual, not because he was\nJewish, not because he was anything. But because he was a man who had suffered and\nwho had been hungry and who was emaciated looking. And these are men that needed\nsomebody to talk to them. It's just that I couldn't stay there too long. That was the only\nthing.",
        "Q: Were you ever concerned about your own health in these camps with diseases and so\nforth?",
        "A: No, not at all. We didn't think of any. We just saw what we saw. We saw what was\nhappening to somebody else, not to us. And we looked and we saw. And it was just -- it\nwas a terrible sight. I only wish I could have realized it then, but maybe I wouldn't have\nslept. Maybe I would have been upset. Maybe I would have become a nervous wreck.\nSo maybe nature has its way of compensating. That could be it. Of course one more\nthing. When I go to Israel, I see some of my relatives, my father's family. And we talk\nabout it. And we talk about it, and we talk about what they went through. And they had\nleft before the concentration camp business. They all went to Israel. And they all\nbecame very successful doctors and so on and so forth. And we discuss it very rationally.\nThey don't prefer to talk too much about it because they're doing well and they don't want\nto be reminded. But they went through quite a bit as well. And I remember the first time\nI went to Israel we took two bags of clothing to bring to them. Now they don't need my\nclothing. They're doing very well.",
        "Q: Any message you want to give to your grandson or any special message to your\nfamily?",
        "A: The truth is that my grandsons got the message by virtue of the fact that I gave them\nthe pictures to take to school. My children, my grandchildren all took these pictures to\nschool. And what they did in school and how they reacted, they all know exactly what\nhappened.",

The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty,\nand beastiology were overpowering.

        "Q: Not Aachen. You mean --",
        "Q: Ohrdruf. And then the other point we should clarify are the dates when you got to\nOhrdruf camp and when you saw Eisenhower.

        "Q: Okay. Before we leave Ohrdruf, I just wanted to ask you again some of your\nimpressions and other sites that you saw. Did you have a sense of the layout of the camp?",
        "Q: You are 25 years old, a young man, and obviously not prepared for this. How did\nyou handle this or do you remember what thoughts were going through your mind when\nyou saw piles of bodies and ovens and lime pits and so forth?",

        "Q: Did you feel any differently after this experience at Ohrdruf than before?",

        "Q: Did you show your wife these pictures? I'm talking about in the 1940s. I'm not\ntalking about later. I'm saying when you first came home. Did you show your wife the\nphotographs?",
        "Q: Why not?",
        "Q: Did what you go through affect -- you had alluded to this before -- affect your\nfeelings about being Jewish?",

        "A: Born in New York City, August 4th, 1919.",
        "A: My parents came -- My biological parents came from Romania, which I understand\nis now Austria. And then my father remarried. My other mother came from Russia,\nMinsk in Russia. Both came over about \u2014 all three of them came over about the same\ntime, 1914, 1913, something like that.",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "A: Ihave one brother, who 1s 84 years old, in Florida; I have a half sister who lives in\nNew York; and then I had a stepbrother who passed away about seven, eight years ago.",
        "A: Manhattan.",
        "A: I went through high school, and that's as far as I went. Abraham Lincoln High\nSchool in Brooklyn and James Monroe High School in the Bronx. Those were the two\nhigh schools I went to. My parents kept moving around because my father was a grocer,\nkept selling one store, moving to another borough, and so on and so forth.",
        "A: Not close, but a loving family. My father -- my mother passed away when I was five\nyears old and my father remarried two years later. So there were two years that I was sort\nof kicked around from relative to relative. And some of them didn't want me because I\nwasn't a very nice child, actually.",
        "A: Well, I was a little wild, a little cantankerous. As a matter of fact, my mother always\nused to say, \"Don't worry, you'll have children.\" I had a son who was just as wild as I\nwas.",
        "A: My mother -- my second mother was a Hebrew school teacher. And the truth is, I\ngot so much of religion that as soon as I graduated -- rather, had my bar mitzvah -- I quit\nthe synagogue. And that was it. That was the end of my Jewish education.",
        "A: I didn't like being Jewish. I really didn't. Only because I had so much of it. And I\nwent to a Hebrew school where the old people used to look at young kids as Americana\nfailed. I don't know if you understand Yiddish. Wild animals. Because we want through\nthe halls of the Hebrew school. And I just couldn't wait to get out of there. So my\nHebrew education was very, very nil until I got into the service. There, I found out that it\nwas pleasant. We discussed history with the chaplains and I began to find my religion --\nnot that I was ever religious, but I began to find out a little bit about Judaism at that time.",
        "A: After-school Hebrew school.",
        "A: My parents spoke Yiddish, and of course I never knew I could talk Yiddish until I\ngot into the service in Germany. And that's where I began to speak half German, half\nYiddish. That consists of my Yiddish today. And it was only because my parents used to\nspeak Yiddish in the house all the time that I sort of picked it up without realizing I could\ntalk Yiddish.",
        "A: Some. Not too many. I lived in Jewish neighborhoods most of the time, but I did\nhave some.",
        "A: Not really, because living in a Jewish neighborhood, I thought the whole world was\nJewish.",
        "A: Well, in school I was on track, baseball, the usual things. Nothing outstanding. I\nwas never a real good athlete, so to speak, but I enjoyed athletics.",
        "A: No. My brother, who's six years older than I, lived his own life. He was always\nsingle. He just got married maybe 15 years ago. He was always with the social bit. And\nwe were never a close family. It was only after I got married that I began to have a\nfamily and a close family, my wife's family, my own family.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I went to work carrying the bags of a jewelry salesman. And it was quite an\nexperience, and I did that for about a year or two. And then I went to work for a jewelry\ncompany. And for the beginning of my life before the service, that's about all I did,\nworking for jewelry companies, because that's where my experience lie. And then I went\ninto the service.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Very little or nothing at all. I only realized -- that's very interesting. I only realized\nwhat could be going on in Europe when I was in the service. And I remember sitting in a\nJeep and reading the Stars and Stripes newspaper that they found out \u2014 I think it was in\nPoland, that they realized that Jews were being tortured. And they began to explain to us\nas to how the torture was going to be. And I read it. And I'm Jewish. And I put the paper\naway and I went about my business. It never had any effect on me whatever, at all, until\nof course I went into the concentration camp. And then I became Jewish.",
        "A: Some. I mean, I can't say I was completely ignorant of what was going on. I knew\nthat the Jews were having trouble. As a matter of fact, we had relatives in Europe, my\nfather did. I'm close to them today, as a matter of fact. And my father was trying to help\nthem come over and so on and so forth. But I don't know the details because I really\ndidn't care at that time. I was too young. And I was worried about myself. I was worried\nabout my well-being, so to speak, and finding a job. Those days, it was important to find\na job and support yourself and move out of the house, which is what I did.",
        "A: Just before -- not long before I got married. I got married at 24. I must have moved\nout at 21, something like that.",
        "A: Then the draft came along. I just want to get my facts straight. The draft came\nalong, and I figured that's the greatest way out. That's the best thing for me. I didn't join\nbecause I was Jewish or because I looked to save the world. I joined to change my life.\nAnd this is the truth. I was rejected six times because I had a hernia. And each time I'd\ngo down there in the hopes that they would let me get in. Finally they wouldn't let me get\nin, so I went for an operation, a hernia operation. It cost me $250, which I saved up. And\nwas it the sixth time I went down there? I was rejected because of my eyesight. I was\nput on limited service. But the seventh time I got in. And as a matter of fact, I remember\nthat first night in the service. I had already met my wife. I was going with her and so on.\nMy first night in the service, they put me in a barracks with maybe 100 other guys, and I\nwas on the top bunk. And there I was, lying on the bunk. And I'm looking at the ceiling,\nwhich was like a foot or two away. And I'm saying, \"What am I doing here? Who needs\nthis? And I volunteered for this?\" And that was my introduction into the service.",
        "A: 1943. I got out in'45. Two and a half years I was in. I'm trying to think of the\nmonth.",
        "A: I guess spring. Yeah, it must have been spring. Early spring or summer, something\nlike that. If I had my discharge in front of me, I could tell. But I don't really remember\nthe date.",
        "A: No, not really. I just heard about it but very vaguely from -- I read newspapers. I'm\nan avid reader in that context. And it didn't affect me one way or another.",
        "A: I went to Camp Upton, New York or New Jersey, I forget where. And we stayed\nthere -- I was in the states for less than six months. From there, we went to Plattsburgh,\nNew York, where I got married. And then we came down to Elkins, West Virginia. And\nthen we went right to the port of embarkation 1n a period of about six months. And I\nwent overseas to a place called Conington, England. Spent a nice time there. Never\nworrying about what the war was going to be like or anything like this.",
        "A: Iwasa patriotic American. That's the only reason. Not because -- I had heard\nthings, but it didn't affect me that much. I felt that 1t was my job. I had heard about\nHitler; I can't say that I didn't. But it didn't affect me that much only because I didn't pay\ntoo much attention to any of that. And I was in there because I wanted to change my life,\nfor one thing. And for another thing, I wanted to get into the service. I wanted\nsomething different. I wanted some adventure, so to speak.",
        "A: Very little. And it all goes back to my mother who kept drumming my being\nYiddish, my being Jewish, over and over and over again until I just couldn't take any\nmore. So I tried to be as -- not that I tried to be a goy, but I tried to be as non-Jewish as I\ncould possibly be. And I got along with most everybody. I never suffered any real\ndiscrimination, although some of the boys who were in my outfit were religious and they\ntook Fridays off and that sort of thing. And they were discriminated against, not me.",
        "A: Never. This is solely my own doing. The only one I talked to really about it was my\ngirlfriend, who is my wife now. And my parents just wouldn't -- didn't understand. They\nwere European people. My mother, who is my second mother, was just as good to me as\nmy original mother, who I barely remembered. And we had no rapport with each other. I\ncouldn't talk to them. My father was busy in the grocery store. My second mother was\nthere helping him. And I never saw my father, really. He'd go into the store before I got\nup, come back from the store after I was in bed. As a matter of fact, I remember one time\nI walked into the house and I looked into their bedroom as I passed. It was a railroad flat.\nAnd I looked into the bedroom and there was my father in bed. I had never seen my\nfather in bed. And I looked in. I says, \"Hi, Pop. How are you?\" He says, \"Not so good.\"\nI says, \"What's the matter?\" And I sat down. And it was like almost the first time I ever\nsat down with him. I says, \"What's the matter?\" He says, \"I hurt my back and I can't\nmove.\" And then I said to him, \"Pop, this is the first time I have ever seen you in bed\nsick.\" I says, \"I've never seen you that way before.\" He says, \"Herbert,\" he says, \"I can't\nafford to be sick.\" What I'm trying to bring out 1s, that was my upbringing, the work ethic\nand so on and so forth. But close to my parents, I never was.",
        "A: England, a place Conington. We spent about three months there. Very, very\npleasant experience. And then we moved down to Southampton, which was a staging\narea for the invasion of Europe.",
        "A: 628th Light Equipment Engineers.",
        "A: Well, we were switched from army to army because we were a small outfit, about\n100 men. And we worked the shovels and the road graders and the bulldozers, and so on,\nclearing roads and so on. We were doing that in England as well. And we were moved\nfrom the -- we originally went over, I think it was the First Army. And then we were\ntransferred as we went down to the Third Army. And then in Europe, I think we wound\nup with the Seventh Army. I'm not quite sure of these details.",
        "A: Southampton, waiting for the invasion. We were in Southampton I guess it must\nhave been about a month until the invasion. And we went over about D-plus 10, 12,\nsomething like that. D-Day plus 10. I wasn't part of the initial invasion. But it was a\nlittle harrowing. And we got stuck on a sand bar. And finally they got us off and they\nwere bombing us and so on and so forth. From there, we landed on Utah Beach. I didn't\neven remember the beach until I sort of looked it up for my company. Utah Beach. And\nthen from there, we sort of went inland through the hedgerows and so on.",
        "A: Absolutely not. We were so busy embroiled in what we were doing because we were\nunder fire here and there, bombardments and so on. And I didn't have time to worry\nabout anybody else but myself, actually.",
        "A: Oh, that's when we went into Germany. We had gone into Germany through\nAachen. I remember that. And somebody said to us, \"Hey, fellows, you better get up to\nthis camp. There are a lot of dead bodies up there.\" A civilian told us. And we went\nthere. And those are the pictures that I show you of what we actually saw. They never\neven had a chance to pick up the bodies. The bodies didn't even smell yet because they\nwere so new. The Germans had left voluntarily because they were afraid of who was\ncoming. And they took off. And we got there about an hour after they had shot a lot of\nthe people. And we saw ovens -- I saw them myself -- with bodies piled in front of the\novens. The ovens seemed to be too small for the bodies. But then there was a ravine with\na bunch of bodies in that they had spread lime on. And then it began to dawn on me what\nI was looking at. And then I became a Jew.",
        "A: Well, we were bombarded. And during the Bulge, the Germans were really shooting.\nWe weren't an infantry outfit; we were an engineer outfit. And we had to move back into\nFrance until the invasion was over, the German invasion was over. And then as they\ncleared it up, we began to move in. And when we first got into Germany, it was -- really,\nthere were snipers firing at us and so on and so forth. But I was never in any real hand-\nto-hand or person-to-person combat per se.",
        "A: Oh, all along. In France we always saw dead bodies. I'm talking about dead bodies\nof Germans. And all the way through, we had seen dead bodies.",
        "A: At first, I was appalled. And after that, strangely enough, you get used to seeing\nbodies. You don't pay any attention to them. And if there's an odor, you walk over to the\nother side, but you leave the bodies there. We were just -- it's a matter of survival, really,\nbeing in the service under those conditions. And you're worried about yourself. That is,\nuntil I got to the concentration camp.",
        "A: Wehad some. We had a few Jews there.",
        "A: Notreally. I had two basic friends who were Jewish -- three. One was the\nlieutenant. The other was -- the other two were buddies of mine. And we sort of -- the\nthree of us stuck out together. The lieutenant, he was sort of in another category. And\nwe went places together. We did things together and so on.",
        "A: No. And that surprises me. I'm so dedicated now to that sort of thing. I wasn't\nbefore. I really wasn't. And it's been since the site of the holocaust, since being in the\nconcentration camp, that I really became Jewish. As a matter of fact, my son didn't want\nto be bar mitzvahed, but I made him become bar mitzvahed and so on. These two girls\nthat I brought with me are fairly religious.",
        "A: Well, I think the first town I remember was Aachen. And then we moved past\nAachen and we were told about the concentration camp which I just told you about.",
        "A: A German.",
        "A: Yeah. See, I can understand German a little bit because I spoke a little Yiddish. And\nI was amazed to find out that I could talk German. As a matter of fact, I became the\ninterpreter between the Germans and my outfit because the boy, \"Hey, Bitter, he talks\nGerman.\" I was really talking Yiddish. That's where we found out, and that's where we\nwent to the concentration camp. There were a few of us. I don't remember who they\nwere. I know that my two buddies were among them but I don't remember who else. And\nthen we saw the bodies --",
        "A: No, no. We just -- a bunch of us went to where we -- he said there was a lot of dead\nbodies there. We didn't know whether they were Germans or Jewish or Americans or\nanything, so we went there.",
        "A: Well, we were all spread out. We were in various vehicles and so on. And\nremember, I was in an outfit with 100 men and we were attached to various divisions. So\nit was no problem. They just told us where it was, and we drove up there.",
        "A: Corporal. And we drove up there. And there was --",
        "A: The two buddies that I had, Jewish boys, Elliot Bass and Abe Corn.",
        "A: Only to see what was there. We were told there were bodies. And we had to find out\nwhat they were, whether they were Americans, whether they were Germans, whether\nthey were -- we didn't know anything about, really, the concentration camps. We did not\nexpect a concentration camp per se.",
        "A: He just told us where it was. He didn't give us any name or anything like that.",
        "A: He says, \"There's a camp with bodies 3 miles away up this road.\" He says, \"Why\ndon't you go up there and look at it.\" See, the Germans were terribly afraid of us. They\ndidn't want to be tortured. They thought that maybe we would come in and torture them.\nAnd of course, we weren't looking to cause any havoc. So we wanted to see what the\nbodies were that were up 1n this camp.",
        "A: I don't remember the date. It was right after we went into Germany, after the -- better\nstill, it was the day before Eisenhower, Bradley, and --",
        "A: -- Patton were there. Of course, they came later.",
        "A: I found out later. And that's one of the things that bugged me because we didn't\nknow where we were, just that we were past Aachen and that there was this camp. And\nthe pictures will show you exactly what we saw as we went through the fences. There\nwas no resistance.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We saw this fence, which was a barbed wire fence. And as we drove in, we saw\nbodies lying all over the area. And we couldn't believe it. We didn't even know they\nwere Jewish or anything like that. We just saw the bodies. And then we went in. And\nthere were a number of people who were alive. A number of people. And they began to\nyell in Yiddish to us. And I understood Yiddish. And I began to talk to them and they\nbegan to tell us what went on, what camp it was. And this was all new to us. We had\nnever experienced anything like this. And there was one Polish boy in that camp who\nspoke Yiddish. And surprisingly enough, he had a bicycle. And he held onto that\nbicycle. And he was the one that showed us around from place to place, showed us\nwhere they slept, showed us where the bodies were. And we were just absolutely\nappalled. That was a real revelation.",
        "A: Yes. I always carried a camera.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. It was after an hour or two of being there that we took the pictures\nbecause this Polish boy wanted food or whatever he wanted. And he took us around to\nthe camp. And we wanted to see what it was. I had my camera with me all the time. And\nhe took us into a -- these long cottages where they slept. Unlike what I've seen in the\nmovies, these were like stalls for cattle, really. And there was a wooden bar in between\nthe stalls. And they were packed with hay. And that's where they slept. They slept one\nright next to another. You could barely move in the stalls. And we went up and down.\nAnd then we saw the bodies in the \u2014 outside the ovens. I didn't see a crematorium there. I\ndidn't know whether they were gassed or -- we didn't think of asking these questions.\nAnd then he took us to this pit where there must have been 500 bodies, something like\nthat, covered with lime. And what they were going to do with these bodies is throw them\ninto the pit because they couldn't burn all of them. They were going to throw these\nbodies into the pit, but they didn't have time. There was no time because the Americans\nwere there. And they didn't know who we were. All the Germans knew was that the\nAmericans are coming, let's get out of here. And there wasn't a German in that camp as\nwe walked in. But we see the Jews firsthand.",
        "A: I'm just trying to think. It was -- I wasn't really affected yet, but I began to talk to\nvarious -- and of course, there was some communication problem because a lot of the\nYiddish that they spoke, I didn't speak. For example, one of the Jewish guys we had with\nus, we used him asa KP. And he said to me one day -- we gave him a room when we\ncame into this town. And he said to me, \"Do you do you speak Yiddish? All right.\nKomm zu mine Zimmer.\" He said, \"Come to my room.\" He wanted to show me\nsomething because we were Jewish, and so on and so forth. And I says, \"Okay. I says,\n\"But was is dat Zimmer?\" I had never heard of the word \"Zimmer.\" He says \"It's\nZimmer,\" and he showed us. And he took me up to the room that he was staying in. And\nI says, \"You mean a room?\" And this is the truth because there are certain idiomatic\nexpressions that pick up the language. I never knew that a room was a Zimmer. And so\nthat's the kind of Yiddish. I spoke a fractured Yiddish but enough to understand what\nwas going on.",
        "A: It didn't quite hit me immediately or anything like that, but I began to feel it. And it\nwas only when I met these girls that I began to realize what had -- the bodies, of course,\nyou can't misinterpret. But I began to understand what was going on in this place, what\nwas going on in Germany.",
        "A: We didn't look that closely. They were dead, and they weren't dead very long. We\nassumed that they had been shot. They may have been shot just before we came there.\nBut they couldn't get rid of all of them. And that was not a big camp. It was a small\ncamp. But there wasn't enough time to get rid of all of them.",
        "A: I'm not quite sure. I think it may have been while I was there somebody may have\nmentioned it or something like that. I'm not quite sure where I learned the name. But I\nnever heard the name after I left until I began to ask people and try to research and find\nout whether there was a camp like that.",
        "A: Ohrdruf. O-D-H-R-U-F, something like that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, we were there just a good part of the day. Now, it wasn't our job to remove the\nbodies or do anything else. We had to contact I think it was the civil government of the\nU.S. Army. They would come in and take care of the government and so on and so forth.",
        "A: From my company. We were the first company to walk in there. There must have\nbeen -- in my company, there must have been 25, 40 guys. And of course, the word\nspread after that that there was this camp. And that's where Eisenhower must have found\nout about it and so on. But they came the next day.",
        "A: Isaw them. I was there. In other words, we went back. We didn't stay far from\nthem because we were bivouacking, actually. And we went back. And we didn't know\nthey were coming. And all of a sudden the gates open up and an entourage comes in,\nmaybe 100 or 200 people. I don't know. And of course the bodies had remained there\novernight. There was nothing we could do. And they came in and they were looking\naround and the cameras and all that sort of jazz. And they went through the place. And\nsomebody was explaining to them what had happened and so on. In other words, the\nhierarchy of the military had come in, and they learned about what happened and they\nwere showing it to the general. And I believe that was the first camp, maybe the only one,\nthat the three generals were there.",
        "A: General Eisenhower, General Bradley. I'm not quite sure about Patton. He was\nthere, but I didn't quite see him. He was sort of walking on his own, more or less. But\nEisenhower and Bradley were together. Wherever they went, they were together with a\nbunch of colonels and military muck-mucks or whatever they call them. And they were\nexplaining to the general what had happened there. They had heard it from one of the\nboys. So then they repeated to the generals exactly what kind of a camp it was, what it\nwas, and so on.",
        "A: I don't know about beastiology, but I know cruelty, starvation. That's something I\nhad never mentioned, the fact that they were emaciated people. These people were skin\nand bones. And we tried to help them, but we didn't have food with us. We had some K-\nrations and so on. We did the best we could. And that's why we decided to come back\nthe next day, to see if we could be of any -- we didn't know that the generals were\ncoming. And we brought back some food and so on and so forth, but it didn't amount to\nanything. And we were just appalled by what we had seen. And really, I can't honestly\nsay that it sunk in at that particular time. The bodies, had they not been Jewish I would\nhave felt the same way more or less at that time. And we went through. We were\ninterested in seeing. We couldn't believe that something like this existed, that people\ncould be so cruel as to shoot them, starve them, hang them, which is in those pictures.\nWe just couldn't believe it. And if anybody tells you he realized what it was -- maybe\nEisenhower did, but we didn't until it began to sink in.",
        "A: They were all anxious to tell me their stories. Strangely enough, Jewish people love\nto relate their problems and what had happened to them. And those that could -- a lot of\nthem were too weak to even talk. You know, they told us about where they came from,\nwhat had happened to them, and so on. But there were so many stories that one story ran\ninto another. There were so many terrible stories. And they're all most willing to talk\nAnd as a matter of fact, what I really found out more than anything else were the girls. I\ndon't want to get too far ahead. I really found out what really happened. They were\nexplicit and they were able to explain. But as far as I was concerned, we heard so many\nstories at the same time, all terrible stories. And it's like somebody pricking your finger\nhere, here, here, here, and you couldn't know where it hurts only because there are so\nmany different spots that it hurts. And we had heard so many terrible stories that there\nwere too many to affect us, so to speak. I don't know if you can understand that. But\nafter a while, we began to understand what was going on.",
        "A: No. I was the only one that spoke Yiddish, so to speak. And therefore, I was able to\nrelate to some of these people better than some of the others. Of course, a lot of them just\ndidn't understand.",
        "A: Oh, sure. I held their hand. I spoke to them. I sat with them. We were there for\nhours. And then strangely enough, here are people who are dying, who -- we picked\nourselves up and we left. It's a terrible thing not to realize the degradation that went on\nand the cruelty that went on. After all, we were in a war. And yet we were able to pick\nourselves up and leave. I don't know if I could do that today, leave back to the bivouac\narea knowing that we were going to come back the next day with whatever we could.\nAnd it wasn't very much. But then the military government moved in right after we left,\nand I guess they took care of them.",
        "A: There was nobody else there. I'm sorry. There was absolutely nobody else there.\nWe walked in through the gates, opened up the gates. They weren't locked. Rather, the\ngates -- the barbed wire gates. We opened them and walked right in. We could see the\nscenes of the dead from outside the gates. And we just went in. And there was absolutely\nnobody there.",
        "A: No. We had seen dead bodies all along. And we came in and we were just curious\nto know what it was that we were looking at. We really didn't know what we were\nseeing, at the beginning. And then we realized. I may be contradicting myself but the\nthoughts are coming so quick and so fast.",
        "A: That's correct. And then from Aachen, I just don't remember where we went because\nI was completely unfamiliar with Germany.",
        "A: It might have been Erfurt or Aachen. I'm not quite sure.",
        "A: Excuse me. Erfurt or Ohrdruf.",
        "A: Icertainly do. I believe if I got there on April 4th, which I think I got there, the\nfollowing day, Eisenhower and Bradley came to that camp. That was the very next day\nbecause the bodies were still there as we saw them the day before. And they came and\nthey looked over, and they had a small contingent of people with them. I don't remember\nwho they were. And then they left. Now, the next thing I know 1s that I saw pictures of\nthe fact that Eisenhower was there. There seemed to be a lot of people there. And the\nday that Roosevelt died, he was supposed to have been there or Bradley and Patton were\nsupposed to have been there. Now, on the day that Roosevelt died, I was in Dresden.\nNow, I had seen the concentration camp on April 4th, I believe honestly, so that\nEisenhower and Bradley were there the day after I was there. And then they may have\ncome back with photographers and with whoever.",
        "A: More or less. As we came in, we saw the bodies. To the right of the gate -- I'm\ntrying to recall because these are things you really don't forget -- were the barracks where\nthe sleeping areas were laid out like in stalls, like cattle, only they were low 2-by-4s that\nseparated each bunk. And that's all they had. And they were filled with straw. And then\nwe went from there. We saw an oven, and there were a bunch of bodies piled up outside\nthe oven. However, the ovens seemed to be too small to handle the bodies. And as we\nwent further, we saw this long pit where there must have been hundreds of bodies\ncovered with lime. And evidently they were preparing to lay the bodies into the pit so\nthey could bury them and bodies above that and so on.",
        "A: Well, it didn't quite hit me at that time, only because going through France and the\ninvasion and everything, I had seen a lot of bodies. This was a terrible, terrible thing.\nAnd then of course we realized that they were Jews. We felt a little bad. But you must\nunderstand that it doesn't hit you suddenly. You're looking and you say \"That's a terrible\nthing.\" And then you go on and so on. It's only after visiting there, after being away from\nthere that I began to realize. And it was only after I spoke to some girls who told me\nwhat they had gone through that I began to realize that this is true. This is a holocaust.\nAnd it gradually over a period of time began to sink in.",
        "A: No. Peculiar thing to say, I had no trouble at all. Because remember when you're in\nthe service you're worrying about your own being, and nothing is important as taking care\nof yourself. And I felt badly. I can't say that it just passed over me. We started to talk\nabout it, some of the boys and us, and then we began to realize how terrible a thing it\nwas. That's why when I see people who are not Jewish or people who don't care, they\ncan't believe it. And I can understand why they can't believe it because it's too much to\nbelieve. It's too much to take in at once.",
        "A: Always. Because I met Jews throughout Europe, I met refugees, I met a lot of Jews,\nand I spoke to some of them. As a matter of fact, we had one Jewish refugee that we took\nwith us, and he served as a KP, a kitchen police. He served as a KP for us. And I\nbefriended him and we talked quite a bit, but we never really talked about details. He may\nnot have known about all of these things. He was just a refugee. And we talked quite a\nbit because I spoke -- I was one of the only people in my outfit that spoke Yiddish, and\nthat's why I was able to communicate.",
        "A: He must have been about 35 years old. We found him walking along the road. And\nhe asked if he could be part of our outfit. He wanted to get to Israel. And we said, \"Well,\nwe're not going to Israel. We're going in the opposite direction.\" He says, \"Can I go with\nyou?\" He says, \"I have to eat.\" So we gave him an American uniform. We set him up.\nNobody knew who he was. And I communicated with him on a regular basis only\nbecause of the Yiddish.",
        "A: I'm not quite sure. It may have been in France, but I'm not quite sure. It's just that he\nwas with us for quite a length of time. And actually, when we came back to Marseilles to\ngo over to the Philippines for the invasion, we had to get rid of him because we couldn't\ngo aboard ship with him. So we had some of the boys put him in a truck, took him down\nto the shipyards in Marseilles. They put him on a ship that was going to eventually wind\nup in Israel. And I never heard from him after that.",
        "A: Meischer (phonetic). That's as much as I remember.",
        "A: No. Asa matter of fact, I didn't know it was a satellite until I went to Yad Vashem,\nand they told me it was a satellite of Ohrdruf.",
        "A: Of Buchenwald. Excuse me.",
        "A: Several days.",
        "A: We went back the next day and possibly once more. And then we had to move on.",
        "A: Yes. We brought whatever we could bring back, but it certainly wasn't enough. It\nwas a drop in the bucket. And we knew that the civil police were coming behind us\nbecause they had been notified and they had been told about what we had found. I didn't\ndo the notifying myself, but somebody did. And I guess they eventually came.",
        "A: I think we were the first because there was nobody in that camp when we went in.\nWe opened the gates -- the barbed wire gates and we walked in. And this is what we\nsaw. Those pictures that I showed you are what we saw.",
        "A: No. Only civilians. Only people who were either shot or died in some way, and then\nthe few that were just wandering around the camp with no place to go and nothing to do.\nThey were sort of lost. They were in a fog.",
        "A: I felt a kinship and a compassion. But as I said, it didn't hit me until I had left the\ncamps and I had spoken to some -- the Jewish girls that I had met along the way.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, we went toward Cologne because I remember being in Cologne. And the war\nwas beginning to wind down. And on the way -- and I'm not quite sure where this factory\nwas -- we came across a factory. And really, I didn't come across the factory. One of the\nofficers came to the headquarters and said, \"Hey, Bitter, are you Jewish?\" I said, \"Yeah.\"\nHe says, \"Boy, you're going to have a good time.\" I says, \"What do you mean?\" He says,\n\"I found a factory full of Jewish broads,\" and that's exactly the way he put it. And he\nsays, \"They can't talk to anybody.\" He said, \"I can't talk to them.\" He says, \"Let me\ndrive you there and I'll pick you up.\" I say, \"Can I be there that long?\" He says, \"I'll pick\nyou up. I'll come and I'll wait for you.\" He says, \"But Have a good time.\" He was being\nvery facetious. And we went there and the picture that I brought with me, the picture of\nthe four girls standing outside this factory. And I went up to the, girls knowing that they\nwere Jewish. I said [Yiddish/German expression] which means, \"What are you doing,\ngirls?\" And they were so excited at the fact that there was a Jewish soldier there. They\nhad never seen an American-Jewish soldier. They had not seen anybody. They knew\nthey were liberated because the Germans had left. And they grabbed me, literally grabbed\nme, pulled me into the building, and took me to the second floor. And I heard screaming\nand yelling of the girls. And they put me up on a -- almost like a stage. And there were\ngirls coming from all over the building. I swear to you, there must have been 100 to 200\ngirls, all disciplined. All sat down. There was one girl who took charge, and she\nexplained to them who I was. And we spoke in sort of Yiddish. And then she said, \"I\nwant you to\" -- in Yiddish she said, \"I want you to hear the stories of some of these girls.\nI want you to know what we went through.\" And I says, \"All right.\" And I sat there for\nthe next two or three hours just listening. And each girl, she said, \"Yanni (phonetic), get\nup and tell your story. Myrtle, get up and tell your story.\" And one by one, there must\nhave been 20 girls, that had -- and they told how they had been raped and taken\nadvantage of and all of that. And I began to feel. I wanted to kill somebody after\nlistening to these girls. And finally they finished. They said, \"Do you want to hear\nmore?\" I says, \"No. That's enough.\" And of course, I had to get back. And the officer\nwas waiting forme. So I says, \"Maidloch (phonetic), I'll be back tomorrow.\" I says,\n\"What can I bring you,\" I says, \"in the way of food?\" She says, \"Food, we're all right on.\"\nShe says, \"But can you bring us a few sidurim,\" prayer books. And I says, \"Well, we\ndon't have many, but I'll pick up every one I can find.\" And I went back and I got about\nthree or four from the boys in the camp. And I went back the next day with some food,\nwhatever it was, and the girls just couldn't get over me. I was a hero. I was the first\nliberator that they saw. And I spent a good part of the day with them. I took my own Jeep.\nAnd we spent some time, and then I left. And of course, I took a picture with the girls or\nall the girls. Here is the Jewish girls liberated from the German factory, slave labor. And\nit was interesting.",
        "A: It was after Aachen. And I cannot remember the distance. I can't remember the\nfactory or what they did in the factory, as a matter of fact. But the whole building was\nfull of girls. Only girls.",
        "A: Several days.",
        "A: We were heading eastward. We were heading eastward toward -- we wound up in a\nplace called Weida, Germany, which was in the Russian section. And we spent quite a\nbit of time there. And then of course we doubled back to go to Marseilles.",
        "A: No, I have no idea what they made. They were so busy telling me about their\nexperiences, not what they were, not -- but they wanted people to know how they\nsuffered. And believe me, they let me know how they suffered. And it was then that the\nwhole thing was coming together, that I began to realize what was going on in there. It's\nnot one incident that sets you apart. It's all of these incidents together. And you begin to\nrealize there's a pattern there. And that's what I began to realize. As a matter of fact, I\nmyself -- I don't know if I told you, I was sitting in a Jeep in France. And they had\nliberated some camps. I think it was in Poland or somewhere else. I don't know. And I\nread the article in Stars and Stripes. And I read about how these people suffered. And I\nclosed the Stars and Stripes, put them away, and I went about my business like it didn't\naffect me in any way. It does affect me now.",
        "A: Two days. I was there the first day. I had to go and get on with the outfit. So I was\nthere the first day. And then the second day I came back by myself with the sidurim.\nAnd I spent a good part of the day. I had my own Jeep. And then I went back to my\noutfit. And that was it.",
        "A: No, because we had to move on. There was nobody I could really talk to because we\nwere an individual outfit. We were -- we had to be attached to various armies to do the\nwork for them and so on and so forth. So there was nobody I could talk to. And I knew\nthat behind us was a civil and military governments who were cleaning up and taking\ncare of whatever we saw. And of course, the Germans didn't know any of this was going\non. None of it. And they were very, very happy to see the Americans because they didn't\nwant to see the Russians. So they were very, very happy to see us and welcome us. And\nthey had white flags outside of all the buildings. And it was a very, very nice thing.",
        "A: Because they were individual stories. \"It happened to me,\" they say. \"This is what\nhappened to me.\" And then another one said, \"This is what happened to me.\" And when\nyou hear so many individual stories, not a group of people talking with one story, there\nare a group of people talking with many, many stories, that has to affect you even if\nyou're not Jewish. And it affected me.",
        "A: Ihave to look at the picture. No, they weren't. Evidently the war or the Germans\nwere in such retreat that they weren't afraid any more because the Germans had left.\nThey were frightened, they didn't know what was going to happen to them, and they\nbegan to run. And basically, they weren't wearing stars.",
        "A: And then we went on to Dresden, as I mentioned before. And we wound up in a\nplace called Weida, W-E-I-D-A: And we were bivouacked in a schoolhouse, and we\nspent the balance of the war there. That's right. Because we had to go from there to\nMarseilles. And in Marseilles, we were going to be put aboard ships and go to the\nPhilippines for the invasion of Japan. And I had enough points to get out and I was very\nmad and we were very irritated and so on and so forth. But while we were there -- we got\naboard the ship, and we're all -- pardon me -- bitching. And the ship took off. And this\nwas after Roosevelt had died. And Truman took over. And while we were aboard the\nship, Truman declared all ships that are headed for foreign ports, military ships, to turn\nback and go to the nearest American port. And I was one of the first troops to get home",
        "after we hit Newport News, VirginiA: I was one of the first American soldiers that came\nin. Excuse me. The war in Japan had ended, so they felt they didn't need us there any\nmore and they didn't want to any more troops than they needed, so they sent us right back\nto Newport News. And I called my family and I told them I'm home. They never\nexpected me to be home. Only my mother said, \"Don't worry. He'll come home.\" And I\ndid. And I called the house and told them I would be home in a few days. They told us\nthey'd give us leave. So I said, \"I'll be home in about two or three days.\" Unfortunately, I\ngot what they call impetigo, which comes from dirt and filth. So they had to change my\nuniform and put me in quarantine. And my family had put up a sign, \"Welcome home,\nHerbie.\" And they had to change the sign because I didn't come back until a week later.\nAnd it said, \"Well, come home, Herbie.\" And that was it basically.",
        "A: No, we didn't talk about much of anything. It came out over a period of time. I may\nhave mentioned it but never any details. I didn't want to talk about my time in the\nservice. I had so many other things that I wanted to do that I wasn't going to start --\nactually a new life. I was already married. I was married in Plattsburgh while I was in the\nservice, which I didn't mention. And I was busy looking for a place to live because in\nthose days you couldn't find an apartment at all in New York. And it was only gradually.\nI never spoke about that to my parents, for some reason or another. Never. I sort of felt\nthey wouldn't understand. I may have mentioned one or two things, but I had spoken to\nmy wife. She would be the only one. And my children. My children were the ones that\nwere affected by this more than anybody else through me. And every time they went to\nschool and they spoke about the holocaust, they insisted on taking the pictures. That's\nwhy I have so few pictures left. And they were more affected. That's why my daughter\ncalled you because she had heard these stories over the years.",
        "A: No, not really. The only people that saw them was when I went to Israel and we\nwent to Yad Vashem, they asked me -- when we found out that it was part of Buchenwald\nand so forth, they asked me whether I had pictures. And they said, \"Would you send me\npictures?\" And I made copies. Somebody had a machine that made copies, and I sent\nthem the copies.",
        "A: She had seen them, I'm sure. It's just that I don't know the period of time that had\nelapsed. I wasn't hesitant to talk about it. I just didn't want to go into any detail,\nbasically. So my wife saw all the pictures. And she speaks Yiddish pretty well so she\nunderstood basically what I went through. And I didn't talk about any gory details\nbecause I wasn't interested in my family reliving it with me or anything like that.",
        "A: Because I had lived it. They had seen the pictures. They knew what I went through\nover a period of years. We had always been talking about it. And I didn't sit them down\nand tell them -- first of all, they were too young, but it was over a period of years that we\ntalked about it, we discussed it and so on. So they know everything that I went through.\nIt's just that we didn't do it in one session or anything like that.",
        "A: I became more Jewish.",
        "A: Because I began to realize what these people had gone through, and I began to see\nwith my own eyes. And I told you, over a period of time it just sort of built up in me until\nI really began -- any chance I had to help holocaust victims or whatever it is, we did. And\nwe're very active. We have our own chavurah, which is a group of friends that get\ntogether that are all Jewish. And my wife is very active in Hadassah, in all the Jewish\norganizations in Dallas. And it's a difficult place to be Jewish, in Dallas, a difficult thing\nto be Jewish in Dallas, especially when we first moved there. So she's very active there.",
        "A: After the war, I got myself a job and another job and a third job. You know, I was\nsort of trying to find myself. At the same time, I had a child a year after I came home.\nBut then I worked for a large jewelry organization, and then I got a job with the PXs in\nEurope. And we went to Japan with my family. We lived in Japan for several years,\nbelonged to the Jewish Community Center in Tokyo. And we lived in Yokohama, and\nwe spent three years in Japan. I came back, went to work for a company that was a\nmanufacturer's representative all over the world because I was used to traveling. I'm just\ntrying to think -- Let's see. Yeah. After that, I went into business for myself, made a\nsuccess of the business, and retired several years ago. And basically, that's the story of\nmy life.",
        "A: Always. It takes the slightest thing to remind me of what I saw.",
        "A: Well, when I hear about the holocaust -- and in Dallas, in the Jewish Community\nCenter, they have a holocaust museum. Nothing like this. But I go down there once in a\nwhile and look at the pictures. And a friend of mine -- I have several friends who are\nrefuges who were in concentration camps. And they're constantly talking about it and so\non. And they make various talks throughout the schools in Dallas, trying to have people\nto be cognizant of what went on and so on, but there are still a lot of skeptics.",
        "A: Excuse me. Mostly Europe. When I see certain areas in Europe, I think of the\nholocaust. I think of what I saw. I'll never forget what I saw. In fact, what I've told you\nthese are the only basic things that I remember, but so much more happened and so much\nmore that I went through that I can't remember. And I wish I could. That's why before I\ncame to see you I wondered what I'm going to say to you. I didn't realize I knew this\nmuch.",
        "A: Ihadadiary. [had a little desk that the carpenter in the outfit made for me. And\neach day I wrote into this diary. And then for some reason we had to leave quickly, so I\nlocked up the desk because I couldn't carry it with me. And they were supposed to be\npicked up by a truck. I never saw that desk again.",
        "A: Probably in -- we left from Weida, Germany, I think. And it's with the -- whatever is\nleft of the 628th Light Equipment records. It should be within that, and written by me.",
        "A: I wrote a lot of what I saw. And I don't remember exactly when I stopped writing. I\njust remember the desk was gone. I thought I would see it when I got to Marseilles, but I\ndidn't.",
        "A: Yes. I began to realize what I had saw -- seen, but for some reason or other it did not\nsink in until days, weeks later.",
        "A: That's when I began to realize. That's when I began to understand what was going\non. And the sights plus what I began to read about it all came together. And suddenly I\nbegan to realize what this was all about. You just can't look at it one time and say, well,\nthis is a terrible thing. It isn't that simple. It's something that has to build up within you.\nAnd now nobody can tell me it didn't happen or I don't believe it. I know I saw it. What\nI went through just trying to find out whether there was such acamp. At first I began to\nsay there had to be an Ohrdruf. I was in there. And everybody in Dallas, they told me\nno. The first trip to Israel they said they don't know of such a camp. And you know they\nhave all the camps laid out on a map. Never saw Ohrdruf until I went into the Yad\nVashem. Until they showed me the books. And they had the history of the camp there.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don't quite understand you.",
        "A: I didn't see the picture, number one.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, because I knew he was there. Nobody could deny it, the fact that\nEisenhower was there on the second trip, I believe. Nobody could believe that this thing\nwent on and yet people will still look at that picture and say, \"It can't be that bad.\" They\nstill do that today.",
        "A: No, nothing. If my memory improves, maybe I'll come back again.",
        "A: No, absolutely not. Nobody -- I've told you, I read it in the Stars and Stripes. Not\nthat I didn't believe it. It just didn't sink in. And that's what happens -- and I'm talking\nabout Jewish people as well. And everybody seems to say, \"Well, it's not that bad. It can't\nbe that horrible. There are a few bodies and there were some mean people there.\" But it\nexisted. And it existed on a mass scale because I saw how organized that was. And\nbelieve me, the Germans know how to organize anything. And they organized that.",
        "A: Well, only because I was curious to know what went on. We knew so little. There\nwas no history, you know, when I went in there. We knew so little. So as I spoke to\nthem, I was holding one of them and because he was an individual, not because he was\nJewish, not because he was anything. But because he was a man who had suffered and\nwho had been hungry and who was emaciated looking. And these are men that needed\nsomebody to talk to them. It's just that I couldn't stay there too long. That was the only\nthing.",
        "A: No, not at all. We didn't think of any. We just saw what we saw. We saw what was\nhappening to somebody else, not to us. And we looked and we saw. And it was just -- it\nwas a terrible sight. I only wish I could have realized it then, but maybe I wouldn't have\nslept. Maybe I would have been upset. Maybe I would have become a nervous wreck.\nSo maybe nature has its way of compensating. That could be it. Of course one more\nthing. When I go to Israel, I see some of my relatives, my father's family. And we talk\nabout it. And we talk about it, and we talk about what they went through. And they had\nleft before the concentration camp business. They all went to Israel. And they all\nbecame very successful doctors and so on and so forth. And we discuss it very rationally.\nThey don't prefer to talk too much about it because they're doing well and they don't want\nto be reminded. But they went through quite a bit as well. And I remember the first time\nI went to Israel we took two bags of clothing to bring to them. Now they don't need my\nclothing. They're doing very well.",
        "A: The truth is that my grandsons got the message by virtue of the fact that I gave them\nthe pictures to take to school. My children, my grandchildren all took these pictures to\nschool. And what they did in school and how they reacted, they all know exactly what\nhappened.\n"
