        "Q: And where were you born?",
        "A: In Krakow, Poland.",
        "Q: When?",
        "A: I was born on June 15, 1925.",
        "Q: Tell me something about your family, Murray. What did your father do?",
        "A: My father had a little store that sold milk and eggs, hardly eked out a living. My mother was\nwatching the children. We were seven kids. And my father also was a baltfele (ph). That\nmeans a step lower than a cantor. And he was earning some money during the high holidays.",
        "Q: What was your childhood like? What city are we in first?",
        "A: We are in Krakow and I was a religious boy. I was one, when the war broke out in 1939 I\nwas only fourteen years old. It was a year after my bar mitzvah...",
        "Q: Let's let's back up a little. I want to go... I don't want to get to'39 yet. Tell me about\ngrowing up. Uh, what was your childhood like, growing up in...",
        "A: A very happy childhood. We were seven children, and one was watching the other ones.\nThere was always a competition, who would say better at the tonight. Who would\nbring home a better report card? Who would be better at the... There were always in the\nfamily an uncle or another person that always will test you on a Saturday night what you\nlearned in school during the week. And your reward was a five cents that was that was good\nto buy an ice cream cone. For ten cents you can buy a chocolate bar. So if we ...1f I made by\nmine... It was my mother's uncle; if I made by him a dime, it was uh really a big winning.\nAnd for we our day start off like early in the morning we would go to the synagogue to pray\nwith the people to with my father and older brother and doing uh we will come home say\nlike 1f we would start at seven, seven thirty we'll be home, have breakfast. And by nine\no'clock we start our school day. So we, I went to a , a Hebrew school, and from nine\nto twelve we learned strictly only to talk Jewish . From twelve to one we had lunch,\nbut lunch in Europe was like dinner time. We had a full-course of meal from twelve to one.\nAt one we went back to school. We had to be there like one fifteen, and from one fifteen till\nfour o'clock, the same school, they start teaching us history, geography, math, and so on.\nAnd at four o'clock, we only had like a five minutes break to buy a little something like a\nchocolate or a candy, or... And we went back to - it was in the same building - went back to\nschool and learned from four 'til six. And at six o'clock, my mother would give me like a\nnickel or a dime and I would buy myself a roll of butter with a piece of herring, some nights\nwith cheese, and go back to the synagogue. It was like a ..... (ph), and there we will try to do\nour homework. Work mostly in the Talmud what we learn in our , and then we drop\nthem in the synagogue and we went home. there was no television. We did not\nhave the radio in our house. I recall we had like a three room apartment. In the three room\napartment we slept uh two in one bed, and there was beds that was, they opened up. One\nchild will sleep, one brother with the head one side and the other one will sleep with the head\nthe other side, so their feet will - so that was more convenient to sleep. And the rooms were a\nkitchen, then a dining room, and a bedroom and my father and mother slept in the bedroom\nwith the younger children. We seemed always to have enough room if somebody else came\nover to sleep over. We did not have the toys that the uh - what we used to do, we couldn't\neven afforded to buy uh rubber ball, because I played soccer - when I had a little chance, I\nplay I liked to play soccer, so we would take some rags, roll them them up, sew them up like\nin when it was finished looked almost like a baseball with the stitches - that's what we would\nkick around. Very seldom it has a bounce. But we had a very, maybe we didn't see anything\nbetter, but we were very happy childhood. And everything uh everybody was looking\nforward, we knew there were things getting bad in Poland cause since uh when I start to\nrecognize and understand certain things, that in 1935, '36, when the Marshall of Poland,\nMarshall Pilsudski, had died, the anti-Semitism because maybe they wanted, the Poles want\nto be friendly with the Germans or maybe that was in fashion like they say, anti-Semitism\nhad start growing 1n Poland to a very untolerable situation. But we lived in Krakow\nKazimierz. And it was strictly... It was called the Kazimierz, after the Kazimierz, the great\nKing Kazimierz who let the Jews come into Poland with so many hundred years back. And\nin , mostly was Jewish, Jewish stores, Jewish shopkeepers, Jewish synagogues, so I\npersonally did not have any connection, special connection with gentiles. We had our own\nlife. Of course we learned in school Polish but uh we did not come in any contact and we,\nour business and our daily life had no mingling with the Polish people. And there was, I\noverheard all our politicking was going on in the synagogue. And I overheard the, as a child\nI liked to listen that the uh some young people were and they were screaming to the\nolder people that Hitler may be coming and conquer Poland - we have to do something about\nit. And I don't know from the olderies (ph) first of all we were told, respect the elder people.\nWhen an elder person spoke, we were quiet. We only listened. We wouldn't dare even\nanswer them anything. So they say that they remember the Germans from World War I.\nThey are cultured. They're intelligent and the argument was going with some, we would\ncome and that after all, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, and he's out to destroy the\nJewish people. So they gave in. They say Hitler's a maniac, but the German people will\ndefinite not come to Poland. They will never hurt us. And then for what reason should they\nhurt us. We are Polish citizens. We are law-abiding citizens. And why would they hurt us?\nSo that was the, maybe now if for a Monday morning quarterback, maybe it's, 1t was their\nwishful thinking, because the average family was eight, ten and even twelve people in a\nfamily. Mostly, ninety percent or more, were very poor, hardly eking out a living. Nobody\nhad a, they may had a little uh piece of ring or piece of gold, some silverware, but wealth,\ncurrency - very few Jews had because they had always to borrow when it came a sabbath or\nwhen it came a high holiday, or any holidays if they want to prepare a table they had to go\nout and borrow some money, so currency nobody had. And it was very hard for a family of\neight or ten to go - nobody, no country in the world would take them, and of course we did\nnot have the state or vision (ph), so there was uh their wishful thinking that uh maybe there\nwould be no war and maybe they were sure that the Germans would not have the audacity,\nhave the nerve to do those things that Hitler's asking them to do.",
        "Q: What happened when the war did break out?",
        "A: But in 1939, we were first worried that my father may be taken to the army. He was born in\n1900, and he was only 39 years old. But a few weeks before the war broke out, they changed\nthe slip of paper - the there were red cards, blue cards, white cards, and there was must have\nbeen that day because of having seven children - the youngest child was four years old when\nthe war broke out - that they did not call him to the army. And the war broke out on\nSeptember 1, 1939, on a Friday morning. To me, I didn't know what's in store. To me it\nwasn't the most uh important thing. To me it was more important we had uh a championship\ngoing to Macabi, the soccer team, and that was important to me, but on Wednesday morning\nI went out near the outskirts from the Wis_a[NB: the Vistula]. Wis _a is the lake [NB: river]\nthat runs through Warsaw and Poland and Krakow. And I went over the bridge to Mos,\nMostowa (ph) and I saw already Germans. So I ran back to my dad because my dad received\nthen to go into the army, to be in the next few days near Warsaw at a certain post. So I\nscreamed to and I told my dad don't go because the Germans are already here. And the\nGermans came into Krak\u00e9w on Wednesday. That was September the 6th. And to say they\ndidn't bother us, we didn't bother them. But the first brutality I saw on the high holidays - I\nliked to run from one shul, from one synagogue or one temple to the other temple to listen to\nthe cantor singing, and as I was going in the street on the , most of our synagogues\nhad open doors to the street, and Germans came in and they happened to be Wehrmacht.\nThey were not SS. I learned later about SS. Plain Wehrmacht. Went into the synagogue,\npulled out the Jews, older people, took the thales, the skrols, throw it in the garbage, ripped\nit up and literally they say that they took out the Jews to shave their beards and their\n[side]locks, and literally I saw them ripping - blood was gushing from their faces from the\npeople and they were laughing and they were smile and then I realized that something is\nwrong somewhere. That I couldn't believe my own eyes, what I saw, and we made up our\nmind at that time, in our house we had built-in closets so we built in a double wall, and we\nhide our father, because our father still had a beard, and we and he didn't want to shave his\nbeard because of the high holidays. And we were afraid in case my father will go out in the\nstreet he will be recognized as a Jew. So we did all our, whatever work we, whatever little\nbusiness, whatever to sustain our family, my older brother, myself and my younger two\nbrothers, we did our dealings, and it was till maybe October or November when the first\nsnow came on the on the , not only the snow on Ka...on our street - it's snowing all\nin Krakow, maybe in Warsaw too, but the first snowstorm - they closed off the streets and\nthey start going door to door, only to Jewish families in their apartments and it couldn't go\nthrough my mind - there were calling us Jews with lice, Juden (ph), dirty Jews.\nYet so nice they asked if you have a ring. My mother had a little ring, a little\ncandelabra for lighting the candles on shabbat, a little piece of - they took everything\naway. On some occasions, people said that they even give them a little paper that they took\nit, enough that they was going to give it back to them. But I was one of the boys that they\ntook down to the courtyard and they make bundles - everybody makes for himself a bundle\nand roll down to his mother, the soldiers, yeah, to his mother - that that was already SS.\nThere was difference because normally the Wehrmacht will be the fighters and the SS will\nbe the administrators. So I saw that they uh in here to rob us with everything we got, but yet\nwe didn't, we didn't care so much. We were never hang up on, we didn't have wealth and we\nwere not hanged up on the piece of stuff that we lost. To us it was important, the family. As\nlong as we stayed whole. But every few weeks new laws came out. Laws that a Jew has to\nwear on his right arm an arm band with the Star of David. If you were caught without it, you\nwere subject to being shot. We didn't pay too much attention. I was a blonde boy, blue eyes,\nspoke a perfect Polish, and I was little. I was never a tall boy. So I could pass for below\ntwelve. I didn't carry no papers with me so I kept on screaming if somebody asked me why\ndidn't you wear the star, I was saying I'm not Jewish. And again we worried only about our\nfather and every time they passed a new law, a Jew has to do this, and above everything,\nwhen they came in they start confiscating Jewish stores. And I'm not talking about the Poppa\nand Momma store, little grocery or little luncheonette but stores of meaning - textiles, shoes,\ncol...colonial - that is coffee and tea, some specialities and of course the Jewish factories.\nAnd in most cases they took away Jewish out of the Kazmierz. They took out Jewish\napartments and they took it away for them, from them. They tell them that they need it for\ntheir administrative group. And the more high ranked you were in the list by the Gestapo or\nby the SS, a bigger store or a bigger factory you receive. In that case, Oskar Schindler\nreceived the biggest factory in Krakow, the Patzenpen (ph) factory. I get back to that later\non, but let me tell you about the family. In March of 1940, things start to go very bad in\nKrakow. My father had a brother in O_arow. That's near Lublin, and he wrote us food is\nbetter, you can get better food in the smaller town than in the big city, so he took his whole\nfamily and he moved to O_aro\u00e9w except myself. I stayed to watch the belongings in our\napartment, and I stayed there for a few months and what's happening while those were\ncoming out, then from time to time they fooled the people and they start loosen up a little bit.\nSo there was talk - we only lived by rumors, so there were rumors that the Jews in Krakow\ncan come back. So by July, my parents and the children came back. In August, the beginning\nof August, they asked us to be, to register. If we register and they like the idea who we are,\nwhat we are, we will have the privilege to go in in March, it was already written down that in\nMarch of 1941 it will be established in Krakow a ghetto. And only if you worthy you going\nto stay in the ghetto. If you're not worthy, you'll be shipped out. My father registered, and\nthat was a part of fooling the people. If you register, then they know you are, they know your\nplace. My father registered and my mother registered and that was some papers that I found\nin the Warsaw archives after the war, and in 1941, like in February, I went out again to get\nsome food for the family, and a Polish policeman grabbed me. And he said, \"Why are you\nhere so early? You must be Jewish.\" And I kept saying, \"No, I'm not Jewish.\" So he took me\nto...he said, \"Let's find out if you're Jewish or not.\" And he took me to the Gestapo and they\npulled my pants down. And I... They start asking me where I live, and I didn't want to give\nup my family, give out my family. So I stayed and I said uh whatever will happen will\nhappen; and one of the Gestapo came out and he says to the Polish policeman, there's a train\nin the train station full of Jews that they are being deported to a town, Bia_a Podlaska. That\nwas on the east side, near the border in Poland where the Russians took part of Poland.\nLemberg, Lwow--near that side. And he even used the word: \"Take that little scheiss and put\nhim on the train.\" So I was on the train. I was very happy to be on the train. And I came to\nBia_a Podlaska; and I wrote home a letter and saying, \"Dad and Ma - I can escape because\nnobody's watching me. Should I come home? I'm coming home.\" So I immediately got back\na letter not to come home, that they were already marked also to be deported. They were not\naccepted to go to the ghetto because my father had no trade. And very seldom do they took\nseven, a family of with seven, eight, nine people into the ghetto. They took to the ghetto\nyoung people with one child or two children and those who worked for the uh they can show\npapers and those special papers was called the , and if they got the , that\nmeans if you work, then you could go to the ghetto. Many people had signed up to work in\nthe factory Emailia, NKF [NB: Neue Kuhler- und Flugzeugteile-Fabrik] by Schindler.\nPeople paid, they signed out if they own a house, diamonds, whatever they could lay their\nhands on, to get those papers to be able to stay in Krakow. My father and mother and the six\nchildren was sent away to Miedzyrzec [Podlaski]. Miedzyrzec [Podlaski], from Bia _a\nPodlaska, from Russia is no more than twenty-one kilometer. That's about fifteen miles. And\none morning, I'm walking in the street, and I see my father . I said to my father,\n\"What are you doing here?\" He said, \"Come. I came to take you home. We are all in\nMiedzyrzec [Podlaski].\" So we stayed in Miedzyrzec [Podlaski], and we were told then the\nreason we are sent in this direction of the east that the fields are more fertilized. It's easier to\nfeed the people. And we were hoping that this is the case. And that was April, May; and my\nbrother and myself were assigned to work for the Germans, to cut the furrows and to make\nroads for the aeroplanes, to make aeroplane fields. Because the Germans had in their mind to\nstart to attack the Russians. And June 22nd in 1941, the war with Russians had started; and\nmy brother and myself, every night we could go home. The fact is while we were walking\nhome, about ten kilometers, we were stopping at a farmer, exchange - money was not worth\nanything - but exchange for little something. He would give us some potatoes, some corn,\nsome food. And that's how we sustain ourselves. When the war broke out on June 22nd, they\ntell us we cannot go home. And they start putting wires around us and they said they are\nmaking a camp. And they need our work. They need to load up some stuff and one day,\nbefore they start putting the electric wire on it, my brother and myself escaped. And we ran\nin for five minutes to our father's home, and we said we're not going to stay in that camp. We\nrunning back to Krakow. We going to sneak in 1n the ghetto. We're going to be in Krakow.\nKrakow 1s a big city. Maybe we can pass for Aryan. We're going to Krakow. So we start by\nfoot. And when we came in like half-way, near the Wis_a; and I was stuck in in ;\nNowy Korczyn, in Polish. My brother was stuck in Staszow, by a family. I had no food to\neat, so during that time, 1t was like in July, there were on the trees some green apples, and I\nate those green apples and I have uh (ph) diarrhea and I got very sick, so I was going\nfrom place to place and finally near Nowy Korczyn there was a Polish family who\nneeded a shepherd boy. They had cows. And I said, \"I will do it. I don't want no money.\nOnly thing I want is to get a little better and get some potatoes, uh cooked potatoes, so...so\nmy stomach will get better.\" And meantime, in...1n Miedzyrzec [Podlaski], my family was\nstarving. There was no food. There was no nothing. So my father put on clothes like uh...like\na man [who] was a farmer, and he got himself a a paper that he is uh like a Polish farmer.\nAnd he went back to his brother to O_ar\u00e9w. And my mother took five children, dressed like\na peasant girl, took a train, and came into Krakow. And when she came back to Krakow, the\ngates for the ghetto was closed off. We had an uncle in the ghetto, so he sent out somebody.\nAnd he said, \"The best thing for you 1s to go like twenty-five, thirty kilometer. Near...there's\na town, Proszowice. Near Proszowice. You can go there and get from a farmer a room for\nyou for your family.\" So she did that. She had a few zlotys--that's Polish currency--and she\nrented; and the place was called Stagniowice. So in 1941, maybe it was September, October,\nshe rented a one-room apartment. And my father couldn't stand uh being without his wife\nand children, so from O_ard\u00e9w he went to Staszow and collected my younger brother, and\nfrom Staszow they come to [Nowy] Korczyn. We wrote letters to each other into the ghetto\nto my uncle, Isaac Levenstein (ph), who was my mother's brother. He stayed with his wife\nand two children in the ghetto. He had...he happened to have in the ghetto a factory from\nbefore the war that was like Brillos, but without the soap, and he maked those Brillos for the\nsoldiers, for the for the German army. So he had the privilege, him and another partner, to\nstay in the ghetto. So we had our con...contact through that uncle, so my father knew by\nwhich farmer I was uh near Nowy Korczyn, and it was after the holiday, high holiday, and\nhe collected me and we all went and we finally hooked up together with my mother and she\nwas there with five children. And we were all nine again together from 1941, by October;\nand was the happiest days of our life. In one room, nothing to eat. And the greatest pain that I\ncan see, when my mother was cooking some food (crying) and she would say she's not\nhungry. We knew she was hungry, but she wouldn't allow herself to have a little food\nbecause she wouldn't take it away from her children. We...again we had to register in the\nJewish because to get some rationing, some food. Without it we couldn't sustain\nourselves, so towards the end of 1941, they say that for to feed our family, one, a male,\nespecially the husband, the men in the house, has to go to a brick factory or a lager camp\nnear Krakow. So my brother said he will go, to save our father. So my brother went. The end\nof '41 he went to camp. It was called U lag, near Krakow. In March of 1942, they said they\nneed more men to go to a brick factory. So again we want to save our father. So I went. And\nin 1942 I came to a factory of bricks in Krakow. I could have escaped. Was easy to escape,\nbut they hold our family hostage. If we would escape, they knew where our family lived, so\nfor the love for our family, we gladly stayed in that camp. It wasn't so terrible. So we all\nalways lived with the idea, the Russian...the Russians already fighting with the Germans, the\nBritish, the French, that an end will come very soon. And to sustain ourselves and to also\nhelp out the uncle in the ghetto that I mentioned to you, my two brothers and a sister also\nblonde, blue-eyes, will go by little train - that was a small train, not a regular train - will go\nfrom that town into Krakow and they will smuggle into the ghetto flour, bread, eggs\nsometimes - whatever they could lay their hands. Even sometimes a piece of meat, and they\nwill bring it to the uncle. The uncle normally will have it for himself. Sometimes he will sell\nit in the ghetto, that stuff, and from that my parents lived. In 1942 they start liquidating all\ntowns in Poland. And maybe it was luck and maybe it was not luck, they forgot about us. We\nwere on the outskirts from Proszowice, and maybe nobody put up a list on it. And they...they\nmade, it was called visedlenie (ph). That means taking the people out. There was always,\nthey always take out some people and the rest they left over because they said we need you.\nSo the, now the hindsight, the Monday morning quarterback, I would understand that they\ntook out the men so the women and the children could not put up the resistance. When they\nhad us in camp where they make barbed wires already, and they change it from a regular\ncamp to a concentration camp. Tell me you had no choice to fight. You couldn't fight. You\ncouldn't escape. So in 1942, in the meantime, they open up a concentration camp, what's\ncalled in Krakow-P_aszow. It was old Ierozolimska (ph). It was a new cemetery and it was\ncalled Ierozolimska (ph) and that cemetery was a Jewish cemetery. So on that cemetery, they\nbuild barracks--factories, that they make shoes, uniforms, brushes, whatever they could get\nthe work out from the Jewish people. The knit...knitting factories. They make sweaters,\nsocks. And they prepared this camp. So from the brick factory and from U lag, I myself with\nmy brother were united...with my older brother; and we stayed in that camp. In the first there\nwas an Obersturmfthrer Miller (ph). He wasn't so bad. And it wasn't so bad \u2018til on a Friday in\n1942, it must have been like September, when Amon Goeth took over that camp. In the first,\nit was on a Friday morning - I will never forget that. When he took over that camp, they\ntook us from that place--it was called \"appellplatz\"--the place that they count us. Every day,\nthey count us like we would be worth a fortune. And...and in that moment, Goeth took out...\nThere was, we was run by Jewish police. The SS was on the outside, and inside in the camp\nwas only a few SS people. But most was run by Jewish police, and Jewish kapos. So they\ntook out, he took out the leader from the Jewish police, Katz, and his second his in\ncommand, Goldberg, and they shot them both on the spot, Katz and Goldberg. So I start\nseeing the brutality of Amon Goeth, and he said I'm going to shoot every Jew if you're not\ngoing to obey, if you're not going to work diligently, so in that time I I saw that we are in for\na lot a lot of trouble. In the meantime at home, in 1942 after the high holidays, they found\nout there were people hiding and they would start cleaning up when they had finished the big\ncities. The smaller cities, they start going to the outskirts, and my father saw from far away\nthat some Germans are coming with some, that some people, there's a lot of horses and\nwagons, there's a lot of things going on, so he pushed out from the house a brother right after\nme and another one and and my sister. They pushed them out from the house, and he said\nrun. So they run into the ghetto, to Krakow. They knew their way to go into the ghetto so\nthey run into the ghetto. My father and mother and the youngest sister and the youngest\nbrother, they took to the town of Miechow. And in Miechow, they had at that time maybe\neighty or ninety Jews altogether. So they asked the men to stay on one side, and the women\nand children on the other side. They didn't know what they're going to do, but my father will\nnot have it. He said, \"I will not leave my wife or with two children. Whatever will happen to\nher, will happen to me.\" They took the men out 1n the side and they asked one, always will\nask the the commander, what should we do with them. So they said, \"It's not enough people\nto make a transport. Shoot them on the spot.\" And they killed my father and mother. One\nwas holding one child in the hand and one was holding the other child in the hand. I know it\nfor a fact, because two days later the men who were segregated were brought into our camp,\nand they were crying like little babies, that they left their family. They felt the guilt. It was\nthe murderers who put them to that position. Because after all, we are taught that life is so\nprecious, that life with force you are born and with force you must die. You cannot take your\nown life, that life by Jewish people is very precious. But they knew my father. They knew\nmy mother. And that was the beginning of that I lost my father and mother and a brother and\na sister. And in the meantime, I was with my older brother in camp in P_aszow. In 194...and\nI building barracks. We were building factories. We were building barracks. It was, we were\nin two different groups. They normally separated so first we were in one group but then we\nwere in separate groups. Every group had fifty peo...boys. And with fifty boys went a Jewish\nkapo. In 1943, in March, beginning of March, they liquidated Krakow ghetto. My two\nbrothers and sister did not have papers. They they were not legally in the ghetto, so they\nhide. They hid and they liquidated the ghetto on a Saturday. I think it was March Ilth. And by\nWednesday, and they brought in all the people. And one occasion I I will forget that - the\nwomen were coming out and one woman had in her knapsack a little baby. And the little\nbaby was crying, and the German heard...heard the baby crying, and he killed the baby and\nthe mother on the spot. Shot them on the spot. And our group from were taken to\nright on Sunday they start cleaning out those people who had no papers and those people\nwho were hide, they were bringing up to P_aszow, and we, the boys, had to take them down\n- some of them were complete dead, some was not dead - in one case I saw a girl, a young\nchild that wasn't dead, and we asked the German give the girl, give her ,aaa\na thing of mercy, so we wouldn't bury her alive. So he said, shmutzige, shit (ph), he said,\nthrow it just in the way it is and it's it's it's a shot (ph) to throw in, to waste a bullet on that\npiece of uh you know what I'm talking about. And my uncle was taken into the P_aszdw (ph)\nand he left in in the ghetto his wife and two children to be hidden, for the children were not\nlegal. And my bro...two brothers and a sister were there too, and every day, every night when\nI come back to the barracks, he would say did you see any familiar faces. And every day,\nevery time I look at a corpse that looks a little bit similar, I turned it around to see if it's any\nof my family. Till on Wednesday that week, they brought in my brother and a sister. And I\nfound out later that one brother escaped. How he escaped is beyond me, but he had escaped\nand he was walking around in Krakow. My brother and sister were, mind you, they probably\nwere hungary so they left the ghe...the ghetto and they were on the road from the ghetto\nalready on the bottom, and the ghetto was not watched anymore by the Germans. It was\nwatched by the Poles because it was all quiet. The only thing they did in the ghetto is to look.\nMaybe people put some wealth in the walls. They start looking and maybe they thought\nsomebody was hidden. They took boys from P_aszow to look over and to check out the\nghetto if nobody is there. But they themselves were finished with the all the brutal work that\nthey done. And two Polish policemen killed my brother and sister. And I know it for a fact,\nbecause I... people told me that. 'Cause people who work in the ghetto saw it. They maybe\nwere for lookout for them. When you were working the ghetto, you look out for somebody.\nYou open up, you cut a piece of wire to let them out. And they could not escape. So I had\nlost another brother and sister. So we were left three in the family. I heard about my younger\nbrother, that he is in Krakow working at the Wis_a by uh those ships and he he 1s sustaining\nhimself, 'til 1944, he was all in Krakow til October or November. October or November,\nwhen the Wis _a froze up they had no work for him on on the ships no more. He went, he had\nno money. And he went to sleep out _ up the hills where they kept the salt hay for the\ncows and for the on the outskirts from Poland. And a Polish peasant caught him, and he said,\n\"If you sleeping in during the winter in that uh snow outside, you must be Jewish.\" So he\nknew the prayers of uh the Catholic prayers as as better than any Catholic. And he said the\nprayers in front of him, but nothing helped him. And he received an award for that, twelve\npounds--that's five kilo--sugar. For every time you gave out a Jew in Poland, you got a\nreward of five kilo sugar. I know it for a fact, because after the war I came to Krakow and\npeople told me that. And I asked him to testify. He said, \"There's no use of testifying. The\nman ran away.\" I'm positive surely he did not run away. But I didn't know who the man was,\nand I couldn't bring him to any justice. I was left with my brother in camp. In 1943, about...it\ncould have been in August or September - it was already chilly a little bit - I worked in [the]\nBarrackenbau. We were fifty boys. And to Krakow came in a new commander tn chief. His\nname was Frank (ph) and Amon Goeth tried to be friendly with him. So he took out all our\nfifty boys with, we loaded up loads of topsoil on trucks and we went near Krakovia (ph)\nplace. There was a big beautiful villa and we made a garden for Frank. While we maked the\ngarden on our way home, one of the boys escaped and when we got in we were forty-nine\nand our kapo. And the kapo didn't notice it that he escaped, so he started beating us over the\nhead with his stick, the night stick that the policeman carries, and they wouldn't let us in.\nThey waited until Goeth comes down from his villa, and Goeth came in and he said, where's\nthe fiftieth? We all say we don't know. We didn't even know him we said. Maybe we only\nwent out forty-nine. So he said for that that one escape, he shot every second boy. A boy was\nshot next to me, to my right, and a boy was shot on the left of me. I cannot recall if 1t was\ntwenty-four or twenty-five, but all we were left is half of our group. The other half of our\ngroup was shot right then and there. I saw it will be impossible to live and to be in the\nBarrackenbau. It was the worst work and was working outside and I, maybe I learned like\nthe animal the necessity of survive. I recognize Goeth when he's ready to shoot people. He\nwill have with him that the instinct of an animal. He would not eat his breakfast or\nsometimes lunch unless he saw Jewish blood. And he will wear three different hats. The\nofficer's hat, the plain soldier's hat and a Tyrol like when you go yacht (ph), uh a Tyrol hat.\nThat Tyrol hat was the most dangerous hat. And by the way, Amon Goeth was an Austrian,\nand he was called in 1946 and people testified and they hanged him in Poland, uh Krakow.\nSo when he would go in with this hat, I would always sneak away, because regardless if you\nwork hard or not, whenever it was convenient for him, for no reason at all, he'd while he was\nriding his horse, from the horse he will shoot, or even while he was walking. He will go\nover, behind the ear - that was his specialty. Go over to a man, behind his ear shoot him, and\nthen scream and yell, then go back home. People testified and he was saying now you can\ngive me my lunch or my breakfast. So it was, being in the Barakenbau (ph) was almost\nunbear...unbearable. So at night, after everybody finished their work at six o'clock, instead of\ngoing back to my barracks to relax, I would go to the kitchen and in the kitchen I would chop\nwood for the people who work in the kitchen. I will also wash for them their kettles. And I\ndid a good job at it. And once I caught the eye of the SS man, and he said why are you\nworking here. You're not working in the kitchen, cause I was shabby dressed. And I said I\nneed food. I'm hungry. So he said, for you working so hard and I chopped the wood very\ngood and I washed the kettles good, when we will enlarge, they kept constantly enlarging\nthat camp from ten thousand to twenty thousand, there were the people to come from\nHungary, I will give you, I will assign you to a kettle. And sure enough, even normally this\nwas assigned by the Jewish police, so one morning I was called in to get a kettle in Krakow,\nin in the in camp, a kettle in the kitchen. And the Jewish policeman said, we didn't send you\nthere. So the German said, I gave it to him. If he wouldn't say the word, I gave it to him, they\nwould probably beat me. I thought they would probably kill me by beating me, so that was\nlike the end of 1943, and my working in the kitchen, I had the opportunity to help myself,\nhelp my other friends and especially help my elder brother. And that was from 1944 in May -\nit was Mother's Day. They , Mutter, Mutter (ph), and Mengele came to our camp.\nAnd again we were taken to the appellplatz, to be counted. And he put markers on small\nchildren, on elderly people, and we didn't know what the markers were for. I stood with my\nbrother. We were holding hands. They marked my brother and they didn't mark me. I knew\nthat something is wrong somewhere, that somebody going...something's going to happen. A\nweek later we were called again, and our names were, the names were called out. My older\nbrother's name was called out, and they took him to Auschwitz; and a day later he was killed\nin Auschwitz. So in 1944 in May, I was left only with that little brother that was running\naround still in the...and I told you already the story about it, but uh I was ahead of myself a\nlittle bit, but in 1944 in May I was left with a younger brother out in Krakow somewhere,\nhoping that he can survive, and myself. In August, I was ready to be shipped out. And I had\nin camp, in P_aszow, I had certain feelings not to go. And that time they took the people to\nMauthausen. Who knows whether I would have survived. And a day later I came back to the\nkitchen and the SS man, Guntz (ph) was his name, Gunther (ph), Guntz Gunther said you\nsupposed to be on the tra...on the to go to with the people on the train. What, what are you\ndoing here? So for an excuse I told him I fell asleep in my barrack. So he called up to\n(ph) and he said what should we do with uh one of my people in the kitchen, but he\ndid say that I'm a good worker. He said if you need him, let him stay until the next transport.\nAnd they start liquidating all small camps. They started bringing in people from our camp,\nand they liquidate the camp Amalia, and for the first time I heard about people talking about\nAmalia, that there's Oskar Schindler. In Oskar Schindler, in his camp nobody gets beaten.\nNobody is hungry and nobody is overworked, so I just couldn't understand it but when they\ntook people from Amalia into P_aszow and they put them on a railroad track - it was like\nAugust and was the sun was unbearable, burning on on the cattle cars, and he bribed Amon\nGoeth. While I came from the kitchen with some, first to give them soup, and opened up the\ndoors to get a little air. He helped people and I was uh asked to do the same thing. Water\nhoses and we hosed down with cold water the roofs of the cattle cars, and he was screaming\nto the Germans, Oskar Schindler, that the Jews are all mechanics, engineers, that the\nGermans need them, and he guarantees that nobody will escape, to open the doors for them\nagain. So I looked at myself, I said like, is this aa German or this an angel? He wore civilian\nclothes. I had no idea who he was. I knew only that he received the factory from Amalia and\nhe was the only one who did not throw out the Jews, the factory owner was Benks, that he\nnot only took that factory, he took a lumber yard and he build barracks and he saved a few\nhundred Jews. My partner Ben Zuckerman was there and got and he was shipped away, also\nto Mauthausen, with that transport. In October of 1944 I was called among other people, that\nP_aszow was starting getting liquidated, cause the Russians are too close and that we going\ndeeper into Germany, and I was sent to Gross Rosen. Gross Rosen, mind you, was East\nGer...now it's East Germany. It's on the border Silesia. And Gross Rosen was a camp, I at\nleast did not see any beds. It was a transit camp of five days was the most that they would let\nyou stay in that camp. They complete undress you. You couldn't have nothing that belongs to\nyou. They make you spread your your legs and and check, cut off your hair. Nothing that\ncould belong to you that you could have it. All you got is uh pair of pants - no underwear, a\nshirt, a cap and a jacket and a pair of wooden shoes. That was, and a number on the things.\nThat's all, and for five days if somebody from the SS called that a factory needs a hundred\npeople, five hundred people, a thousand people, then no no question was it, then they\nshipped them out there. If after five days nobody called you, dead. The first day we came in,\nthey gave us showers and we didn't know if we going to get gas or we're going to get water.\nWe knew already about it, it was on under they had a that under doorway, on the\ndoors that you walked into Gross Rosen, it said in German, here you enter, and then there\nwas a big chimney and it says on the big chimney, and over there you go now. It's supposed\nto be a political camp. We sat in crutches (ph). Inside on the floor, spread our legs and one\nwas sitting right into the other. If one, and we were so packed if one had to sneeze or move,\neverybody had to move. Like glued in like sardines. And we were taken to a doctor, and\nthe five days, I saw truckloads of young Poles who tried to take over Warsaw,\nmake an , and they were taken and they immediately were given gas. Young,\neighteen, twenty years old. And everybody was saying that the same thing works for us. The\nfourth or the fifth night they were saying that Oskar Schindler came to Gross Rosen with a\nlist, and that people are on the list, and when I heard my name called out, Murray Pantirer,\nMoses Pantirer, sheet metal worker. Until this day I have no idea who put me there because\nto be, everybody knew that they making lists. People were promising, there was, the list was\nmade with Schindler and also Marcel Goldberg, a Jewish policeman. People promised\nMarcel Goldberg diamonds, houses that after the war they will assign. I had nothing to give.\nWas a very poor boy. And almost everybody was poor. What, at least some of it had maybe\nsome belongings that they hid some place. I had no belongings I hid no place. Nothing. And\nto have my name in it, if I would be a kind of fanatic, I would say an angel flew down from\nheaven and wrote down my name. Maybe it meant to be that at least one of our Pantirer\n(crying) should survive. In October, the fifth day, they put us on cattle cars and I want to\nbring out a very important point right now. The Germans claimed that they didn't know. We\nknew, when we were walking from, to the train station, when we were in Germany we were\npelted with stones and we called S Juden (ph). When we passed only from\nGermany into Czechoslovakia, the people were crying. The Czechs were throwing bread at\nus, and they were standing with such a sad faces that you can tell that they were with us, that\nthe Czechs were with us. And when we came to uh Brnenc [Ger: Brinnlitz],\nCzechoslovakia, and some boys had to go out to work in the sand pit, every night there were\npotatoes and bread hidden in the sand pit by the Czechs, who they themselves had very little.\nAnd they gave to us. They were the least collaborated with the Germans. They were most uh\nat least they they were insensitive what's happening to us. When we came to Brnenc, I was\nvery lucky. I was assigned to clean by the Germans.",
        "Q: OK. We're going to hold it, Murray. Let's hold it here. We need to change tapes. OK.\nTAPE #2",
        "Q: OK, Murray. We're back on tape. Tell us what happened to you after you were put on\nSchindler's list. Where did you go?",
        "A: I was called out in Gross Rosen among other people. They give us some food and they put\nus on a train, but we were all very excited because uh we knew that if Oskar Schindler came\nand brought in a list that somehow there's an opportunity of survival, that we may be able to\nsurvive. We knew that uh Poland was all occupied, almost occupied by the Russians. We\nknew that the Allied forces are doing good in Europe and France and Italy, so to us it was\nlike a a new lease on life. The .... (ph), uh maybe it wasn't convenient but there's nothing\nwhat to complain about because we knew we're going to Brnenc. We came to Brnenc. It was\na different situation. Was a few SS people. There were no barbed wires. There was an old\nfactory, and we're supposed to fix up that factory. And Oskar Schindler was not happy that\nhe took out eight or nine hundred Jews from Gross Rosen. He went a few weeks later to\nAuschwitz, and got out three hundred women, and he said in Auschwitz that he needs them\nto work. I can testify to you the only thing I saw them doing is getting wool and knit\nsweaters for their husbands or boyfriends or friends or socks or gloves. Very little work did\nthey do. As a matter of fact we all did very little work. We always was scared that\nsomething's going to happen that he will be called, because we did not produce a single piece\nof ammunition, not a single piece. Once we were told that he bought a car load of\nammunition from another factory and delivered that it is from our factory. Once we were\ntold that he kept saying, Oh, I'm almost almost there. And I have to, and he alwa...he\nwelcomed us and he said, you are the Schindler's Juden, and here you will survive. Nothing\ngoing to happen to you. And I was assigned to work in the areas where the Ger...the SS were\nliving in their quarters. And I shined their shoes, so I always had a little extra piece of bread,\nhad a piece of cigarette from the ends uh that I could come to camp and always share it,\nexchange it for a piece of bread because people looked for the cigarette even if they were\nhungry, they gave you a piece of bread to have that cigarette, because they were they were\naddicted to the cigarette. I didn't smoke. I was young, and I would do some work in\nSchindler's own house, so I had uh a matter of fact I could say that I walked out from camp a\nhealthy boy. I never had uh those uh boils on my body and somehow I, how it happened I\ndon't know but I have to give you a a story. In February of 1944, '45, a call came into the\ncamp that on a siding not far from our camp the Germans left carloads of people just to die.\nThey need the locomotives, that's the engines, they needed for their own use. And the Czech\nwho worked on the siding, on the railroad, asked his superior to call in to our camp that\npeople are just laying there and dying, if our camp will accept them. And Oskar Schindler\nand his wife said yes, they will accept. They accept. That was mostly Hungarian Jews, and\nthey brought us, brought them into our camp. They they send out an engine from our camp\nbecause we had an engine and it brought in, and I was among some young boys\nwho learned with picks and shovel to open up the doors. The doors was so frozen from the\nhuman things, from the urine and the other stuff, so wet, that we couldn't open them up. So\nwith hot water we opened them finally up and when we opened up and we saw the crying\nout of the people, we we were thinking we doing them a favor - one grabbed him by the\nshoulders and the other grabbed him by, and I grabbed him by the feet, and they were so\nfrozen their behind that we ripped their skins. And the screaming was unbearable. So what\nwe did we worked slowly, and we worked like almost impossible task. If we hold our\nfingers, if we put too hot water we will burn them. Too cold water, it didn't help. So we had\nto try to, and lift them up, and we lift up maybe about twenty-eight or thirty young men like\nskeletons. And we took them into our camp, and Mrs. Schindler was cooking cereal for them\nevery day. They were in a separate barrack, cause the stink from them, the smell was just\nunbearable. And she would ask one of our boys, sometimes myself, to carry in the food and\nyou had to feed them. And out of the twenty-eight a few people have died and a few walked\nout. I was on a gathering for the Yad Vashem to valey (ph) that we building now\nthree years ago, and a man walked over to me and he said, are you Murray Pantirer? I live in\nLong Island. You are the one who pulled me from this car. So not only he didn't kill people,\nhe has on his, he and his wife were the real righteous people that they help anybody they\ncould have helped to.",
        "Q: Tell us about them. What was Oskar Schindler like? What was what was Oskar Schindler\nlike?",
        "A: Oskar Schindler was, as a figure, kind of looks like our President Ford. Well dressed.\nSometimes I couldn't figure out why he's doing those things and maybe it's, I try to to explain\nit that he was such a powerful man that he did not have to knock anybody down to make\nhimself so powerful. And I used to drink with him enough . He used to like\ncognac, so after the war, you say when a person is under alcoholic influence maybe he will\ntalk and I kept on asking him, him, and he always said to me the same thing - he\ncouldn't stand the killing. He he couldn't see that one human being should do the same thing\nto a human being. He said to me, I will never deny I was a Nazi. He was a Nazi. Let me give\nyou a little background from as far as Oskar Schindler is concerned. He was born in\nSuddeten (ph), German. That was Czechoslovakia. Before World War I, that belonged to\nKing Franz Joseph (ph), to Austria, but after the war it was given back to the Czechs, so he\ndid not like the Czechs. His father and mother was Suddeten Germans. And when he was in\nthe Czech army, he spied for the Germans. He gave uniforms from the Czech army to the\nGermans and the Germans up a lot of those uniforms and when they attacked in 1938\nCzechoslovakia, they attacked with their uniforms. They camouflaged it that they, so they\ndidn't loose people, and he was on hierarchy and he had a lot of friends, and he he went for\nthe money. No question about it. He was happy to have this kind of life. At the, I used to call\nthem the men with the three W's - wealth, women and whiskey. And we met him all the\ntime. In 1972 when in January when mine wife and myself, we celebrated our 25th wedding\nanniversary, before Christmas, we got him over to the United States. We always made\nhim parties and '72, in January, he was at our celebration of the 25th wedding anniversary. I,\nwe always met him in Israel, and was always the same thing. Like regardless how many\nschnopzs, how many cognacs he had, he always said he could not stand the killing. So when\nhe was written up in somewhere in Berlin or he may have some friends, he was always\ngetting himself in...he was plenty of times in trouble. He was put in jail a few times, but not\nfor long. He always had somebody and he somehow somehow he managed. And after the\nwar his best life was for him when he was in Israel. He will sit in the hotel and we will have\na drink. Plenty of times he sit in my house, but he will always call us the Schindler Juden and\nmy children he used to call kinder, his children. And it's, I II don't have no words to\ndescribe you the man, the niceness, the feelings that this man had for the Jewish people and\nalways was the same thing. I'm not trying to say that uh he loved the Jewish people, but he\njust couldn't stand this this uh innocent people being killed. Then he turned against the Nazis.\nBut in the beginning he was working with them, and he also was a good business man. When\nthe Germans would throw out the Jew who when they took over some factories, he stayed\nand he wanted to learn how to make money with the Jewish people, and he made, he made\nquite quite a bit of money, but he let it go through because uh he couldn't hold on to a dollar.\nAnd when he passed away in '76, they buried him in Jerusalem, in the Catholic cemetery,\nand it's the only tombstone that it's written up, . That say that here lays\na arighteous, among righteous people. He was the third tree (ph) for the righteous people\nand the of was given to Oskar Schindler. He received the Buben Prize.\nHebrew University supported him. And of course there's a book written up about him and I\nhope that someday a movie will be written about him.",
        "Q: Let's get back a little to the camp, to the factory of of Oskar Schindler. Tell me a little more\nabout what your day was like with him. What did you do there?",
        "A: It was just passing by the days. Nobody worked hard. Would you believe that there was in\nApril, in that factory Jews were baking matzos.",
        "Q: How?",
        "A: In the factory. They got some flour - either they asked him to bring some flour or he brought\nin some flour from the kitchen. Comparing to camps in, the last few camps that's why I I\ncame out a strong boy. The last few months in the camp of Brnenc was like being in in a ina\nsanitarlum. We were never hungry. He would go with some people from camp, go into the\nfront where the Germans had no time to collect bread, potatoes, meat, and he would bring it\nto our camp. He would feed us like we would be his own children. For we received\n. Everybody got a . For his birthday in April, he was born in April, he give us\nand after the war, while he ran away - he couldn't, he told us, he got us together and\nhe told us - I have to go away. He didn't tell us the reason but after the war we found out - the\nCzechs had a death warrant out for him, so he took ten people from camp with his own car -\nhe had a Mercedes uh sports car with two trucks, load up all the stuff, and he and his wife\nand some of the from camp were going, he said we going to get closer to the American side.\nMost of Germans were afraid to fall into the Ivan. Ivan is the Russian. They all were going\ninto the front, to the Americans. They knew that the Americans will treat them better. The\nSpies were working for them very good, and he held the speech for us and he gave out\nammunition. He wouldn't let the SS go in, and he give out ammunition and he said, defend\nyourselves. If the, if the SS will come in, there was only a few of them, if they will come in -\ndefend yourselves, and also, he was afraid there were \u2014__ in Czechoslovakia from Vlasov\nof armies to Ukraine and the White Russians, and they will kill off some of people from\ncamp and take their identification cards and pretend that they are from camp, so protect\nyourselves, but I hope to see you. And he left uh the beginning of May. The first few days in\nMay or maybe the end of April, and then there was a little, a few days very quiet and on May\n10th, everybody was screaming the war's over, and the Russians came in. We were liberated\non May 10th, and he told us that he has a key from a factory with clothing and materials. He\nleft it with one of our head men, and he said everybody as soon as he gets out from camp\nshould get a package. We got a package for for clothes, for material for clothes, material for\nsuits, material for shirts, for underwear. Everybody was made a package. He prepared\npackages. I, I myself am with with everyone maybe should felt maybe he could have saved\nanother person of his family - that's the only grudge he can have against Schindler, but we\nowe our lives to Oskar Schindler.",
        "Q: How did he keep the SS away from you all the time in the camp?",
        "A: He, he was bribing them awful lot. He had an awful lot of wealth and he had papers that uh\nhe's doing a good job, that he's working for the high ranking uh higher than the SS, Gestapo,\nwhatever they call it. Maybe if the war would have been another few months, maybe you\nwould have bust. Nobody knows, but the bottom line is that whatever walked in in\nthat man's camp, plus the Hungarian, mostly Hungarian Jews that I told you about, they walk\nout from camp. They're alive. They built families.",
        "Q: Tell me about liberation itself.",
        "A: When I was liberated, as I have told you, I was uh a healthy kid so I took with another\ncouple friends who were also healthy, and we start our way back to Poland. And in\nCzechoslovakia, when we passed by train, by cars, by trucks, we hitch-hiked, we walked a\nlittle bit, horse and wagon - the Czechs treated us very good. And we didn't know Czech. We\nknew Czech a little bit because we knew Polish. It's a little similarity. On the train, if I was\nriding and I still had the uniform from camp, they would start to cry and they would give me\nnot one seat mind you - they will stand up and they will let me lay down, and anything they\nhad in their belongings, they would give it to me. And when we got to Poland, I'm sorry to\nsay it but the fact is we felt the anti-Semitism immediately. And I couldn't understand it, but\nnow that I'm getting a little older, maybe they were scared those who collaborated with the\nGermans. Maybe the they were afraid there were a lot of Jewish people who gave away\neverything they own to Polish people to hide for them. So they were afraid they're going to\ncome back and get it back from them. And a and a Polish person, you don't want to\ngive it back what you have already for three or four years, considered it your own. I came to\nKrakow and I walked in in mine apartment and I told the woman immediately I absolutely\ndon't want nothing from this apartment. All, everything that was in that apartment belonged\nto us. I didn't care for it. I only want to write down a little note. If anybody from my family\nor by miracle somebody survived, I am the second son of Lester (ph) Pantirer. I survived and\nI'm registering myself in the Jewish community of Krakow. Where I'm going to be I don't\nknow, but I - so she said sit down, have a cup of tea. She sent her son to the militia (ph). The\nmilitia came up and said, why did you come here to make trouble. I said, what kind of\ntroubles did I make? I just want to put down on my address, my apartment, I want to put\ndown my name and then we, as I have told you, we got some material so we start selling it\non the street, so either they will say Jidan (ph), we don't buy stuff from a Jew,\nor they will say, look - they said they killed them. Look how many they are. So I was -\namong thousands, there were two Jewish boys or three Jewish boys trying to exchange uh\nfor livelihood for stuff that they needed - they didn't want us. And in my ear they're\nconstantly saying, Jid .... Palestina. Jew go to Palestine. So I saw, I came to that the\ncommu...the community center was on . | wrote down my name with my papers\nand I told them I'm going to Palestine. I start going to Palestine. Literally going to Palestine.\nI went by train, by hitch-hiking. Also I had a problem that I was twenty years old. I wasn't\ntwenty years when the war ended, but a month later, in June, I was twenty years old, and the\nPoles start bothering me to go to the army. After being in camp, I have no , no\nfeelings to go to the army, so I went to Czechoslovakia and Czechoslovakia, I will never\nforget. I was in Prague when Benes arrived back from London, and he, and his Czech I\nunderstood when he said, the Jews who survived are welcomed to stay in Czechoslovakia,\nbut my advice to you is, build your own country. The sidewalks are f..., are f....1s full of\nblood from your families and your friends. You have no future in Europe. You are welcomed\nto stay in Czechoslovakia, but build you...try to find and build a life for yourself. So I went\nto, from Czechoslovakia to Linz, Austria, and in Linz, Austria I was in a displaced persons\ncamp for a while, and I heard that there's a Jewish brigade who fou...who fought with British\nand that they are in Italy and they are making arrangements to get you into Palestine. So I\nwent to the Bremenhaufen (ph), Brem...Bremenhaufen (ph), to Innsbruck not,\nBremenhaufen, Bremenpass and I went to Innsbruck. From Innsbruck I went by foot over\nthe mountains into Italy, and from Italy the first time I came was Modena and Modena got\nhooked up with some...that was the end of '45. I was hooked up with some brigade from\nthe...and they told me to move down all the way to Sicily, down at the bottom by the port\nand that ships will come and pick me up to go to Palestine. Ships came. There was not\nenough room for me. I was a single boy. People went down there with families and when I, I\nstayed there and wait for another ship. Another ship did not arrive, and I heard that the\nBritish intercepting the Jewish people. They take them to Cyprus. So I was scared. I said,\nwhere am I going to go to. Another camp again. So I went back to Austria. Back to Italy,\nfrom Italy back to Austria and I stayed in Austria. In 1946, in August, I met my wife and for\n- it was love at first sight. She's a beautiful person. She happens to be in Russia, and she was\nalso on her way to go to Israel. But in the meantime there was, you couldn't go to Israel, so I\nstayed in that displaced person camp and I have to say something to you. I want to make two\npoints very important that in my life I became an orphan twice. Once I lost my father and\nmother, and the next time I lost my country. Poland didn't want me. To Palestine I couldn't\ngo, and a person without a country 1s like a child without a father and mother. I absolutely\nhad no place to go. It puzzles me till today why nobody picked me up. They didn't teach us\nanything. I was on my...like five years of suffering, six years was not enough. I had to suffer\nanother few years. But I was married to my wife and my wife had a mother, a wonderful\nperson, and to me to ever been have, able to have a mother was a very important thing, and I\nwas told to make myself a displaced person as . That's a displaced person\ncou...without a country. I was in Linz written up that I had survived, that I was less than\ntwenty years old, that I was an orphan, but because I was married that statue, that uh quota\nfell through because I was married already. But uh lucky that in 1948 towards the end,\nTruman signed a two hundred thousand quota of displaced persons, and in '48 my wife\nbecame pregnant. When she became pregnant, I became terrible impatient. I didn't want a\nchild of mine to be born in Europe. So I went from Linz to Salzburg to the American Consul\nand I asked the consul, there was always German girls working in the consul, when you get\nto the consul, so I would bribe them with some chocolate or some cigarettes and they would\nalways say to me, Mr. Her Pantirer, your papers are a little bit higher, from the bottom a little\nbit higher, a little higher. And sure enough, at the end of '48, I was called with my wife from\nthe very first on the quota to come to America, and in '49, January 17th, we stayed in '48 a\nfew days in Bremenhaufen and from Bre...Bremenhaufen we took a ship, SS Marine Fletcher\n(ph) and January 4th or 5th happened to be our anniversary - I told my wife take out a suit.\nWe're going to dance on that ship, but I was so sick - she says that I was begging for a little\ndry ice, but I came to America, and I had, I had feelings in America that I I came to the nght\ncountry. I saw in New York so many cars and if everybody who works can make a living, I\npride myself that I can do anything and be able to make a living. And 1n beginning, in '49, of\ncourse in July 6th my son was born. My wife's mother and sister came to America in August,\nand I work in shops. I I was a floor boy on in garment center, but to help myself a little bit I\nused to go in in the factories for sweaters and buy off a few gross of sweaters and buying like\nuh two for a dollar, and I would sell one for a dollar. So I helped myself a little bit but I had\nno trade. Was very hard for me, so I had an opportunity and I decided in 1950 to become a\nbuilder. And I have to make a point here, that in the building trade I work harder in my\nbusiness than I worked in the concentration camp. To show you the logic things from a\nperson, regardless if you stand with a gun, if he has nothing from the work and you don't feel\nlike working, nothing can make you. But with the work that I did in mine building business,\nI knew, I used to come home at night, like ten o'clock at night, and I was tired. I found out\nfor the first time that when you're tired you cannot have your dinner, but I was happy. I knew\nI come home to my wife, to a child and I dedicated my life towards my children, to build a\nbetter home for my children. And that way I was awarded, I was rewarded that uh not only I\nget a better life for my children but for myself and I did it with all my heart and I'm very\nthankful to the country that gave me all that opportunity and I can only speak to the young\npeople who never lost their freedom - guard your freedom very strongly. God bless America.\nIt's a wonderful country. Has certain faults but like everyone has, but it's a beautiful, a\nwonderful country and and I have to tell you that I was confused in the beginning. I didn't\nknow bring up the children Jewish, not bring them up Jewish and I said to myself, if Hitler\nand his Nazi party, and they are still many Nazi guys, will say we tried to kill off Murray\nPantirer. We didn't want nobody to survive from his family, but now that he survived, he\nkilled himself. He didn't bring up the Jewish religion. He didn't bring up the Jewish family,\nso it's not a victory for me, but it's a victory for the Jewish people that uh I brought up my\nchildren. I've three wonderful children, a son and two daughters. They're married, three\nwonderful children, so I have six - I have no difference between mine son-in-law or\ndaughter-in-law and of course they produced for me nine grandchildren that I'm very proud\nof them. They're very Jewish-minded, and I want to say if two things it's important to learn\nfrom the Holocaust - our President J. F. Kennedy said, if you fooled me once, shame on you.\nYou are bad boys and you fooled me. But if you fooled me twice, shame on me that I'm\ngoing to let myself be fooled. So we, the Jewish people, always have to be vigilant and\nalways like they saying in America of the best thing - nip it in the bud. Cut it, when\nimmediately, don't make say , crazy guy does not pay attention. Be always\nalert. But above everything, we must have a State of Israel. I am convinced without, with all\nmy heart and all my belief, had we had a State of Israel in '35, '38, '39, even '40, many, many\nof us could have escaped. Many of us would have survived. I watch now which country\ntakes in their people without checking their health, their wealth, they, how old they are.\nIsrael opens up the doors for every Jew in the world. So this way we have to make sure that\nwe learn and we teach our children about the Holocaust. As painful as it is and it's almost\nunbelievable - the story has to be told. And if the story for the sake of my suffering and my\nlosses, 1f I can bring up a better world for one human being - never mind for a whole\ngeneration - it's worthwhile to teach, because on our skin we learned so make a better world\nfor any other people, regardless of color, creed, religion - every human being. We see now\nhow many doctors and lawyers, how ma...how we brought up our children, how many\nvaluable people. So you never know. When you kill off a person, you kill off a generation.\nAnd that, the free world should never allow it. And if uh if I have a minute, if you permit me\na few minutes, I want to talk a little bit about United Germany.",

        "A: A very happy childhood. We were seven children, and one was watching the other ones.\nThere was always a competition, who would say better at the tonight. Who would\nbring home a better report card? Who would be better at the... There were always in the\nfamily an uncle or another person that always will test you on a Saturday night what you\nlearned in school during the week. And your reward was a five cents that was that was good\nto buy an ice cream cone. For ten cents you can buy a chocolate bar. So if we ...1f I made by\nmine... It was my mother's uncle; if I made by him a dime, it was uh really a big winning.\nAnd for we our day start off like early in the morning we would go to the synagogue to pray\nwith the people to with my father and older brother and doing uh we will come home say\nlike 1f we would start at seven, seven thirty we'll be home, have breakfast. And by nine\no'clock we start our school day. So we, I went to a , a Hebrew school, and from nine\nto twelve we learned strictly only to talk Jewish . From twelve to one we had lunch,\nbut lunch in Europe was like dinner time. We had a full-course of meal from twelve to one.\nAt one we went back to school. We had to be there like one fifteen, and from one fifteen till\nfour o'clock, the same school, they start teaching us history, geography, math, and so on.\nAnd at four o'clock, we only had like a five minutes break to buy a little something like a\nchocolate or a candy, or... And we went back to - it was in the same building - went back to\nschool and learned from four 'til six. And at six o'clock, my mother would give me like a\nnickel or a dime and I would buy myself a roll of butter with a piece of herring, some nights\nwith cheese, and go back to the synagogue. It was like a ..... (ph), and there we will try to do\nour homework. Work mostly in the Talmud what we learn in our , and then we drop\nthem in the synagogue and we went home. there was no television. We did not\nhave the radio in our house. I recall we had like a three room apartment. In the three room\napartment we slept uh two in one bed, and there was beds that was, they opened up. One\nchild will sleep, one brother with the head one side and the other one will sleep with the head\nthe other side, so their feet will - so that was more convenient to sleep. And the rooms were a\nkitchen, then a dining room, and a bedroom and my father and mother slept in the bedroom\nwith the younger children. We seemed always to have enough room if somebody else came\nover to sleep over. We did not have the toys that the uh - what we used to do, we couldn't\neven afforded to buy uh rubber ball, because I played soccer - when I had a little chance, I\nplay I liked to play soccer, so we would take some rags, roll them them up, sew them up like\nin when it was finished looked almost like a baseball with the stitches - that's what we would\nkick around. Very seldom it has a bounce. But we had a very, maybe we didn't see anything\nbetter, but we were very happy childhood. And everything uh everybody was looking\nforward, we knew there were things getting bad in Poland cause since uh when I start to\nrecognize and understand certain things, that in 1935, '36, when the Marshall of Poland,\nMarshall Pilsudski, had died, the anti-Semitism because maybe they wanted, the Poles want\nto be friendly with the Germans or maybe that was in fashion like they say, anti-Semitism\nhad start growing 1n Poland to a very untolerable situation. But we lived in Krakow\nKazimierz. And it was strictly... It was called the Kazimierz, after the Kazimierz, the great\nKing Kazimierz who let the Jews come into Poland with so many hundred years back. And\nin , mostly was Jewish, Jewish stores, Jewish shopkeepers, Jewish synagogues, so I\npersonally did not have any connection, special connection with gentiles. We had our own\nlife. Of course we learned in school Polish but uh we did not come in any contact and we,\nour business and our daily life had no mingling with the Polish people. And there was, I\noverheard all our politicking was going on in the synagogue. And I overheard the, as a child\nI liked to listen that the uh some young people were and they were screaming to the\nolder people that Hitler may be coming and conquer Poland - we have to do something about\nit. And I don't know from the olderies (ph) first of all we were told, respect the elder people.\nWhen an elder person spoke, we were quiet. We only listened. We wouldn't dare even\nanswer them anything. So they say that they remember the Germans from World War I.\nThey are cultured. They're intelligent and the argument was going with some, we would\ncome and that after all, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, and he's out to destroy the\nJewish people. So they gave in. They say Hitler's a maniac, but the German people will\ndefinite not come to Poland. They will never hurt us. And then for what reason should they\nhurt us. We are Polish citizens. We are law-abiding citizens. And why would they hurt us?\nSo that was the, maybe now if for a Monday morning quarterback, maybe it's, 1t was their\nwishful thinking, because the average family was eight, ten and even twelve people in a\nfamily. Mostly, ninety percent or more, were very poor, hardly eking out a living. Nobody\nhad a, they may had a little uh piece of ring or piece of gold, some silverware, but wealth,\ncurrency - very few Jews had because they had always to borrow when it came a sabbath or\nwhen it came a high holiday, or any holidays if they want to prepare a table they had to go\nout and borrow some money, so currency nobody had. And it was very hard for a family of\neight or ten to go - nobody, no country in the world would take them, and of course we did\nnot have the state or vision (ph), so there was uh their wishful thinking that uh maybe there\nwould be no war and maybe they were sure that the Germans would not have the audacity,\nhave the nerve to do those things that Hitler's asking them to do.",
        "A: But in 1939, we were first worried that my father may be taken to the army. He was born in\n1900, and he was only 39 years old. But a few weeks before the war broke out, they changed\nthe slip of paper - the there were red cards, blue cards, white cards, and there was must have\nbeen that day because of having seven children - the youngest child was four years old when\nthe war broke out - that they did not call him to the army. And the war broke out on\nSeptember 1, 1939, on a Friday morning. To me, I didn't know what's in store. To me it\nwasn't the most uh important thing. To me it was more important we had uh a championship\ngoing to Macabi, the soccer team, and that was important to me, but on Wednesday morning\nI went out near the outskirts from the Wis_a[NB: the Vistula]. Wis _a is the lake [NB: river]\nthat runs through Warsaw and Poland and Krakow. And I went over the bridge to Mos,\nMostowa (ph) and I saw already Germans. So I ran back to my dad because my dad received\nthen to go into the army, to be in the next few days near Warsaw at a certain post. So I\nscreamed to and I told my dad don't go because the Germans are already here. And the\nGermans came into Krak\u00e9w on Wednesday. That was September the 6th. And to say they\ndidn't bother us, we didn't bother them. But the first brutality I saw on the high holidays - I\nliked to run from one shul, from one synagogue or one temple to the other temple to listen to\nthe cantor singing, and as I was going in the street on the , most of our synagogues\nhad open doors to the street, and Germans came in and they happened to be Wehrmacht.\nThey were not SS. I learned later about SS. Plain Wehrmacht. Went into the synagogue,\npulled out the Jews, older people, took the thales, the skrols, throw it in the garbage, ripped\nit up and literally they say that they took out the Jews to shave their beards and their\n[side]locks, and literally I saw them ripping - blood was gushing from their faces from the\npeople and they were laughing and they were smile and then I realized that something is\nwrong somewhere. That I couldn't believe my own eyes, what I saw, and we made up our\nmind at that time, in our house we had built-in closets so we built in a double wall, and we\nhide our father, because our father still had a beard, and we and he didn't want to shave his\nbeard because of the high holidays. And we were afraid in case my father will go out in the\nstreet he will be recognized as a Jew. So we did all our, whatever work we, whatever little\nbusiness, whatever to sustain our family, my older brother, myself and my younger two\nbrothers, we did our dealings, and it was till maybe October or November when the first\nsnow came on the on the , not only the snow on Ka...on our street - it's snowing all\nin Krakow, maybe in Warsaw too, but the first snowstorm - they closed off the streets and\nthey start going door to door, only to Jewish families in their apartments and it couldn't go\nthrough my mind - there were calling us Jews with lice, Juden (ph), dirty Jews.\nYet so nice they asked if you have a ring. My mother had a little ring, a little\ncandelabra for lighting the candles on shabbat, a little piece of - they took everything\naway. On some occasions, people said that they even give them a little paper that they took\nit, enough that they was going to give it back to them. But I was one of the boys that they\ntook down to the courtyard and they make bundles - everybody makes for himself a bundle\nand roll down to his mother, the soldiers, yeah, to his mother - that that was already SS.\nThere was difference because normally the Wehrmacht will be the fighters and the SS will\nbe the administrators. So I saw that they uh in here to rob us with everything we got, but yet\nwe didn't, we didn't care so much. We were never hang up on, we didn't have wealth and we\nwere not hanged up on the piece of stuff that we lost. To us it was important, the family. As\nlong as we stayed whole. But every few weeks new laws came out. Laws that a Jew has to\nwear on his right arm an arm band with the Star of David. If you were caught without it, you\nwere subject to being shot. We didn't pay too much attention. I was a blonde boy, blue eyes,\nspoke a perfect Polish, and I was little. I was never a tall boy. So I could pass for below\ntwelve. I didn't carry no papers with me so I kept on screaming if somebody asked me why\ndidn't you wear the star, I was saying I'm not Jewish. And again we worried only about our\nfather and every time they passed a new law, a Jew has to do this, and above everything,\nwhen they came in they start confiscating Jewish stores. And I'm not talking about the Poppa\nand Momma store, little grocery or little luncheonette but stores of meaning - textiles, shoes,\ncol...colonial - that is coffee and tea, some specialities and of course the Jewish factories.\nAnd in most cases they took away Jewish out of the Kazmierz. They took out Jewish\napartments and they took it away for them, from them. They tell them that they need it for\ntheir administrative group. And the more high ranked you were in the list by the Gestapo or\nby the SS, a bigger store or a bigger factory you receive. In that case, Oskar Schindler\nreceived the biggest factory in Krakow, the Patzenpen (ph) factory. I get back to that later\non, but let me tell you about the family. In March of 1940, things start to go very bad in\nKrakow. My father had a brother in O_arow. That's near Lublin, and he wrote us food is\nbetter, you can get better food in the smaller town than in the big city, so he took his whole\nfamily and he moved to O_aro\u00e9w except myself. I stayed to watch the belongings in our\napartment, and I stayed there for a few months and what's happening while those were\ncoming out, then from time to time they fooled the people and they start loosen up a little bit.\nSo there was talk - we only lived by rumors, so there were rumors that the Jews in Krakow\ncan come back. So by July, my parents and the children came back. In August, the beginning\nof August, they asked us to be, to register. If we register and they like the idea who we are,\nwhat we are, we will have the privilege to go in in March, it was already written down that in\nMarch of 1941 it will be established in Krakow a ghetto. And only if you worthy you going\nto stay in the ghetto. If you're not worthy, you'll be shipped out. My father registered, and\nthat was a part of fooling the people. If you register, then they know you are, they know your\nplace. My father registered and my mother registered and that was some papers that I found\nin the Warsaw archives after the war, and in 1941, like in February, I went out again to get\nsome food for the family, and a Polish policeman grabbed me. And he said, \"Why are you\nhere so early? You must be Jewish.\" And I kept saying, \"No, I'm not Jewish.\" So he took me\nto...he said, \"Let's find out if you're Jewish or not.\" And he took me to the Gestapo and they\npulled my pants down. And I... They start asking me where I live, and I didn't want to give\nup my family, give out my family. So I stayed and I said uh whatever will happen will\nhappen; and one of the Gestapo came out and he says to the Polish policeman, there's a train\nin the train station full of Jews that they are being deported to a town, Bia_a Podlaska. That\nwas on the east side, near the border in Poland where the Russians took part of Poland.\nLemberg, Lwow--near that side. And he even used the word: \"Take that little scheiss and put\nhim on the train.\" So I was on the train. I was very happy to be on the train. And I came to\nBia_a Podlaska; and I wrote home a letter and saying, \"Dad and Ma - I can escape because\nnobody's watching me. Should I come home? I'm coming home.\" So I immediately got back\na letter not to come home, that they were already marked also to be deported. They were not\naccepted to go to the ghetto because my father had no trade. And very seldom do they took\nseven, a family of with seven, eight, nine people into the ghetto. They took to the ghetto\nyoung people with one child or two children and those who worked for the uh they can show\npapers and those special papers was called the , and if they got the , that\nmeans if you work, then you could go to the ghetto. Many people had signed up to work in\nthe factory Emailia, NKF [NB: Neue Kuhler- und Flugzeugteile-Fabrik] by Schindler.\nPeople paid, they signed out if they own a house, diamonds, whatever they could lay their\nhands on, to get those papers to be able to stay in Krakow. My father and mother and the six\nchildren was sent away to Miedzyrzec [Podlaski]. Miedzyrzec [Podlaski], from Bia _a\nPodlaska, from Russia is no more than twenty-one kilometer. That's about fifteen miles. And\none morning, I'm walking in the street, and I see my father . I said to my father,\n\"What are you doing here?\" He said, \"Come. I came to take you home. We are all in\nMiedzyrzec [Podlaski].\" So we stayed in Miedzyrzec [Podlaski], and we were told then the\nreason we are sent in this direction of the east that the fields are more fertilized. It's easier to\nfeed the people. And we were hoping that this is the case. And that was April, May; and my\nbrother and myself were assigned to work for the Germans, to cut the furrows and to make\nroads for the aeroplanes, to make aeroplane fields. Because the Germans had in their mind to\nstart to attack the Russians. And June 22nd in 1941, the war with Russians had started; and\nmy brother and myself, every night we could go home. The fact is while we were walking\nhome, about ten kilometers, we were stopping at a farmer, exchange - money was not worth\nanything - but exchange for little something. He would give us some potatoes, some corn,\nsome food. And that's how we sustain ourselves. When the war broke out on June 22nd, they\ntell us we cannot go home. And they start putting wires around us and they said they are\nmaking a camp. And they need our work. They need to load up some stuff and one day,\nbefore they start putting the electric wire on it, my brother and myself escaped. And we ran\nin for five minutes to our father's home, and we said we're not going to stay in that camp. We\nrunning back to Krakow. We going to sneak in 1n the ghetto. We're going to be in Krakow.\nKrakow 1s a big city. Maybe we can pass for Aryan. We're going to Krakow. So we start by\nfoot. And when we came in like half-way, near the Wis_a; and I was stuck in in ;\nNowy Korczyn, in Polish. My brother was stuck in Staszow, by a family. I had no food to\neat, so during that time, 1t was like in July, there were on the trees some green apples, and I\nate those green apples and I have uh (ph) diarrhea and I got very sick, so I was going\nfrom place to place and finally near Nowy Korczyn there was a Polish family who\nneeded a shepherd boy. They had cows. And I said, \"I will do it. I don't want no money.\nOnly thing I want is to get a little better and get some potatoes, uh cooked potatoes, so...so\nmy stomach will get better.\" And meantime, in...1n Miedzyrzec [Podlaski], my family was\nstarving. There was no food. There was no nothing. So my father put on clothes like uh...like\na man [who] was a farmer, and he got himself a a paper that he is uh like a Polish farmer.\nAnd he went back to his brother to O_ar\u00e9w. And my mother took five children, dressed like\na peasant girl, took a train, and came into Krakow. And when she came back to Krakow, the\ngates for the ghetto was closed off. We had an uncle in the ghetto, so he sent out somebody.\nAnd he said, \"The best thing for you 1s to go like twenty-five, thirty kilometer. Near...there's\na town, Proszowice. Near Proszowice. You can go there and get from a farmer a room for\nyou for your family.\" So she did that. She had a few zlotys--that's Polish currency--and she\nrented; and the place was called Stagniowice. So in 1941, maybe it was September, October,\nshe rented a one-room apartment. And my father couldn't stand uh being without his wife\nand children, so from O_ard\u00e9w he went to Staszow and collected my younger brother, and\nfrom Staszow they come to [Nowy] Korczyn. We wrote letters to each other into the ghetto\nto my uncle, Isaac Levenstein (ph), who was my mother's brother. He stayed with his wife\nand two children in the ghetto. He had...he happened to have in the ghetto a factory from\nbefore the war that was like Brillos, but without the soap, and he maked those Brillos for the\nsoldiers, for the for the German army. So he had the privilege, him and another partner, to\nstay in the ghetto. So we had our con...contact through that uncle, so my father knew by\nwhich farmer I was uh near Nowy Korczyn, and it was after the holiday, high holiday, and\nhe collected me and we all went and we finally hooked up together with my mother and she\nwas there with five children. And we were all nine again together from 1941, by October;\nand was the happiest days of our life. In one room, nothing to eat. And the greatest pain that I\ncan see, when my mother was cooking some food (crying) and she would say she's not\nhungry. We knew she was hungry, but she wouldn't allow herself to have a little food\nbecause she wouldn't take it away from her children. We...again we had to register in the\nJewish because to get some rationing, some food. Without it we couldn't sustain\nourselves, so towards the end of 1941, they say that for to feed our family, one, a male,\nespecially the husband, the men in the house, has to go to a brick factory or a lager camp\nnear Krakow. So my brother said he will go, to save our father. So my brother went. The end\nof '41 he went to camp. It was called U lag, near Krakow. In March of 1942, they said they\nneed more men to go to a brick factory. So again we want to save our father. So I went. And\nin 1942 I came to a factory of bricks in Krakow. I could have escaped. Was easy to escape,\nbut they hold our family hostage. If we would escape, they knew where our family lived, so\nfor the love for our family, we gladly stayed in that camp. It wasn't so terrible. So we all\nalways lived with the idea, the Russian...the Russians already fighting with the Germans, the\nBritish, the French, that an end will come very soon. And to sustain ourselves and to also\nhelp out the uncle in the ghetto that I mentioned to you, my two brothers and a sister also\nblonde, blue-eyes, will go by little train - that was a small train, not a regular train - will go\nfrom that town into Krakow and they will smuggle into the ghetto flour, bread, eggs\nsometimes - whatever they could lay their hands. Even sometimes a piece of meat, and they\nwill bring it to the uncle. The uncle normally will have it for himself. Sometimes he will sell\nit in the ghetto, that stuff, and from that my parents lived. In 1942 they start liquidating all\ntowns in Poland. And maybe it was luck and maybe it was not luck, they forgot about us. We\nwere on the outskirts from Proszowice, and maybe nobody put up a list on it. And they...they\nmade, it was called visedlenie (ph). That means taking the people out. There was always,\nthey always take out some people and the rest they left over because they said we need you.\nSo the, now the hindsight, the Monday morning quarterback, I would understand that they\ntook out the men so the women and the children could not put up the resistance. When they\nhad us in camp where they make barbed wires already, and they change it from a regular\ncamp to a concentration camp. Tell me you had no choice to fight. You couldn't fight. You\ncouldn't escape. So in 1942, in the meantime, they open up a concentration camp, what's\ncalled in Krakow-P_aszow. It was old Ierozolimska (ph). It was a new cemetery and it was\ncalled Ierozolimska (ph) and that cemetery was a Jewish cemetery. So on that cemetery, they\nbuild barracks--factories, that they make shoes, uniforms, brushes, whatever they could get\nthe work out from the Jewish people. The knit...knitting factories. They make sweaters,\nsocks. And they prepared this camp. So from the brick factory and from U lag, I myself with\nmy brother were united...with my older brother; and we stayed in that camp. In the first there\nwas an Obersturmfthrer Miller (ph). He wasn't so bad. And it wasn't so bad \u2018til on a Friday in\n1942, it must have been like September, when Amon Goeth took over that camp. In the first,\nit was on a Friday morning - I will never forget that. When he took over that camp, they\ntook us from that place--it was called \"appellplatz\"--the place that they count us. Every day,\nthey count us like we would be worth a fortune. And...and in that moment, Goeth took out...\nThere was, we was run by Jewish police. The SS was on the outside, and inside in the camp\nwas only a few SS people. But most was run by Jewish police, and Jewish kapos. So they\ntook out, he took out the leader from the Jewish police, Katz, and his second his in\ncommand, Goldberg, and they shot them both on the spot, Katz and Goldberg. So I start\nseeing the brutality of Amon Goeth, and he said I'm going to shoot every Jew if you're not\ngoing to obey, if you're not going to work diligently, so in that time I I saw that we are in for\na lot a lot of trouble. In the meantime at home, in 1942 after the high holidays, they found\nout there were people hiding and they would start cleaning up when they had finished the big\ncities. The smaller cities, they start going to the outskirts, and my father saw from far away\nthat some Germans are coming with some, that some people, there's a lot of horses and\nwagons, there's a lot of things going on, so he pushed out from the house a brother right after\nme and another one and and my sister. They pushed them out from the house, and he said\nrun. So they run into the ghetto, to Krakow. They knew their way to go into the ghetto so\nthey run into the ghetto. My father and mother and the youngest sister and the youngest\nbrother, they took to the town of Miechow. And in Miechow, they had at that time maybe\neighty or ninety Jews altogether. So they asked the men to stay on one side, and the women\nand children on the other side. They didn't know what they're going to do, but my father will\nnot have it. He said, \"I will not leave my wife or with two children. Whatever will happen to\nher, will happen to me.\" They took the men out 1n the side and they asked one, always will\nask the the commander, what should we do with them. So they said, \"It's not enough people\nto make a transport. Shoot them on the spot.\" And they killed my father and mother. One\nwas holding one child in the hand and one was holding the other child in the hand. I know it\nfor a fact, because two days later the men who were segregated were brought into our camp,\nand they were crying like little babies, that they left their family. They felt the guilt. It was\nthe murderers who put them to that position. Because after all, we are taught that life is so\nprecious, that life with force you are born and with force you must die. You cannot take your\nown life, that life by Jewish people is very precious. But they knew my father. They knew\nmy mother. And that was the beginning of that I lost my father and mother and a brother and\na sister. And in the meantime, I was with my older brother in camp in P_aszow. In 194...and\nI building barracks. We were building factories. We were building barracks. It was, we were\nin two different groups. They normally separated so first we were in one group but then we\nwere in separate groups. Every group had fifty peo...boys. And with fifty boys went a Jewish\nkapo. In 1943, in March, beginning of March, they liquidated Krakow ghetto. My two\nbrothers and sister did not have papers. They they were not legally in the ghetto, so they\nhide. They hid and they liquidated the ghetto on a Saturday. I think it was March Ilth. And by\nWednesday, and they brought in all the people. And one occasion I I will forget that - the\nwomen were coming out and one woman had in her knapsack a little baby. And the little\nbaby was crying, and the German heard...heard the baby crying, and he killed the baby and\nthe mother on the spot. Shot them on the spot. And our group from were taken to\nright on Sunday they start cleaning out those people who had no papers and those people\nwho were hide, they were bringing up to P_aszow, and we, the boys, had to take them down\n- some of them were complete dead, some was not dead - in one case I saw a girl, a young\nchild that wasn't dead, and we asked the German give the girl, give her ,aaa\na thing of mercy, so we wouldn't bury her alive. So he said, shmutzige, shit (ph), he said,\nthrow it just in the way it is and it's it's it's a shot (ph) to throw in, to waste a bullet on that\npiece of uh you know what I'm talking about. And my uncle was taken into the P_aszdw (ph)\nand he left in in the ghetto his wife and two children to be hidden, for the children were not\nlegal. And my bro...two brothers and a sister were there too, and every day, every night when\nI come back to the barracks, he would say did you see any familiar faces. And every day,\nevery time I look at a corpse that looks a little bit similar, I turned it around to see if it's any\nof my family. Till on Wednesday that week, they brought in my brother and a sister. And I\nfound out later that one brother escaped. How he escaped is beyond me, but he had escaped\nand he was walking around in Krakow. My brother and sister were, mind you, they probably\nwere hungary so they left the ghe...the ghetto and they were on the road from the ghetto\nalready on the bottom, and the ghetto was not watched anymore by the Germans. It was\nwatched by the Poles because it was all quiet. The only thing they did in the ghetto is to look.\nMaybe people put some wealth in the walls. They start looking and maybe they thought\nsomebody was hidden. They took boys from P_aszow to look over and to check out the\nghetto if nobody is there. But they themselves were finished with the all the brutal work that\nthey done. And two Polish policemen killed my brother and sister. And I know it for a fact,\nbecause I... people told me that. 'Cause people who work in the ghetto saw it. They maybe\nwere for lookout for them. When you were working the ghetto, you look out for somebody.\nYou open up, you cut a piece of wire to let them out. And they could not escape. So I had\nlost another brother and sister. So we were left three in the family. I heard about my younger\nbrother, that he is in Krakow working at the Wis_a by uh those ships and he he 1s sustaining\nhimself, 'til 1944, he was all in Krakow til October or November. October or November,\nwhen the Wis _a froze up they had no work for him on on the ships no more. He went, he had\nno money. And he went to sleep out _ up the hills where they kept the salt hay for the\ncows and for the on the outskirts from Poland. And a Polish peasant caught him, and he said,\n\"If you sleeping in during the winter in that uh snow outside, you must be Jewish.\" So he\nknew the prayers of uh the Catholic prayers as as better than any Catholic. And he said the\nprayers in front of him, but nothing helped him. And he received an award for that, twelve\npounds--that's five kilo--sugar. For every time you gave out a Jew in Poland, you got a\nreward of five kilo sugar. I know it for a fact, because after the war I came to Krakow and\npeople told me that. And I asked him to testify. He said, \"There's no use of testifying. The\nman ran away.\" I'm positive surely he did not run away. But I didn't know who the man was,\nand I couldn't bring him to any justice. I was left with my brother in camp. In 1943, about...it\ncould have been in August or September - it was already chilly a little bit - I worked in [the]\nBarrackenbau. We were fifty boys. And to Krakow came in a new commander tn chief. His\nname was Frank (ph) and Amon Goeth tried to be friendly with him. So he took out all our\nfifty boys with, we loaded up loads of topsoil on trucks and we went near Krakovia (ph)\nplace. There was a big beautiful villa and we made a garden for Frank. While we maked the\ngarden on our way home, one of the boys escaped and when we got in we were forty-nine\nand our kapo. And the kapo didn't notice it that he escaped, so he started beating us over the\nhead with his stick, the night stick that the policeman carries, and they wouldn't let us in.\nThey waited until Goeth comes down from his villa, and Goeth came in and he said, where's\nthe fiftieth? We all say we don't know. We didn't even know him we said. Maybe we only\nwent out forty-nine. So he said for that that one escape, he shot every second boy. A boy was\nshot next to me, to my right, and a boy was shot on the left of me. I cannot recall if 1t was\ntwenty-four or twenty-five, but all we were left is half of our group. The other half of our\ngroup was shot right then and there. I saw it will be impossible to live and to be in the\nBarrackenbau. It was the worst work and was working outside and I, maybe I learned like\nthe animal the necessity of survive. I recognize Goeth when he's ready to shoot people. He\nwill have with him that the instinct of an animal. He would not eat his breakfast or\nsometimes lunch unless he saw Jewish blood. And he will wear three different hats. The\nofficer's hat, the plain soldier's hat and a Tyrol like when you go yacht (ph), uh a Tyrol hat.\nThat Tyrol hat was the most dangerous hat. And by the way, Amon Goeth was an Austrian,\nand he was called in 1946 and people testified and they hanged him in Poland, uh Krakow.\nSo when he would go in with this hat, I would always sneak away, because regardless if you\nwork hard or not, whenever it was convenient for him, for no reason at all, he'd while he was\nriding his horse, from the horse he will shoot, or even while he was walking. He will go\nover, behind the ear - that was his specialty. Go over to a man, behind his ear shoot him, and\nthen scream and yell, then go back home. People testified and he was saying now you can\ngive me my lunch or my breakfast. So it was, being in the Barakenbau (ph) was almost\nunbear...unbearable. So at night, after everybody finished their work at six o'clock, instead of\ngoing back to my barracks to relax, I would go to the kitchen and in the kitchen I would chop\nwood for the people who work in the kitchen. I will also wash for them their kettles. And I\ndid a good job at it. And once I caught the eye of the SS man, and he said why are you\nworking here. You're not working in the kitchen, cause I was shabby dressed. And I said I\nneed food. I'm hungry. So he said, for you working so hard and I chopped the wood very\ngood and I washed the kettles good, when we will enlarge, they kept constantly enlarging\nthat camp from ten thousand to twenty thousand, there were the people to come from\nHungary, I will give you, I will assign you to a kettle. And sure enough, even normally this\nwas assigned by the Jewish police, so one morning I was called in to get a kettle in Krakow,\nin in the in camp, a kettle in the kitchen. And the Jewish policeman said, we didn't send you\nthere. So the German said, I gave it to him. If he wouldn't say the word, I gave it to him, they\nwould probably beat me. I thought they would probably kill me by beating me, so that was\nlike the end of 1943, and my working in the kitchen, I had the opportunity to help myself,\nhelp my other friends and especially help my elder brother. And that was from 1944 in May -\nit was Mother's Day. They , Mutter, Mutter (ph), and Mengele came to our camp.\nAnd again we were taken to the appellplatz, to be counted. And he put markers on small\nchildren, on elderly people, and we didn't know what the markers were for. I stood with my\nbrother. We were holding hands. They marked my brother and they didn't mark me. I knew\nthat something is wrong somewhere, that somebody going...something's going to happen. A\nweek later we were called again, and our names were, the names were called out. My older\nbrother's name was called out, and they took him to Auschwitz; and a day later he was killed\nin Auschwitz. So in 1944 in May, I was left only with that little brother that was running\naround still in the...and I told you already the story about it, but uh I was ahead of myself a\nlittle bit, but in 1944 in May I was left with a younger brother out in Krakow somewhere,\nhoping that he can survive, and myself. In August, I was ready to be shipped out. And I had\nin camp, in P_aszow, I had certain feelings not to go. And that time they took the people to\nMauthausen. Who knows whether I would have survived. And a day later I came back to the\nkitchen and the SS man, Guntz (ph) was his name, Gunther (ph), Guntz Gunther said you\nsupposed to be on the tra...on the to go to with the people on the train. What, what are you\ndoing here? So for an excuse I told him I fell asleep in my barrack. So he called up to\n(ph) and he said what should we do with uh one of my people in the kitchen, but he\ndid say that I'm a good worker. He said if you need him, let him stay until the next transport.\nAnd they start liquidating all small camps. They started bringing in people from our camp,\nand they liquidate the camp Amalia, and for the first time I heard about people talking about\nAmalia, that there's Oskar Schindler. In Oskar Schindler, in his camp nobody gets beaten.\nNobody is hungry and nobody is overworked, so I just couldn't understand it but when they\ntook people from Amalia into P_aszow and they put them on a railroad track - it was like\nAugust and was the sun was unbearable, burning on on the cattle cars, and he bribed Amon\nGoeth. While I came from the kitchen with some, first to give them soup, and opened up the\ndoors to get a little air. He helped people and I was uh asked to do the same thing. Water\nhoses and we hosed down with cold water the roofs of the cattle cars, and he was screaming\nto the Germans, Oskar Schindler, that the Jews are all mechanics, engineers, that the\nGermans need them, and he guarantees that nobody will escape, to open the doors for them\nagain. So I looked at myself, I said like, is this aa German or this an angel? He wore civilian\nclothes. I had no idea who he was. I knew only that he received the factory from Amalia and\nhe was the only one who did not throw out the Jews, the factory owner was Benks, that he\nnot only took that factory, he took a lumber yard and he build barracks and he saved a few\nhundred Jews. My partner Ben Zuckerman was there and got and he was shipped away, also\nto Mauthausen, with that transport. In October of 1944 I was called among other people, that\nP_aszow was starting getting liquidated, cause the Russians are too close and that we going\ndeeper into Germany, and I was sent to Gross Rosen. Gross Rosen, mind you, was East\nGer...now it's East Germany. It's on the border Silesia. And Gross Rosen was a camp, I at\nleast did not see any beds. It was a transit camp of five days was the most that they would let\nyou stay in that camp. They complete undress you. You couldn't have nothing that belongs to\nyou. They make you spread your your legs and and check, cut off your hair. Nothing that\ncould belong to you that you could have it. All you got is uh pair of pants - no underwear, a\nshirt, a cap and a jacket and a pair of wooden shoes. That was, and a number on the things.\nThat's all, and for five days if somebody from the SS called that a factory needs a hundred\npeople, five hundred people, a thousand people, then no no question was it, then they\nshipped them out there. If after five days nobody called you, dead. The first day we came in,\nthey gave us showers and we didn't know if we going to get gas or we're going to get water.\nWe knew already about it, it was on under they had a that under doorway, on the\ndoors that you walked into Gross Rosen, it said in German, here you enter, and then there\nwas a big chimney and it says on the big chimney, and over there you go now. It's supposed\nto be a political camp. We sat in crutches (ph). Inside on the floor, spread our legs and one\nwas sitting right into the other. If one, and we were so packed if one had to sneeze or move,\neverybody had to move. Like glued in like sardines. And we were taken to a doctor, and\nthe five days, I saw truckloads of young Poles who tried to take over Warsaw,\nmake an , and they were taken and they immediately were given gas. Young,\neighteen, twenty years old. And everybody was saying that the same thing works for us. The\nfourth or the fifth night they were saying that Oskar Schindler came to Gross Rosen with a\nlist, and that people are on the list, and when I heard my name called out, Murray Pantirer,\nMoses Pantirer, sheet metal worker. Until this day I have no idea who put me there because\nto be, everybody knew that they making lists. People were promising, there was, the list was\nmade with Schindler and also Marcel Goldberg, a Jewish policeman. People promised\nMarcel Goldberg diamonds, houses that after the war they will assign. I had nothing to give.\nWas a very poor boy. And almost everybody was poor. What, at least some of it had maybe\nsome belongings that they hid some place. I had no belongings I hid no place. Nothing. And\nto have my name in it, if I would be a kind of fanatic, I would say an angel flew down from\nheaven and wrote down my name. Maybe it meant to be that at least one of our Pantirer\n(crying) should survive. In October, the fifth day, they put us on cattle cars and I want to\nbring out a very important point right now. The Germans claimed that they didn't know. We\nknew, when we were walking from, to the train station, when we were in Germany we were\npelted with stones and we called S Juden (ph). When we passed only from\nGermany into Czechoslovakia, the people were crying. The Czechs were throwing bread at\nus, and they were standing with such a sad faces that you can tell that they were with us, that\nthe Czechs were with us. And when we came to uh Brnenc [Ger: Brinnlitz],\nCzechoslovakia, and some boys had to go out to work in the sand pit, every night there were\npotatoes and bread hidden in the sand pit by the Czechs, who they themselves had very little.\nAnd they gave to us. They were the least collaborated with the Germans. They were most uh\nat least they they were insensitive what's happening to us. When we came to Brnenc, I was\nvery lucky. I was assigned to clean by the Germans.",
        "A: I was called out in Gross Rosen among other people. They give us some food and they put\nus on a train, but we were all very excited because uh we knew that if Oskar Schindler came\nand brought in a list that somehow there's an opportunity of survival, that we may be able to\nsurvive. We knew that uh Poland was all occupied, almost occupied by the Russians. We\nknew that the Allied forces are doing good in Europe and France and Italy, so to us it was\nlike a a new lease on life. The .... (ph), uh maybe it wasn't convenient but there's nothing\nwhat to complain about because we knew we're going to Brnenc. We came to Brnenc. It was\na different situation. Was a few SS people. There were no barbed wires. There was an old\nfactory, and we're supposed to fix up that factory. And Oskar Schindler was not happy that\nhe took out eight or nine hundred Jews from Gross Rosen. He went a few weeks later to\nAuschwitz, and got out three hundred women, and he said in Auschwitz that he needs them\nto work. I can testify to you the only thing I saw them doing is getting wool and knit\nsweaters for their husbands or boyfriends or friends or socks or gloves. Very little work did\nthey do. As a matter of fact we all did very little work. We always was scared that\nsomething's going to happen that he will be called, because we did not produce a single piece\nof ammunition, not a single piece. Once we were told that he bought a car load of\nammunition from another factory and delivered that it is from our factory. Once we were\ntold that he kept saying, Oh, I'm almost almost there. And I have to, and he alwa...he\nwelcomed us and he said, you are the Schindler's Juden, and here you will survive. Nothing\ngoing to happen to you. And I was assigned to work in the areas where the Ger...the SS were\nliving in their quarters. And I shined their shoes, so I always had a little extra piece of bread,\nhad a piece of cigarette from the ends uh that I could come to camp and always share it,\nexchange it for a piece of bread because people looked for the cigarette even if they were\nhungry, they gave you a piece of bread to have that cigarette, because they were they were\naddicted to the cigarette. I didn't smoke. I was young, and I would do some work in\nSchindler's own house, so I had uh a matter of fact I could say that I walked out from camp a\nhealthy boy. I never had uh those uh boils on my body and somehow I, how it happened I\ndon't know but I have to give you a a story. In February of 1944, '45, a call came into the\ncamp that on a siding not far from our camp the Germans left carloads of people just to die.\nThey need the locomotives, that's the engines, they needed for their own use. And the Czech\nwho worked on the siding, on the railroad, asked his superior to call in to our camp that\npeople are just laying there and dying, if our camp will accept them. And Oskar Schindler\nand his wife said yes, they will accept. They accept. That was mostly Hungarian Jews, and\nthey brought us, brought them into our camp. They they send out an engine from our camp\nbecause we had an engine and it brought in, and I was among some young boys\nwho learned with picks and shovel to open up the doors. The doors was so frozen from the\nhuman things, from the urine and the other stuff, so wet, that we couldn't open them up. So\nwith hot water we opened them finally up and when we opened up and we saw the crying\nout of the people, we we were thinking we doing them a favor - one grabbed him by the\nshoulders and the other grabbed him by, and I grabbed him by the feet, and they were so\nfrozen their behind that we ripped their skins. And the screaming was unbearable. So what\nwe did we worked slowly, and we worked like almost impossible task. If we hold our\nfingers, if we put too hot water we will burn them. Too cold water, it didn't help. So we had\nto try to, and lift them up, and we lift up maybe about twenty-eight or thirty young men like\nskeletons. And we took them into our camp, and Mrs. Schindler was cooking cereal for them\nevery day. They were in a separate barrack, cause the stink from them, the smell was just\nunbearable. And she would ask one of our boys, sometimes myself, to carry in the food and\nyou had to feed them. And out of the twenty-eight a few people have died and a few walked\nout. I was on a gathering for the Yad Vashem to valey (ph) that we building now\nthree years ago, and a man walked over to me and he said, are you Murray Pantirer? I live in\nLong Island. You are the one who pulled me from this car. So not only he didn't kill people,\nhe has on his, he and his wife were the real righteous people that they help anybody they\ncould have helped to.",
        "A: Oskar Schindler was, as a figure, kind of looks like our President Ford. Well dressed.\nSometimes I couldn't figure out why he's doing those things and maybe it's, I try to to explain\nit that he was such a powerful man that he did not have to knock anybody down to make\nhimself so powerful. And I used to drink with him enough . He used to like\ncognac, so after the war, you say when a person is under alcoholic influence maybe he will\ntalk and I kept on asking him, him, and he always said to me the same thing - he\ncouldn't stand the killing. He he couldn't see that one human being should do the same thing\nto a human being. He said to me, I will never deny I was a Nazi. He was a Nazi. Let me give\nyou a little background from as far as Oskar Schindler is concerned. He was born in\nSuddeten (ph), German. That was Czechoslovakia. Before World War I, that belonged to\nKing Franz Joseph (ph), to Austria, but after the war it was given back to the Czechs, so he\ndid not like the Czechs. His father and mother was Suddeten Germans. And when he was in\nthe Czech army, he spied for the Germans. He gave uniforms from the Czech army to the\nGermans and the Germans up a lot of those uniforms and when they attacked in 1938\nCzechoslovakia, they attacked with their uniforms. They camouflaged it that they, so they\ndidn't loose people, and he was on hierarchy and he had a lot of friends, and he he went for\nthe money. No question about it. He was happy to have this kind of life. At the, I used to call\nthem the men with the three W's - wealth, women and whiskey. And we met him all the\ntime. In 1972 when in January when mine wife and myself, we celebrated our 25th wedding\nanniversary, before Christmas, we got him over to the United States. We always made\nhim parties and '72, in January, he was at our celebration of the 25th wedding anniversary. I,\nwe always met him in Israel, and was always the same thing. Like regardless how many\nschnopzs, how many cognacs he had, he always said he could not stand the killing. So when\nhe was written up in somewhere in Berlin or he may have some friends, he was always\ngetting himself in...he was plenty of times in trouble. He was put in jail a few times, but not\nfor long. He always had somebody and he somehow somehow he managed. And after the\nwar his best life was for him when he was in Israel. He will sit in the hotel and we will have\na drink. Plenty of times he sit in my house, but he will always call us the Schindler Juden and\nmy children he used to call kinder, his children. And it's, I II don't have no words to\ndescribe you the man, the niceness, the feelings that this man had for the Jewish people and\nalways was the same thing. I'm not trying to say that uh he loved the Jewish people, but he\njust couldn't stand this this uh innocent people being killed. Then he turned against the Nazis.\nBut in the beginning he was working with them, and he also was a good business man. When\nthe Germans would throw out the Jew who when they took over some factories, he stayed\nand he wanted to learn how to make money with the Jewish people, and he made, he made\nquite quite a bit of money, but he let it go through because uh he couldn't hold on to a dollar.\nAnd when he passed away in '76, they buried him in Jerusalem, in the Catholic cemetery,\nand it's the only tombstone that it's written up, . That say that here lays\na arighteous, among righteous people. He was the third tree (ph) for the righteous people\nand the of was given to Oskar Schindler. He received the Buben Prize.\nHebrew University supported him. And of course there's a book written up about him and I\nhope that someday a movie will be written about him.",
        "A: It was just passing by the days. Nobody worked hard. Would you believe that there was in\nApril, in that factory Jews were baking matzos.",
        "A: In the factory. They got some flour - either they asked him to bring some flour or he brought\nin some flour from the kitchen. Comparing to camps in, the last few camps that's why I I\ncame out a strong boy. The last few months in the camp of Brnenc was like being in in a ina\nsanitarlum. We were never hungry. He would go with some people from camp, go into the\nfront where the Germans had no time to collect bread, potatoes, meat, and he would bring it\nto our camp. He would feed us like we would be his own children. For we received\n. Everybody got a . For his birthday in April, he was born in April, he give us\nand after the war, while he ran away - he couldn't, he told us, he got us together and\nhe told us - I have to go away. He didn't tell us the reason but after the war we found out - the\nCzechs had a death warrant out for him, so he took ten people from camp with his own car -\nhe had a Mercedes uh sports car with two trucks, load up all the stuff, and he and his wife\nand some of the from camp were going, he said we going to get closer to the American side.\nMost of Germans were afraid to fall into the Ivan. Ivan is the Russian. They all were going\ninto the front, to the Americans. They knew that the Americans will treat them better. The\nSpies were working for them very good, and he held the speech for us and he gave out\nammunition. He wouldn't let the SS go in, and he give out ammunition and he said, defend\nyourselves. If the, if the SS will come in, there was only a few of them, if they will come in -\ndefend yourselves, and also, he was afraid there were \u2014__ in Czechoslovakia from Vlasov\nof armies to Ukraine and the White Russians, and they will kill off some of people from\ncamp and take their identification cards and pretend that they are from camp, so protect\nyourselves, but I hope to see you. And he left uh the beginning of May. The first few days in\nMay or maybe the end of April, and then there was a little, a few days very quiet and on May\n10th, everybody was screaming the war's over, and the Russians came in. We were liberated\non May 10th, and he told us that he has a key from a factory with clothing and materials. He\nleft it with one of our head men, and he said everybody as soon as he gets out from camp\nshould get a package. We got a package for for clothes, for material for clothes, material for\nsuits, material for shirts, for underwear. Everybody was made a package. He prepared\npackages. I, I myself am with with everyone maybe should felt maybe he could have saved\nanother person of his family - that's the only grudge he can have against Schindler, but we\nowe our lives to Oskar Schindler.",
        "A: He, he was bribing them awful lot. He had an awful lot of wealth and he had papers that uh\nhe's doing a good job, that he's working for the high ranking uh higher than the SS, Gestapo,\nwhatever they call it. Maybe if the war would have been another few months, maybe you\nwould have bust. Nobody knows, but the bottom line is that whatever walked in in\nthat man's camp, plus the Hungarian, mostly Hungarian Jews that I told you about, they walk\nout from camp. They're alive. They built families.",
        "A: When I was liberated, as I have told you, I was uh a healthy kid so I took with another\ncouple friends who were also healthy, and we start our way back to Poland. And in\nCzechoslovakia, when we passed by train, by cars, by trucks, we hitch-hiked, we walked a\nlittle bit, horse and wagon - the Czechs treated us very good. And we didn't know Czech. We\nknew Czech a little bit because we knew Polish. It's a little similarity. On the train, if I was\nriding and I still had the uniform from camp, they would start to cry and they would give me\nnot one seat mind you - they will stand up and they will let me lay down, and anything they\nhad in their belongings, they would give it to me. And when we got to Poland, I'm sorry to\nsay it but the fact is we felt the anti-Semitism immediately. And I couldn't understand it, but\nnow that I'm getting a little older, maybe they were scared those who collaborated with the\nGermans. Maybe the they were afraid there were a lot of Jewish people who gave away\neverything they own to Polish people to hide for them. So they were afraid they're going to\ncome back and get it back from them. And a and a Polish person, you don't want to\ngive it back what you have already for three or four years, considered it your own. I came to\nKrakow and I walked in in mine apartment and I told the woman immediately I absolutely\ndon't want nothing from this apartment. All, everything that was in that apartment belonged\nto us. I didn't care for it. I only want to write down a little note. If anybody from my family\nor by miracle somebody survived, I am the second son of Lester (ph) Pantirer. I survived and\nI'm registering myself in the Jewish community of Krakow. Where I'm going to be I don't\nknow, but I - so she said sit down, have a cup of tea. She sent her son to the militia (ph). The\nmilitia came up and said, why did you come here to make trouble. I said, what kind of\ntroubles did I make? I just want to put down on my address, my apartment, I want to put\ndown my name and then we, as I have told you, we got some material so we start selling it\non the street, so either they will say Jidan (ph), we don't buy stuff from a Jew,\nor they will say, look - they said they killed them. Look how many they are. So I was -\namong thousands, there were two Jewish boys or three Jewish boys trying to exchange uh\nfor livelihood for stuff that they needed - they didn't want us. And in my ear they're\nconstantly saying, Jid .... Palestina. Jew go to Palestine. So I saw, I came to that the\ncommu...the community center was on . | wrote down my name with my papers\nand I told them I'm going to Palestine. I start going to Palestine. Literally going to Palestine.\nI went by train, by hitch-hiking. Also I had a problem that I was twenty years old. I wasn't\ntwenty years when the war ended, but a month later, in June, I was twenty years old, and the\nPoles start bothering me to go to the army. After being in camp, I have no , no\nfeelings to go to the army, so I went to Czechoslovakia and Czechoslovakia, I will never\nforget. I was in Prague when Benes arrived back from London, and he, and his Czech I\nunderstood when he said, the Jews who survived are welcomed to stay in Czechoslovakia,\nbut my advice to you is, build your own country. The sidewalks are f..., are f....1s full of\nblood from your families and your friends. You have no future in Europe. You are welcomed\nto stay in Czechoslovakia, but build you...try to find and build a life for yourself. So I went\nto, from Czechoslovakia to Linz, Austria, and in Linz, Austria I was in a displaced persons\ncamp for a while, and I heard that there's a Jewish brigade who fou...who fought with British\nand that they are in Italy and they are making arrangements to get you into Palestine. So I\nwent to the Bremenhaufen (ph), Brem...Bremenhaufen (ph), to Innsbruck not,\nBremenhaufen, Bremenpass and I went to Innsbruck. From Innsbruck I went by foot over\nthe mountains into Italy, and from Italy the first time I came was Modena and Modena got\nhooked up with some...that was the end of '45. I was hooked up with some brigade from\nthe...and they told me to move down all the way to Sicily, down at the bottom by the port\nand that ships will come and pick me up to go to Palestine. Ships came. There was not\nenough room for me. I was a single boy. People went down there with families and when I, I\nstayed there and wait for another ship. Another ship did not arrive, and I heard that the\nBritish intercepting the Jewish people. They take them to Cyprus. So I was scared. I said,\nwhere am I going to go to. Another camp again. So I went back to Austria. Back to Italy,\nfrom Italy back to Austria and I stayed in Austria. In 1946, in August, I met my wife and for\n- it was love at first sight. She's a beautiful person. She happens to be in Russia, and she was\nalso on her way to go to Israel. But in the meantime there was, you couldn't go to Israel, so I\nstayed in that displaced person camp and I have to say something to you. I want to make two\npoints very important that in my life I became an orphan twice. Once I lost my father and\nmother, and the next time I lost my country. Poland didn't want me. To Palestine I couldn't\ngo, and a person without a country 1s like a child without a father and mother. I absolutely\nhad no place to go. It puzzles me till today why nobody picked me up. They didn't teach us\nanything. I was on my...like five years of suffering, six years was not enough. I had to suffer\nanother few years. But I was married to my wife and my wife had a mother, a wonderful\nperson, and to me to ever been have, able to have a mother was a very important thing, and I\nwas told to make myself a displaced person as . That's a displaced person\ncou...without a country. I was in Linz written up that I had survived, that I was less than\ntwenty years old, that I was an orphan, but because I was married that statue, that uh quota\nfell through because I was married already. But uh lucky that in 1948 towards the end,\nTruman signed a two hundred thousand quota of displaced persons, and in '48 my wife\nbecame pregnant. When she became pregnant, I became terrible impatient. I didn't want a\nchild of mine to be born in Europe. So I went from Linz to Salzburg to the American Consul\nand I asked the consul, there was always German girls working in the consul, when you get\nto the consul, so I would bribe them with some chocolate or some cigarettes and they would\nalways say to me, Mr. Her Pantirer, your papers are a little bit higher, from the bottom a little\nbit higher, a little higher. And sure enough, at the end of '48, I was called with my wife from\nthe very first on the quota to come to America, and in '49, January 17th, we stayed in '48 a\nfew days in Bremenhaufen and from Bre...Bremenhaufen we took a ship, SS Marine Fletcher\n(ph) and January 4th or 5th happened to be our anniversary - I told my wife take out a suit.\nWe're going to dance on that ship, but I was so sick - she says that I was begging for a little\ndry ice, but I came to America, and I had, I had feelings in America that I I came to the nght\ncountry. I saw in New York so many cars and if everybody who works can make a living, I\npride myself that I can do anything and be able to make a living. And 1n beginning, in '49, of\ncourse in July 6th my son was born. My wife's mother and sister came to America in August,\nand I work in shops. I I was a floor boy on in garment center, but to help myself a little bit I\nused to go in in the factories for sweaters and buy off a few gross of sweaters and buying like\nuh two for a dollar, and I would sell one for a dollar. So I helped myself a little bit but I had\nno trade. Was very hard for me, so I had an opportunity and I decided in 1950 to become a\nbuilder. And I have to make a point here, that in the building trade I work harder in my\nbusiness than I worked in the concentration camp. To show you the logic things from a\nperson, regardless if you stand with a gun, if he has nothing from the work and you don't feel\nlike working, nothing can make you. But with the work that I did in mine building business,\nI knew, I used to come home at night, like ten o'clock at night, and I was tired. I found out\nfor the first time that when you're tired you cannot have your dinner, but I was happy. I knew\nI come home to my wife, to a child and I dedicated my life towards my children, to build a\nbetter home for my children. And that way I was awarded, I was rewarded that uh not only I\nget a better life for my children but for myself and I did it with all my heart and I'm very\nthankful to the country that gave me all that opportunity and I can only speak to the young\npeople who never lost their freedom - guard your freedom very strongly. God bless America.\nIt's a wonderful country. Has certain faults but like everyone has, but it's a beautiful, a\nwonderful country and and I have to tell you that I was confused in the beginning. I didn't\nknow bring up the children Jewish, not bring them up Jewish and I said to myself, if Hitler\nand his Nazi party, and they are still many Nazi guys, will say we tried to kill off Murray\nPantirer. We didn't want nobody to survive from his family, but now that he survived, he\nkilled himself. He didn't bring up the Jewish religion. He didn't bring up the Jewish family,\nso it's not a victory for me, but it's a victory for the Jewish people that uh I brought up my\nchildren. I've three wonderful children, a son and two daughters. They're married, three\nwonderful children, so I have six - I have no difference between mine son-in-law or\ndaughter-in-law and of course they produced for me nine grandchildren that I'm very proud\nof them. They're very Jewish-minded, and I want to say if two things it's important to learn\nfrom the Holocaust - our President J. F. Kennedy said, if you fooled me once, shame on you.\nYou are bad boys and you fooled me. But if you fooled me twice, shame on me that I'm\ngoing to let myself be fooled. So we, the Jewish people, always have to be vigilant and\nalways like they saying in America of the best thing - nip it in the bud. Cut it, when\nimmediately, don't make say , crazy guy does not pay attention. Be always\nalert. But above everything, we must have a State of Israel. I am convinced without, with all\nmy heart and all my belief, had we had a State of Israel in '35, '38, '39, even '40, many, many\nof us could have escaped. Many of us would have survived. I watch now which country\ntakes in their people without checking their health, their wealth, they, how old they are.\nIsrael opens up the doors for every Jew in the world. So this way we have to make sure that\nwe learn and we teach our children about the Holocaust. As painful as it is and it's almost\nunbelievable - the story has to be told. And if the story for the sake of my suffering and my\nlosses, 1f I can bring up a better world for one human being - never mind for a whole\ngeneration - it's worthwhile to teach, because on our skin we learned so make a better world\nfor any other people, regardless of color, creed, religion - every human being. We see now\nhow many doctors and lawyers, how ma...how we brought up our children, how many\nvaluable people. So you never know. When you kill off a person, you kill off a generation.\nAnd that, the free world should never allow it. And if uh if I have a minute, if you permit me\na few minutes, I want to talk a little bit about United Germany.",
