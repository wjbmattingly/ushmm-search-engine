        "LEOPOLD PAGE\nMarch 11, 1992\nBeep.\nI want you to describe for me Oscar Schindler. Describe what he was like, what he looked like,\nand then tell me in general what he did. I've never heard of him. I don't know who he 1s.\nI met Oscar Schindler the first time when I was hiding from the Gestapo who looking after me\nwhen I escaped from the Prisoner of War transport, and I was thinking that he's a Gestapo officer\nlooking for me, and I still have my pistol, so I put the pistol behind, beh, behind my back, and I was\nwaiting till my mother opened the house. He entered the, her apt, my mother was very scared, she\nask him what he wish, and he said, \"Don't worry, I'm not here to arrest anybody, I am here to make\nbusiness with you because I took apt, a Jewish apt, from, and I pay money for the apt. I received it\nfree, but I pay money to this Jewish fellow, and he said that you were in, interior decorating, and he\nwas decorating his apt. This moment I came forwards. I knew that he's not a Gestapo officer. He\nwas about 6'2\" and I was only 5'8\", so I looked to this guy, handsome face, young looking and in\nhis early 30s or late 30s. How to describe his age he looked very mature, he was about 35 years old\nor 34 years old at this time, and he looks me, and I felt right away a closeness between him and me,\nand we start talking, and we became a friend right away from the first day we met. And he asked\nme to do some certain things to him and then market in city to give him, get him some goods to his\nnew apt, I tell you what, he paid for it, and we became a very, very close associate together. He\nwas a German, he was a Catholic, and I was Polish Jew. We stick together till the day he die in\n1974. He did extraordinary things. He'd bought himself a factory, and employed Jewish people,\nand from the first day he employed, this is end of 1939, till the day we were liberated, he called\nthose people who he took from the camps, close to 1300 people, women, children, women and\nmen, from all type of professions, even a prostitute was in our camp, and he said he will try to save\nus, and he save us. He did extra ordinary job. It's very hard to explain this in a few words. You\nhave to really go day by day to explain the danger what he was exposed to it. The danger that\nwhen he will be exposed, we will be perished. He managed to escape by bribing the high officials,\nand they were afraid to expose him because in this case they will lose their life too, so one hand\nwas washing the other hand, by using bribes, by organizing a fake factory, we never produced\nanything in the factory. Everything was uh, staged, like in a movie, but he went through from the\nDecember of 1939, till May 8, 1945, and he promised to stick with us till 5 minutes after 12, and he\nkept his promise.",
        "Tell me the scale, how many people do you think he rescued.\nHe start with about 36 in the beginning. He asked me many times to come to his factory, but I was\nvery independent, I didn't want to go to factory, I want to have open hands, and figure out how to\nget every time because I wasn't sure what I would do. I didn't want to be in a camp, I didn't want to\nbe in a gh-ghetto, I don't want to be any place, I want to run. But, in between I got married, and\nthis changed completely my life because in 1940 in July, I got married to my wife who survived\nwith me thanks to Schindler, and while I was tied up, I was trying to run, uh run, run away before,\nduring the wintertime over the borders, but, the minute I met her, I decide to stay and see what,\nwhat happen. And I follow her up from Krakow to ghetto, from ghetto to, to concentration camp,\nand then we were separated. The man went to Gross Rosen in Sudetenland, and the women went\nto Auschwitz. Schindler pulled out the women, 300 women from Auschwitz by the list, and 900\nmen by the list from Gross Rosen, and was a miracle what never happened before and never\nhappened after. And, he fed us, he protect us, he paid the money to Gestapo, 600-half, Deutsche\nmarks, German marks for each of the prisoner, even though there were children who was in the age\nof 5-6 years old, and old women in his, their 60s. Well, he promised to protect us and save us and\nhe did. This is a miracle of 20th Century.\nTell me what you called yourselves.\nHe called himself, we, he call--\nWhat you called yourselves. What you called yourselves.\nHow I call myself?\nThe Schindler Jews, tell me about that.\nWe, the Sh--the Sh--the people who were employed, we decide to, we establish ourselves as a\nSchindler Jews, Schindler Juden. Why? Because he became like a father to us. When the, when\nthe women were sent to Auschwitz, and we sent to Gross Rosen, I was, we were sure that is the end\nof the line. But, when we saw him coming over there to Gross Rosen to pick us up, and the women\nsaw him over there in Auschwitz, pick--picking them up, and when we came to the factory in B-----\n, the Sudetenland, and we saw him, some definite feeling came to, to us. We knew that we are safe\nwith Schindler how long he is with us, and this was a tremendous wonderful feeling. His camp in",
        "Krakow, what he established, what was all, only for protection purposes, not too much for work,\nexcept when they were working on the utensil, what he could sell it on the black, black market and\nget money for it, you understand, and use the money to bribe the officials, you understand, nothing\nwas produced for the uh war effort of Germany. Everything was bought by him on the black\nmarket. Everything he bought for with his own money. I don't know that any of the Schindler\nJews give him any money, that he should use it to save this life of the Jews. No. He was using\nonly the money what we could sell on the black market, and this was the only income he got. And\nthis was a very big income, because according to the estimation, what was done by, uh, German\nDistribution ------------, he spent in the last 8 months of the war, from October, 44, till May 45, he\nspent 4 million marks, equivalent in these days to 2 million pre-war dollars. That was a\ntremendous fortune. When he would like to wash his hands and run away with this amount of\nmoney, he would go any place in the world, and hide himself till the war was over. No, he stick\nwith us, he spent the money, he save us, and he became a pauper. After the war, he didn't have a\npenny to his soul. We help him.\nWhy do you think he did that?\nThis question, I gu--, everybody asking me the same question. He got involved with the Jews right\naway in the beginning, and he knew about what the German has, they have in sleeves for us, what\nHitler want to do with us. He knew that the Jews will be killed. Because he has a, not so much on\nthe count that he was relig--a religious, he was not religious, but his upbring, upbringing from\nhome propagated him. He has a lot of Jewish friends in his family. He was warned??? and he lost\nthem when Hitler came to Sudetenland. And he knew what will happen. He decided on his own,\nfrom the bottom of his heart, from the goodness of his heart, to do something. First of all, he start\nto employ them, and the work, and working condition in his camp was so wonderful that people\nwho were in the Plazov Camp, or in or in any concentration camp, called his camp and his factory\nwhat we ca--there was the name Amaria, we called them a paradise. Because everybody was\ndreaming to go to Schindler camp because it was, compared to the other camp was a paradise. He\nprovided food, the ------------, he didn't allowed anybody to interfere with his work. He protected\nthose people. And this the reason we call ourselves Schindler Jew because he save us. He said, \"I\nwill be your father, and you are my children. You are my children.\" This what he always said, \"I\nstick with you till the end of the war.\" And he really kept his promise, was a big promise given to\nus, but he delivered. I don't know, maybe this was the destiny, I don't know how to answer.\nI'm trying to find a short question. Define a ghetto. Define ghetto. What is a ghetto?",
        "In 1939 in September when the Germ--German enter, the uh Poland, and conquered the Poland in 3\nweeks, they right away established certain part of the city to put the Jews over there. We knew that\nsomething will happen. We didn't know in 1939, in 1940, even in 1941 that will happen, even\nthough I was trained as officer, and we knew what happened in Germany, but never think to our\nmind that the German will destroy 6 million people. Never. I never will believe it. When\nsomebody will tell me in this time that this will happen, I say it's impossible. Germany was on the\nheight of, of the, in Europe, the most cultured country. But they decide.\nWe have to reload. We have to put another roll in.\nOh, I'm sorry.\nThat's okay.\nBecause I want to point the point what---\nChanging film, camera roll 2 1s up; Sync take 2 1s up.\nBeep.\nOkay, I want you to finish explaining about the ghetto.\nSo, the German decide first to put the people who recognize who is Jewish, not Jewish, and they\nput the armband with Jewish star on it, so, and there was a law, when somebody was caught\nwithout the armband, was shot, sometime on the spot, sometime they took him to the hills. Then\nafter a few months, they decide to bring all the people from the city of Krakow and surrounding\narea to a certain enclosed part of the city, and they pick a part of Padush, this is a suburb of\nKrakow, and they expel all the Polish population, the Catholic population, out from the, the, the uh,\nfrom this district, and they put all the Jews. Now, in this time, in, in Krakow was close to about 50\nto 60,000 population. They only established that only 15,000 can go together, and only people who\nhas a working passport with some German establishment, or private or government, and everybody\nwas trying to get this type of perm-permit, who didn't get it couldn't get in, but, when they move in\nMarch, 1941 from the city to the ghetto, they said to everybody over there, in particular to the\nofficial Jewish community official, that they will be self-supporting, they will be self-managed,\nnothing will uh happen to them, they will be protected by the German government against the\nPolish population, and this the reason they putting us up in it. In this time, the control of the ghetto,",
        "they call this ghetto ---------, what, because the Jews were only Jews in, there's nobody else could\nbe there. Will be controlled by police, regular police, but couple months, three months later, they\nchange it, and Gestapo took jurisdiction and this was changed of completely different picture.\nThey crossed the walls, they built the walls, they closed the ghetto, and nobody could get out or get\nin without special permission. The groups were going from the ghetto to work. People has to,\nhave a certain permit to have, to stay in the ghetto has to have a working permit with some\ngovernment, uh government uh establishment or private German establishment. Who didn't have\nit has to be removed or leave the ghetto.\nWhy did people not realize what was going to happen?\nYou see, the German use a very uh psychologic--psychological point of approach. They said, \"You\nlisten, you obey, nothing will happen to you, we are thinking about your welfare, this reason we're\ntaking you out from all these apartments and houses and places where you live around the city to\none place, we will provide you with the food, you will get the uh certain amount of food, the whole\namount of food was not more than 400 to 600 calories a day. But it, even this was, was stops after\na few, few months being there. And, you will not -----------survive the war, you will be protected\nand this, they were us--they were using a tac-tactic to keep the people quiet. When the people will\nrealize that in 1941 what will happen in 1942, 43, 44, probably lots of the people will run away, the\nyoung. The old didn't have a chance. They didn't know where to go. But the young will have the\nchance. But, family, you know, Jewish family like to stick together. Uh, the sentiment and the\nlove affection of children to parents, parents to children, husband to wife, wife to husband, they all\ntried to. What happened to me will happen to the, to my family, and they were sticking together,\nand they obey the orders, because not obeying the order was automatically uh bullet in the head.\nAnd they were using the strong tactics to force the people to obey the rules.\nWas there any resistance in the ghetto, and did you play a role in that resistance?\nThere was quite a bit of resistance in the ghetto. I did not pl-play the role there, were only a couple\nof my students who participate, Shemegrenger, and Lieberskin, and couple of other ones. They\norganized underground, they were more prepared by the organization to which they belong. The\nuh, the Jewish organization, and they organized. They realize, they already lost pro-probably all the\nfamily, they were all abou--on their own, and they organize, and they devastated the German in the\nfirst uh mo--few months of their existence. They were caught later on and they were all executed.\nThey were all killed.",
        "You had an experience one time in the ghetto where you heard Arnold Gette, and others were\noutside and you were, can you--\nCan you add something to the resistance? You see this was a resistance, but was different type of\nresistance. By obeying the rules, this means submitting to the orders of the German, I consider was\na certain part of resistance. We are trying to take away from German hands the strong practice of\nkilling and executing by obeying. This worked in the beginning, and later on the, the Jewish uh uh-\n-------, you know, like the Jewish commander was trying even to go and use bribe system. They\ntook the bribe, but nothing changed. Now you're going to the que-next question was--\nIt was about a time when you were hiding and you knew you were going to--tell me what was\nhappening---\nNow, you see, this happened in 1943 when they were liquidated the ghetto. I, my wife and myself\nand a friend of mine, Dr. Alexandrovich decide to escape from ghetto through the canal.\nCoincidentally, the action was going so fast, when I was trying to reach Dr. Alexandrovich, a dear\nfriend of mine, and his wife and his child, they already went to the canals, and when I, when I\narrived to the canals was no way to get in, the German already disco-discovered the canals exit, and\nthey kill everybody whom they caught over there, so when I came back to my apt, the one of the\napt, there was a one room, kitchen room, I notice my wife is gone. So, I ran outside looking where\nshe is and they told me they saw her going out from the ghetto toward the Plazov camp, who was\nbuilt over there on Jewish cemetery. They destroyed Jewish Cemetery, and they built barracks\nbecause the commandant who was appointment, appointed by the Gestapo, uh, ---------- Fuehrer uh\nArmand Gette, he, he selected this place as the best place for Jews because they can be buried there\nright away on the cemetery, that was his expression. And Armand, Armand Gette, this last day, I\nwould say, I was the last Jew alive who left the Krakow ghetto. I was trying to hide and figure out\nwhen the action will be over, I can go to my friends in the city, and stay outside, and eventually\nthis way I can help my wife who will be in the camp. But they were going from house to house\nwith 2 dogs. And they were ss--trying to trace all the Jews who were hiding, and I say, hiding\nbehind a special wall, what I was thinking would be good protection, but later on, I found out it will\nbe not a good protection against the dogs. I saw them pulling a woman and a child. They shot the\nwoman and they killed the child by sli--taking the child by the legs and hitting the wall. Then I\ndecide to step, and I knew that probably my min--last minutes of my life, but I didn't want to kill,\nbe killed over there in the hiding place, and I s--decide to figure out how I can protect myself, and I\nknow little bit mentality of the soldiers of and the officer, so they, when somebody gets some order\nand fulfill the or-order, then they have to respect it. So I start to take the bundles what was laying",
        "all around on the street and put them on one, in one place, and when they came to me close enough,\nabout 4 or 5 feet, I turned to them, and in German, I reported to them that I was appointed here by\none of the officer to clean the road so that the ---------will be open. There were no cars there, there\nwere not horses, there was nothing there. They start to laugh, but they figure out, the guy just got\nthe order, so he's doing the order, so he told me in German ------------, this means, \"Get lost.\" I did\nnot run, I turned around, clicked with my heels, and slowly left, don't even turning my head behind,\nbecause I knew when I turn my head, maybe will will will get a bullet in the back of the head. And\nthen I turned to the next corner, and I was the last Jew alive, with the last group of about 40 people\nleft the ghetto.\nDescribe the going in and out of the ghetto and the little code where you for how many people had\nbeen executed on the hill, the little word in and out of the ghetto, 60-0.\nOh, this was in camp already when we were in camp. In the camp, we play a little game. And the\ngame was very simple one. We count how many people were killed in the camp, and how many\nGermans was killed in the camp as a revenge. The history was like this, when a, when a group of\n60 people in camp from a table, and they caught food on them, they took them all to the hills, and\nthey executed, and this day was 60 to 0. Some days was 2 to 0. Some were 15 to 0. Some was 3\nto 0. Every day was something happening in the camp, so when people were coming from outside,\nthey said, \"What is this, how is today, what is the mood?\" \"Oh today was 3 to 0.\" \"Oh this is good,\nonly 3.\" But one day, because we killed one guy.\nWait till we reload. We have to do that one again.\nBeep.\nOkay tell me again the story of giving the statistics as though you haven't told me before. I haven't\nheard this story.\nIn, in the camp, from the first day we arrive, the mentality of the German was to create a condition\nthat people will suffer and, and die. The execution was almost on daily basis. Some of those\npeople were working outside and the group were going out 6 o clock in the morning, returning 6 o\nclock in the evening back to the camp. And the people who were outside were in a better situation\nthan the people who were inside the camp because we, inside the camp they have to live through\nthe whole experience what is going in the camp, and the killing was going over there. When some\ngroup came in like 60 people from _ ----------came in and they found food on them, they sent them",
        "to the hills and executed the people, and we called this 60 to 0. This means 60 our Jewish people\nwere killed, not one German. There were 2 to 0, 15 to 0, 20 to 0, one day, when they came outside,\nwe said, today was 21 to 1. One of the boy who was led to the execution jumped on the German\nguard, pulled out the bayonet and killed this guard while he was killed too, but at least was one\nGerman perish -------------one of the helper of the German was Ukrainian soldier. Now this was a\nsituation what was like a game, but this was a very deadly game. Armand Gette would, would stay\non his balcony with a rifle, from early in the morning, sometime afternoon, with a rifle, and picking\nup people and run them, and shoot them from balcony to create a, a tremendous pressure of people\nwho were working outside because nobody knew when he can appear with a pistol or with a rifle.\nHe was going from a one uh, uh barrack, working barrack like an uh, uh mechanical barrack, and\nhe didn't like somebody who was doing the job too slow, he pull a gun and shoot them on the spot.\nHe didn't like somebody walking through the camp, he has two dogs, who were trained to kill, he\nlet the dogs uh tear the, the person to pieces. So there were every minute, every day from morning\ntill we woke up till the day we went to bed, and at night something always happens.\nWas there, in your experience, any physical resistance in the camp?\nIn this particular camp, there were very, I don't think so were any big resistance what I knew about\nthis. No. There were maybe individual people who tried to escape on their own. Some of them\nescaped. Very few. Some of them got caught, and they were hanged, and for anything was only\none penalty, penalty of death. So, the, in the German camps, in the Plazov camp, they were not\norganized resis--resistance, uh to, to do something. No, I don't think so.\nWhat about mental resistance?\nThere were a lot of mental resistance because the, even those people who were kil--led to the death,\nto the execution place, they were going over there with dignity. They never begged for, for\nanything, they didn't ask for anything. They died with dignity, and I consider this resistance. One\ncase what I can tell that's stuck in my mind, on Yom Kippur day, in 1944, they were always\nselecting the hardest jobs for the people. And I, we woke up in the morning, was dark because it\nwas in October, and I noticed father and son was praying, religious Jews, pray, they, lots of Jews\nwere praying, because there were lots of religious Jews, but not so openly, they were standing on\nthe side of a barrack facing Jerusalem and they were playing uh, uh praying, and they German\ncame, he said, \"Los, los, to work!\" and they didn't move, they were in such uh contemplation and\nsuch a spiritual moment, they maybe didn't hear this guy, he pulled a gun, and shoot father and son.\nThat, I consider this was a tremendous resistance because they could save their lives if they would",
        "start working, but they were praying and they were talking to God, they forget about anything else.\nThis was a resistance in my opinion.\nWhat other kinds of resistance did, were there friendships, did you keep each other's spirits up?\nThe friendship between the people was tremendous, everybody was trying to help each other.\nWhen somebody was, my wife, for example told me one day she didn't felt, feel well, so the group\nof five girls who were staying in the line, were holding her so she shouldn't fall down or fainted or\nsomething because it will be automatically sent to for execution or in, in, in Auschwitz, to the gas\nchamber. So, there tremendous friendship, and everybody was trying to help each other, morally\nand even physically.\nTell me about friendship between men that you knew about. When you were alone with men in\ncamps, did you have close friends.\nWe have, I have few close friends, very close, we were all very close, we know each other, but I\nwas in a much luckier position, uh, uh much lucky because I was a professor before the war, and I\nwas teaching in every Jewish gymnasium in Krakow, and lot of my students were in ---------, and\nthey were a very, very close friend, and I tried to help them as much, and they were trying to help\nme, and many times happened that they helped me in, in, in, in the ghetto, for example, one of my\nstudents was a, in the police, in the out there, he asked and beg the German to let me go because I\nwas already in a transport to go, and they let him uh, the to the-----------this is a very important\nperson, and he, he let me out, but you see, the, the, the, the respect and love was tremendous. The\nsame between the women, between the men and women, between the families who were there,\nbecause the family was still over there, not every family was completely torn apart. I was with my\nwife in Plashow. Coincidentally, my family, my mother, my father, my sister, my brother-in-law,\nthey were already in a different part of, of the country. They went to the Eastern part of the country\nand I never saw them again. So, it's very, it was a, a tremendous support one to each other.\nTalk about keeping each other's hopes up and how rumors would help. Like once there was a\nrumor of food coming from Switzerland. Do you remember that?\nFrom Switzerland? Maybe from Hungary. Rumor about what?\nFood coming in.",
        "I know the whole story------------. There were rumors that we would get some support from\nSwitzerland, but the rumors were only rumors, it's true, we got some food, and there were uh rotten\ncheese, and some rotten marmalade, that's all. Where the money went, what's the Red Cross from\nSwitzerland and Jewish organizations was donated, I don't want to know, I don't want to be in it,\nthe history is written by Israeli government, let's somebody who wants to find out exactly what\nhappened, they can find out with ---------------. I don't want to point fingers at anybody.\nOkay. A lot of times people believe there was no resistance in camps. How would you react to\nthat?\nThis is not true. There were many camps in which be big resistance, Sobibor in Auschwitz, in\nGross Rosen, 1n, in our little camp. In Brinwitz??? we have a very nice little group of resistance,\nwhat Schindler himself created, was 15 of us ex-soldiers, who uh, he organized us in special little\ngroups, and everybody has a job to do, he explained to us that there are orders when the war will be\nover, and we are already close to the, because there was the uh the march 1945, the war was going\nto the end, is or--there are order to executed all those people in the Brinwitz camp, and already\nthere were a grave dig out by the Russian prisoner of war who were in the different camp, four\npeople from Brinwitz, from the camp of Schindler. He said, \"Look, when this moment came in,\nyou have to stand up, maybe you will get killed, but they cannot executed 4,300 people, it's\nphysically impossible because when thousand people, hundred people will jump on -----------SS\nsoldier, they will kill some of them, not all the people, but we were very lucky. He organized this\nway, so on the night of May the 7th, to 9, to 9, to May the 8th, we disarmed 12 o clock at night all\nthe soldiers, and we put them in the cellar, and we kept them till the Russians came in on the 11th\nof May, we were protecting the camp ourselves, we put our own people on the towers, and we kept\nthe guard the inmate, and we closed the camp because we were surrounded with over 100,000\nGerman sold-soldiers around because they were between the American, French and English troops\non the West Side, and the Russian troop on the East side, and we were just in the center of the\nwhole mess, and we put a big sign, '\"Typhus inside,\" so nobody could enter because the Germans\nwere afraid that the typhus could be spread, and we put -----------because nobody---, and they lib--\nwe were liberated by ourselves, but officially on May 11, the first Russian soldiers entered the\ncamp.\nWe're just about to run out. We have to reload.\nI almost killed a guy too.",
        "Change film, camera roll 4 is up; Sync take 4 is up.\nBeep.\nI want to ask you some more about Schindler. Tell me about the work you did and how involved\nhe was in, in any sabotage.\nWhen Schindler the, the, his factory from Krakow to Brinwitz, he knew that we cannot produce\nanything, and he supposed to produce the shells, the, the, the, the casting for the shells, you know,\nhow you call this, I don't know, it's in English, you know, the brass part of the shell.\nShell casing.\nShell casing.\nStart it again.\nOkay. You know when he moved his factory from Krakow to Brinwitz, and he is establishing his\nfactory to produce uh shell casing, understand? And, for the, for the war effort, for the German\narmy, he knew he has to deliver. So, the first few weeks, we don't have to deliver because the ma,\nmachinery came in we put the factory together, we put the oven together, we start working,\neverybody was hammering, was lots of noise, but nothing was coming out. We didn't know how to\ndo it. We were not that professional, there were a few, maybe professional mechanics. There\nwere very good engineers who fake up everything that looks like a big factory, but he has to uh,\ncertain time, deliver the quantity what he promised to deliver. So were very simple procedures he\nmade. He bought on the black market from another shell casing manufacturer, the quantity he\nneeded, and delivered of his own. What we produce, they were using too, but they start to\ninvestigate him because they were all over burned or over hit. You see, they have to have, be hit a,\na cert, certain amount of temperature. When they are overheated, they break. When the shell goes\noff, uh, uh, uh explodes. When it's under-heated, it won't work at all. So, his last speech was he\nsays to us, he said, \"Thank God that everything we produce here never kill anybody. Because they\ncouldn't use it.\" They start investigate it, they sent a group of engineer, but when they look on the\nfactory, and the, how the machinery works, how the ovens work, how they uh big uh, uh, uh, uh\nmachinery is operating, they sent a report that everything looks good because we fake it up\neverything. Nobody was there who knew what did. I was a welder. What I did? I have to weld\ncertain parts of the machinery, so I opened the, the bottle with the gas overnight, very little, in the\nmorning was no gas. So I could report that we don't have gas, I cannot do the job. So they got me",
        "another bottle, couple days happened to the other bottle. So we couldn't finish it. I said, \"It's not\nmy fault that they're putting wrong gauges on the machine. I don't do anything, I try to work, and\nthen I cannot do it. Well, we were doing some little job, but this was a little type sabotage. Then\nSchindler give me and the other man, Mr. Mandel, a little radio, supposed to be, we're supposed to\nfix the radio, but we always fix the radio only about | o clock in the morning when we have a night\nshift to listen to BBC to find out how it's going on. And every, in the morning, there were a little\ninformation on a piece of paper in every barrack, in every room, what is going on, how close the\nGermans are, what is happening here, and this, our radio mechanic was doing with us together, it\nwas very interesting, we knew exactly what is going on.\nTell me again about getting arms for you at the end.\nNow with the arms, now we, we didn't have too much arms, we had only one little pistol that\nSchindler give to one of the guys, we have some stick, metal sticks, they were, I think so, but I\ndon't remember only one ---------------Schindler got from a Czech partisan. We didn't have too\nmany, but he knew that at 12 0 clock at night, they will be change of guards. I was the lucky one. I\nwas sent to disarm the little commandant who was replacing the original commandant, who was\nsent to West--uh Eastern front, and this was an old-timer, and I sneak behind him with another\ngentleman, who coincidentally die in Vienna, and put my finger against his back, and say, hand the\nhold the hands up. He didn't know what I had in my hand. He put the hands up, I took his gun, and\nI held his gun. And he start to yell that I want to kill him, and Schindler came in and all nobody, all\nthe soldiers, we disarmed them all, we put them in the cellar, and we kept them there.\nWhat is Schindler symbolic of for you?\nI will not say what he means to me because he was a dear friend to me. I will tell what Rabbi\nLevitor said when I interviewed Levor, Levitor for the Schindler List book, or Schindler's ------\nwhat is calling in England. He said to me a very simple: \"I as a Rabbi supposed to believe in only\none God, the mighty one. Schindler is another God to me.\"\nWhy weren't there more Schindler\u2019s?\nI wouldn't say, it's very hard to answer the question, because when I would like to put myself in the\nposition of Schindler, well I do consider myself a pretty honest guy, I don't know if I will do it.\nYou have to have a guts to do something like this because the penalty for helping a Jew, even\ngiving him a cigarette or a piece of bread or shelter him overnight, when he's got caught, 1s a",
        "penalty of death, not only to the person who did the helping, who give the helping hand, but the\nwhole his family and even a village. When this happened in a village, a whole village was burned.\nWhen they, they caught the person, the whole family was executed. So this was a tremendous\nresponsibility on the per--on the side of the person who wants to help the Jew, and put himself in\nthe position that he can be lose his own life, but also endanger the family life. So, this was a very,\nvery hard ques, question to answer. He was in a position that he knew how to handle the, the\nGermans in power. He became a friend, he bribed them, he dined them, he whined them. You\nunderstand? And using this type of method, of bribing this person, particular person, he got the\nconfidence. When he got in trouble, they found out, they better take him out, otherwise he will s-\nsay something not so nice about us and maybe we can lose our life, and this was his power. But\nwhy was not so many Schindler? I wish there would be another thousand Schindler, there will be\nanother 60 or 70,000 people saved. There was another gentleman, Mr. Mavrich, who has 3,000\npeople working for him in his factory in Krakow. The considered him a very nice German. He\nwas honored by Ger--by the government, I personally didn't have respect for this man because in\nNovember 1944, Schindler begged Mavrich to take his 3000 Jews with him to Brinwitz, and we\nwill try to save those 3,000 Jews. He said, in German I will say it and I will translate it. \"------------\n----------------------- ---------------------: I did everything possible till November 44 for the Jews. I\ngive them food and shelter and everything. Now I'm washing my hands and I'm going home to\nVienna.\" And he did. In October, 1944, he went to Vienna with millions what he made under\nslave labor, he was good till this time, but later he run like a captain running from a ship what is\ngoing down, like a rat. And I didn't respect this. I was supposing to give him a Righteous Gentile\nStatus, but some people who were working for him and there was 3,000 of them, they make a\nstatement that he was good for them, and the Jewish government decide to give him the Righteous\nGentile Status, and I think so maybe he deserve it, for this what he did.\nDid his people live?\nYes. From his people there a very interesting question. Schindler from his memory, put on his list\n64 I think so, or 65 names what he knew from dealing with Mr. Mavrich, and knew the people\nclose, most the people who were in charge, like a chief tailor or something, he put with Mr. Tisch,\nRaymond Tisch, who was asst to Mr. Mavrich. The list, and the last minute, when the list was\ncreated to go to Brinvitz, those 64 people survived. From the other, almost 3000 people of 2940\npeople only are the same percentage what in general per, about 5 percent survived in this bunch.\nTell me about the first person you saw in liberation, what he looked like riding in.",
        "The first person we saw on the uh on the May the 11th, when it was about 10 o clock in the\nmorning, there came a couple of Russian soldiers, I didn't know that one of them was Magor, they\ncome on the horses without the saddle, the rifle with a string, they didn't look to me like a sol,\nsoldiers, they looked to me like a bunch of uh I don't know, running away soldiers. No shoes, no\nnothing, but they were the conquerors, they beat the, the Hitler's army, so they came in and they\nsaid, \"Now you are all liberated.\" So, people were thanking them and kissing them and hugging\nthem, and I stay away and look at them, and say, \"My God, these are our liberators. What\nhappened, why, why they were not here about a couple months earlier, or at least 3 days earlier,\nbecause from May the 8th till May 11th, we still were in a big danger because they were shooting\npeople, shooting from outside to the camp, they knew some of the Germans knew who are inside,\nand one of the guys was wounded there. You see? So, but they were the liberator.\nWe're just, we're running out. We're going to reload.\nBeep.\nHe only can stop for 20 minutes he said.\nYeah.\nAll right.\nOkay, tell me that story.\nNow, you asking a question about little Oleg Grossner. His father and his mother were a dear\nfriend of mine before the war. He was a very famous musician, and he and his brother, Paul\nGrossner, were playing for Armand Gette, commandant of Plaushau. And they have some certain\ninfluence through their music, and this bloodthirsty murderer. One day, I was working in the\ngarage as a welder, and we were repairing the cars for Armand Gette. He said, \"You are going to\nthe city to bring some uniforms for the factories what we have in the camp. How about maybe you\nshould bring my son to the camp.\" I looked at him, and I said that this ma-man is out of his mind.\nThe children don't have a chance to survive here. I said, \"What's the matter, you want, what\nhappened to us, I want to happen to my son.\" I said, \"This is not fair.\" He said, \"No, this is our\ndecision.\" Nancy, his wife, and he decided to bring him. He said, \"My son will wait on this and\nthis corner on the street, and you know the city very well, and try to bring him in.\" We went to the\ncamp, to the city, and we passed the corner, and I saw the boy standing there with some other",
        "gentleman, so we sent them, Ger, uh, the Ukrainian guard with money to buy some vodka. In\nbetween, we sneak the boy in the car. There was a big truck, in the little box. But when we\nreturned to the camp, when we were passing the examination, they never examined uh, examined,\nbecause we were so empty truck, we didn't brought anything from the city. They look around and\nthat's all. When he was passing off the guard on the, on the gate, I hear a little voice coming up\nfrom the box, \"Mr. Mr. my little feet are sticking out.\" I look and I almost fainted, I see his two\nfeet sticking out from the back, so I covered with my ------------, going around, how this guy was\ngoing around the car, I was going around and cover these little feet, and we brought the boy to the\ncamp. The boy survived the camp with the, with the parents, by miracle, and again, I have to say,\nthanks to Oscar Schindler, because when Oscar Schindler was making the list, he wants to have the\nmusician with them so he put the musician name, and Oleg, in this time Oleg was almost ten years\nold, you understand? And he went to the camp to bring this, through the Gross Rosen camp, but\nfrom Brinwitz, in the end of uh, uh it was probably in the, in the, I don't remember it was, end of\n1944, or beginning of of 1945, the commandant sent all the children to Auschwitz, and the parents,\nfather decide to go with the children, and Herman and Oleg Grossner went to Auschwitz, this was\nin the end of 44, because mother saw him over there is Auschwitz, you know, and uh, uh...\nI want you to tell me about a time when you were cleaning a window, and a guard came in, tell me\nthat story.\nThis is it's happened in May in 1944, I got a order to clean the window, this was a Sunday, during\nthe Sunday day there, there were 2 shifts, day and night, so the day shift cleaned the barracks, and\nnight shift was uh, uh day shift was staying, uh, I have to go back to it.\nStart again.\nYeah. There were two shifts in the barracks. The night shift and the day shift. The day shift was\nworking during the day, and stay sleep at night, and the night shift was working during the night\nand sl-sleep during the day. And I was in the day shift, and I was in the barrack on Sunday\nafternoon, and I got a job to clean the window of the barrack, and I was cleaning the window the\nbest I could, the, nobody too much pressure on do, effort to do this job perfect, but in between was\na little shower, rain, and the window got spotted up, and then we hear some rumor that one of the\nGestapo officer is going from barrack to barrack shooting people Sunday afternoon. He was drunk,\nno question about it, and he was named Hans Schreiber, and he come over, and he go, everybody\ndisappear, there was in the barrack close to about couple hundred people, but outside, he brought\noutside maybe 50, 60 people. He put us in one line, and start to examine the cleanness of the",
        "barrack, and the barrack wasn't so clean, and the window was even worse because rain ruined the\nall the job. But he start passing and looking and looking and passing, we didn't know what he's\nlooking for, and one moment he said, \"Who was cleaning the window?\" Nobody surrendered with\nthe information, and I was not the first one who will go forwards, so he was passing and asking the\nquestion, you know, like a drunken guy, he asking repeat the question and question. Nobody\nanswered, so he op--he brought his gun to the barrack, to the front, opened the holster, and he said,\n\"When this person who cleaned this window will not step out, every ten of you will be killed. And\nthat was not a saying, this was not a trick, he was killing people just before he came to our barrack.\nWell, what do you do in a case like this. I knew I was the guy who was cleaning the window,\nmaybe some other people were cleaning too, but I knew I did. So when he came on the height of\nmy position, I was just in the center of the whole line, and about four or five feet away to from me,\nI stepped forwards in a like military way. I one, two, three, step, click with my heels and report, so\nand so, ------------Fuehrer, Mr. number my hefling number, what was at this time, and I report, I,\nmy number was very interesting, was, in Plachau, was 4040, was very easy, vierzig, vierzig was\nvery easy to remember, and I did this. He looks down, and he has a right punch, he hit me over the\nhead with the right punch once. I stayed, didn't move. He hit me from the other side. Again from\nthis side, and again--I didn't move. Normally, normally people by instinct start to protect\nthemselves. I said no, I will not move, because I knew I have to watch his hand, when he goes for\nhis gun, I will try to go maybe for his throat, I, you know in the split second you don't know what\nyou're thinking, but I was watching his movement. Then he come to me, and he ask in German, \"T\nam not hurting you?\" I said, \"You can kill me, but I don't move, I am Polish officer.\" He come to\nme, pat me on the back, and said \"You are a brave --------, you are a brave man.\" He took a pack of\ncigarettes and gave me. From this time, every time he saw me, he brought me a piece of bread, or\napple for my wife, or something, and, and one day, he came in and start crying, that he did lots of\nbad things, now he's going to Eastern front, and he don't know what happen to him, but he\napologized. I never saw him, I tried to find him after the war, I couldn't.",
        "What does your experience make you feel about humanity?",
        "When we were talking about humanity and feeling and between our Jews, we tried to support this,\nthis was normal. About the humanity of the outside people, I would say there were 2 type of\npeople, who were trying, very small percent, or people who stay on the outside, who were afraid to\ndo anything, and I don't blame them for it, and there were other people who were very happy what\nwas happening to Jews. Now, what is the majority, the majority was in the center. Was very few\nwho helped, and I will say, majority was sympathizer, but was afraid to do it, and the skunks who\nwere happy with it, I con--I consider them as rotten type of group, group of people, and I cannot",
        "judge them, I am not the person who will judge them. Humanity, man to man, so, they show only\nthose people who risked their lives, and helped the Jews in this particular situation. Probably they\nwill help anybody else when there be situation like this, and this is the reason the, the Israeli\ngovernment established the highest award a human being can get, the Medal of the, they called this\nRighteous Gentile. And give them a tree planted in the ----------- in their honor. And when you\nlook over there, there's over 5,000, maybe 5 to 6000 trees pleasantly??? planted. There are very\nfew Germans, maybe on one hand, maybe on two hands, you can, very small amount of\nFrenchmen, very small amount of other nationality, 90% are the Polish people because they, what\nhappened to the Jews mostly happened in Poland and they were found out, but percentage wise,\ncomparing to the population, this was a very, very, very small percentage.\nHow did you survive?\nUh, by inner strength. By believing that I have to survive. By, I knew I will survive. And\nsomething happened in 1944 in May again, there was a, when the biggest killing was going in all\nthe camps and they were killing people by thousands and they...Now the group of gypsies come to\nKrakow Plaushau concentration camp, and there was close to 800 with them, and on Sunday??? a\nfriend of mine who lives now in Australia, his name is Dr. Roseli, we are going, and we just got a\npiece of bread, everybody got a very small piece of bread, maybe weighed, I don't know, maybe\nhundred gram.\nWait. Reload.\nChange film to camera roll 6; Sync take 7 1s up\nBeep.\nSo, with a friend of mine, we were just getting a piece of b-uh bread, every one of us, was\nafternoon, and we were going to the work, and the men rode in the camp. We were approaching\nthe, the part of the camp what was specially designated to keep these people over there for the few\nhours or few days what they supposed to be in the camp. They were all on the way to Auschwitz.\nThen one of the Hungarian Gypsies start to yelling to us in Hungarian \"Kitsche kanner, kitsche\nkanner.\" We couldn't figure what this she meant, when we come, come to the uh tron, uh to the\nbarbed wire ga-uh gate, she pointed on the bread, --------------- 1n German, a little piece of bread.\nSo I broke a piece of bread and give it to her. She didn't want to accept it. She said in broken\nGerman, she would like to give me, tell me what is my future. So I said, \"My future is the same as",
        "your future. Tomorrow you and today I, or I, or you today and tomorrow me.\" \"No no, I want to\ndo it.\" Well, if the gypsy wants to do it, do it. So, I show her my hand, and she look at it and said,\n\"You and your closest one...you will survive this war.\" I have to stop, -------(long pause) \"You and\nyour closest one, you'll survive the war, you'll go over the big ocean to a big country, and you will\nlives happy after.\" I smiled because it was a very big prediction. \"Okay, all right. Thank you.\"\nAnd my friend is giving also a piece of bread. She says, \"I will tell you something what happened\nto you.\" She looked on his hand, and said, \"You and your closest one will survive the war, and you\nwill live happily after.\" We were talking about this. But inside, I found out, probably she's right. I\nhave to survive. I hope, have to protect my wife, I have to try to save her as much I can, nobody is\nsmart in this particular situation, but I have to be stay here, and this the reason I went there,\notherwise maybe I will never went to the, to the camp, you know. And we survived. And we're\nliving happy after. He survived, live in Australia with his father who was the closest one. He\nmarried after the war, I was married just when the war started. And this is a very interesting\nprediction because my inner strength, and this what she said to me, give me a tremendous push.\nThere must be a way to survive, some way somehow, we have to survive. Not in the condition was\nfavorable to us. We survived, but 6 million people didn't, including my whole family what consists\nclose to a hundred people. So must be a purpose that we survived, maybe this is the purpose--that I\nam sitting here and telling you this story.\nI want to ask you a hard question. A lot of people say that Jews went like sheep to the slaughter.\nI disagree with this. I disagree with this. Because as an officer and trained soldiers, who went to\nwar and a hardship. People never go to, to death like sheeps. When they go without the fighting,\nthey go with dignity. When they fight and they get killed, they try to protect themselves, but not uh\nlike sheep, because was no way to escape, what a children can do when they took close to 60\nchildren on the hill and executed them? What the woman who can do when they undress them and\nthey ask them to stay on the, on the side of the grave, and they shoot them with machine guns?\nWhat the other people can do? What the soldiers in the, in the uh, uh, uh last winter of the war\nwhere they execute them by Gestapo when they're in French country, close to 150 American\nsoldiers were executed. What they can do? Nothing. They can try to escape, was no way to\nescape. I think so that those people who died, died with dignity in my opinion, and there 1s a -------\n----- that nobody, nobody, I never heard that any of those people begged to save their life. They\nknew there was nowhere to turn. One of my friends who was led to the execution place in\nPlauschau, on the way there, and we stood by the road, because they asked us to stay there, he\ncome to me and said, \"Tell my wife that on the last road, I am thinking about her.\" The woman is\nalive in New York. He was a good person????",
        "Take 8 is up.\nBeep.\nI want to go to before the war, the night that's known as Kristallnacht. I want you to tell me where\nyou were, and what was going on.\nThis was in November, 1938 when the Kristallnacht, night, happened. I was teacher, and I was\nteaching in different city, not in city of Krakow, city in -----------. There were lots of things in the\npapers and we knew what is going on, but we got, was very hard to analyze because it was\noutbreak of some fanatical hatreds on the side of the German Nazi, Nazi Party. After the one of\nthe, the Jewish fellow kill one of the secretary of the German Consulate in Paris, and this was like\na, a revenge, and was horrible things, the paper was full of it, and we knew what is going on. This\nwas like a point to realize it what the German had in their sleeves for the Jews in future. But we\nwere in Poland, we were free, we could go anyplace we wanted, you understand? We were, we, we\nhave feeling of shelter, but the one things we did, when all the German Jews who were coming to\nPoland what was expelled by the Germans because they were born in Poland, in ------------, and\nthey came to Poland, was absorbed by the Jewish communities all over the Poland in Lodz,\nWarsaw, Czestochowa, Krakow particular was very, very known for the hospitality to those people.\nWe accepted a family who stayed with us till, till the uh German took over Krakow, some of those\npeople survived, some of those people perished , but the hospitality of Polish Jewry to those people\nwho were expelled by the Germans from Germany, this spirit of ------- was the best you, in the\nmost humane way, everybody was trying to help, and shelter them and feed them, and protect them\neven though they were outsider. They never speak a word of Polish.\nTell me about Schindler's birthday party.\nIn 19...In 1944 in October, Schindler was born uh on the 24th of October, and this was a party.\nThis was a party what we would like to some recompensate to him for this goodness and the\nprotection what he was giving to us. I'm sorry I'm, I'm giving you a...\nThat's okay you're fine.\nOne second. His birthday is not in October, or in April, I think so, uh, uh in April, yes? His\nbirthday is in April, and this we decide to recompensate something, so the women decide to bake",
        "him a cake. Now we didn't have a anything to bake with it, but we have our piece of bread, so\neverybody chip a piece of bread, they put this bread together, we have a little bit marmalade what\nwe were getting from Schindler, and we use the marmalade and we make a cake. The bakers from\nour, the Jewish bakers who were still in camp made this cake of his birthday, and, and uh dec--we\ndecide to give him also a present, so one of our friends still have his gold teeth. He remove his\ngold teeth, his bridge gold bridge and give it, and the one of the -------------, who was working as a\nmechanic make a gorgeous ring for him, casting the, the ring, and inside the ring, he put the\ninscription in Hebrew, \"A man who save one life, save the world.\" And this what we giving\nSchindler as his birthday present on his, on the 28th of April. And he has a speech of to us, and I\nremember, uh, I remember forever, we stay all the people there, women and men, 1300 people in\nthe big hole, and he has a speech to us and said to us like this, uh short--that was a long speech, I\nwill take the synthesis??? of the speech: \"You are here, you are my chil-children, children, I am\nhere to protect you. The war will be very soon over. You will be free. Remember the people who\nperished. We will have a one minute silence in the name of those people who perished, but don't\ntake revenge on those who has did the harm to you. Let's the revenge go to the legal road. The\nroad of, of uh, uh judges and legal ways. Don't take revenge in your own hand. Behave like a\nhuman being, and this was his last speech, and I remember like today, we were all shaved, so we\ndidn't have a hair, but my, I get go-goose pimple on my top of my head when I heard this, I was\nthinking that they will kill him on the spot and we, all us, all of us together. He was not afraid.

        "Okay, tell me about when the women arrived from Auschwitz.\nWhen we arrived to Brinwitz and we found all the women are not there, we are very much\nsurprised, and we start to talk with Schindler, and I was also talking, he he knew my wife very well,\nand he says, \"I'm sorry to say, I don't know where the women. They supposed to left after ten or\ntwo weeks??? Plashow, and come over here. He start to looking at our friend to find out what\nhappened to to the women. He called probably the Krakow, and he found out that the women in\nAushwitz. He told us that the women are in Auschwitz. We are afraid that we never will saw her,\nmothers or wives or sisters. And we start to ask him. He says, \"I will try my best to do everything\npossible.\" And he got the idea to take the most beautiful German girl what he has in his camp, give\nher some gifts, Polish sausage, vodka, diamonds or --------- whatever, or rings or gold or\nsomething, and he sent her to Auschwitz to open the door for him so that he can come over and talk\nwith the Commandant Hess, who was Commandant of Auschwitz, who was famous for killing\n4,000 to 5,000 people a day, and the woman came in, she became a girlfriend, she was so beautiful,\nthat he couldn't resist it probably and give him a, but when Schindler came in, he told him, \"I don't\nknow what ------------------.\". He know is here about 35,000 women in the camp, where I can find\nit. \"You have to find, those are the most essential work for that uh war effort. You know what\nkind of trouble you will have, what kind of problem I will have when I will not get the workers\nback, their skill. I'll give you three hundred dollars a woman, you train them, is no time to train, we\nhave, those are already trained for 4 years, they know exactly what they doing, and they start to\nlook for the woman, they found the woman except one, mother of one of my friends, a Jewish\nfriend, already was murdered in Auschwitz. When they brought them over there from the uh uh\ntheir together place when they were sending the transport out, the Hess was asking how a girl 11\nyears old or the woman 60 years old can be excellent worker. Well, he says \"Look on the finger of\nthe old woman and on the little girl. You will see they have a long, skinny finger. They can clean\nthe boxes so good that nobody else can clean them. And he got 299 woman, and one day in\nNovember, early in the morning, about 6 o clock in the morning, on a foggy day, the big gate of the\nfactory opened, and we see like on, like on that picture of the camp, this group of women coming in\na dark because they covered themselves with anything, they have blankets or something, coming in\nthe from the fog of the camp to the factory, and he stand there and wait for them, greet them and\nsays, \"And now you are with me. You don't have to worry about anything. Hot soup is waiting for\nyou.\"\nNow tell me about how long Schindler stayed with you, how you guys helped him.\nSchindler promised us that he will stay till 5 minutes after 12, that means, when the war will be",
        "over and we are secured, he will go away.",
        "Let's back up and start that again. Tell me why he had to be worried. Why was Schindler worried?\nOr why were you worried about Schindler at this time?",
        "You see, we were worry about Schindler in a, during the last month of war that when the Russian\nwill come in, we will be liberate by Russian, they didn't ask question. They shoot first and then ask\nthe question. When we didn't want him to get in the hands of the Russian because they will not\nhave any mercy on anybody, and German particular when they fi-find out that he was the owner of\nthe factory who was using the slave labor, so we decide that we will prepare getaway car for him\nand his group--his wife and his friends and who was there, what he wants to take with him, and we\nwould assign a group of our people will protect him and take him out from the camp, and five\nminutes after 12, 12 o clock midnight, on the, on the day of uh May the 8th, you know, between\nMay 7, May 8. After a while when we disarmed the, the, the Gestapo soldiers in the camp, he said,\n\"Now is my time to go.\" And (laughs), I remember one thing, that somebody cut the wire to the\ngas pump in his car.
