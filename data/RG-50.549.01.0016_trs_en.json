        "A: ...the past as much, you know, | try not to. So it's very hard and have some\nchronological, | mean | have some period after the war, certainly the early years, |\nhave more, very strong impressions and feelings than be able to tell you exactly what\nhappened at this and this time, you know, that kind of thing, so that's why questions\nhelp focus and put some structure in because | could probably talk for hours and it\nwouldn't, would be a little rambling, this is what I'm saying.",
        "Q: Life isn't so tidy.",
        "A: No, and life isn't tidy, but | mean people get, | mean | don't know whoever is going\nto listen to this, so it doesn't even matter, you know, but | guess if you're interested\nin facts, then you need to guide me to some extent to ,",
        "Q: Okay, let me start with the first fact because | actually need at the top of each side\nof the tape to have your name.",
        "A: My name, okay. So is it the beginning of the tape?",
        "Q: (Yes).",
        "A: Okay. Well my name is Anny, my official name is Anna Leiser and my married\nname is Kleinhaus, so my name is Anna Leiser Kleinhaus.",
        "Q: You say official name?",
        "A: Because I'm, people call me Anny and not Anna, so it's very strange when\nsomebody does call me Anna , although at work people do, they see my\nname and that's what they call me. So I'm used to being called Anny by my friends\nand relatives and so on. So that's my name.",
        "Q: | wanted to go back over a couple of things that struck me about the earlier\ninterview if you don't mind?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you used a whole, you had been given a series of names and\nyou'd also said that you didn't remember them all. Since the interview, have you\nremembered more of them?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well, | don't remember which ones | did remember at the time. But, one of them\nwas Anny, as a matter of fact, and that why it was so striking to see that book. One\nof them was Shalot(ph) Donrae(ph), | think at some point | must have had a name\nMarie, you know, to make me as Catholic as possible. That's about all | remember,\nso | don't know if those are the ones | said, but at least those three | remember.",
        "Q: So you started out life as Anna?",
        "A: Well, | actually started life as Hannala(ph), which is, my parents were both from\nPoland and they spoke Yiddish and Polish and certainly only gave me the name, let's\nsay, Anna because they had to have some official sounding European, | mean\nWestern European name. But, my Hebrew name was Hannah and, or is still Hannah,\nHannah , aS a matter of fact, and that was my maternal grandmother's\nname. Until, my mom died about six months ago, and she used to call me Hannala\nstill. So, that's how | started out. And then as a kid, as | went through the war, |\nguess they made it from Anna, Anny because that sounded more French when we\ngot into France. And then with all the various papers that my parents got, mostly my\nmother, | was with her most of the time, they came, the name came with the papers.\nSo if it was Marie, well, | was told, you know, you are now Marie, if it was Renee(ph),\nyou are Renee, if it's Charlotte, | think the last one was Charlotte, Charlotte Henri(ph),\nthat was the one before. And a very funny thing happened after the war, when my\nfather came back from concentration camp and my mother wanted him to meet the\npeople who had, they weren't officially hiding us because we were paying rent there\nsupposedly, but at least we were living there under false pretenses and | think they\nknew that we weren't exactly who we said we were. My mother wanted to meet those\npeople and they, so her name was, | can't remember what her name was, Tonree(ph)\nwas the last name, which is a very French name, and they called him Monsieur\nTonree when they first saw him, which was very funny. They never got used to the\nidea that we, actually even our names were not our names. And so that's the story\nof the name.",
        "Q: How did you go about unlearning one name and learning another one?",
        "A: Well, it was very difficult. It was very difficult. It was, | was very, very frightened\nmost of the time, | mean | was living in terror and | was so afraid that | would mix it\nup, you know, that | would just say, whatever the name was, was wrong, you know?\nSo I'd just try to concentrate, you know, and keep telling myself, you are now such-\nand-such. But! was very frightened, | mean there wasn't, it wasn't hard in the sense\nof, you know, these are names | could pronounce and | learned French very quickly,\nbut it was very hard emotionally. To not know from one day to the next who you were\nsupposed to be and make sure you remember the right, you know, the right person\nto be that particular time.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Were you ever afraid that you would forget your real name?",
        "A: | don't think | was thinking about that very much. | mean, the only concerns | had\nwas to survive, | think, | didn't think about, ahead very much, and the only concern\nabout, let's say ahead, was that my father should come back from Auschwitz, | didn't\nknow where he was, but that's where he turned out to be. That where my, those\nwere my concerns was to remain alive and to have a family, but not whether | would\nremember who | was or who | wasn't, that, you Know, | think inside of me, | knew very\nwell who | was. So that, | mean after awhile, even though | was very young, |\nunderstood that it was just necessity and that it didn't really change whoever | was.\nAnd | played the game, essentially. | went to church, you know, | played the game.\nYou know. Just knew this is what you have to do and that was that. You know, went\nfor communion to the priest and all that stuff. And at that time | must have been six\nor seven, you know, so, at the most. So | just did it, you know, and | knew it was a\ngame and | knew, you know, sometimes | said | wish | were Catholic because it would\nbe so nice, particularly wnen they had communion and they had the white dresses\nand, that | really envied, you know. And | did stand somewhat in awe of the church,\nyou know, it was extremely impressive, you know, when you go into a big church and\nthe priest stand there and, you know, pontificates and the music and so on. That\nwas impressive and | kind of wished | could identify with that whole thing, but as my\nmother told me and many people repeated to me, that at the age of four | already\nhad sort of taken leave of religion, you know, and didn't want to obey anything. So\nthat, basically, | think was sort of a refuge, it made me, in some ways, feel safe, you\nknow, if | could be part of that group, | would be safe. And | don't think it was, in\nretrospect, such a deep religious feeling as some sort of feeling of being protected,\nyou know, in church you were protected. And if you're part of that group, nothing\nhappened to you. So | think it was, you know, as a young kid, going with the children\nof the town and our neighbors, | mean our landlords, going to church on a Sunday, |\nwas, | felt extremely alienated, you know, in one aspect, and trying to play the game\nand like believing that maybe | was Catholic and | could be Catholic and | could just\nproceed, you know, from there on and not have to worry about being who | was. So\nit was all confusing.",
        "Q: Do you remember if you prayed?",
        "A: | can't remember that, | can't remember that. I, | mean | know all the prayers\nbecause | had to pretend, you know, but | don't, as | said, it's hard to be quite\nauthentic, but being, knowing the religious feelings that | don't harbor now, or the\nanti-religious feelings that | harbor and have, apparently, since really childhood,\naccording to my parents, it's hard to believe that | was swayed by anything more than\nthe sense of, this is going to protect me, you know, so maybe it's worth doing. But\nnot, | don't think | had, | certainly never believed in Jesus Christ or anything of the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nkind. | mean, that stuff was not believable, but, not that any other was, but | mean\nthis in particular, | found very hard to stomach, so, but as | said, the atmosphere and\nthe big voices and the, you know, the echoes in the church and all the people that\nlooked so, umm, you know, they looked very happy to be there and they looked like\nthey were participating and so on, and | was participating but knowing | was a fake,\nyou know, and, but | don't think | ever prayed to anybody with conviction. Never. So\n| don't think | did. But | did pray, because | certainly had to go to communion and say\nall the words and go to confession and confess to sins that | made up. You know,\nthings of that sort. So...",
        "Q: You were a performer?",
        "A: | think to some extent, but that was part of the game, you know, if | had to change\nnames, | had to change everything about myself, so I, but | knew it was fake, you\nknow, | never, | think, totally took on the other identity. | don't think | ever did, | mean\nwhoever | was, | mean | certainly got, I'm sure | got to some extent, you know,\ndamaged by this whole experience, but maybe not, not as much as, if one listens to\nthe scripture and you could expect somebody who would be much worse shape than\n|, | am, maybe, | think | was in pretty bad shape, actually, right after the war. | was\nreally in, but nobody had time to pay attention, so | just had to pull myself together, |\nthink that's what happened. | don't think anyone had the time to pay any attention to\nme. So | just had to survive, which | had learned, you Know, to survive. So, that's it.",
        "Q: That's the beginning.",
        "A: Yeah. But, it's very difficult, you know, | am a very successful person, | mean I,\nand when, that's why | don't like to go to reunions of hidden children anymore\nbecause | feel that maybe I'm just an elitist, you know, and that's all there is to it, but\n|, there are a lot of people who are still whining about this and it's, | don't, really don't\nwant to downplay it in any sense, but it's past and a lot of people have bad things\nhappen to them in life. And if you're going to just focus on those things, you're just\nnot going to get anywhere and I, | can't, | cannot go and sit there and talk about this\nover and over and over. And, you know, maybe it's denial for me which is, that's\npossible, too, | just don't want to deal with it anymore. | mean, I'm happy to tell you\nmy story, but | don't think that what's happening in my life now or let's say to a great\nextent, has that much to do with that experience. | think I've, | know myself pretty\nwell now and I, | can tell, you know, where things are coming from more than just\nblaming it all on the war and everything of that nature. So.",
        "Q: You're wearing, are those diamond earrings?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Are those from your family?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Yes. Well, they're actually, my husband gave them to me, but all our families are\nin diamonds, so, | mean both my parents and his parents were both into diamonds,\nso that's Antwerp for you.",
        "Q: One of the things | was curious about reading your family history, your father's\nhistory, is that you're feeling toward diamonds now, because you had talked about\nhow, when you fled, your mother took the diamonds and threw them out the window.\nThat's quite a dramatic image.",
        "A: Yeah, | always try to, you know, save some, to try and sell them and that's all they\nhad, was diamonds. They had nothing, no property, no money really to speak of, but\nthe diamonds that they were dealing with, they could try and sell to survive. So,\nthat's...",
        "Q: So the ones in your ears aren't part of that pile\u2019?",
        "A: No. They're not. |, | didn't, there is nothing, | mean the only diamonds actually\nthat survived the war, was my mother's engagement ring, but no, my in-laws, actually,\nbecause they came here, so they, they fled, but they fled as a family and they didn't\nreally go through any camps or anything, so whatever they took with them they,\nexcept for what they had to spend to bribe officials along the way to survive, they\ncame with quite a bit of diamonds with them, so my mother-in-laws jewelry that she\ngave me along the years, those are really pre-war, many of them. My mother didn't\nhave that much to begin with and she didn't, she wasn't able to keep much of it and\nso, the only thing is her engagement ring, that's the only thing that actually survived\nthe war and | have that. So, that's pretty nice. So.",
        "Q: Do you wear it?",
        "A: No. No, | put that away. | have my own engagement ring, which | actually very\nrarely wear. So, and my mom just passed away, you know, and it's very hard for me\nto take her jewels and put it on, | just put them away someplace. And | think, my\ndaughter isn't married and if she does, at some point, | want to give it to her. Because\nshe was very close to my mother so | would give it to her. So...",
        "Q: You had talked about being in the children's home and the sweet potatoes or the\nsweet potato-like things.",
        "A: Ah, please.",
        "Q: All right, I'm not going to ask quite about that, but you said there was a song about\nit and | was wondering of you remembered the song?",
        "A: Umm, yes, there was a song that just came back to me not too long ago which\nhad to do with getting up in the morning and having to go wash. How was that?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n[Singing in French]. So that was a song to get our, [French phrase], which is\nwhatever. And [French phrase] was, is that sweet potato or whatever it is, | don't\nknow if | remember that song. It will come back maybe. If | think about it, it won't,\nbut it might just spring up at some point. There's a fellow that lives in Antwerp who\nis my childhood friend and he's now the only one alive because his parents died just\nover the last two years, they were in their 80's and his sister, unfortunately, was a\nvery good friend of mine, and she died at age 21 in childbirth, so he's the only, and\nhe seems to have a better memory than | do for these things. | mean, he actually\nwent back to the place where we had been hidden and looked up the priest who had\nbeen in charge of the place and it apparently has not turned into some kind of a hotel\nor inn and...",
        "Q: Where is this?",
        "A: This is in Von Deen(ph), which is in the Pyrenees and he recognized it, he said he\nreally did and he took some pictures and he showed me. | don't think | remember it\nquite as well as he does. And we're the same age, so it's not a matter, he's six\nmonths older, so it's not a matter, | think | just tuned out a lot of it. Just tuned it out,\nit was just too awful. So | don't think | would really recognize it.",
        "Q: You were, until you were 10, you were the only child, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you feel more responsibility because you were the only one?",
        "A: Towards?",
        "Q: Toward your mother, for example. Responsibility to kind of keep alive and keep\ngoing?",
        "Q: Well, | think I, | took a lot of responsibility on, for that friend of mine who, because\nwe were together and she was two years younger and as | was, | would say\nessentially, anorectic(ph) and she, but not anorectic in terms of throwing up, but just\nwouldn't eat, | mean | was just not interested in food, but not that | had an image of\nbeing fat or what goes along with anorexia these days, just, just so distraught that |\ncouldn't eat. But she on the contrary, being upset, she wanted to eat more, every\ntime, So we were the opposite and we would go in the kitchen and steal food for her\nat night and so | was, | felt very responsible for her. | don't think | felt responsible for\nmy mother or to stay alive for any other reason than | just wanted to be alive. You\nknow, not for any particular reason. No, | don't think, | think, | can't remember if my\nmother, you know, felt or made me feel very safe, | can't say that. | think | did feel\nabandoned quite frequently because she was gone a lot. So I, no, | don't think there\nwas any consideration of my mother, of me doing something for her, protecting her,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n| think it was clearly the opposite. Even though | didn't feel that protected by her, |\nfelt more protected by playing the Catholic girl and going to church with our\nneighbors. You know, | felt a lot more safe than being with her. And in some ways,\nwhen she didn't learn, she didn't know French very well and she learned it, you know,\non the run and she had a pretty heavy accent, even though she learned the language,\nand so | didn't feel comfortable with her. | mean, | sort of thought she was going to\nget us into trouble more than anything else. And |, | don't know if | said that on the\ntape, but | was very nasty, | mean | was extremely nasty, and you know, just plain\nold angry. And | threatened the people that she used to put up with the denouncing\nthem to the Germans, thinking they're not going to catch me because I'm this French\ngirl, you Know. But they'll catch you. And scaring people to death, you know, just\nscaring them to death. And it was silly, | mean | was this six year old, | really wasn't\ngoing to go up to, and | knew that | was never going to do that and | knew that | was\njust as, as much in danger as they were, but | could go out and pretend to be whoever\n| was and they couldn't. You know, they didn't know the language or they didn't\nappear to be totally French, you know, and also | would really torture them, make\nthem feel very sad. Some of them have, you know, they're all dying out now, but\nthey reminded me of that frequently as | went back to visit my mother, which | did\nfrequently. So, | was not a nice person, not a nice kid, | mean just not at all. Not at\nall. And you're interested in what's happening after the war, so after the war, in\nschool, | mean | was an absolute terror. | mean, a completely uncontrollable terror.\nAnd, but | was smart, you know, and | knew | could get away with it because our\nclass was made up of just really the dregs of the earth and, you know, people of all\nages speaking different languages.",
        "Q: Where was this?",
        "A: That was in Belgium, so we went back to Belgium.",
        "Q: To Antwerp?",
        "A: Yeah. And so | went to, so there was a Jewish school which had been flourishing\nbefore the war, but at that point it was just sort of in shambles and the teachers were\nthemselves survivors and nothing that relates to modern pedagogical methods had\nreached the shores, even among the non-Jewish teachers, | mean they were still\npretty much versed in ancient methods of discipline and, and as | said, the class was\nmade up for, of all kind so of people, all kinds of ages and some spoke just\nand some spoke Polish and some spoke Hungarian and some, you\nknow, it was just really the Tower of Babel and, but | knew French and that was a big\nadvantage and...",
        "Q: How many languages did you know then?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well then, | knew, | don't know what | knew because | grew up in Yiddish and\nPolish and | learned French really well, so at least those three | Knew. But | didn't get\nto practice that, those that much, | mean | went to school and it was French, so |\nspoke French at school and then they taught me Hebrew, they started to in that\nschool and, you know, | just had great ease of learning so they used to parade me in\nfront of, you know, they were trying desperately to get money for the school and so\nthe donors came and, you know, you have to parade the monkeys in front of them,\nso they, | was their monkey, you know, they knew that they could rely on me for giving\nthe right answers and reading and doing all these things to see their wonderful\nmethods of teaching and so | would really take advantage of that. | mean, | knew\nthis was a game for them, you know, it was a great thing to have somebody to show\nand | would just totally, totally not follow any rules. | would jump on the desks and |\nwould be, you know, when there was no inspection, when they came for inspection |\nperformed, | did everything according to what they expected me to do, but as soon\nas they left, you know, these donors and inspectors and whatnot, | would just go wild,\njust wild. In fact, a couple of, about six months, well eight months ago, | was in\nBelgium visiting my mother, just a week before she died, and we went to a go-away\nparty for my uncle who is also 80-something and who moved to Israel with his family.\nSo my mother and | went to it and one of my Hebrew teachers from that time was\nthere and a very strange thing happened because | had not seen the man in, oh\nprobably 30 years, and he came up and he says, \"Is that you?\" And | said, \"Yes\".\nAnd he says, \"You know, look at my gray hair, you did this to me\". He said, well me\nand, you know, a couple of years. But then, so we talked awhile, then it was really\nfunny because his daughter was there and she said, \"| don't know how he recognized\nyou because he's blind and he doesn't see anything\". Because | couldn't tell, you\nknow, | saw him and | greeted him and just from the voice, or | don't know what, |\nmean it was very funny, very funny. So | really made an impression on this man.",
        "Q: What language was the school taught in since people spoke so many languages?",
        "A: Well see, it had been, this is before the uproar, this is just at the time when the\nuproar began between Flemish and French in Belgium, so, and this school had been\na private school, it was a private day school just like there are some here, and so we\nwere taught in French, which is, that was it, we had to be taught in French and the\nHebrew teachers taught without speaking any other language essentially. There was\nnot translation, you were taught the alphabet and that's, now kids learn very quickly,\nthey really do. | mean, all this bilingual crap is crap, it's ridiculous. Because we came\nfrom so many different parts and we all learned French in a matter of months. | mean,\n| Knew it but everybody spoke French in a matter of months. Even just, and as | said,\nwe did not have sophisticated teaching methods or language labs or anything, it was\njust. When you know you have to, you learn.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Were you aware that the war had ended?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes, absolutely.",
        "Q: How did you become aware of that?",
        "A: Well, for one, in France they had this incredible celebration, Victory Day, so there\nwas no, no avoiding knowing it.",
        "Q: Do you remember that day?",
        "A: Not in great detail, | just remember more of an impression of people jumping in the\nstreets and music and dancing and, but | was, you know, an eight year old, | mean |\ncan't remember details, | just remember that everybody was just elated and then we\ntook down the, we had these black blankets on the windows because we had\ncurfews, so you know, the light wouldn't go out, wouldn't shine in the street, we took\noff all of that.",
        "Q: Who's we?",
        "A: My mother and | who lived in that place.",
        "Q: Which was in?",
        "A: In Exleba(ph), Exleba, and the neighbors, you know, were all so happy because\nthe neighbor, the man, had been in World War | and he had been injured, in fact, in\nWorld War | and he had no love for the Germans at all, so he was, you know, very,\nvery happy, even though in this war they didn't suffer that much. He was too old to\njoin and he was, anyway, he was injured, so he was really, really, really happy. And\nthen, so that's, you know, how we found out. | mean, the radios and everybody was\njust extremely, extremely excited. So there was just a joy in the streets and\neverybody, people pouring out from every house, apartment, in the streets, there was\njust thousands of people even though it was a small town, it looked to me like, you\nknow, thousands of people. | really don't know how many they were. So that's,\nessentially, what | remember. And | remember then, somehow, my mother getting\nnotice that my father had returned. And leaving me there to go find him. So she left\nme with those neighbors and so that, | remember that and | remember when she\ncame for me, she had actually found him and we went back and that trip was\nhorrendous. And it was in a truck, you know, just one of those trucks with, not even\ncovered, but some sort of tarp cover, that's it, and we traveled from there and it took\ndays and days and days. | don't Know who was driving the truck, | have no idea.\nAnd it just, see, certain stupid things, | mean, I, | was still very nasty and very angry\nand at some stop there was nothing to drink except beer and | said that | would rather\ndie than drink beer, you know, just as a, who knows why? You know, | mean if you're\nreally, really thirsty you'll drink beer and | was thirsty, but | said | would rather die than\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ndrink beer. And | don't like beer to this day, so | mean, why? Who knows? Justa\nstupid, you know, detail that comes to mind. And so we went back.",
        "Q: You went back to where?",
        "A: To Antwerp and the place we had lived in was pretty much destroyed, so, in Exleba\nwe had met a woman who had two children who was from Antwerp as well. And she\nowned a house and her husband had been deported and she didn't know whether\nhe would come back or not, but she had a house with several floors and she said\nthat she, we could come and live in her place, you know, for rent. And so we did.\nWe moved, my mother, my father, myself, moved to that, we moved to the ground\nfloor of the house that had three flights. It was like one of these railroad houses, very\nskinny, everything was one room behind the other. And there was no running water,\n| remember that very well. There was no central heat. So we had to pump the water.\nAnd we had a coal stove to do everything, basically. And at first, when we first got\nback, my parents and | went to a sort of an inn in the Ardennes(ph), which is the hilly\npart, they call it mountains, but in reality it's just hills, hilly part of Belgium and | think\nthat was the only time in his life that my father ate non-kosher food.\n[end of side 1 of tape 1].",
        "Q: Okay. It's the only time in his life your father ate non-kosher food?",
        "A: Yeah. And it was really to get him back on his feet. | mean, he accepted that, it\nwas a necessity, there was no kosher food and he needed to just get back on his\nfeet. So, we went, | think originally it was supposed to be for a month, but no sooner\nwe were there, my mother took off and she went to Antwerp because there were\nmany people who were getting married who had been separated during the war and\ngot together and she went to cook for weddings. Not for money, you know, just out\nof, you know, community feeling. And so she left us and she would come back and\nforth. You know, she would be doing all these charity, volunteer and whatever kind\nof works, so she didn't stay the full month, but my dad and | did. And then we went\nand moved into this place that | told you about.",
        "Q: I'm just curious, when you saw your father, you hadn't seen him, for a time you\ndidn't know if you would see him, you had been very close to him.",
        "A: | had been extremely close, so that was a terrible disappointment, terrible, terrible\ndisappointment because, well, what you remember as a three or four year old from\nyour father is very different from the way you see him at age eight or nine, particularly\nsince there hasn't been a progression, you know. So, and | was extremely\ndisappointed because he was extremely orthodox and wanted me to be that way.\nAnd extremely rigid in his, the practice of religion where, you know, he wouldn't allow\nme to turn on the light on the Sabbath, | mean he was extremely, extremely,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nextremely strict and rigid and | could not abide by this. | just could, | didn't believe in\nit and | kept telling him that | didn't see how, after what he's gone through, he could\nstill believe in this sort of stuff. And so there was really a crack in our relationship\nbecause of that. You know, he tried, on other fronts. | mean, my father was not an\neducated man and he would make an effort and take me to the movies and | know\nthat this was not something that he would have done normally, this is something he\nreally did to try and regain some, some closeness with me. | mean, I'm sure he\nmissed it, too, but he just didn't know how to go about it. And | think in some ways,\nhe was soiled, you know, as far as, why did he let himself be taken? Why didn't he,\nwhy wasn't he the strong man | thought he was in, you know, protecting us all and\nwhy did he just disappear? | mean, he just, he was supposed to meet us Somewhere\nand he never showed up. You know, and at that time, | think | had this certain\nresentment towards him for being my fallen hero, you know, why didn't, why didn't\nyou protect us and why were you gone and why were you, come back in such a\ndecrepit state, you know, you look terrible and, you Know, you can't really be my\nstrong father. You know, so | had a lot of that. And | don't think | could tell him, |\nreally couldn't, the only fights that we openly had was about religion. And | think |\nthen channeled everything into absolutely refusing to have anything to do with the\nreligion because | got, you know, it was a little inconsistent, like angry at God like for\nallowing this to, and then somebody who allows this to happen, can't exist, just can't\nbe. So that was the end of my religious, and we fought about that for a very, very\nlong time. Through my teens it was really bad, really bad because there were very\nfew of us left, for one, of children my age who returned to Antwerp. And the majority\nof them were not observant and so, | mean their families weren't, and by forcing me\nto, you know, stay in on the Sabbath and not being able to go to the movies like\nSaturday afternoon, | was cut out from a lot of social activities, as well, so | resented\nthat terribly, terribly, so | was really angry as an adolescent. | mean, on top of\neverything else, | was not a, not a happy camper in my youth. Not at all. So | don't\nthink | ever, | mean now, you know, my father has been dead for 20 years or more, |\ncan understand what he was about and how strong he actually had been to survive\nthis and to be able to rebuild a family and bring his entire family, his entire surviving\nfamily to live with us after having gone through hell himself. And making money just\nto, you know, feed all these brothers and sisters, | mean two brothers, a sister and\nhis father moved in with us, into that place what didn't have water. His father, a sister\nand two brothers, right. You know, and | just resented that awfully, | mean | wasn't,\nnot charitable at all.",
        "Q: How long had you been reunited with your father before the rest of his family\ncame?",
        "A: Not that long because a few, when my parents, my brother was born in May, '46,\nso maybe a year or less after they had been reunited. And that family, | think, moved\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nin with, my brother was clearly an infant, so | don't know if they moved in just before\nor, he was born, or right after, so that's not clear in my mind. But they, my father\nfound some smuggler and he paid him a lot of money to go and rescue whoever was\nleft.",
        "Q: Where were they?",
        "A: Well, they were actually in Siberia. They made it to Siberia from Poland. And |\ndon't know how he found out about it, | really don't know.",
        "Q: That was going to be my next question.",
        "A: | don't know, but they, they were people coming from various places and they tried\nto find people who were from the same villages that they had been and then they\nwould, | think it's just word of mouth. On the other hand, they knew, since my father\nhad been in Belgium since 1933, his family knew that, at least he had been in\nBelgium, they didn't know whether he, where he went during the war of if he had\never, if he had stayed or if he had returned, if he hadn't stayed. So | think they might\nhave tried to contact the, you know, Jewish Refugee Agency and that sort of thing.\nSo it was probably a little bit word of mouth, a little bit through official channels, you\nknow, Jewish or something like that. | would imagine that that's how\nthey found each other. Because they knew at least to look for him in Belgium where\nhe didn't know where to look for them at all.",
        "Q: So less than a year, obviously, if your brother was born in '46?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: After you got together as a family, suddenly the family dynamic changed.",
        "A: Entirely. What are you doing here? Sylvan(ph)?\n[Greetings exchanged between parties in the room and someone who came in --\ntape turned off briefly].",
        "A: So, yeah the dynamics changed completely from being a family with just one child,\nto a family with two children and uncles and aunts and grandfather, to boot. And |\nfelt that my mother was completely unavailable to me, essentially. Because she was\ncompletely hassled, | mean, but again, | can see that now and as an adult, but as a\nchild, | didn't see that at all. | mean, it was just like now you get this stupid baby and\nall these other people living with us, you know, and now then we could maybe be\nhappy or, you know, have, you're not there. And then she was running all her\nvolunteer activities on top of everything else.",
        "Q: So tell me what it was like, you're, what, 10 years old or something?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Yeah, about 10.",
        "Q: And you've got a home without running water, with all sorts of people, many of\nwhom you've never met before.",
        "A: Yeah, most of them.",
        "Q: And you had said earlier, that this was a time when you really needed attention\nand you really didn't have it.",
        "A: Yeah, that's true, | didn't have any. At least, | felt | didn't have any, I'm sure that |\ndid have, you know, | mean my basic needs were taken care of, | mean | had food\non the table and | had clothes and | went to school and | even, well | don't Know if in\nthat apartment, a little later, | got piano lessons because | was dying to play the piano.\nSo they bought me some kind of secondhand upright piano which | still remember.",
        "Q: Do you still play?",
        "A: Not much, no, | always say I'm going to go back to it, but, | used to play quite well,\nbut | didn't really pursue that very much, after 15 or 16 years of age | gave up. So\nagain, it was a matter of feeling, you know, in that first place, it was a railroad house,\nas | said, so the kitchen was all the way in the front, behind it was something which\nwas more, was the dining room | would say, and then in the back of it was a living\nroom that wasn't used at all, and then in the back of it was a bedroom. And the first,\n| don't know whether months, how long, but the first, for sure, month that we lived\nthere, my parents and | slept in one bed and the bed used to collapse. It was\nextremely frightening. It was, | don't know what it was made of, it was some cheap\nwood bed and it would just collapse and we would find each other, you know, on the\nfloor. And my father had these incredible nightmares and he would be screaming,\naside from that. And | had my own nightmares. So it was a nightmare, it was hell,\nabsolute hell. And then, again, | can't say for, it's six months or a year, they bought\nme some kind of bed where | was in the so-called dining room and the family, the\nadditional, the uncles and aunts and that group, moved to the third floor, so we had\nthe first, ground floor, the family, the owners, had the floor right on top of us, the\nowner's husband did not come back from the war, so she was with two children by\nherself, so she needed the rent, and then the top floor was for the two uncles, the\naunt and the grandfather. But food was all at our house, everything, laundry, food,\neverything. Without refrigerator, without any, you know, fancy appliance of any kind,\nso in some ways, in some ways it was almost worse than during the war. Because\nduring the war, | had some kind of stability, | mean for the last couple of years when\n| lived in that house in Exleba, as | said, | was in terror but it was, to some extent |\nhad accommodated to the terror. There was not that much unpredictable that was\nhappening. We had our air raids and we'd run off and go to the shelters, by that time\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n| had one name and that didn't change any more and | had some sort of routine. And\nmy mother, when she was there, was there for me, there was no, she had all these\npeople that she was hiding and so on, but still, | felt that she was there, you know, for\nme. We would go to the beach together on occasion and we would do things\ntogether, whatever they were. But then she disappeared, essentially. She was\ndiluted so much to such an extent that in some ways, | felt more abandoned than\nduring the war, even though | wasn't afraid for my life. | mean, and so my, | think a\nlot of that anger was due to the fact that | was just lost, you know, just, it felt like | was\nto take care of myself plus take care of my brother. Which | had to do, | mean | had\nto babysit for him and, because we couldn't afford any help, and my mother was just\nunable to do everything, she was doing care for my brother, you know,\nday and night, so when | came home from school, | mean | had to watch my brother,\n| had to, | learned how to cook very early because | had to help for, you know, for\nmaking a meal for Friday night for 10 people without, you know, appliances, | mean\non a coal stove and it was a Friday night and for Saturday lunch and for Saturday\nevening before you could turn on the lights again. | mean, that sort of, so | had to\npitch in, come home from school Friday early and help my mother or watch my\nbrother or both and | didn't have much time to be a kid, you know. Just not much\ntime. But, the lady who rented the place had two children and one boy was about a\nyear or two older than | was at the time and he and | had become really good friends\nin the war and sort of partners in crime, you know, we could think of every possible\nmischief and we would just do it. And so we continued that. And we established, he\nwas very mechanically gifted, in fact, he's an aeronautics engineer for Israel, for the\nIsrael government, so that really panned out. And we would just build things and\nwe'd build some kind of telephone between his bed and mine and we'd go to the,\nthere was a flea market every Sunday morning and we'd go and we'd buy all these\ncomponents and we'd build radios and so dolls was really not my thing. It was erector\nsets and radios and that sort of thing. So he had a tremendous influence on me.\nUnfortunately, he left for Israel when, | mean he and his mother and sister left when\nhe was about 13, so that was a terrible loss. And we used to, we were inseparable,\ninseparable, but we also would fight.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Bobby, Bobby Ackleman(ph). | don't know what they call him now in Israel, but,\nand he, we would fight and he was stubborn and | was stubborn, and so we wouldn't\ntalk for weeks on end, and we'd go to school together and we'd walk one behind the\nother, without exchanging a word. And then we'd wait for each other to go home, we\nwouldn't say a word. It's very funny. We had a lot of imaginary games and then we'd,\nwe'd build swords, swords out of wood, and shields and paint them. And my favorite\nbook was the Three Musketeers, and so | would read that over and over and over\nagain. And so we'd play the Musketeers and we'd have sword fights and, so | had a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ngood time, | mean it's not like | was completely miserable at all times, but | think | was\nvery troubled, you know, a very troubled person.",
        "Q: Which Musketeer were you?",
        "A: | think | was , you know. And we had an area not far from the house,\nwhich now is really built up, but it was, they called it in Flemish, the Barta(ph), which\nis like the countryside, you know, and it was really very rural, there was nothing, there\nwere some old fortifications from World War | and we'd use those, you know, to hide\nand play and have war games and really not very, you know, pacifist type of, but\nmostly like little boy's games, you know.",
        "Q: You had mentioned that when you were very young, your father treated you as if\nyou were a son.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And | think that carried through. But, in addition, because that little girl,\nImogene(ph), my friend, | gave her my doll and carriage that they bought for me, |\njust had zero interest in it. Even when I, even before the war, you know, for my\nparents to buy something like that was a tremendous financial sacrifice and | had\nabsolutely no interest, none. So, but having this kind of a friend reinforced the entire,\n| mean | wasn't just passively doing what he was doing, but | really enjoyed it, | really\nenjoyed those games. And, but he was great because he was so mechanically gifted\nand he, apparently, didn't have a better friend, you know, a male friend, so | just had\nto do, basically. And | think he was, you know, | think we were mutually, you know,\nin love with each other. | mean, we only, because when he left for Israel, he used to\nsend me these terribly, you know, sad letters and how he missed me and, which was\nnot his type at all because he was very withdrawn and very noncommunicative with\nother people. Very, very closed person except with me, you know, and we met when\nwe were six or seven years old. And | haven't spoken to him in a few years, but | had\nabout six, seven years ago | did call him up when | was in Israel because | don't have\na lot of time when | go there. Mostly, because I'd like to see him, but, and | think he\nstill likes me a lot, you know. It was clear, at some point | came, when | was about\n17 or so and he was, at that time, he must have been 19 and then he showed some\ninterest in me which | could not respond to. You know, | just wasn't, | mean | loved\nhim as a kid and | love him still as a friend, but | wasn't interested in him romantically\nand he was, you know, so | think that sort of, | don't know, | guess by now it doesn't\nmatter any more, but there was a time when there was a break, we couldn't really\ncommunicate because | didn't want to hurt him and so we just left it.",
        "Q: So all these relatives who were living up on the third floor, they didn't help at all,\nthey didn't do anything?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you, you know, they, my aunt, she's still alive, | could show you a\npicture of them, | can show them to you before the war and after the war, it's very\ntelling. My aunt was a very depressed person and, you know, in those very orthodox\nfamilies, you had to get married young, if you didn't, it was terrible. So her years\nwhere she should have been married, passed, you know, and she was not very\nattractive at that point and she was very bitter, very bitter person. And a depressed\nperson, so | don't, she acted as if my mother was her mother, but my mother was just\na few years older than she was and had gone through hell herself and had a family.\nShe really expected my mother to do for her. And my mother did. So | don't think\nshe helped a lot, at all. The men, my father, you know, paid for their apprenticeships\nto become diamond cutters and diamond whatever, but one uncle then took that on,\nso, and he wasn't going to help in the household, | mean that's just unheard of. And\nto be honest, he worked long, long hours. | mean, he would take diamonds home\nand he would have the machine at home and he would work 12, 13 hours, so you\ncouldn't expect him to do a lot. Not that he knew how anyway, but it wasn't part of\nthe culture, but he wasn't just sitting there and doing nothing. | mean, and the other\nuncle, had been a teacher and so he tried to learn diamonds, but he really wasn't\ngifted and so he got a job in the school, that Hebrew school. And so he remained a\nteacher until his retirement. And my parents, my grandfather was in his 60's and he\nreally, certainly wasn't going to help in the household, he did try and do odd jobs to\nearn a few dollars here and there, | mean franks, it wasn't dollars, but he wasn't a\nparasite in the sense of sitting at home and hoping to be catered to, but in essence,\nculturally, you expected a daughter-in-law to take care of the father-in-law, you know,\nthe father. And he did try, he started a little business of, he would wrap packages\nand take them to the post office for people who would send food and gifts and\nwhatever to Israel, you Know, people who had re-established contact with relatives\nwho were from their country, from their town and they would send them food or\nwhatever, clothes, whatever they could save and gather. And so he would pick it up\nat their houses and he would wrap it up and he would ship it. And he got a little\ncommission for doing that, so, you know, he was trying to participate in some ways\nfinancially, you know, even if it was just to buy himself, you know, his own pocket\nmoney to buy himself some clothes and things of that nature. So it's not that he was,\nthat they were mean or bad people, they just came from a culture where it was, |\nmean their mother had eight kids, so it was not, you know, that's what they were used\nto and they were all trying to do something to better themselves and to get\nthemselves on their feet and financially independent. And they did. And they all got\nmarried, my mother married them all. And had a lot of kids, each of them had, | think\nthree was the minimum, so they had three, three and four, these people had, so...",
        "Q: How do you feel about these people?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well, now | love them, really, | do. | love their kids, | mean I'm very close to some\nof them, not all of them. | got to love them, you know, as | grew up and |, my\nresentment sort of disappeared.",

        "Q: And the bitter one got married off?",
        "A: She did and it was, my mother was very heavy after my brother's, having my\nbrother. And she used to go to a seamstress, sort of, who would make clothes,\ncustom, | mean people did that in Europe anyway, but she was a very good\nseamstress because my mom really didn't look that great and so she had very, you\nknow, very well made clothes and that part | remember. She took my aunt and she\nwanted to dress her in that same fancy place and this lady was very, very arrogant,\nelegant, French lady, and she took a look at her and she said, \"But Madame Leiser,\nwhat are you going to do with her?\" And my mother said, \"Marry her\". She said,\n\"Well, | wish you a lot of luck\". But she did, she married her off. And I'm not saying\nthat it was the happiest marriage ever, but it was probably the best that she could\nexpect, being from that culture and this background and everything she'd gone\nthrough.

        "A: Okay. Well, my uncle, the one | just mentioned, his name is Heim(ph), his wife is\nLilly, and he was the teacher. Raised his children in Belgium, but when they reached\ncollege age, two of them moved to Israel, the two girls, and | don't remember if the\nboy did or, | don't think so. He went to performing arts school, to the great chagrin of\nhis father and his mother who really wanted him to be a lawyer or a doctor, a teacher,\nsomething, not an artist. Little did they know that he'd be really famous. And so they\nare now very proud of him. His name is Moshelle(ph) Leiser. And he keeps his,\nMoshelle, this is how he appears in records he's made and everything he stages, he\nkeeps his Hebrew name. He doesn't have another one.

He's not getting old and not, he's not well my uncle, and so his\ndaughters wanted him to move near them. And so he did, | mean they both. And |\nthink they are quite happy. They have done the move.

        "Q: You had been going to Catholic church.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "Q: What were your religious feelings at this point? Did you just suddenly say, okay,\n| don't have to do this anymore, I'm Jewish and my name is Anny.",
        "A: Yeah, | said, | don't have to do any of this anymore. Not this, not the other. And\nthat's where, you know, some of the fights started with my dad. My grandfather was\nextremely orthodox, too, so the entire household became, in fact, being Catholic was\neasy because there's nothing you have to do. You could eat whatever you want,\nyou'd go to church, but it's, you know, an act of presence, | mean you show up, that's\nit, doesn't matter much. But here all of a sudden, there are all these rules and you\ncan't do this and you can't do that and Friday night you have to rush and take your\nbath, and in turns, eight people, there is no tub, so you're just washing in some kind\nof the zinc tubs, you know. | mean, | hated this. And my mother, you know, being\nunder such pressure to finish it all on time and that made me crazy, that she had to\nrush and | would then drag it out, you Know, as long as possible to make everybody\nangry, you know. And the pressure, the tension was just unbearable in the\nhousehold, you know, until they lit those candles and everybody sort of sigh of relief,\nyou know. It's all done. And then, of course, the only person who had to continue\nworking through this was my mother because she had to serve the food and wash\nthe dishes. Finally, after perhaps a year, we hired somebody to come and do the\ndishes Friday night and to clean the house, things started improving and after they\nall got married, we moved to a different place. We moved to an apartment which, at\nthe time, well, there were other feelings, there were feelings of jealousy for people,\nmy friends, Leon(ph) and Regine(ph) and their parents, who had, we had been\ntogether for part of the war, but they had made it to Switzerland. And so they came\nback and they hadn't gone through the rest of it and they were much better off\nfinancially because the father hadn't been in concentration camp and they didn't have\nto take in the entire family, they just took in my mother's friend's mother and so, they\nmoved to a very nice place with hot water and a bathtub and | was extremely jealous.\n| was so jealous. And | kept saying, you know, if we didn't have all these people here,\nmaybe we could move and have a nicer life. And | mean, | made no bones about\nthat, as | said, | was not charitable in the least. And then when they moved out, we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ndid move to a better place. It was not as nice as what these people had, but at least\n| had the semblance of my own room and we had a tub, one bathroom for the, for the\nfour of us, the five of us, my father, my grandfather, my mom, my dad and my brother\nand |, but that was a tremendous improvement over what had been. And at that time,\nall these people still used to come for most Friday nights with their spouses and they\nused to come for all the holidays. And in reality it was very nice, even though it was\na lot of work, but then we had help, | mean we had a cleaning woman and my mother\nhad hired, by then my brother was, you know, maybe four or five or something, she\nhad hired sort of a nanny, not really a nanny, but she would come every afternoon\nand pick him up from kindergarten and, you Know, come home and feed him a snack\nand she would stay til dinnertime, she wouldn't stay til after, but she would stay until\ndinnertime. And she'd come Friday nights and do the dishes when we had 20 people\nfor dinner and she'd do them on Saturday. And all the Saders(ph) and all that stuff\nwas all with my mother, everything. And when the babies started appearing, those\nfamilies, it was all still with us. But | didn't resent it any, you know, it was, | think it\nwas controlled. You know, it was just for holidays and things like that, so |, | actually,\n| began to like them, | began to babysit for their kids.",
        "Q: Did you go to services, then, Friday night and Saturday morning?",
        "A: No Friday night orthodox people don't go, only men. Women don't go. So my\nfather used to go. Saturday morning, no. Actually, orthodox women don't go\nSabbath either. They only go on the high holidays and all the other holidays were,\nthey don't really, there's some, very few women go to services in the orthodox\ncommunity. What they do is usually they go pick up their husband as he comes out.\nSo they get all dressed up and they go pick up their husband and then they'd go for\na walk in the park. There's a park in Antwerp, just the central park of Antwerp, and\nyou'd see everybody parading in their new hats and new clothes. And | hated that.\n| absolutely hated it. And at that point, somewhere around the age of nine or ten, |\ntold my mother that | wasn't going to be like her. | was going to be entirely\nindependent and | wasn't going to have a man give me money every week. Which\nis what happened. My mother would get an allowance, essentially, to run the\nhousehold and there were numerous arguments about that. And she always got\nwhat she wanted, and she would lie because she gave a lot of it to charity, but see,\nhe didn't know that. So she would say, well, | bought myself a dress for, you know,\na thousand dollars or something ridiculous and he could say, \"What! You know,\nwhere did you have an idea that you could afford a dress for a thousand dollars?\"\nAnd she would say, \"Well, you know, | needed it\". Or something like that, and then\nthey would argue like crazy and then he would give her, I'm making up a number,\nshe probably never bought a dress for a thousand dollars, but the equivalent now,\nlet's say, and he would sort of shake his head and, you know, couldn't believe it. But\nshe would give the money away, you know, she would send it to this relative and that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nrelative and she would give it away locally, | mean, so and | told her that | was never,\nnever in a million years, going to be like, in that situation. At age nine or ten. And |\nsaid on top of that | would never get married because that just didn't look right to me.\nNone of this looked right to me. And | remember my mother's friend saying, \"Well,\nit's, you know, you just have to know how to work that situation\". You know, they\nwere all in the same situation and they had really nice husbands, but they all had to\nargue to get the money so, you know, whatever the husbands evaluated the\nexpenses to be, they kind of doubled or tripled them, for whatever reasons. And\nthey'd have their own little, you Know, savings aside that they had accumulated from\ntheir husband's weekly allowance. And I'll tell you, when | got married, my mother-\nin-law told me to do this. But | wasn't in that framework at all. But she told me, you\nknow, put away money of your own, just don't tell him, just put it away. We were both\nstudents, there was no way that anybody had any money to put away. But it was\nsuch a strange concept, you know, that | just couldn't go along with that.",

        "A: But she really wasn't, you see, that was the point, the only place where she didn't\nhave the independence was financial because she told not to work for pay. And\nprobably she couldn't have, | mean first of all, she wasn't trained in anything\nparticular. Although, she could have been anything she had wanted to had she had\na formal education because she was really brilliant. But, she didn't have it and she\nconsidered her role to be the social worker, essentially. And that's what she was.\nAnd she was that for the entire community, | mean she, she passed away in January\nand | went, well, | was there a lot before that, but | went back in March, they had a\nmemorial service for her. The Vitsa(ph) organization, which is the sort of like the\nHaddasah(ph), it's a similar, she had been president of that, organized a memorial in\nMarch. And had very prominent people come and speak and made incredible\nspeeches about, and | found out things about her that | didn't even know. Things that\nshe did and things she contributed to. And so | know that she didn't give up her\nspiritual independence and she also didn't give up her physical independence, that\nshe did these things, and my father was fully aware. The only thing he expected us\nto have dinner on the table, lunch, it was lunch, 1:00, had to be lunch. And 7:00 had\nto be dinner. And what she did in between, he couldn't care less. | mean, he simply,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhe would never, you know, check with her, | mean she ran the household extremely\nwell and he knew that and he didn't care, | mean he just wanted his meals at a certain\ntime. And that was that. That's all he really demanded from her. And not demanding,\nbut he was extremely compulsive and things had to be done just so and it had to be\njust at a particular time and his time was one and seven. And everything, everything\nran around those two, you know, landmarks during the day, | mean there was\nnothing, she could go and do whatever, but she had to be back and have the meal\non the table for these two hours.",

        "Q: So you don't color between the lines?",
        "A: No, the only think | Knew and that's why | got pushed to my, and even above my\nage, was | could read extremely well. And that fooled everybody. Perhaps | didn't\nunderstand everything | read, but | could just read very fast and because that, see\nthat was one thing which now tells me | still am addicted to books, | mean I'm really\naddicted. I, | mean | do terrible things, | will read through the night and | know that\nkills my next day and | just cannot stop. So it's really an addiction, it's nothing else\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbut an addiction, and that | picked up, | think, was a real escape as, in those years\nwhere | could just totally ignore what was going on around me and pretend it wasn't\nso and just immerse myself in those books, but it was, | don't even know, because\nthe first book | read | think was Forever Amber and this was so inappropriate. |\ncouldn't have possibly understood what was going on, but | just stuck to it and then\nwas Gone With the Wind or stuff like that. | mean, as a six year old, you know, and\nit's totally inappropriate, but because of that | really knew how to read extremely well\nand that was why they placed me, so they didn't check on anything else and | knew\nnothing else. | just Knew nothing, | mean | could barely write, but | was up there, |\nwas put in fourth grade. So | was in that school. And then, as | said, | had told my\nparents that | wasn't going to be, you know, married at 18, or | wasn't going to marry\nat all, basically, and | was going to become a doctor.",

        "Q: Wait a second, hold it, hold it, you're skipping over this. How did you know that?",
        "A: | don't know, | just knew | wanted to be something and doctor seemed extremely\nheroic, so | guess | was very impressed by the doctors | went to. You know, they\nseemed to have such power and, you know, everybody was very deferent to doctors.\nSo, | don't think | was in it really to help people, | think | was in it more for interest.\nSo, that's what | was going to be. And, so in order to do that, | couldn't stay in that,\nsee that school was, as | said, in shambles, it was the remnants of a pre-war, very,\nvery fine Jewish school, but because, so the system in Belgium was that if you went\nto public school, you could get into university after graduation, you didn't need to take\na special test. But, if you went to private school, you had to take a very, very thorough\nsort of baccalaureate type of exam. So, and you had to, in order to get to university,\nat that point, Antwerp became a Flemish town, so you had to go to a public school in\nFlemish. | didn't Know any Flemish, really not, | mean | just knew a few words to talk\nto the cleaning woman and | didn't have a lot of interaction with her because when\nshe was there | was in school and | hardly ever saw her. So that was a bit of a\nproblem because you had to have an admissions test in Flemish. So, | don't know,\nsee people think maybe I'm lying, but I'm not, | mean | went and | took the test and a\nfriend of mine came with me and she copied everything from me and she didn't get\nin. So, but | don't Know, | mixed French and Flemish and whatever | could think of,\nyou know, in the answers. | mean, the, | don't know what the questions were and |\nonly had three years of elementary school and everything was, really, | Knew nothing\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nreally well except reading, that's all | really knew. Well, the rest | knew, math was\nterrible, because | didn't have the elementary stuff, you know, | was really bad. And\nso | got into this extremely, extremely difficult public school that had six years of\nstudies. And in order to go to university, you had to take the classic tract, so the\nclassic tract was Latin and Greek. Plus Flemish, of course, which was the main, plus\nsix hours of math a week. | mean, this was really horrible, and my experience at that\nschool was terrible, just terrible because there were only two Jewish girls in it and\neven though it was really a secular school, it was a public secular school, because in\nBelgium they have, as they have here, a Catholic system that is parallel to the public\nsystem, | obviously, so the people who came to the secular schools were not\nCatholic, or at least not practicing or not very serious about their religion since they\nchose the public school. But | still felt very alienated and really not welcome. | felt\nthere was real anti-semitism there.",
        "Q: In Antwerp in general it was this feeling at the time?",
        "A: Well, | couldn't tell because the Jews really lived very much in the ghetto, even\nthough they didn't live that much physically a ghetto, they lived spiritually and\nculturally in a ghetto, there was very little mixing. So the only traces of anti-semitism\nwere, | have a friend who lives down in Boston, she's several years older, and we\nsometimes speak Flemish just kind of out of, you know, out of fun and there is one\nkind of joke we have, is if we haven't heard from each other for a long time, she'll\ngreet me like in Flemish, [Flemish phrase], like, are you still alive? And she said\nthat's how they greeted her when she came back to school, like, , gee,\nyou know, | thought you were dead. So, that was the atmosphere among the\nFlemish, although many had been hiding Jews. They really then had a concerted\neffort to rescue Jewish children and hide them, but obviously, there were a fair\nnumber of people who, and you know, it's, | couldn't even say that it was vicious, it\nwas like having no clue and say, oh, you know, well, we thought you were dead, kind\nof a thing. But just imagine, when you have survived something like this, you don't\nfeel that great. And the other thing that contributed to my feeling pretty bad was that\nwe had school on Saturdays and my father didn't let me go. And so, | was already\nreally, you know, culturally deprived, | mean | was, | don't know how | managed to do\nwell in school because | did, but it was strictly grabbing things here and there and\nputting them together, but not having a coherent view of things. It was, | missed, you\nknow, a sixth of math every week, which was algebra and going on to, you know,\nhigher math and |, | really, | had a lot of trouble catching up and staying afloat.\nMissing one hour of Latin and one hour of Greek every week, and trying to make up,\nwhereas the six hours, | mean the five hours that we had were hard enough, you\nknow, to try then every week, by the time you catch on, there you go, you're missing\nthree or four or five hours of really important work. And then | had to go after Sabbath,\npick up the work from these people who weren't very friendly, they let me in their\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhouse, but like barely, and try and copy it over. | mean, it was hell. And then, when\nthe Jewish holidays came on Monday and Tuesday, so now here we go, | miss\nSaturday, of course, Sunday no school. Sunday | can't go pick up the notes because\nSunday the holiday starts early and we have to go through that routine of bathing and\ngetting ready and whatever. And so by Wednesday, | mean you can imagine how |\nfelt when | got to school. | mean, the people were talking about things | had\nabsolutely no clue about and the teacher said, \"Well, you know, you want to observe\nyour religion, that's okay with me, but I'm not going to help you. You'll just whatever,\nyou know, do it yourself\". So we did, this girl and myself, and we had six miserable\nyears. But somewhere in between, in 1951, | believe it was, my father's immigration\npapers, he had applied to come to this country in 1933, and of course, the Americans\nhad no intention of saving a single Jew so they made sure he didn't get the papers\nand they figured by, like , In '51, he'd be dead. But in '51, his number\ncame up, and so this was in sort of the middle of the Korean war and there was big\npanic in Europe that this was going to turn up to be World War Ill. And so my father\nsaid, \"I'm not going to survive another war, | just, | will not be able to do that\". So we\nall left and we came here.",
        "Q: All, meaning...",
        "A: My mother, my brother, myself, my grandfather and that's it. | mean, the other\npeople were married and on their own and they weren't on his quota. | mean, they\ndid, they couldn't have come even if he had wanted them to. And, so we came and\nmy mother had a brother who lived in Borough(ph) Park, and his name was\nBlitz(ph), and he had escaped just before the war, on the last boat to\nBrazil and came then that route, with his wife and three children. And so he was\nliving in Borough Park and he helped us get a place and | hated it. Because Borough\nPark was even more orthodox than what | had seen and my mother hated it.\nBecause my mother could go along with the Antwerp orthodoxy because she, but\nthat was just too much for her. She really hated it.",
        "Q: In '51, did you fly, take a boat, how did you...",
        "A: Took a boat. We took the Queen Elizabeth. And it was a fun trip, | mean, but we\ncame as immigrants with the suitcases and the, we left our apartment in Antwerp,\nactually we didn't vacate it, because my mother really wasn't sure that this was going\nto work out, and so she thought we better stick it out and see what happens. And,\nbecause by then she had established herself, she was happy in Antwerp, she had all\nher fingers into, her tentacles really, into all sorts of pots and she was really a leader\nof the community. And she had friends, they had a social life, they played cards with\nother people. She and | used to skip away occasionally for a weekend to Paris, you\nknow, go to the theater because she loved the theater. And we'd go to movies\ntogether and we just had a good time, basically, she and |. My father was pretty\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmuch on the side, he didn't participate much in these, but he didn't mind, you know,\nthat they occurred. So...",
        "Q: You said you had fun on the ship, you were a teenager, you might have had a\nreally lot of fun.",
        "A: Yeah, | had fun, | mean I...",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: But | wasn't a teenager, the American teenager, we were very different. We were\nreally entirely different. So, first of all, we weren't dating as teenagers. Not at all.\nWe, most of my friends, and that's another thing, there were two, two sets of people,\nthere was one set like my friend Regine(ph), who, she belonged to a Jewish\norganization, like a youth movement. And they would meet on every Saturday, some\nZionist group, they would learn about Israel and they would sing songs and it was\nlike a bit of a, let's say, a scout type of experience. They'd go camping, but with a\nZionistic, strong Zionistic feeling.",
        "Q: What was it called?",
        "A: That was the , and | think it's still ongoing, it was part of the\nsection. Then there were other youth movements that were very left\nwing which were , and they were very Socialist and | couldn't go to that\nbecause my father would have killed me and | didn't like the other one, so my friend\nand | kind of parted the ways, parted ways. And in fact, | think | was also not much\nof a, | wasn't functioning very well in a group, | was really an individualist, too, |\ncouldn't function, | got bored. | just got bored. | went with Regine just to be with her\nfor awhile, and | really couldn't, | just couldn't do it. So | went to a couple of camping\ntrips, you know, for the summer where we, and | had a very good time, |, on those\ntrips because that was sort of further away from home and there was less control.\nAnd then, if you're with a bunch of young people camping, there isn't that much you\ncan do on a Saturday that you, you know, that you could or couldn't do, we'd go for\nhikes and we'd do all these things, so it was actually a lot of fun. And so we came\nhere and...",
        "Q: You said you had fun on the ship and I'm just curious.",
        "A: | don't even know, | mean | guess first it was very luxurious and I'd go to movies\nand I'd go run around the cabins and read, there was a very good library. You know,\nwe played games like shuffleboard and things like that, you know. | don't think | met\nanyone on the boat, | didn't go dancing or, it was just luxury, | think that's what\nattracted me.",
        "Q: What was your sense about going to America?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: | wasn't sure, you know, | wasn't sure because, but | wasn't that happy over at\nhome. | wasn't having a great social life really, | had a pretty miserable social life\nbecause my school mates were not Jewish, except for this one girl, and so we didn't\ndo a lot of socializing with them.",
        "Q: Just because they weren't Jewish or...",
        "A: Yeah, | think we were, they weren't Jewish and we had all these restrictions, you\nknow, on going this and going that, and so it was very hard and they didn't understand\nany of it. | mean they simply couldn't understand what we were talking about. There\nwere two, actually, | think that our first year of high school, | think we were somewhere\nnear 60, divided in three groups, one that wasn't planning to go to university, so they\nwere not the Latin, Greek types and | think two who were going to university, so out\nof 40, nine graduated. And out of those nine, there was these two Jewish girls,\nNelsie(ph) and myself. And two other girls that we have, that we did become friends\nwith over the years. And in fact, | think the Nelsie might still be in touch with at least\none of them. And | know where they are at least, you know, so it's not like they're\ntotally lost. But it took a long time, until something gelled. And at the time that | left,\nit was about, | was beginning to feel a bit better and | knew Flemish by then, and |\nwas, | was really doing very well. And so it was a little difficult to leave. But on the\nother hand, it was like a big adventure going to America, you know, it was something\nterribly attractive. And | did adjust, really, | mean | hated Borough Park.",
        "Q: Wait a minute. So, you're on the boat, you were, did you identify, you said there\nyou were with your suitcases, did you identify with the concept, refugee?",

        "A: And the people who came to pick us up were, so my grandfather, | don't know, he\nhad a number of siblings that, unfortunately, | only met one or two of them and | don't\nreally know, | think there may have been six or eight, | don't really Know. One of them\ncame here in early 1900's, and in fact, my grandfather came as well. But he went\nback to Poland, he's one of those people who came, had a pushcart and just figured,\nthis is really not for me, so he learned English, it was very funny, my grandfather\nknew English. And he went back to Poland, but one brother and a sister, | think,\nstayed here. So those people came to meet us at the boat. Now, these people had\nbeen transplanted from Poland to Borough Park, essentially, or the Bronx, | can't,\nyeah, those | think might have been in the Bronx. And they, okay.\n[end of side 1 of tape 2].\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: So we landed with our trunks and not only did we have our stuff, but my mother in\nher usual generosity, took things to deliver to, | don't Know, | really don't know how\nmany people, it was incredible. Vases and this, and | mean it was just, really it was\nridiculous. And my father was yelling at her. And | was yelling at her. But, she was\nalways on the side of the, you know, the loser and the underdog and the, you know,\nyou have to do this, you must do this, and what's the big deal, so we have one more\nsuitcase. Yes, ma, now 10 more suitcases. And who's going to drag this? And then\nyou get here and you go, first of all immigration treats you like shit, that's number\none. | mean, really awful. And you land on this pier and these people appear who\nare primitive, in my view, because, see, even though my parents didn't have a formal\neducation, my mother was anything but primitive, and the people who they\nassociated with, again, had no education, but were very, they were street wise and\nthey were, they had a veneer of worldliness about them because most them had\nbeen, they'd been to South America and America or Switzerland, so they, they had\na better, they had a much wider experience. And they had to adjust very quickly, so\nmany of them learned Spanish and then they learned French and then they learned\nGerman and they learned just to be able to stay alive and to function in those\nsocieties, so they had a veneer of worldliness, you know, and they had sort of, and\nthey were very elegant, they had beautiful apartments. These people here lived in\nthese buildings with the, you know, the fire escapes. And | had a totally different\nvision of America, which had been fed to me by the movies of the early 50's, you\nknow, with these Hollywood apartments and the little maids with the little white things.\nAnd | took a look at this, | said, \"My God, you know, this is awful\". | mean, I'd much\nrather be in Antwerp because that's really not me at all. And the first thing these\npeople would ask you is, \"How do you like America?\" You know, and having been\njust treated like garbage, | would say, \"| hate America\". And my mother was furious.\nAnd | mean, it was just a bad experience. So we moved to Borough Park and there\nis where my brother, my mother's brother, had got us a place. And he got us a place\noff some rabbi who was going to Florida for the winter because we came in the winter.\nIt happens that the rabbi's travel plans didn't work out quite as predicted, so here we\ncome, four people and the rabbi and his wife with the wig, the little girl, you know,\nsnotty nose, white socks, | mean, just, you know, from the ghetto, from Poland, this\nis how it looked to me. And we have to spend two nights with them in the same\napartment. And there were roaches there and we had left our apartment, which was\nnot luxurious, but compared to that, it was clearly Trump Tower. And so, | felt very\nbad about this whole thing and when they left, you know, at least we got, the place\nwas ours and it became a little easier. And in fact, then | started having a good time\nbecause my mother's brother who left, | told you, with his three , he left\nwith his three kids on that last boat, his daughter is about two years older than | am\nand she's wonderful, a really wonderful person. And so she was really very\nwelcoming to me and she took me with her friends, although it seemed to me she\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwas from Mars. We had, we really, we took a liking to each other immediately, but\nwe, we were so different, so completely different that | couldn't understand any of the\nstuff she did. | mean, she would, on Saturday night if she didn't have a date, she\nwould not dare put her nose out the house and | would, \"Look Renee(ph), let's go to\nthe movies\". And she says, \"No, we can't\". And | said, \"Why not?\" And she wouldn't\ntell me, you know, because | was still maybe a little too young for her to, and she\nwould have a bunch of friends, they'd come to the house and they would do their hair\nand they would do all these stupid things and they wouldn't, and | couldn't, | was just,\n| couldn't understand, but | liked her a lot and so | had fun, | think it was almost like\nan anthropological study at that time, like what are these people thinking? And then\nwe had to move to, so my mother didn't like it there in Borough Park and we moved\nto Manhattan.",
        "Q: Were you in school at all during this time?",
        "A: Well, this is, I'm coming to this. So after about a month, they figured, you know,\nI'm in the middle of high school, | got to go to school. So my cousin was at\nRamaz(ph), the Jewish day school. In fact, my husband was there, too.",

But, so, my father wanted to send me there because it was a\nHebrew school, but they wouldn't take me because | hadn't gone to Hebrew school\nall these years and | was very far, far behind. So then another recent immigrant told\nhim about the Julia Richmond(ph) High School in Manhattan, which at the time was\napparently a very, a very good public school. And so | went there. And although |\nwas, | had finished the third year of high school there in, their high school is six, |\nmean in Belgium, because of all my Latin and Greek and stuff, they didn't know what\nto do with me. So they put me in the graduating class. So again, | was like\ndisconnected from having a coherent education. And, and | didn't know English, |\nknew just a little bit from, you know, a little high school English, | mean after three\nyears of high school, how much English do you know? That's all | Knew.

And here we'd go, the graduate, the seniors in\nhigh school, | don't know, you know, from ten to one or from, so | started enjoying\nthis, | said, \"This is a lot of fun\". I'm graduating, | don't know anything, but I'm going\nto college at, you know, 16 because I'm through, you know. And | mean, | knew it\nwas going to be a problem because | really didn't, | didn't know anything. | mean, |\nknew nothing, | just, | don't know, | just sort of skimmed by and managed to learn\nenough English to be able to read and | was here til about May. At which point my\nmother decided that it's not for her. My father was not well, my father was a sick\nman, all throughout.",
        "Q: You were living in Manhattan at this time?",
        "A: Yes, that, we were living in one of those efficiency type apartments on West 72nd,\n| don't remember what it was called, it had a name, it was a sort of hotel, apartment\nhotel. And it was fine, | mean it was much better than Borough Park and, and | met\na very nice young woman at Julia Richmond and she, she wanted absolutely to have\nme date, so she would introduce me. She thought | was this incredible kid, you know,\nbecause | was very different from everybody else. And she used to introduce me,\nthese guys who were much older, who were, you know, from Yashiva(ph) University\ntypes. And | didn't want Yashiva University types. The hat and the thing, but | mean,\n| dated a couple of times, you know, and | was very uncomfortable. The dating\nsituation was, wasn't me at all. And then my mother said, you know, my father was\nhaving horrible headaches and he wasn't feeling well and she just couldn't get used\nto the anonymity and sort of lack of interaction and the fact that her brother was in\nBorough Park and it became a whole hassle just to go to Borough Park, you know,\neverything was a hassle. In Antwerp, you can walk to most of your friend's and\neverything, you know, you can walk to downtown and you can do all your shopping\non foot. | mean, there is public transportation and people use it, but it's not like the\nnoisy subway and, you know, all of that. There's not that many, it's not crowdy and\nnoisy and filthy and, you know, scary. So we, we returned, we went back. And that\nwas, so, | think we got here probably around February and | started school at the end\nof February and | was to graduate in June, but that would have been a real mistake.\nAnd went back in May, and of course, | had missed four months of Latin and Greek\nand trigonometry and | mean, horrors. And so they said, \"Look, you can repeat a\nyear or you can try and cram\". So | said I'd try and cram. And | did, | crammed. And\n| failed only one subject and that was hist, not history, geography. So they let me\ntake a makeup and then that was it. So | made it to my grade level and continued til\nthe end and graduated in, can't remember what year, '55 | think. Somewhere around\nthere.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: And then what happened? What was it like going back to Antwerp, first?",
        "A: Well, yeah, by the time we left, | actually like it because, hey, as | said, | was\ngraduating, | knew | didn't really know anything, but | thought | could fake it. And |\nwas dating, although | didn't like the scene, there was something kind of nice about\nit. And | was becoming more independent. So | don't think | was looking forward to\ngoing back to Antwerp at all. | think | was, by that time, beginning to open up to the\npossibilities of much more freedom. And the possibility of meeting a lot more people\nin may age group. In Antwerp it was extremely restricted and, as | said, there were\nsome that were going to these religious things which | wasn't going to go into. There\nwere some that were going to the non-religious one, | mean still the organized Zionist\ngroup, | couldn't join that because my father wouldn't let me and besides, as | said,\nI'm not sure | was that type. And then there was a group of very rich kids, or at least\nacted as they were, as if they were very rich, and they were very sophisticated and\nhad their hair done in nice places and we couldn't afford that. So | wasn't really\ncomfortable with them either. So | was quite isolated and had just, and then the\npressure was on to just get married. In all those groups, you know, and | mean |\ncouldn't deal with this at all. | simply couldn't deal with this. So | had two or three\nfriends, girlfriends mostly, til the end of high school. And we'd just meet in each\nother's houses and commiserate, basically. Complain about how terrible life was in\nAntwerp. And so that's how it was until | graduated high school. And a time, about,\nwhen | was studying for my big finals in high school, it was around the holiday of\nPentecost, you know, , my, one of my uncles, Myer, you know, who had\nlived with us, and his wife had taken an apartment for the month of June at the\nseashore and they invited me to come for that holiday. So | came and | brought all\nmy books to study my final exams. And | was studying on the beach because it, it\nwas the month of June and it was not high season yet, there were just families with\nyoung children. And this one guy, you know, approached me and he was a young\nman from Antwerp, but just a few years older than | was. And we started dating. So\nthen | had sort of a good time for awhile except that he wanted to get married. And |\njust didn't want to. | mean, | just did not. You know, | just knew that | had to hang\nonto what | had said and | wasn't going to cave in. And so that, didn't have a nice\nending, but | started medical school.",
        "Q: In Antwerp?",
        "A: In Brussels. There was no medical school in Antwerp, there is one now, there\nwasn't one. And again, that was really a mistake because | wasn't ready. | mean, |\nwas 17 and in Europe, to this day, medical school is right after high school, so there\nis, there is no college to kind of buffer. And medical school is seven years, So you\ndo all the science courses that you would normally do in college, you do in the first\nyear of medical school, all together. And in addition, you do anatomy. And the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncadavers and me, that just didn't work out very well. Not at all, | couldn't take it. So\nin fact, | became anorectic again, but again, it wasn't like, you know, | thought | was\nfat and | wasn't going to eat, but | stopped eating because, just the odor would pursue\nme and | really think that that had a connotation with the concentration camps and\nwith having seen those horrible pictures and having seen my father the way he looked\nwhen he came back. And every time I'd go, it would just sort of flash. And | would\nget sick, | mean | simply couldn't deal with it. So | was in medical school for two\nyears, but | quit. | couldn't do it. And | lost maybe 10 pounds, 15 pounds, 20 pounds,\n| was really disintegrating. So that was one problem. My other problem is, the school\nwas in Brussels and my father wouldn't let me live in the dorms, which means | had\nto commute, which means | had to get up every morning at five, be on the train at\nseven and be awake in class at eight. And come back at 7:00 at night. So that was\none very difficult, and the other thing about that was that that first year was, you know,\nmath and physics and chemistry and these were things that | just didn't know. | mean,\n| faked my way through high school, basically, but | didn't know it. And | didn't know\nit enough to jump to calculus, for instance. | mean, | just, so | was really struggling\nand | gave it up. | mean, | just couldn't handle it.",
        "Q: Were there other women in your class?",
        "A: Some.",
        "Q: Other Jews?",
        "A: Yeah, actually, | traveled on the train with a bunch of, | think there we were four or\nfive. But that university, we went to Brussels and Brussels is a very anti-clerical\nuniversity. It was actually erected as a reaction to Catholicism. So they were very\nfree thinkers, | mean that was, so | think that the Jewish aspect was less of a problem\nthere. The people there were truly secular. And | don't recall feeling, you know, no,\nin fact, | made a lot of friends. Mostly men, though. And that was very bad because\nAntwerp still is, you Know, a small gossipy town. And for the daughter of Natan(ph)\nLeiser to be seen with a non-Jew was close to prostitution. | mean, | think they\nequated that essentially with prostitution. So | had a really bad reputation in Antwerp\nand my father was shattered that | would do such a thing. And there was no talking\nsense into him, you know, there was just no talking sense into him about that it meant\nnothing and, and besides, | was going to be friends with whoever | was going to be\nfriends with. And it was bad enough that | couldn't stay in town, you know, that | had\nto do this horrible thing. And | had a good time, | mean with all the difficulties, one of\nthe fellows was Jewish and is actually now a cardiologist, had, was a good\nmathematician, so we, he would train me in math on the train at seven in the morning.\nAnd he managed to make me pass which was a feat, | must tell you, this was a feat.\nAnd another friend, | mean he's, this man is a cardiologist and is very, you know,\ngood reputation, is at the University of Brussels. The other fellow is the medical\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ndirector of the chief university hospital in Antwerp. We're still in contact, not frequent,\nbut in contact. And the other one was a woman and she's a pathologist and she's\ndivorced and she has only one child. And | think that was our little group on the train.\nFour or five of us. And then there were non-Jews and we were friendly with them\nand, in fact, my friends, particularly who is the medical director of the\nMiddleham(ph) Hospital in Antwerp, he's still friends with these people that we\nstudied together, so | think the religion was not important there. At that point it\nbecame completely, just irrelevant. These people were really very free thinkers and\neducated and it was no longer a problem. And | don't think, at that point, that |\nconsidered it as much as a problem as | did, you know, before where |, | felt\ndiminished and | felt inferior. | did feel inferior. And | was struggling, you know, just\nto keep afloat. And there, | was struggling, but it had no longer to do with not going\nto school on holidays as much as it had to do with my really lack of preparation in\nvery serious subjects and then my unability, inability to deal with dead bodies. | mean\nthat was a serious, but it had nothing to do with being Jewish per se, you know.",
        "Q: When you say it reminded you of pictures you'd seen of cadavers and of your\nfather, it reminds me of when you said that you and your father and mother would be\nin the same bed and you'd wake up with your own nightmares. Do remember any of\nthose nightmares?",
        "A: Well, yeah, the nightmares were just terror, plain terror because, see when my\nmother was away, well first of all, the terror when we fled and we were followed by\nthe, you know, in these woods and we were running and hearing the German\nShepherds, | mean until, until maybe 10 years ago, if | even saw a dog five miles\naway, | would, | would just disintegrate, | mean | couldn't deal with a dog.",
        "Q: So that's what you would have nightmares about?",
        "A: | would have nightmares about fleeing, | had a nightmare about being caught, |\nhad nightmares about bombs because we, frequently as my mother was away, when\nshe was fencing those watches and going to Switzerland, | was alone at night. And\nthere were alarms, you know, for bombs and I'd run with the people in the house, but\n| had to make it out of my own apartment first. You know, at age seven, eight, you\nknow, and it's, the sirens are going and it's like, and you heard the bombs falling and\nyou never knew if you were going to be next. So that's the kind of nightmares. And\nthen | also had nightmares about, that home | had been, because that was far from\nbeing fun and | had nightmares about having lice, which | had had, and | think | said\nthat on my tape about cutting off the hair, that was just the worst, the worst.",
        "Q: Do you still have a thing about hair?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: | love my hair, but | mean | don't know that, | mean I'm lucky that it's nice, but I'm\nnot, maybe | have a thing about hair, | don't know, | mean I've made my hair in a lot\nof different ways and I've colored it red and every possible way, so maybe, but | don't\nknow. | don't know if it's different from any woman really that has nice hair. And as\nyou get older, the rest of you becomes not so nice, so | hang onto a few things that\nare still reasonably looking. My hair is one of them, so | don't know if there's\nsomething more than what you would expect, you know, to favor the things that are\nstill nice about you. You know, as you're kind of getting into the twilight.",
        "Q: What did your father look like?",
        "A: Well, he looked like a skeleton, he looked awful and his teeth were moving, his\nhair had fallen out, he had, his feet were huge, | mean his legs were swollen from,\nyou know, when you don't eat protein and you sort of, everything turns into water, so\nhe had swollen legs. And he weighted 80 pounds, you know, | mean, and he was\ntaller than | am. And I'm not very tall, but | weigh 100 pounds and I'm really not that\nfat, so considering a man who was, you know, five six, he wasn't tall, but | mean he\nwas five six, five seven or somewhere around there, to weight 80 pounds, that's\npathetic. | mean, his cheeks were sunken and he could barely breathe, you know,\nhe was every, you know, inhaling was like you'd heard noises and it was terrible. It\nwas scary. | mean, it was really, really scary and then he had these nightmares and\nthen he was very irritable, extremely irritable, and he'd get angry and he'd yell and |\nhad never saw him like, | didn't remember him this way. | mean, he wasn't that way.\nSo, it was very hard. Very hard.",
        "Q: So to jump in our flashback sequence further close to the present, you dropped\nout of medical school?",
        "A: Dropped out of medical school and didn't really know what to do with myself. But\n| Knew | wanted to study, you know, | just figured this is like a break. And |, | went\nand worked for a year or so.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: Well, again, you know, | was sort of an, essentially because | was a con artist, you\nknow, and like | faked my way through school, | faked my way through elementary\nschool, | more or less faked my way through high school, faked my way through, you\nknow, to graduate here, | mean it was all, | Knew enough to put together something\nthat looked fine, but it was really not fine in depth. And so, this one person | knew\nwho is now in Boston, Mimi(ph), she, she lost her father during the war and she and\nher brother and mother lived in Antwerp and Mimi ts still a very strong individual and\nshe decided there was no future for them at all in Antwerp and so they were going to\nimmigrate to the States. And they did. And she worked as an office manager for a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nman who is American who had this business in scrap plastics, so he'd buy plastics\nfrom factories and he would sell them all over Europe and | guess they would recycle\nthem essentially. And so he was a German Jew who lived in the States and he would\ncome every summer to Antwerp to sort of oversee his business, the rest of the time,\nshe was running the office. So, | took that job. | knew nothing. He could only speak\nGerman, this man, and we'd correspond in German and, or some English, but mostly\nGerman. | needed to do accounting and | didn't know anything about it. | needed to\nsell stuff and quabble over the price and | hate, | mean | was 19, you know, | had no\nidea. But somehow she trained me in a couple of months to, again, present a credible\npicture, not, not really knowing what | was doing but enough to, and | remember\nclearly, clients coming in and they were looking for the boss, you know. | said, \"Well,\n| represent him\". And they were like, \"Oh, my God, you know, what is this?\" Because\n| looked very, very young, very young. | mean now maybe, | look my age, but then |\ndidn't, | really, | looked 15 at the most, at the most, and that was stretching it because\n| couldn't get into movies where you had to be 17 without ID, | mean they wouldn't let\nme in at all. And so, but I, | really did an okay job, you know, | didn't lose the man\nany money, maybe | didn't do as well as someone who really Knew what they were\ndoing, but | managed the office and there was two secretaries and there was a like\nchief accountant, but | had to present the stuff in the way that this person could, and\n| was their boss, which was really laughable. But | did it, | did it for a year and then |\nsaid this is clearly not my avocation. And | told my mother that | was going to go to\nSwitzerland to study because | couldn't do it in Belgium because | wasn't going to be\nable to, this commuting business wasn't for me. And she supported me, you know,\nshe supported me. And | left for Switzerland, not knowing at all what | was going to\ndo, not knowing anybody there.",
        "Q: You'd been accepted into med school?",
        "A: No, | didn't go to med school, | wasn't accepted into anything, | just took my\nluggage, | went on a night train, | got to Geneva at six in the morning with coffers and\ncoffers, you know, because my mother had packed God knows what, and stood there\nand had no idea where to go. And finally managed to get a cab and there was a\nJewish , aS I've figured, well, I'll go there. At least somewhere to park\nmy stuff. And | did, went there, and put my stuff and immediately figured that | didn't\nwant to stay there for very long because it was one of these orthodox things again\nand | said, \"That's really lovely, I'll stay a couple of nights, but I'm not staying\". And\nso there were some other students there, obviously, and they helped me find a, you\nknow, they helped me through the ropes of getting a newspaper and finding a place\nto stay. And | found a room to stay. And then | went to register and, honestly, | didn't\nknow for what. | really didn't Know. And I'm standing on line, you Know, in front of\nthe register, you know, the teller essentially. And there was these two Swiss girls\nand they're talking and we started talking, | asked them what are you registering for,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand they said, \"Oh, we're going for a degree in biology\". | said, \"Okay, I'll do that,\ntoo\". | mean, it sounds really idiotic, but that's how it happened. So! went and | got\na degree in biology.\nEnd of Tape 2.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nTape 3",
        "A: And so we registered, the three of us, and we became really good friends, in fact,\nI'm still friends with them now. Once every two or three months, she'll give me a call,\njust out of the blue, one of them, the other, then | hear from this, from the second\none, , just Christiana(ph) is the one that I've kept in touch with, but |\nalways hear about Christiana. And that's how | started a biology degree and\nsomewhere in the midst of all of that | met my husband. | met one woman who is an\nIsraeli and I'm still very friendly with her, in fact, she called me on Saturday. And she\nwas in the interpreter school, oh yeah, that's the other thing, all the girls who went to\nschool to Switzerland were in interpreters. | didn't want to do that because | still had\nmy views on a real job, you know. And something that | was interested in. So biology\nwas just, just great. My friend that | met, Elana(ph), was an Israeli woman who was\njust a lot of fun, she's a great gal. And she was in interpreter school, so we became\nreally good friends and | had these two Swiss girls, Christiana and Josiana(ph), and\nwe became good friends. So immediately | had a group of friends. And so, of course,\nmy parents were very worried about, is she ever going to get married. And | said,\n\u201cLook, I'm going to study, | don't know what I'm going to study, but I'm going to study\nsomething and I'm not getting married\". So they were very upset because there had\nbeen several candidates in between that | didn't mention from this fellow whom | met\nat age 17. There was a bunch of them and | didn't like any of them, | always had an\nexcuse. And one was even a physician and, because | said, well this is uneducated,\nthis is this, this is that, what's with the doctor? You know. | said, \"I just don't love\nhim. That's it. | don't love him. I'm not marrying somebody | don't love and that's\nthat\". So, they were getting really concerned and by that time | was 21, 22, and this\nis really getting to be the old maid. So everybody was concocting, you know, to have\nme meet men. So unbeknownst to me, there were relatives of his in Antwerp who,\nhe had relatives there who he used to come and visit for holidays and so on. They\ntold him about me, about this nice Jewish girl and, you know, when you're 22 and\nsomebody tells you, nice Jewish girl, you say, oh, yeah, right. The same family told\nme about him and | said, \"Anybody who needs to be introduced by his uncle, | don't\neven want to know about\". So, but | didn't say anything, | said, \"Oh yeah, really\".\nAnd | knew some of, there were a lot of American students studying medicine in\nGeneva at the time. Those who were essentially there because they were Jews\nbecause there was clearly a quota of not admitting Jews to medical school in the\nUnited States. So they came to Switzerland and he was one of them.",
        "Q: So he's American?",
        "A: Well, he was born in Belgium, came here during the war, went back with his family,\nof course, in 1946, but for some reason or other, his parents couldn't get used to\nAntwerp again, they went back to the States. So he was essentially raised here from\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe age of four on. Went to Columbia College, did extremely well, but for the quota\nreason didn't make it into medical school right away, they wanted him to wait another\nyear, it was very complicated, he said, screw you, I'm going to Switzerland. So he\ncame to Switzerland. And so this is how people were kind of planning to get us\ntogether. So | knew some of the other medical students who were there and | told,\nso | must say, | had seen Sylvan(ph) and | didn't know who he was, but he was really\nhandsome. And | said, gee, and he looked totally non-Jewish, blue eyes, light hair,\njust what | needed. And so | really wanted to meet him. And | told someone, \"Do\nyou know this guy Sylvan Kleinhaus?\" He said, \"Yeah, he's in, you know, my\nmedical\". | said, \"Just point him out to me because | want to make sure that | don't\nmeet him\". So next time we are in the cafeteria together, he says, \"That's him\". |\nsays, \"No\". So he said, \"Yes,\" he said, \"Why no?\" | said, \"Oh, that's a long story, I'm\nnot telling you why\". So we met and interestingly enough, he knew my friend Elana,\nseparately, independently. And so we became really, the three of us, you know, very\nclose and she was dating another medical student at the time. And so we met and\nwe Started to date and we got married about a year later. Even though | said, I'm not\ngetting married.",
        "Q: Did you have a religious ceremony?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, that | didn't mind, you know, that I, see | will go for the form, | still, I'll\ngo, | go to synagogue now and | attend on the high holidays and | bitch throughout\nthe entire thing, but it's, but | am, it's an ethnic identification. | feel in some ways,\nextremely Jewish, | have very, very strong feelings for Israel, my brother lives there\nand his family. My brother who was born in 1946, with his children and | love his\nfamily. And all, practically all the cousins that were born to these people who lived\nwith us, as | told you, they all live in Israel. And, and | went there for one summer\nafter | graduated high school, so | really took a love for this country. For a variety of\nreasons. And | think that's probably where the war has marked me the most, is that\n| feel so strongly identified as a Jew and | cannot stand it when anybody makes any\nkind of comment, you know, about Israel or Jews or, it just makes me completely\ncrazy, even though | don't agree with everything that the Israeli government does and\nit's not like I'm a totally right wing fanatic, not at all, but | just can't stand criticism from\npeople who aren't Jewish, | just cannot. | always feel that it's tainted, that is' not\nstrictly on political grounds. So to that extent maybe | have a certain amount of\nparanoia that | can trace back to the war. | mean, maybe that's where it's most visible.",
        "Q: You went to Israel after high school?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You didn't tell me this part.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well, there's so much, you know. | went to Israel as a, essentially, a graduation\npresent because one of my father's sisters who had, had gone to Israel in 1933. So\nwhen my father came to Belgium, she, or shortly thereafter, maybe '36 or so, went to\nIsrael as a pioneer essentially, went to kibbutz. She was clearly not orthodox, or\nbecame not orthodox, | don't know what she had been at home. And so she was\nliving there, she married there, she had two children there and so my father sent me\nto her for the summer after | graduated.",
        "Q: So this was the early 50's?",
        "A: Yeah, '55 or so.",
        "Q: The height of Zionism.",
        "A: Yes. And height of poverty, height of rationing, height of really primitive conditions.\n| mean, my aunt and her three, the three other members of her family lived in two\nrooms, essentially.",
        "Q: Where was this in Israel?",
        "A: It was in Tel Aviv. And | went there and | have a cousin who is about approximately\na year younger or so, | can't, | don't know exactly, we're certainly the same generation\nexcept that she was a Sabra(ph) and | was born under different circumstances. And\nunfortunately, when | came there, she was quite ill, she had kidney stones and so,\nshe's suffered from that since then, she's never been entirely well, although she's\nhad, you know, a fairly normal life, but she's had health problems throughout. And\nshe knew only Hebrew and | didn't Know any, or you know, again, three years of\nelementary school, that was not exactly sufficient to, so | was in a sort of desperate\nstate because | wanted to meet people. So | just really by force learned Hebrew, you\nknow, just kept asking her, what's this, what's that, | mean just continuously and the\ndictionary. And by the end of the three months, | was fluent. Really fluent. Don't\nknow how to write, still to this day, | write terribly and | read very slowly, but when |\nspeak, people think I'm a native from those three months there. So, and | made a lot\nof friends. And it was just lovely because my aunt wasn't religious. And so Friday\nnight we'd go to parties and, you know, it was just a completely different, and then,\nwhereas in Belgium, you know, you felt Jewish because you were ghettoized and\nbecause of my experience in high school, over there, it was just a wonderful feeling.\nAnd at the time, the country was just so safe. You just could go anywhere. And |\nwould hitchhike across the whole country and nobody thought anything about it, you\nknow, it was just a normal thing to do. Nobody locked their doors, it was just\nwonderful. So | did that before | started medical school, so that was my graduation\nfrom high school. And | met a fellow there who also became a boyfriend and who\ndragged in my life for several years on and off because he was in Israel and he was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\na painter. He's dead now, unfortunately, because several years ago | went back to\nIsrael actually looking for him and someone told me he had died. So...",

        "A: Before graduation. Yeah, we, because | got married a year after | started school.\nAnd so | was 23. And | moved into his place, he had a little studio, and he was in\nmedical school, so we got married in April and...",
        "Q: Of what year?",
        "A: 1960. A long time ago. And we, the summer, we came here because he had\nwanted to transfer to an American medical school. And he got several interviews.\nHis parents lived on West 96th and Central, not Central, Riverside Drive. And we\nwere married in April and | did not want to go live with his parents. And they couldn't\nunderstand it. So we, domineering people, particularly the father, and | insisted that\nwe move to our own place. | said, \"I don't care if it's a hole, but a place of our own\".\nAnd we did, they did get us a place in the Windermere (ph) Hotel, which was west\nsomething or other, 90, 91st, I'm not sure, and Broadway, | think it was. Or, yeah, |\nthink it was Broadway. But we, it was very difficult. | came here, he started to do\nsome externships (ph) and interviewing in medical school and then | said, | wasn't, |\ndidn't finish, | mean | was still, had | think a year or two to go. And | started looking\nat various colleges to see how | could continue what | was doing. And it looked\nextremely difficult because the curriculum wasn't the same and over there it was only\nscience, but here in college, you needed all these core courses of English, literature\nand so on and |, really had already lost two years of medical school, one year of\nworking, | didn't want to start, | was on the track and | just didn't want to get off it now.\nSo we had some difficult times right after we got married because to him it was\ncertainly much more enticing to transfer to a medical school, get an American degree\nand have not to deal with any of this foreign business. But to me, it was hell. And\nalso, | must tell you that Geneva was, and perhaps still is, but it was paradise on\nearth, it was just beautiful. Just, just beautiful. And we had, you took in life, you\nknow, we were very much in love, we loved what we were doing, the surroundings\nwere beautiful, you Know, | mean we'd go to the lake, Lake, now | hear it's totally\npolluted, but you know, lunchtime we'd go and swim, we'd take boat rides, we'd go\nup in the mountains. | mean, his parents were very wealthy so he had a car and |\nmean, we just had a life, the best life, you know, no responsibilities except to our\nstudies. And really enjoy life, for me, almost | would say for the first time, really, really\nenjoying my life. | mean, | had had moments, you know, that | had a good time and\nwhen | was in Brussels | had a good time and when | went to Israel | had a good time\nand here and there | had a good time, but | had mostly | was somber, you know.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: When did you stop being nasty?",
        "A: | think probably by the time | got to Geneva | sort of had that straightened out. |\nbecame, you know, happy and | stopped, maybe |, | still, I'm still nasty to people |\ndon't like. | mean, | have a certain level of tolerance, but once that's exceeded |, |\nthink I'll go absolutely through fire for people that | love, | mean | will leave no stone\nunturned and | will, you Know, even harm myself, but | will not, | have very little\ntolerance for people that | don't tolerate, so, when they reach the point where | can't\ntake them any more, there is almost no, there's almost no return. So I'm not tolerant,\nI'm very intolerant. But I'm not nasty. Not anymore, | don't think I'm, | don't think\npeople think I'm nasty, but | am not very tolerant.",
        "Q: Okay, so you're at sea here, your husband has these externships...",
        "A: My in-laws are a big pain in the neck. Big pain in the neck because they want to\ncontrol us and | didn't want to be controlled. Never did | want to be controlled, and\nthe last thing | wanted to be controlled by is my in-laws. Because | must say that, as\nsoon as | got married, | mean okay, my parents, you Know, my mother supported me\ngoing to Switzerland, my father did not put up a fight. | mean, he sort of gave in and\nsupported me financially. And from that moment on, except trying to, you know,\nmanipulate me to getting married, they became extremely non-meddling in my life.\nYou know, and I, once | get married, they totally unmeddled. | mean, completely and\nremarkably so for my father. He said nothing, he knew that we didn't observe the\nSabbath, he said, he never said a word anymore. Never. Which was, in retrospect,\nreally remarkable. With my in-laws, it was just the opposite. And | really couldn't\ntake it, | could not take that acting, they wanted me to be a certain way and | was\nnothing like it. My mother-in-law never did anything outside of the house, she was a,\npretty much a slave to her husband. And they expected me to be that way, you know,\nand | really had told Sylvan when we met and we started dating that | was going to\nhave a career and | wasn't quite clear yet as to what it would be and how | would\nmanage it, because | had no model, you know, to go by. But | would do that. | was\nnot going to be a housewife, under any circumstance was | going to be a housewife.\nSo, and even though he came from a really different picture, | think he just loved me\nenough to agree with it in principle, maybe he didn't know exactly what it would entail,\nbut at least he was able to say, \"Yes, I'll go along with it\". And he did, | mean he\nreally did. But, his parents were up in arms. So while we were still there, one\nprofessor from an American university, so we went back to Switzerland because |\nreally didn't want to stay. And reluctantly he agreed to come back. And we went\nback to Geneva and we were there for another three years. And while | finished my\ndegree, | got a job as a teaching assistant.",
        "Q: Where was this?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: In Geneva, in the department of physiology.",
        "Q: At?",
        "A: The University of Geneva, it's called. And | got two jobs, two part-time jobs which\nturned out to be two full-time jobs. You know, | was just wanted, by that time | was\nreally interested in science. And the professor who had taught us physiology was\njust amazing and | wanted to work of him in the worst possible way. And it was also\none of the plumb jobs, was to work for this, to be an assistant to Professor\nwas like. | can't even describe it to you. And | managed to get a job\nlike that. Because normally he would only give it to medical students, but | impressed\nhim enough, | took his course and | got the maximum in all three parts of the test, so\nhe said, \"Okay, I'll take you\". So | worked there and | worked in the Department of\nBiology part-time. And while | was there, a man came from the States, he was a\nprofessor of pharmacology at Downstate(ph) Medical Center in Brooklyn, he was\nthere on sabbatical. And | asked him if he would take me as a graduate student.\nAnd this was completely against all rules because you had to take GRE's and you\nhad to have this and that and the other, so | really kind of manipulated him and finally\nhe just said okay, you know. So he was staying another six months when we went,\nwe came to the States, Sylvan got an internship.",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: And that was 1963. He got an internship and | was admitted to the Ph.D. program\nat Downstate on this man's word, no papers, no nothing corresponding to what the\nrequirements were here. And he said, \"But, you better do well, because really, I'm\nputting my head on the block for you, so you better do well\". So with this admonition,\n| started graduate school. Again, | had really a language problem because the only\nEnglish | had learned was for those three months when | was at Julia Richmond High\nand that was very hard to study, you know, science in that language. | mean, | really,\nso it was an adjustment period again, but | mean that was, | knew some English, |\nwasn't totally, it's not like when the first time | came.",
        "Q: This was your third time.",
        "A: Yeah, it was. So | came, but the second time | was doing nothing because | was\ndepressed, what | did that summer, we were here for that summer, | went every single\nday to the , which is, that, you know, that, | don't Know if you know that\nmovie house, because they were showing foreign films. And | would just go in there\nas soon as they opened and | would stay til dinnertime. And | couldn't care less about\nanything else. Saw a lot of very good movies. And | was sometimes alone in the\nmovie, you know. And I'd come home and we'd go and have dinner at his folk's\nhouse because we had to have dinner at his parent's house every night. And | was,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n| cannot say how miserable. So essentially, you know, | pretty much put an\nultimatum, you know, if we go back, we go back, if not, I'm not staying married.\nBecause | can't, | can't deal with this whole scene and not being able to really finish\ncollege within a year, you know, having to do all these extra things, | didn't want to\ndo that at all. So as | said, we went back and | met Professor Firchcot(ph) and\nmanaged to convince him to take me on to school, which he did. And | came to\ngraduate school and studied for five years in Brooklyn and in the meantime, those\nfive years were terrible, terrible years again because he was an intern so, and then\nhe became a surgeon, resident in surgery, which was every other night on call, every\nother night, every other weekend away from home. Brooklyn compared to Geneva\nwas, | mean it's like moving to, you know, Haiti or something, coming from, you know,\nlet's say coming from | don't know a fancy town, let's say Monterey, California going\nto, you know, Haiti or something, you know, Port Au Prince where the colored folks\nlive, | mean that's what Brooklyn was, it was awful. Awful. And, but, and | was alone,\n| had no friends, studying was really tough because | had, on top of that, this fear of\nhaving to do well. You know, this absolute panic of having to really, you know,\nperform, to not put this man to shame. So, and | made friends there, | mean it, but\nthe intolerable was that, that Brooklyn is horrible and | was alone a lot and | made\nfriends and the friends, | was also an oddity, you know, they used to call me this cute\nlittle French girl, you know, that was the, and everybody was attracted to me because\n| was different. You know, | was a completely different type of person, different\nbackground, different everything.",
        "Q: But you let people think you were French?",
        "A: Well, they didn't know the difference. Belgium, they had no idea what that was,\nso French was fine, | looked French, you know, according to their idea, just as, you\nknow, the Bronx didn't look to me like Hollywood, in their view | looked French\nbecause, you know, | did, | mean Belgium and France aren't that different and the\nclothing was French and the haircut was French and my demeanor | suppose was\nmuch more French than it was American. You know, if you took it this way. And |\nmade some good friends there that I'm still, well, at least one of them I'm still in touch\nwith. And others I'm occasionally in touch with, but, and here and there | run into\nsome of the men. But! was friendly with two women and the others were all men\nand we were very friendly, but | was the only married one, so it was a bit different\nbecause | couldn't really date anyone and | couldn't really, but | did go out with a\nbunch of people and we used to hang out in the village. | must say that over all it\nwas pretty bad, but it wasn't, there were some good moments. | mean, | enjoyed\nwhat | was doing, | enjoyed my research and | enjoyed my friends, but | didn't like my\nloneliness and, and then | had a child.",
        "Q: When was this?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: That was 1964. So, July, 1964, and his name is Jean Pierre and he's now 32.\nAnd made it much more difficult for me to continue, but | said | was going to do it, and\nI'm going to do it. And so my mother sent me an au pair from Belgium. And\nessentially, kept me going with help until my youngest child was about, | think when\nBrian was six, | think, so for about 10 years.",
        "Q: So you had one child in '64, next one?",
        "A: Was '67 and the third one was '71.",
        "Q: So, Jeane Pierre.",
        "A: Karin(ph), she's 28 and she's a medical student, she's finishing next year and, so,\nJeane Pierre is married, he's the only one married so far and he's in business, he's\nin the diamond business. Brilliant kid, but extremely rebellious, so didn't want to finish\ncollege. Karin is very, very, very, smart, but she's also smart on the human level,\nvery sensitive, very clever about human relations and all of that and a very good\nstudent. And then Brian is 25, so he's doing a master's in one branch of geology,\nhe's, he lives in Boulder now until he's done.",
        "Q: (ph) the au pair?",
        "A: She sent me au pairs and we've had ups and downs with them. There were good\nones, there were bad ones. There was one who left us. The arrangement was that\nwe paid for their trip and we paid them a salary which was not a high salary, but it\nwas a Salary, you know, enough, and of course, room and board, and air ticket. So\nwe changed every year and one year, we had one who, so she came with us, we\nused to go, every summer we used to go home, to my parents. And my parents\nrented a house at the beach and we all went and it was just wonderful because my\nmother was just, | mean we'd come there and she rented these gorgeous homes,\nsomething like this type of home. And in fact, some of the furniture | have is\nreminiscent of that type of furniture. And she's always have, by that time they were\ndoing well and so she had full-time help, and she would just absolve me of any\nresponsibility of any kind and we'd come and we'd each have our rooms and in each\nroom there was new things hanging, clothes for me, clothes for the kids, | mean it\nwas just amazing. And so, of course, | loved going back. And so we would hire, |\nmean she would hire somebody, she would, the person would spend the month of\nAugust with us there and then come back with us and the plan was that they would\ncome back in August. One of them quit in May, she just disappeared. She left for\nthe weekend and she never came back, which was a terrible thing for me. My son\nJeane Pierre was two at the time.",
        "Q: You were still in school?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: | was in school. And well, my mother-in-law didn't want to take care of him. So |\nflew home with my kid, left him to my mother and came back.",
        "Q: You had money.",
        "A: Well, | didn't have money, she did, my mother had, she paid for it. Just flew for\nthe weekend back and forth, dropped off the child, came back to school. No, | had\nvery little money, we were making a grand total of $4,000 between the two of us. So,\nnot even enough to pay the rent, but our parents were helping us out. They really\nwere, so both, | mean his parents helped very nicely financially, but there were strings\nattached to it. And it was difficult. | mean, that relationship remained difficult for a\nlong time.",
        "Q: So when you had kids, let me turn this over. [end of side 1 of tape 3] Did you give\nyour kids a religious education?",
        "A: Yeah, in the sense that | put them in Jewish school. And, but | didn't, | mean we\nobserved all the holidays, | mean | lit, and | still do, light candles Friday night, but |\nthought that this was sort of a nice family thing to do. | never told them that there\nwas a God or that they had to believe in God. It was all sort of for, really, tradition.\nAnd ethnic identification. So | never forced them to do anything, so but, we did\nobserve the holidays because | thought they were nice. | mean, | made the Sader\nand Roshhosana(ph) and all these holidays, | mean we always made big dinners, |\nstill do when | can and invite lots of people just as it had been at home. But, | mean,\n|, they, none of my kids are religious. None of them are, so, and | really don't think\nthey feel any guilt towards it at all, you know.",
        "Q: When you give a Sader, do you do it traditionally?",
        "A: Yeah. We do itt traditionally, but the truth is, we usually, it's tradition, but it's, we\nlaugh a lot, you know, we joke around the things that are being said, | mean when\nthe kids were younger we did it more authentic because they were learning the stuff\nin school and so they wanted to read parts of it, etcetera, etcetera. And so we did tt,\nbut now we do it and we go through the whole thing and usually we do it, you know,\nsome of the kids come home, some of our friend's kids, | mean there are a little bit\neverywhere, some are married, some aren't, we try and do it together with some of\nthe people that we've always done it.",
        "Q: So then go back to school, you graduated from, you got your doctorate?",
        "A: | got my doctorate.",
        "Q: In what?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: In pharmacology. From Brooklyn. And by the time | got my, well, what happened\nis this, | was writing my thesis, being pregnant with my second child, and Sylvan\nfinished all his residencies in general surgery and decided to do a specialization in\nchildren's surgery. So there were several possible places where he could do it and |\nsaid, we have to get out of this country. | mean, Brooklyn was such a bad experience\nthat | equated all of America to Brooklyn and | said, \"I got to get out of here\". So we\nwent to Montreal. And he did a specialty training, sub-specialty training in a Catholic\nhospital there, a French one.",
        "Q: This was when?",
        "A: That was, well, Karin was born 1967, Jeane Pierre in 1964, he was, | think it was\n\u201866, starting \u201866.",
        "Q: So you're in Montreal.",
        "A: Montreal and | went there pregnant with the second child, starting a post-doctoral\nfellowship, but not having really defended my thesis. So | continue writing and we\nkeep sending back and forth between my sponsor, back and forth, and, but | started\nto work as a post-doctoral like this. Which was a terrible thing, too, because when |\nwent for the interview | didn't tell them that | had a child because at that time, to be a\nwoman was really not a plus. To be married was even less of a plus, to have one\nchild was pretty much lethal and to be pregnant with a second was, you were, had\nzero chances of getting any kind of position in science, none, zero. So | didn't tell\nthem | was pregnant. But then, you know, comes where it 's kind of\nhard. | don't know, | was so panicky. When | got there | said, \"Look, you know, |\nwasn't forthright, but I've got one child and the second one is on the way. But, |\npromise you | will work, | will continue to work\". And he was not pleased, the man\nwas not pleased at all. But, | had gotten an MRC Fellowship which was also quite\nprestigious and | had gotten that really based on recommendations from the people\nwho had trained me. So he necess, he really didn't have to pay me, | was getting it\nfrom the Canadian government, so he figured, okay, I'm not wasting that much\nresources on this person. And so, | went to McGill(ph) and he went to San\nTristine(ph), which is the French hospital, but since he spoke French, having studied\nin Switzerland, there was no problem and they were very grateful to have an\nAmerican who spoke French. That was a nice touch to it. And, so we were in McGill,\n| mean Canada, and then Karin was born over there. | went back to work five days\nafter she was born. And, because I, you know, | felt that | had to, | just felt that | had\nto do this. And | read the last draft of my thesis in the hospital, having had the baby.\nAnd flew to New York to defend my thesis six weeks after | gave birth, and it was\nvery funny because | couldn't sit, you know, | was really torn and | mean it was, |\nstood the entire flight and when | got to Brooklyn, | had to defend a thesis. And my\nthesis director wanted to do me a big favor and requested from the committee that |\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nshould be allowed to sit. Because | had just given birth. And | said, \"No way. I'm\nnot sitting\". | said, \"| sat on the plane, | just want to stand\". You know, and all men,\nof course. And, so | defended the thesis and that was fine and we went back to\nMontreal and we were there until 1971 where he finished his training and | kind of\nfinished my doctorate, my post-doctorate fellowship, but | didn't have a job coming\nback. So | figured | have to get a job after he gets his because, obviously, he's going\nto be making much more money than | am. And my job would never be that reliable\nas a scientist. So he got the job and we came back, we bought a house, actually his\nfather bought us a house because we certainly couldn't afford a house, and his father\ndied right after. It was terrible. By that time, | was pregnant with the third one, so...",
        "Q: Where was the house?",
        "A: The house was in New Rochelle. And Sylvan was working at Montefure(ph) and\nthat's where he got, he's been working there ever since. So |, well, things kind of fell\napart in that, again, | was moved to a place where | didn't know anyone. Now I'm two\nand a half children, a mother-in-law who is in total depression. And she became like\na burden, she just wouldn't do anything and she'd come every weekend and we'd\nhave to pick her up and bring her home. And on the weekend | didn't have help\nbecause this one lady that we had hired came when Karin was six, six months old,\nby the time we came back she was three, we came back, and she followed us. So\nshe came from Belgium to Montreal and she came with us to the States, so she\nseemed like she was going to be there for awhile and that was a big help. But on the\nweekends she was off and so | was overwhelmed, | literally was overwhelmed.\nBetween my mother-in-law and the kids and the pregnancy and not knowing anybody\nand it was not a good time. And, you know, the mourning of my father-in-law. And,\nso, but decided that | wasn't going to look for a job being pregnant because with three\nthis clearly wasn't going to work. So | didn't, | stayed home for about eight months.\nAnd towards the end of my pregnancy, | started sending letters to people who had\nbeen my professors in graduate school and who had now moved on to being chair,\nyou know, chairmen in big, big departments like Columbia and so on and so forth.\nAnd | said that they have to help me in the letter, and at least grant me an interview.\nSo, one or two of them did, and one in particular, | told him, \"Look, everybody says\nthat it's no point, there is no point training women because they have children and\nthey don't work. I'm trained, | have children, but | want to work. So, are you going to\nhelp me or not?\" So he could say, he couldn't say no, so he got me a job as a\nresearch associate for, at Rockefellow University which is, obviously, very\nprestigious. And | was there for about a year and then started sending out all my\nCV's(ph) and landed a job at Yale. So | started working there in the Department of\nNeurology and became the assistant professor. And worked at Yale from about 1973\ntil '89. And sort of rose through the ranks, made it, | didn't make it to full professor,\nbut | made it to research professor because | was in a clinical department and so |\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncouldn't really become, not having the MD degree, | couldn't become a real professor,\nfull professor. And | commuted from New Rochelle to Yale which was 125 miles a\nday and did quite well, you know, established a reputation and, you know, raised the\nkids, | mean all kinds of good and bad things, you know, with the kids as usual. And\nthat's it. In 1989, | moved to New York Medical College where | am now a full\nprofessor and have my own lab, teach medical students, . That's it, my\nkids, you know as | said, Jeane Pierre is married, is business, he looks very happy\nand | really like his wife. And more than that, | think she likes me which is a rare\noccurrence because |, | know exactly what not to do. And | also know what to do.\nAnd Karin is in medical school and she's going to be, become an obstetrician. And\nBrian is sort of getting his master's, but he's a little bit in limbo as to what he wants to\ndo with it. But, I'm sure he'll find a job. And so there |, there | am.",
        "Q: ,",
        "A: Hmmm?",
        "Q: Did you remember any more songs?",
        "A: Songs? No, that one that | sang to you, | Know it had to do with , but\nnow | cannot remember it, | simply can't. Funny because, you know, my mother died\nin January, she was 84 years old, she remembered those songs. She remembered\nthe songs that | had sang to her coming back from that home.",
        "Q: Do you ever have times when you kind of go back in your head and you wake up\nand you're another name, you're another nationality or another identity?",
        "A: No. But, | don't feel any allegiance to any nationality. You know, we lived in\nSwitzerland, we lived in the States, we lived in Canada, | went, in between my two\njobs, | went to Israel for six months, did a sabbatical. Between Yale and this, and felt\nvery much at home, so | think I'm really, truly multi-cultural and, but of a certain type\nof culture. | mean, I'm not, | don't think | would do very well in Africa, that's not me.\nBut, in let's say, again you know, you could say I'm elitist, but among civilized\npeoples, or so-called civilized people, | manage extremely well. All over the world.",

        "A: Well, | have a picture, for instance, | have a picture of when | was in France in\nExleba, sitting on my bed with my teeth falling out, you know, this really ugly duckling.\nAnd I'm, you know, I'm smiling and I'm saying to myself, \"That's really not how | felt\".\nYou know, when | think back, it's not how | felt. And | have pictures of being this\nterrified little girl in the shelter at night, that comes back. You know, this unbelievably\nhelpless kid that, that comes back frequently, and then anger comes up. That's why,\nas | said, when | read things about Israel and, | mean | just, | really lose it, | can't deal\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwith that very well at all. And something which, you know, is maybe anti-\n, If you wish, is that, | don't have a lot of sympathy for the, you know, the\ndemands that the blacks make on us because | feel that I've had it so much worse, |\nfeel absolutely no responsibility for their plight. Zero. And I'm personally, you know,\ntouched when they say something about Jews. | mean, that just kills me. And | had\na very, very liberal attitude when | first came to this country and |, among the graduate\nstudents, there was one black fellow and | was the only one who was friendly with\nhim. You know, really friendly, | mean |, and | didn't even know that there was a\nproblem. But, what I've heard in this country and the evolution of the black\nmovement, you know, blaming the Jews and this has just turned me off completely.\nAnd the failure to take, you know, responsibility for their own lives, | think is really\nentirely their failure and | think I'm a prime example of why terrible things in childhood\ndo not necessarily lead to, you know, becoming a criminal or a drug addict or\nanything, you know, so dysfunctional. | mean, | know that | was a dysfunctional child,\nfor sure, | mean | was not normal, definitely wasn't normal. And | had real anger and\nreal, | mean you know, they say these kids grow up with drive-by shootings and stuff,\nbut who is shooting? Their own is shooting. | was terrified with bombs were falling\nand they were aimed in my country, towards me. And for reasons | couldn't\nunderstand at all. There was absolutely nothing that made, gave that any kind of\nlogic, you know, | didn't look any different, | did very well at church, you know, | mean\n| could pass for one, it wasn't hard at all. And | knew, though, that if somebody found\nout, | would be dead. And so that was really, it was petrifying and | knew that | didn't\nfunction, you know, like a normal child should function. And, you know, | definitely\ndidn't eat. | could go days without eating at all. And | didn't miss the food.",
        "Q: Do you think of yourself as a survivor?",
        "A: Oh, definitely. Definitely. Because, for instance, when | left Yale it wasn't all sweet,\na new chairman came in and he essentially wanted to change the whole tenant of\nthe department, and he gave me a really tough time, others as well. But the others\nwere MD's and they were geographically mobile. And | had to go find a job and | was\n50 years old at that time, and a woman scientist, again, not a great pedigree. | mean,\n| had a good pedigree in terms of, you know, | had proven myself. But still, and |\nmanaged to land one, you know, just by never giving up. | just never give up, | mean\n| don't give up. So! know I'm a Survivor, for sure. | mean, absolutely. And you know,\n| live in luxury, but | went for six months to Israel on this sabbatical and | really lived\nin a dump and | was very happy. It just didn't matter. | don't have attachment to\nmoney, | mean, | spend a lot of money, but it's, | have it, | spend it, | don't have it,\nokay. You know, it doesn't mean anything. | have no attachment to Belgium, no, |\nmean everywhere | go, | feel at home.",
        "Q: , SOIT.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Some facet of me feels at home. You know, | go to France and they think I'm\nFrench. | go to Belgium and they think I'm Belgian. I'm here and people think I'm\nAmerican. | mean, nobody ever thinks I'm not. | do have some accent, but | mean,\n| met a guy from Seattle and he heard me speak French and German and whatever,\nto a bunch of people, he said, \"Jesus, you're really the only American | know who\nspeaks that many languages\". | said, \"Well, I'm not American\". Then ,\n| said, \"Don't you hear?\" He said, \"No, | thought you were from the East\". Because\nthere are so many different people in the States that you can't really identify and |\nspeak well enough that you cannot say that this is not my native tongue. And so, |\ncan pass everywhere. I'm transparent, you know. | mean, I'm a little bit like a\nchameleon in, at least, outwardly. | can sit with people and, in the Catholic\nenvironment, they talk about certain things and | know exactly what they're talking\nabout. You know, | feel it, | know what it's like. And the same, | can be among\nextremely orthodox Jews, | mean | speak Yiddish very well and they have a certain\nway of putting things and | know exactly, and | know, | can respond in kind. See, |\ncan just play the game, | can play any game you want me to play. So, | don't have a\nproblem knowing who | am inside of me, as a person, but as far as the superficial\nstuff, it doesn't matter much. | think I'm a Jew, | mean that's really clear to me. But |\ncan camouflage that under anything else that needs to be, you know, that's\nappropriate.",
        "Q: What's your citizenship?",
        "A: Well, it's still Belgian. For many reasons, one is, | don't feel any allegiance to this\ncountry at all, now this might land me in jail, but | don't care. And | never wanted to\ndeal with bureaucracy, | cannot stand bureaucracy. The little that | had to do with the\nimmigration service here has told me that | don't want to have anything further to do\nwith them. Now | must tell you that, in truthfulness, | might actually become a citizen\nnow because of only inheritance laws, that's the only reason. So | don't feel Belgian,\n| mean the Belgian passport is actually a European passport, so | like to hang on to\nthat because it gives you free passage through Europe, it's much nicer than an\nAmerican citizen's. And second of all, my mom lived there until, as | said, a few\nmonths ago and | used to go back several times a year to visit. And it was just so\neasy and | just fit right in, you Know. And | didn't see the advantage of being\nAmerican, | mean I, see this is where the immigrants that came before really fouled,\nyou know, but I'm resentful to this country for actually wanting my father to die. So |\nhave no respect, | think it's hypocritical, hypocritical, like no other place on earth. And\nreally, really reactionary with putting in religion, pretending that it's separate, but then\nthe Congress opens with prayers. | mean, | think the hypocrisy here is what gets me\nthe most.",

        "A: Well, I'll tell you, see that's the thing, | would prefer to live in Israel than in Europe.\n| feel that there I'm at peace, in fact, | moved my mother's body there and moved my\nfather's remains after 22 years to be next to her. This July, amonth ago. So, to me,\nit's like the end of the road and | will be happy there in spite of all the difficulties. I'm\nvery family oriented and socially, I'm very social. | love my friends, | really love to\nspend time with them. | don't have a lot of time to spend with them, but | love the\nwhole idea. And in Israel, life is much more social than here. And my brother is there\nand his wife and his kids. Sylvan's brother is there, wife and kids. About 17 cousins,\nand I'm not exaggerating, there's at least that many and they're all much younger\nthan | am, but | am very good friends with a few of them, really friends. The six\nmonths that | spent in Jerusalem on sabbatical, | made dear friends, really dear\nfriends, so | get there and I'm home. Do you know, more almost, than here.",

My kids know, they know there was\nsomething pretty terrible, because my oldest son is definitely, he's completely anti-\nreligious, | mean he, my daughter lives in Israel right now, she studies in Israel and\nshe will got to synagogue, you know, she has her own, the way she does religion is\nvery much her own thing. So she goes for various, but | don't know that she believes\nin God either, | mean | kind of don't think so.

So she does that\nand she's definitely active, but | wouldn't say continuously. | mean, she'll have\nepisodes or periods where she'll go and she'll go to pray on Sabbath and she'll eat\nkosher and then she'll just throw it to the wind. She'll come here and she'll order\nshrimp, you know, so it's clearly not totally settled, but | think she, she's very Jewish,\n| mean, she doesn't look Jewish either in the sense of, you know, the typical Jewish\nlook, but she's very Jewish and she lives in Israel, | mean that's clearly...",

        "A: Yeah, that they did, but for instance, Brian lives in Boulder, | mean | don't think\nhe's gone to synagogue in the three years he's there, you know, so it's not very strong\nidentification. But when we were in Israel during one of our trips with the kids, we\nwent to , which ts the local Holocaust museum, and Jeane Pierre, who\nwas, he might have been eight or nine at the time, just became hysterical, totally,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ntotally hysterical.

And then with all the various papers that my parents got, mostly my\nmother, | was with her most of the time, they came, the name came with the papers.\nSo if it was Marie, well, | was told, you know, you are now Marie, if it was Renee(ph),\nyou are Renee, if it's Charlotte, | think the last one was Charlotte, Charlotte Henri(ph),\nthat was the one before. And a very funny thing happened after the war, when my\nfather came back from concentration camp and my mother wanted him to meet the\npeople who had, they weren't officially hiding us because we were paying rent there\nsupposedly, but at least we were living there under false pretenses and | think they\nknew that we weren't exactly who we said we were. My mother wanted to meet those\npeople and they, so her name was, | can't remember what her name was, Tonree(ph)\nwas the last name, which is a very French name, and they called him Monsieur\nTonree when they first saw him, which was very funny. They never got used to the\nidea that we, actually even our names were not our names. And so that's the story\nof the name.",
        "A: Well, it was very difficult. It was very difficult.

But! was very frightened, | mean there wasn't, it wasn't hard in the sense\nof, you know, these are names | could pronounce and | learned French very quickly,\nbut it was very hard emotionally.

        "A: | don't think | was thinking about that very much. | mean, the only concerns | had\nwas to survive, | think, | didn't think about, ahead very much, and the only concern\nabout, let's say ahead, was that my father should come back from Auschwitz, | didn't\nknow where he was, but that's where he turned out to be. That where my, those\nwere my concerns was to remain alive and to have a family, but not whether | would\nremember who | was or who | wasn't, that, you Know, | think inside of me, | knew very\nwell who | was. So that, | mean after awhile, even though | was very young, |\nunderstood that it was just necessity and that it didn't really change whoever | was.\nAnd | played the game, essentially. | went to church, you know, | played the game.\nYou know. Just knew this is what you have to do and that was that. You know, went\nfor communion to the priest and all that stuff. And at that time | must have been six\nor seven, you know, so, at the most. So | just did it, you know, and | knew it was a\ngame and | knew, you know, sometimes | said | wish | were Catholic because it would\nbe so nice, particularly wnen they had communion and they had the white dresses\nand, that | really envied, you know. And | did stand somewhat in awe of the church,\nyou know, it was extremely impressive, you know, when you go into a big church and\nthe priest stand there and, you know, pontificates and the music and so on. That\nwas impressive and | kind of wished | could identify with that whole thing, but as my\nmother told me and many people repeated to me, that at the age of four | already\nhad sort of taken leave of religion, you know, and didn't want to obey anything. So\nthat, basically, | think was sort of a refuge, it made me, in some ways, feel safe, you\nknow, if | could be part of that group, | would be safe. And | don't think it was, in\nretrospect, such a deep religious feeling as some sort of feeling of being protected,\nyou know, in church you were protected. And if you're part of that group, nothing\nhappened to you. So | think it was, you know, as a young kid, going with the children\nof the town and our neighbors, | mean our landlords, going to church on a Sunday, |\nwas, | felt extremely alienated, you know, in one aspect, and trying to play the game\nand like believing that maybe | was Catholic and | could be Catholic and | could just\nproceed, you know, from there on and not have to worry about being who | was.

        "A: | had been extremely close, so that was a terrible disappointment, terrible, terrible\ndisappointment because, well, what you remember as a three or four year old from\nyour father is very different from the way you see him at age eight or nine, particularly\nsince there hasn't been a progression, you know. So, and | was extremely\ndisappointed because he was extremely orthodox and wanted me to be that way.\nAnd extremely rigid in his, the practice of religion where, you know, he wouldn't allow\nme to turn on the light on the Sabbath, | mean he was extremely, extremely,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nextremely strict and rigid and | could not abide by this. | just could, | didn't believe in\nit and | kept telling him that | didn't see how, after what he's gone through, he could\nstill believe in this sort of stuff. And so there was really a crack in our relationship\nbecause of that. You know, he tried, on other fronts. | mean, my father was not an\neducated man and he would make an effort and take me to the movies and | know\nthat this was not something that he would have done normally, this is something he\nreally did to try and regain some, some closeness with me. | mean, I'm sure he\nmissed it, too, but he just didn't know how to go about it. And | think in some ways,\nhe was soiled, you know, as far as, why did he let himself be taken? Why didn't he,\nwhy wasn't he the strong man | thought he was in, you know, protecting us all and\nwhy did he just disappear? | mean, he just, he was supposed to meet us Somewhere\nand he never showed up. You know, and at that time, | think | had this certain\nresentment towards him for being my fallen hero, you know, why didn't, why didn't\nyou protect us and why were you gone and why were you, come back in such a\ndecrepit state, you know, you look terrible and, you Know, you can't really be my\nstrong father. You know, so | had a lot of that. And | don't think | could tell him, |\nreally couldn't, the only fights that we openly had was about religion. And | think |\nthen channeled everything into absolutely refusing to have anything to do with the\nreligion because | got, you know, it was a little inconsistent, like angry at God like for\nallowing this to, and then somebody who allows this to happen, can't exist, just can't\nbe.

And my father had these incredible nightmares and he would be screaming,\naside from that. And | had my own nightmares. So it was a nightmare, it was hell,\nabsolute hell. And then, again, | can't say for, it's six months or a year, they bought\nme some kind of bed where | was in the so-called dining room and the family, the\nadditional, the uncles and aunts and that group, moved to the third floor, so we had\nthe first, ground floor, the family, the owners, had the floor right on top of us, the\nowner's husband did not come back from the war, so she was with two children by\nherself, so she needed the rent, and then the top floor was for the two uncles, the\naunt and the grandfather. But food was all at our house, everything, laundry, food,\neverything. Without refrigerator, without any, you know, fancy appliance of any kind,\nso in some ways, in some ways it was almost worse than during the war. Because\nduring the war, | had some kind of stability, | mean for the last couple of years when\n| lived in that house in Exleba, as | said, | was in terror but it was, to some extent |\nhad accommodated to the terror. There was not that much unpredictable that was\nhappening. We had our air raids and we'd run off and go to the shelters, by that time\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n| had one name and that didn't change any more and | had some sort of routine. And\nmy mother, when she was there, was there for me, there was no, she had all these\npeople that she was hiding and so on, but still, | felt that she was there, you know, for\nme. We would go to the beach together on occasion and we would do things\ntogether, whatever they were. But then she disappeared, essentially. She was\ndiluted so much to such an extent that in some ways, | felt more abandoned than\nduring the war, even though | wasn't afraid for my life. | mean, and so my, | think a\nlot of that anger was due to the fact that | was just lost, you know, just, it felt like | was\nto take care of myself plus take care of my brother. Which | had to do, | mean | had\nto babysit for him and, because we couldn't afford any help, and my mother was just\nunable to do everything, she was doing care for my brother, you know,\nday and night, so when | came home from school, | mean | had to watch my brother,\n| had to, | learned how to cook very early because | had to help for, you know, for\nmaking a meal for Friday night for 10 people without, you know, appliances, | mean\non a coal stove and it was a Friday night and for Saturday lunch and for Saturday\nevening before you could turn on the lights again. | mean, that sort of, so | had to\npitch in, come home from school Friday early and help my mother or watch my\nbrother or both and | didn't have much time to be a kid, you know. Just not much\ntime. But, the lady who rented the place had two children and one boy was about a\nyear or two older than | was at the time and he and | had become really good friends\nin the war and sort of partners in crime, you know, we could think of every possible\nmischief and we would just do it. And so we continued that. And we established, he\nwas very mechanically gifted, in fact, he's an aeronautics engineer for Israel, for the\nIsrael government, so that really panned out. And we would just build things and\nwe'd build some kind of telephone between his bed and mine and we'd go to the,\nthere was a flea market every Sunday morning and we'd go and we'd buy all these\ncomponents and we'd build radios and so dolls was really not my thing. It was erector\nsets and radios and that sort of thing. So he had a tremendous influence on me.\nUnfortunately, he left for Israel when, | mean he and his mother and sister left when\nhe was about 13, so that was a terrible loss.

        "A: Bobby, Bobby Ackleman(ph). | don't know what they call him now in Israel, but,\nand he, we would fight and he was stubborn and | was stubborn, and so we wouldn't\ntalk for weeks on end, and we'd go to school together and we'd walk one behind the\nother, without exchanging a word. And then we'd wait for each other to go home, we\nwouldn't say a word. It's very funny. We had a lot of imaginary games and then we'd,\nwe'd build swords, swords out of wood, and shields and paint them. And my favorite\nbook was the Three Musketeers, and so | would read that over and over and over\nagain. And so we'd play the Musketeers and we'd have sword fights and, so | had a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ngood time, | mean it's not like | was completely miserable at all times, but | think | was\nvery troubled, you know, a very troubled person.",

        "A: Yes, yes. And | think that carried through.

And | think he was, you know, | think we were mutually, you know,\nin love with each other. | mean, we only, because when he left for Israel, he used to\nsend me these terribly, you know, sad letters and how he missed me and, which was\nnot his type at all because he was very withdrawn and very noncommunicative with\nother people.

It was clear, at some point | came, when | was about\n17 or so and he was, at that time, he must have been 19 and then he showed some\ninterest in me which | could not respond to. You know, | just wasn't, | mean | loved\nhim as a kid and | love him still as a friend, but | wasn't interested in him romantically\nand he was, you know, so | think that sort of, | don't know, | guess by now it doesn't\nmatter any more, but there was a time when there was a break, we couldn't really\ncommunicate because | didn't want to hurt him and so we just left it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

My grandfather was\nextremely orthodox, too, so the entire household became, in fact, being Catholic was\neasy because there's nothing you have to do. You could eat whatever you want,\nyou'd go to church, but it's, you know, an act of presence, | mean you show up, that's\nit, doesn't matter much.

Finally, after perhaps a year, we hired somebody to come and do the\ndishes Friday night and to clean the house, things started improving and after they\nall got married, we moved to a different place. We moved to an apartment which, at\nthe time, well, there were other feelings, there were feelings of jealousy for people,\nmy friends, Leon(ph) and Regine(ph) and their parents, who had, we had been\ntogether for part of the war, but they had made it to Switzerland. And so they came\nback and they hadn't gone through the rest of it and they were much better off\nfinancially because the father hadn't been in concentration camp and they didn't have\nto take in the entire family, they just took in my mother's friend's mother and so, they\nmoved to a very nice place with hot water and a bathtub and | was extremely jealous.\n| was so jealous.

And at that time,\nall these people still used to come for most Friday nights with their spouses and they\nused to come for all the holidays.

And when the babies started appearing, those\nfamilies, it was all still with us. But | didn't resent it any, you know, it was, | think it\nwas controlled.

Plus Flemish, of course, which was the main, plus\nsix hours of math a week. | mean, this was really horrible, and my experience at that\nschool was terrible, just terrible because there were only two Jewish girls in it and\neven though it was really a secular school, it was a public secular school, because in\nBelgium they have, as they have here, a Catholic system that is parallel to the public\nsystem, | obviously, so the people who came to the secular schools were not\nCatholic, or at least not practicing or not very serious about their religion since they\nchose the public school. But | still felt very alienated and really not welcome. | felt\nthere was real anti-semitism there.",
        "A: Well, | couldn't tell because the Jews really lived very much in the ghetto, even\nthough they didn't live that much physically a ghetto, they lived spiritually and\nculturally in a ghetto, there was very little mixing. So the only traces of anti-semitism\nwere, | have a friend who lives down in Boston, she's several years older, and we\nsometimes speak Flemish just kind of out of, you know, out of fun and there is one\nkind of joke we have, is if we haven't heard from each other for a long time, she'll\ngreet me like in Flemish, [Flemish phrase], like, are you still alive? And she said\nthat's how they greeted her when she came back to school, like, , gee,\nyou know, | thought you were dead. So, that was the atmosphere among the\nFlemish, although many had been hiding Jews. They really then had a concerted\neffort to rescue Jewish children and hide them, but obviously, there were a fair\nnumber of people who, and you know, it's, | couldn't even say that it was vicious, it\nwas like having no clue and say, oh, you know, well, we thought you were dead, kind\nof a thing. But just imagine, when you have survived something like this, you don't\nfeel that great. And the other thing that contributed to my feeling pretty bad was that\nwe had school on Saturdays and my father didn't let me go. And so, | was already\nreally, you know, culturally deprived, | mean | was, | don't know how | managed to do\nwell in school because | did, but it was strictly grabbing things here and there and\nputting them together, but not having a coherent view of things. It was, | missed, you\nknow, a sixth of math every week, which was algebra and going on to, you know,\nhigher math and |, | really, | had a lot of trouble catching up and staying afloat.\nMissing one hour of Latin and one hour of Greek every week, and trying to make up,\nwhereas the six hours, | mean the five hours that we had were hard enough, you\nknow, to try then every week, by the time you catch on, there you go, you're missing\nthree or four or five hours of really important work. And then | had to go after Sabbath,\npick up the work from these people who weren't very friendly, they let me in their\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhouse, but like barely, and try and copy it over. | mean, it was hell. And then, when\nthe Jewish holidays came on Monday and Tuesday, so now here we go, | miss\nSaturday, of course, Sunday no school. Sunday | can't go pick up the notes because\nSunday the holiday starts early and we have to go through that routine of bathing and\ngetting ready and whatever. And so by Wednesday, | mean you can imagine how |\nfelt when | got to school. | mean, the people were talking about things | had\nabsolutely no clue about and the teacher said, \"Well, you know, you want to observe\nyour religion, that's okay with me, but I'm not going to help you. You'll just whatever,\nyou know, do it yourself\". So we did, this girl and myself, and we had six miserable\nyears. But somewhere in between, in 1951, | believe it was, my father's immigration\npapers, he had applied to come to this country in 1933, and of course, the Americans\nhad no intention of saving a single Jew so they made sure he didn't get the papers\nand they figured by, like , In '51, he'd be dead. But in '51, his number\ncame up, and so this was in sort of the middle of the Korean war and there was big\npanic in Europe that this was going to turn up to be World War Ill. And so my father\nsaid, \"I'm not going to survive another war, | just, | will not be able to do that\". So we\nall left and we came here.",
        "A: My mother, my brother, myself, my grandfather and that's it. | mean, the other\npeople were married and on their own and they weren't on his quota. | mean, they\ndid, they couldn't have come even if he had wanted them to. And, so we came and\nmy mother had a brother who lived in Borough(ph) Park, and his name was\nBlitz(ph), and he had escaped just before the war, on the last boat to\nBrazil and came then that route, with his wife and three children. And so he was\nliving in Borough Park and he helped us get a place and | hated it. Because Borough\nPark was even more orthodox than what | had seen and my mother hated it.\nBecause my mother could go along with the Antwerp orthodoxy because she, but\nthat was just too much for her. She really hated it.",
        "A: Took a boat. We took the Queen Elizabeth. And it was a fun trip, | mean, but we\ncame as immigrants with the suitcases and the, we left our apartment in Antwerp,\nactually we didn't vacate it, because my mother really wasn't sure that this was going\nto work out, and so she thought we better stick it out and see what happens. And,\nbecause by then she had established herself, she was happy in Antwerp, she had all\nher fingers into, her tentacles really, into all sorts of pots and she was really a leader\nof the community. And she had friends, they had a social life, they played cards with\nother people. She and | used to skip away occasionally for a weekend to Paris, you\nknow, go to the theater because she loved the theater. And we'd go to movies\ntogether and we just had a good time, basically, she and |. My father was pretty\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmuch on the side, he didn't participate much in these, but he didn't mind, you know,\nthat they occurred. So...",
        "A: Yeah, | had fun, | mean I...",
        "A: But | wasn't a teenager, the American teenager, we were very different. We were\nreally entirely different. So, first of all, we weren't dating as teenagers. Not at all.\nWe, most of my friends, and that's another thing, there were two, two sets of people,\nthere was one set like my friend Regine(ph), who, she belonged to a Jewish\norganization, like a youth movement. And they would meet on every Saturday, some\nZionist group, they would learn about Israel and they would sing songs and it was\nlike a bit of a, let's say, a scout type of experience. They'd go camping, but with a\nZionistic, strong Zionistic feeling.",
        "A: That was the , and | think it's still ongoing, it was part of the\nsection. Then there were other youth movements that were very left\nwing which were , and they were very Socialist and | couldn't go to that\nbecause my father would have killed me and | didn't like the other one, so my friend\nand | kind of parted the ways, parted ways. And in fact, | think | was also not much\nof a, | wasn't functioning very well in a group, | was really an individualist, too, |\ncouldn't function, | got bored. | just got bored. | went with Regine just to be with her\nfor awhile, and | really couldn't, | just couldn't do it. So | went to a couple of camping\ntrips, you know, for the summer where we, and | had a very good time, |, on those\ntrips because that was sort of further away from home and there was less control.\nAnd then, if you're with a bunch of young people camping, there isn't that much you\ncan do on a Saturday that you, you know, that you could or couldn't do, we'd go for\nhikes and we'd do all these things, so it was actually a lot of fun. And so we came\nhere and...",
        "A: | don't even know, | mean | guess first it was very luxurious and I'd go to movies\nand I'd go run around the cabins and read, there was a very good library. You know,\nwe played games like shuffleboard and things like that, you know. | don't think | met\nanyone on the boat, | didn't go dancing or, it was just luxury, | think that's what\nattracted me.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: | wasn't sure, you know, | wasn't sure because, but | wasn't that happy over at\nhome. | wasn't having a great social life really, | had a pretty miserable social life\nbecause my school mates were not Jewish, except for this one girl, and so we didn't\ndo a lot of socializing with them.",
        "A: Yeah, | think we were, they weren't Jewish and we had all these restrictions, you\nknow, on going this and going that, and so it was very hard and they didn't understand\nany of it. | mean they simply couldn't understand what we were talking about. There\nwere two, actually, | think that our first year of high school, | think we were somewhere\nnear 60, divided in three groups, one that wasn't planning to go to university, so they\nwere not the Latin, Greek types and | think two who were going to university, so out\nof 40, nine graduated. And out of those nine, there was these two Jewish girls,\nNelsie(ph) and myself. And two other girls that we have, that we did become friends\nwith over the years. And in fact, | think the Nelsie might still be in touch with at least\none of them. And | know where they are at least, you know, so it's not like they're\ntotally lost. But it took a long time, until something gelled. And at the time that | left,\nit was about, | was beginning to feel a bit better and | knew Flemish by then, and |\nwas, | was really doing very well. And so it was a little difficult to leave. But on the\nother hand, it was like a big adventure going to America, you know, it was something\nterribly attractive. And | did adjust, really, | mean | hated Borough Park.",
        "A: Only when | got here. Not at all when | was traveling, but only when we got here.",
        "A: And the people who came to pick us up were, so my grandfather, | don't know, he\nhad a number of siblings that, unfortunately, | only met one or two of them and | don't\nreally know, | think there may have been six or eight, | don't really Know. One of them\ncame here in early 1900's, and in fact, my grandfather came as well. But he went\nback to Poland, he's one of those people who came, had a pushcart and just figured,\nthis is really not for me, so he learned English, it was very funny, my grandfather\nknew English. And he went back to Poland, but one brother and a sister, | think,\nstayed here. So those people came to meet us at the boat. Now, these people had\nbeen transplanted from Poland to Borough Park, essentially, or the Bronx, | can't,\nyeah, those | think might have been in the Bronx. And they, okay.\n[end of side 1 of tape 2].\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: So we landed with our trunks and not only did we have our stuff, but my mother in\nher usual generosity, took things to deliver to, | don't Know, | really don't know how\nmany people, it was incredible. Vases and this, and | mean it was just, really it was\nridiculous. And my father was yelling at her. And | was yelling at her. But, she was\nalways on the side of the, you know, the loser and the underdog and the, you know,\nyou have to do this, you must do this, and what's the big deal, so we have one more\nsuitcase. Yes, ma, now 10 more suitcases. And who's going to drag this? And then\nyou get here and you go, first of all immigration treats you like shit, that's number\none. | mean, really awful. And you land on this pier and these people appear who\nare primitive, in my view, because, see, even though my parents didn't have a formal\neducation, my mother was anything but primitive, and the people who they\nassociated with, again, had no education, but were very, they were street wise and\nthey were, they had a veneer of worldliness about them because most them had\nbeen, they'd been to South America and America or Switzerland, so they, they had\na better, they had a much wider experience. And they had to adjust very quickly, so\nmany of them learned Spanish and then they learned French and then they learned\nGerman and they learned just to be able to stay alive and to function in those\nsocieties, so they had a veneer of worldliness, you know, and they had sort of, and\nthey were very elegant, they had beautiful apartments. These people here lived in\nthese buildings with the, you know, the fire escapes. And | had a totally different\nvision of America, which had been fed to me by the movies of the early 50's, you\nknow, with these Hollywood apartments and the little maids with the little white things.\nAnd | took a look at this, | said, \"My God, you know, this is awful\". | mean, I'd much\nrather be in Antwerp because that's really not me at all. And the first thing these\npeople would ask you is, \"How do you like America?\" You know, and having been\njust treated like garbage, | would say, \"| hate America\". And my mother was furious.\nAnd | mean, it was just a bad experience. So we moved to Borough Park and there\nis where my brother, my mother's brother, had got us a place. And he got us a place\noff some rabbi who was going to Florida for the winter because we came in the winter.\nIt happens that the rabbi's travel plans didn't work out quite as predicted, so here we\ncome, four people and the rabbi and his wife with the wig, the little girl, you know,\nsnotty nose, white socks, | mean, just, you know, from the ghetto, from Poland, this\nis how it looked to me. And we have to spend two nights with them in the same\napartment. And there were roaches there and we had left our apartment, which was\nnot luxurious, but compared to that, it was clearly Trump Tower. And so, | felt very\nbad about this whole thing and when they left, you know, at least we got, the place\nwas ours and it became a little easier. And in fact, then | started having a good time\nbecause my mother's brother who left, | told you, with his three , he left\nwith his three kids on that last boat, his daughter is about two years older than | am\nand she's wonderful, a really wonderful person. And so she was really very\nwelcoming to me and she took me with her friends, although it seemed to me she\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwas from Mars. We had, we really, we took a liking to each other immediately, but\nwe, we were so different, so completely different that | couldn't understand any of the\nstuff she did. | mean, she would, on Saturday night if she didn't have a date, she\nwould not dare put her nose out the house and | would, \"Look Renee(ph), let's go to\nthe movies\". And she says, \"No, we can't\". And | said, \"Why not?\" And she wouldn't\ntell me, you know, because | was still maybe a little too young for her to, and she\nwould have a bunch of friends, they'd come to the house and they would do their hair\nand they would do all these stupid things and they wouldn't, and | couldn't, | was just,\n| couldn't understand, but | liked her a lot and so | had fun, | think it was almost like\nan anthropological study at that time, like what are these people thinking? And then\nwe had to move to, so my mother didn't like it there in Borough Park and we moved\nto Manhattan.",
        "A: Well, this is, I'm coming to this. So after about a month, they figured, you know,\nI'm in the middle of high school, | got to go to school. So my cousin was at\nRamaz(ph), the Jewish day school. In fact, my husband was there, too.",
        "A: No, not the camp.",
        "A: The school, Ramaz, it's called. My husband was there, too, at the same time. |\ndidn't know him then. But, so, my father wanted to send me there because it was a\nHebrew school, but they wouldn't take me because | hadn't gone to Hebrew school\nall these years and | was very far, far behind. So then another recent immigrant told\nhim about the Julia Richmond(ph) High School in Manhattan, which at the time was\napparently a very, a very good public school. And so | went there. And although |\nwas, | had finished the third year of high school there in, their high school is six, |\nmean in Belgium, because of all my Latin and Greek and stuff, they didn't know what\nto do with me. So they put me in the graduating class. So again, | was like\ndisconnected from having a coherent education. And, and | didn't know English, |\nknew just a little bit from, you know, a little high school English, | mean after three\nyears of high school, how much English do you know? That's all | Knew. And so it\nwas again, a struggle to just know what was going on in class, but it was really simple.\n| mean, It was not hard.",
        "A: '51.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: '50, '51, something like that. So again, you know, | was like at sea, but at least |\ndidn't have school on Saturday. And in my view, they always had no school because\n| would go to school from eight to six. And here we'd go, the graduate, the seniors in\nhigh school, | don't know, you know, from ten to one or from, so | started enjoying\nthis, | said, \"This is a lot of fun\". I'm graduating, | don't know anything, but I'm going\nto college at, you know, 16 because I'm through, you know. And | mean, | knew it\nwas going to be a problem because | really didn't, | didn't know anything. | mean, |\nknew nothing, | just, | don't know, | just sort of skimmed by and managed to learn\nenough English to be able to read and | was here til about May. At which point my\nmother decided that it's not for her. My father was not well, my father was a sick\nman, all throughout.",
        "A: Yes, that, we were living in one of those efficiency type apartments on West 72nd,\n| don't remember what it was called, it had a name, it was a sort of hotel, apartment\nhotel. And it was fine, | mean it was much better than Borough Park and, and | met\na very nice young woman at Julia Richmond and she, she wanted absolutely to have\nme date, so she would introduce me. She thought | was this incredible kid, you know,\nbecause | was very different from everybody else. And she used to introduce me,\nthese guys who were much older, who were, you know, from Yashiva(ph) University\ntypes. And | didn't want Yashiva University types. The hat and the thing, but | mean,\n| dated a couple of times, you know, and | was very uncomfortable. The dating\nsituation was, wasn't me at all. And then my mother said, you know, my father was\nhaving horrible headaches and he wasn't feeling well and she just couldn't get used\nto the anonymity and sort of lack of interaction and the fact that her brother was in\nBorough Park and it became a whole hassle just to go to Borough Park, you know,\neverything was a hassle. In Antwerp, you can walk to most of your friend's and\neverything, you know, you can walk to downtown and you can do all your shopping\non foot. | mean, there is public transportation and people use it, but it's not like the\nnoisy subway and, you know, all of that. There's not that many, it's not crowdy and\nnoisy and filthy and, you know, scary. So we, we returned, we went back. And that\nwas, so, | think we got here probably around February and | started school at the end\nof February and | was to graduate in June, but that would have been a real mistake.\nAnd went back in May, and of course, | had missed four months of Latin and Greek\nand trigonometry and | mean, horrors. And so they said, \"Look, you can repeat a\nyear or you can try and cram\". So | said I'd try and cram. And | did, | crammed. And\n| failed only one subject and that was hist, not history, geography. So they let me\ntake a makeup and then that was it. So | made it to my grade level and continued til\nthe end and graduated in, can't remember what year, '55 | think. Somewhere around\nthere.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well, yeah, by the time we left, | actually like it because, hey, as | said, | was\ngraduating, | knew | didn't really know anything, but | thought | could fake it. And |\nwas dating, although | didn't like the scene, there was something kind of nice about\nit. And | was becoming more independent. So | don't think | was looking forward to\ngoing back to Antwerp at all. | think | was, by that time, beginning to open up to the\npossibilities of much more freedom. And the possibility of meeting a lot more people\nin may age group. In Antwerp it was extremely restricted and, as | said, there were\nsome that were going to these religious things which | wasn't going to go into. There\nwere some that were going to the non-religious one, | mean still the organized Zionist\ngroup, | couldn't join that because my father wouldn't let me and besides, as | said,\nI'm not sure | was that type. And then there was a group of very rich kids, or at least\nacted as they were, as if they were very rich, and they were very sophisticated and\nhad their hair done in nice places and we couldn't afford that. So | wasn't really\ncomfortable with them either. So | was quite isolated and had just, and then the\npressure was on to just get married. In all those groups, you know, and | mean |\ncouldn't deal with this at all. | simply couldn't deal with this. So | had two or three\nfriends, girlfriends mostly, til the end of high school. And we'd just meet in each\nother's houses and commiserate, basically. Complain about how terrible life was in\nAntwerp. And so that's how it was until | graduated high school. And a time, about,\nwhen | was studying for my big finals in high school, it was around the holiday of\nPentecost, you know, , my, one of my uncles, Myer, you know, who had\nlived with us, and his wife had taken an apartment for the month of June at the\nseashore and they invited me to come for that holiday. So | came and | brought all\nmy books to study my final exams. And | was studying on the beach because it, it\nwas the month of June and it was not high season yet, there were just families with\nyoung children. And this one guy, you know, approached me and he was a young\nman from Antwerp, but just a few years older than | was. And we started dating. So\nthen | had sort of a good time for awhile except that he wanted to get married. And |\njust didn't want to. | mean, | just did not. You know, | just knew that | had to hang\nonto what | had said and | wasn't going to cave in. And so that, didn't have a nice\nending, but | started medical school.",
        "A: In Brussels. There was no medical school in Antwerp, there is one now, there\nwasn't one. And again, that was really a mistake because | wasn't ready. | mean, |\nwas 17 and in Europe, to this day, medical school is right after high school, so there\nis, there is no college to kind of buffer. And medical school is seven years, So you\ndo all the science courses that you would normally do in college, you do in the first\nyear of medical school, all together. And in addition, you do anatomy. And the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncadavers and me, that just didn't work out very well. Not at all, | couldn't take it. So\nin fact, | became anorectic again, but again, it wasn't like, you know, | thought | was\nfat and | wasn't going to eat, but | stopped eating because, just the odor would pursue\nme and | really think that that had a connotation with the concentration camps and\nwith having seen those horrible pictures and having seen my father the way he looked\nwhen he came back. And every time I'd go, it would just sort of flash. And | would\nget sick, | mean | simply couldn't deal with it. So | was in medical school for two\nyears, but | quit. | couldn't do it. And | lost maybe 10 pounds, 15 pounds, 20 pounds,\n| was really disintegrating. So that was one problem. My other problem is, the school\nwas in Brussels and my father wouldn't let me live in the dorms, which means | had\nto commute, which means | had to get up every morning at five, be on the train at\nseven and be awake in class at eight. And come back at 7:00 at night. So that was\none very difficult, and the other thing about that was that that first year was, you know,\nmath and physics and chemistry and these were things that | just didn't know. | mean,\n| faked my way through high school, basically, but | didn't know it. And | didn't know\nit enough to jump to calculus, for instance. | mean, | just, so | was really struggling\nand | gave it up. | mean, | just couldn't handle it.",
        "A: Some.",
        "A: Yeah, actually, | traveled on the train with a bunch of, | think there we were four or\nfive. But that university, we went to Brussels and Brussels is a very anti-clerical\nuniversity. It was actually erected as a reaction to Catholicism. So they were very\nfree thinkers, | mean that was, so | think that the Jewish aspect was less of a problem\nthere. The people there were truly secular. And | don't recall feeling, you know, no,\nin fact, | made a lot of friends. Mostly men, though. And that was very bad because\nAntwerp still is, you Know, a small gossipy town. And for the daughter of Natan(ph)\nLeiser to be seen with a non-Jew was close to prostitution. | mean, | think they\nequated that essentially with prostitution. So | had a really bad reputation in Antwerp\nand my father was shattered that | would do such a thing. And there was no talking\nsense into him, you know, there was just no talking sense into him about that it meant\nnothing and, and besides, | was going to be friends with whoever | was going to be\nfriends with. And it was bad enough that | couldn't stay in town, you know, that | had\nto do this horrible thing. And | had a good time, | mean with all the difficulties, one of\nthe fellows was Jewish and is actually now a cardiologist, had, was a good\nmathematician, so we, he would train me in math on the train at seven in the morning.\nAnd he managed to make me pass which was a feat, | must tell you, this was a feat.\nAnd another friend, | mean he's, this man is a cardiologist and is very, you know,\ngood reputation, is at the University of Brussels. The other fellow is the medical\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ndirector of the chief university hospital in Antwerp. We're still in contact, not frequent,\nbut in contact. And the other one was a woman and she's a pathologist and she's\ndivorced and she has only one child. And | think that was our little group on the train.\nFour or five of us. And then there were non-Jews and we were friendly with them\nand, in fact, my friends, particularly who is the medical director of the\nMiddleham(ph) Hospital in Antwerp, he's still friends with these people that we\nstudied together, so | think the religion was not important there. At that point it\nbecame completely, just irrelevant. These people were really very free thinkers and\neducated and it was no longer a problem. And | don't think, at that point, that |\nconsidered it as much as a problem as | did, you know, before where |, | felt\ndiminished and | felt inferior. | did feel inferior. And | was struggling, you know, just\nto keep afloat. And there, | was struggling, but it had no longer to do with not going\nto school on holidays as much as it had to do with my really lack of preparation in\nvery serious subjects and then my unability, inability to deal with dead bodies. | mean\nthat was a serious, but it had nothing to do with being Jewish per se, you know.",

And as\nyou get older, the rest of you becomes not so nice, so | hang onto a few things that\nare still reasonably looking. My hair is one of them, so | don't know if there's\nsomething more than what you would expect, you know, to favor the things that are\nstill nice about you. You know, as you're kind of getting into the twilight.",
        "A: Well, he looked like a skeleton, he looked awful and his teeth were moving, his\nhair had fallen out, he had, his feet were huge, | mean his legs were swollen from,\nyou know, when you don't eat protein and you sort of, everything turns into water, so\nhe had swollen legs. And he weighted 80 pounds, you know, | mean, and he was\ntaller than | am. And I'm not very tall, but | weigh 100 pounds and I'm really not that\nfat, so considering a man who was, you know, five six, he wasn't tall, but | mean he\nwas five six, five seven or somewhere around there, to weight 80 pounds, that's\npathetic. | mean, his cheeks were sunken and he could barely breathe, you know,\nhe was every, you know, inhaling was like you'd heard noises and it was terrible. It\nwas scary. | mean, it was really, really scary and then he had these nightmares and\nthen he was very irritable, extremely irritable, and he'd get angry and he'd yell and |\nhad never saw him like, | didn't remember him this way. | mean, he wasn't that way.\nSo, it was very hard. Very hard.",
        "A: Dropped out of medical school and didn't really know what to do with myself. But\n| Knew | wanted to study, you know, | just figured this is like a break. And |, | went\nand worked for a year or so.",
        "A: Well, again, you know, | was sort of an, essentially because | was a con artist, you\nknow, and like | faked my way through school, | faked my way through elementary\nschool, | more or less faked my way through high school, faked my way through, you\nknow, to graduate here, | mean it was all, | Knew enough to put together something\nthat looked fine, but it was really not fine in depth. And so, this one person | knew\nwho is now in Boston, Mimi(ph), she, she lost her father during the war and she and\nher brother and mother lived in Antwerp and Mimi ts still a very strong individual and\nshe decided there was no future for them at all in Antwerp and so they were going to\nimmigrate to the States. And they did. And she worked as an office manager for a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nman who is American who had this business in scrap plastics, so he'd buy plastics\nfrom factories and he would sell them all over Europe and | guess they would recycle\nthem essentially. And so he was a German Jew who lived in the States and he would\ncome every summer to Antwerp to sort of oversee his business, the rest of the time,\nshe was running the office. So, | took that job. | knew nothing. He could only speak\nGerman, this man, and we'd correspond in German and, or some English, but mostly\nGerman. | needed to do accounting and | didn't know anything about it. | needed to\nsell stuff and quabble over the price and | hate, | mean | was 19, you know, | had no\nidea. But somehow she trained me in a couple of months to, again, present a credible\npicture, not, not really knowing what | was doing but enough to, and | remember\nclearly, clients coming in and they were looking for the boss, you know. | said, \"Well,\n| represent him\". And they were like, \"Oh, my God, you know, what is this?\" Because\n| looked very, very young, very young. | mean now maybe, | look my age, but then |\ndidn't, | really, | looked 15 at the most, at the most, and that was stretching it because\n| couldn't get into movies where you had to be 17 without ID, | mean they wouldn't let\nme in at all. And so, but I, | really did an okay job, you know, | didn't lose the man\nany money, maybe | didn't do as well as someone who really Knew what they were\ndoing, but | managed the office and there was two secretaries and there was a like\nchief accountant, but | had to present the stuff in the way that this person could, and\n| was their boss, which was really laughable. But | did it, | did it for a year and then |\nsaid this is clearly not my avocation. And | told my mother that | was going to go to\nSwitzerland to study because | couldn't do it in Belgium because | wasn't going to be\nable to, this commuting business wasn't for me. And she supported me, you know,\nshe supported me. And | left for Switzerland, not knowing at all what | was going to\ndo, not knowing anybody there.",
        "A: No, | didn't go to med school, | wasn't accepted into anything, | just took my\nluggage, | went on a night train, | got to Geneva at six in the morning with coffers and\ncoffers, you know, because my mother had packed God knows what, and stood there\nand had no idea where to go. And finally managed to get a cab and there was a\nJewish , aS I've figured, well, I'll go there. At least somewhere to park\nmy stuff. And | did, went there, and put my stuff and immediately figured that | didn't\nwant to stay there for very long because it was one of these orthodox things again\nand | said, \"That's really lovely, I'll stay a couple of nights, but I'm not staying\". And\nso there were some other students there, obviously, and they helped me find a, you\nknow, they helped me through the ropes of getting a newspaper and finding a place\nto stay. And | found a room to stay. And then | went to register and, honestly, | didn't\nknow for what. | really didn't Know. And I'm standing on line, you Know, in front of\nthe register, you know, the teller essentially. And there was these two Swiss girls\nand they're talking and we started talking, | asked them what are you registering for,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand they said, \"Oh, we're going for a degree in biology\". | said, \"Okay, I'll do that,\ntoo\". | mean, it sounds really idiotic, but that's how it happened. So! went and | got\na degree in biology.\nEnd of Tape 2.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nTape 3",
        "A: And so we registered, the three of us, and we became really good friends, in fact,\nI'm still friends with them now. Once every two or three months, she'll give me a call,\njust out of the blue, one of them, the other, then | hear from this, from the second\none, , just Christiana(ph) is the one that I've kept in touch with, but |\nalways hear about Christiana. And that's how | started a biology degree and\nsomewhere in the midst of all of that | met my husband. | met one woman who is an\nIsraeli and I'm still very friendly with her, in fact, she called me on Saturday. And she\nwas in the interpreter school, oh yeah, that's the other thing, all the girls who went to\nschool to Switzerland were in interpreters. | didn't want to do that because | still had\nmy views on a real job, you know. And something that | was interested in. So biology\nwas just, just great. My friend that | met, Elana(ph), was an Israeli woman who was\njust a lot of fun, she's a great gal. And she was in interpreter school, so we became\nreally good friends and | had these two Swiss girls, Christiana and Josiana(ph), and\nwe became good friends. So immediately | had a group of friends. And so, of course,\nmy parents were very worried about, is she ever going to get married. And | said,\n\u201cLook, I'm going to study, | don't know what I'm going to study, but I'm going to study\nsomething and I'm not getting married\". So they were very upset because there had\nbeen several candidates in between that | didn't mention from this fellow whom | met\nat age 17. There was a bunch of them and | didn't like any of them, | always had an\nexcuse. And one was even a physician and, because | said, well this is uneducated,\nthis is this, this is that, what's with the doctor? You know. | said, \"I just don't love\nhim. That's it. | don't love him. I'm not marrying somebody | don't love and that's\nthat\". So, they were getting really concerned and by that time | was 21, 22, and this\nis really getting to be the old maid. So everybody was concocting, you know, to have\nme meet men. So unbeknownst to me, there were relatives of his in Antwerp who,\nhe had relatives there who he used to come and visit for holidays and so on. They\ntold him about me, about this nice Jewish girl and, you know, when you're 22 and\nsomebody tells you, nice Jewish girl, you say, oh, yeah, right. The same family told\nme about him and | said, \"Anybody who needs to be introduced by his uncle, | don't\neven want to know about\". So, but | didn't say anything, | said, \"Oh yeah, really\".\nAnd | knew some of, there were a lot of American students studying medicine in\nGeneva at the time. Those who were essentially there because they were Jews\nbecause there was clearly a quota of not admitting Jews to medical school in the\nUnited States. So they came to Switzerland and he was one of them.",
        "A: Well, he was born in Belgium, came here during the war, went back with his family,\nof course, in 1946, but for some reason or other, his parents couldn't get used to\nAntwerp again, they went back to the States. So he was essentially raised here from\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe age of four on. Went to Columbia College, did extremely well, but for the quota\nreason didn't make it into medical school right away, they wanted him to wait another\nyear, it was very complicated, he said, screw you, I'm going to Switzerland. So he\ncame to Switzerland. And so this is how people were kind of planning to get us\ntogether. So | knew some of the other medical students who were there and | told,\nso | must say, | had seen Sylvan(ph) and | didn't know who he was, but he was really\nhandsome. And | said, gee, and he looked totally non-Jewish, blue eyes, light hair,\njust what | needed. And so | really wanted to meet him. And | told someone, \"Do\nyou know this guy Sylvan Kleinhaus?\" He said, \"Yeah, he's in, you know, my\nmedical\". | said, \"Just point him out to me because | want to make sure that | don't\nmeet him\". So next time we are in the cafeteria together, he says, \"That's him\". |\nsays, \"No\". So he said, \"Yes,\" he said, \"Why no?\" | said, \"Oh, that's a long story, I'm\nnot telling you why\". So we met and interestingly enough, he knew my friend Elana,\nseparately, independently. And so we became really, the three of us, you know, very\nclose and she was dating another medical student at the time. And so we met and\nwe Started to date and we got married about a year later. Even though | said, I'm not\ngetting married.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, that | didn't mind, you know, that I, see | will go for the form, | still, I'll\ngo, | go to synagogue now and | attend on the high holidays and | bitch throughout\nthe entire thing, but it's, but | am, it's an ethnic identification. | feel in some ways,\nextremely Jewish, | have very, very strong feelings for Israel, my brother lives there\nand his family. My brother who was born in 1946, with his children and | love his\nfamily. And all, practically all the cousins that were born to these people who lived\nwith us, as | told you, they all live in Israel. And, and | went there for one summer\nafter | graduated high school, so | really took a love for this country. For a variety of\nreasons. And | think that's probably where the war has marked me the most, is that\n| feel so strongly identified as a Jew and | cannot stand it when anybody makes any\nkind of comment, you know, about Israel or Jews or, it just makes me completely\ncrazy, even though | don't agree with everything that the Israeli government does and\nit's not like I'm a totally right wing fanatic, not at all, but | just can't stand criticism from\npeople who aren't Jewish, | just cannot. | always feel that it's tainted, that is' not\nstrictly on political grounds. So to that extent maybe | have a certain amount of\nparanoia that | can trace back to the war. | mean, maybe that's where it's most visible.",
        "A: Yes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well, there's so much, you know. | went to Israel as a, essentially, a graduation\npresent because one of my father's sisters who had, had gone to Israel in 1933. So\nwhen my father came to Belgium, she, or shortly thereafter, maybe '36 or so, went to\nIsrael as a pioneer essentially, went to kibbutz. She was clearly not orthodox, or\nbecame not orthodox, | don't know what she had been at home. And so she was\nliving there, she married there, she had two children there and so my father sent me\nto her for the summer after | graduated.",
        "A: Yeah, '55 or so.",
        "A: Yes. And height of poverty, height of rationing, height of really primitive conditions.\n| mean, my aunt and her three, the three other members of her family lived in two\nrooms, essentially.",
        "A: It was in Tel Aviv. And | went there and | have a cousin who is about approximately\na year younger or so, | can't, | don't know exactly, we're certainly the same generation\nexcept that she was a Sabra(ph) and | was born under different circumstances. And\nunfortunately, when | came there, she was quite ill, she had kidney stones and so,\nshe's suffered from that since then, she's never been entirely well, although she's\nhad, you know, a fairly normal life, but she's had health problems throughout. And\nshe knew only Hebrew and | didn't Know any, or you know, again, three years of\nelementary school, that was not exactly sufficient to, so | was in a sort of desperate\nstate because | wanted to meet people. So | just really by force learned Hebrew, you\nknow, just kept asking her, what's this, what's that, | mean just continuously and the\ndictionary. And by the end of the three months, | was fluent. Really fluent. Don't\nknow how to write, still to this day, | write terribly and | read very slowly, but when |\nspeak, people think I'm a native from those three months there. So, and | made a lot\nof friends. And it was just lovely because my aunt wasn't religious. And so Friday\nnight we'd go to parties and, you know, it was just a completely different, and then,\nwhereas in Belgium, you know, you felt Jewish because you were ghettoized and\nbecause of my experience in high school, over there, it was just a wonderful feeling.\nAnd at the time, the country was just so safe. You just could go anywhere. And |\nwould hitchhike across the whole country and nobody thought anything about it, you\nknow, it was just a normal thing to do. Nobody locked their doors, it was just\nwonderful. So | did that before | started medical school, so that was my graduation\nfrom high school. And | met a fellow there who also became a boyfriend and who\ndragged in my life for several years on and off because he was in Israel and he was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\na painter. He's dead now, unfortunately, because several years ago | went back to\nIsrael actually looking for him and someone told me he had died. So...",
        "A: Before graduation. Yeah, we, because | got married a year after | started school.\nAnd so | was 23. And | moved into his place, he had a little studio, and he was in\nmedical school, so we got married in April and...",
        "A: 1960. A long time ago. And we, the summer, we came here because he had\nwanted to transfer to an American medical school. And he got several interviews.\nHis parents lived on West 96th and Central, not Central, Riverside Drive. And we\nwere married in April and | did not want to go live with his parents. And they couldn't\nunderstand it. So we, domineering people, particularly the father, and | insisted that\nwe move to our own place. | said, \"I don't care if it's a hole, but a place of our own\".\nAnd we did, they did get us a place in the Windermere (ph) Hotel, which was west\nsomething or other, 90, 91st, I'm not sure, and Broadway, | think it was. Or, yeah, |\nthink it was Broadway. But we, it was very difficult. | came here, he started to do\nsome externships (ph) and interviewing in medical school and then | said, | wasn't, |\ndidn't finish, | mean | was still, had | think a year or two to go. And | started looking\nat various colleges to see how | could continue what | was doing. And it looked\nextremely difficult because the curriculum wasn't the same and over there it was only\nscience, but here in college, you needed all these core courses of English, literature\nand so on and |, really had already lost two years of medical school, one year of\nworking, | didn't want to start, | was on the track and | just didn't want to get off it now.\nSo we had some difficult times right after we got married because to him it was\ncertainly much more enticing to transfer to a medical school, get an American degree\nand have not to deal with any of this foreign business. But to me, it was hell. And\nalso, | must tell you that Geneva was, and perhaps still is, but it was paradise on\nearth, it was just beautiful. Just, just beautiful. And we had, you took in life, you\nknow, we were very much in love, we loved what we were doing, the surroundings\nwere beautiful, you Know, | mean we'd go to the lake, Lake, now | hear it's totally\npolluted, but you know, lunchtime we'd go and swim, we'd take boat rides, we'd go\nup in the mountains. | mean, his parents were very wealthy so he had a car and |\nmean, we just had a life, the best life, you know, no responsibilities except to our\nstudies. And really enjoy life, for me, almost | would say for the first time, really, really\nenjoying my life. | mean, | had had moments, you know, that | had a good time and\nwhen | was in Brussels | had a good time and when | went to Israel | had a good time\nand here and there | had a good time, but | had mostly | was somber, you know.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: | think probably by the time | got to Geneva | sort of had that straightened out. |\nbecame, you know, happy and | stopped, maybe |, | still, I'm still nasty to people |\ndon't like. | mean, | have a certain level of tolerance, but once that's exceeded |, |\nthink I'll go absolutely through fire for people that | love, | mean | will leave no stone\nunturned and | will, you Know, even harm myself, but | will not, | have very little\ntolerance for people that | don't tolerate, so, when they reach the point where | can't\ntake them any more, there is almost no, there's almost no return. So I'm not tolerant,\nI'm very intolerant. But I'm not nasty. Not anymore, | don't think I'm, | don't think\npeople think I'm nasty, but | am not very tolerant.",
        "A: My in-laws are a big pain in the neck. Big pain in the neck because they want to\ncontrol us and | didn't want to be controlled. Never did | want to be controlled, and\nthe last thing | wanted to be controlled by is my in-laws. Because | must say that, as\nsoon as | got married, | mean okay, my parents, you Know, my mother supported me\ngoing to Switzerland, my father did not put up a fight. | mean, he sort of gave in and\nsupported me financially. And from that moment on, except trying to, you know,\nmanipulate me to getting married, they became extremely non-meddling in my life.\nYou know, and I, once | get married, they totally unmeddled. | mean, completely and\nremarkably so for my father. He said nothing, he knew that we didn't observe the\nSabbath, he said, he never said a word anymore. Never. Which was, in retrospect,\nreally remarkable. With my in-laws, it was just the opposite. And | really couldn't\ntake it, | could not take that acting, they wanted me to be a certain way and | was\nnothing like it. My mother-in-law never did anything outside of the house, she was a,\npretty much a slave to her husband. And they expected me to be that way, you know,\nand | really had told Sylvan when we met and we started dating that | was going to\nhave a career and | wasn't quite clear yet as to what it would be and how | would\nmanage it, because | had no model, you know, to go by. But | would do that. | was\nnot going to be a housewife, under any circumstance was | going to be a housewife.\nSo, and even though he came from a really different picture, | think he just loved me\nenough to agree with it in principle, maybe he didn't know exactly what it would entail,\nbut at least he was able to say, \"Yes, I'll go along with it\". And he did, | mean he\nreally did. But, his parents were up in arms. So while we were still there, one\nprofessor from an American university, so we went back to Switzerland because |\nreally didn't want to stay. And reluctantly he agreed to come back. And we went\nback to Geneva and we were there for another three years. And while | finished my\ndegree, | got a job as a teaching assistant.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: In Geneva, in the department of physiology.",
        "A: The University of Geneva, it's called. And | got two jobs, two part-time jobs which\nturned out to be two full-time jobs. You know, | was just wanted, by that time | was\nreally interested in science. And the professor who had taught us physiology was\njust amazing and | wanted to work of him in the worst possible way. And it was also\none of the plumb jobs, was to work for this, to be an assistant to Professor\nwas like. | can't even describe it to you. And | managed to get a job\nlike that. Because normally he would only give it to medical students, but | impressed\nhim enough, | took his course and | got the maximum in all three parts of the test, so\nhe said, \"Okay, I'll take you\". So | worked there and | worked in the Department of\nBiology part-time. And while | was there, a man came from the States, he was a\nprofessor of pharmacology at Downstate(ph) Medical Center in Brooklyn, he was\nthere on sabbatical. And | asked him if he would take me as a graduate student.\nAnd this was completely against all rules because you had to take GRE's and you\nhad to have this and that and the other, so | really kind of manipulated him and finally\nhe just said okay, you know. So he was staying another six months when we went,\nwe came to the States, Sylvan got an internship.",
        "A: And that was 1963. He got an internship and | was admitted to the Ph.D. program\nat Downstate on this man's word, no papers, no nothing corresponding to what the\nrequirements were here. And he said, \"But, you better do well, because really, I'm\nputting my head on the block for you, so you better do well\". So with this admonition,\n| started graduate school. Again, | had really a language problem because the only\nEnglish | had learned was for those three months when | was at Julia Richmond High\nand that was very hard to study, you know, science in that language. | mean, | really,\nso it was an adjustment period again, but | mean that was, | knew some English, |\nwasn't totally, it's not like when the first time | came.",
        "A: Yeah, it was. So | came, but the second time | was doing nothing because | was\ndepressed, what | did that summer, we were here for that summer, | went every single\nday to the , which is, that, you know, that, | don't Know if you know that\nmovie house, because they were showing foreign films. And | would just go in there\nas soon as they opened and | would stay til dinnertime. And | couldn't care less about\nanything else. Saw a lot of very good movies. And | was sometimes alone in the\nmovie, you know. And I'd come home and we'd go and have dinner at his folk's\nhouse because we had to have dinner at his parent's house every night. And | was,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n| cannot say how miserable. So essentially, you know, | pretty much put an\nultimatum, you know, if we go back, we go back, if not, I'm not staying married.\nBecause | can't, | can't deal with this whole scene and not being able to really finish\ncollege within a year, you know, having to do all these extra things, | didn't want to\ndo that at all. So as | said, we went back and | met Professor Firchcot(ph) and\nmanaged to convince him to take me on to school, which he did. And | came to\ngraduate school and studied for five years in Brooklyn and in the meantime, those\nfive years were terrible, terrible years again because he was an intern so, and then\nhe became a surgeon, resident in surgery, which was every other night on call, every\nother night, every other weekend away from home. Brooklyn compared to Geneva\nwas, | mean it's like moving to, you know, Haiti or something, coming from, you know,\nlet's say coming from | don't know a fancy town, let's say Monterey, California going\nto, you know, Haiti or something, you know, Port Au Prince where the colored folks\nlive, | mean that's what Brooklyn was, it was awful. Awful. And, but, and | was alone,\n| had no friends, studying was really tough because | had, on top of that, this fear of\nhaving to do well. You know, this absolute panic of having to really, you know,\nperform, to not put this man to shame. So, and | made friends there, | mean it, but\nthe intolerable was that, that Brooklyn is horrible and | was alone a lot and | made\nfriends and the friends, | was also an oddity, you know, they used to call me this cute\nlittle French girl, you know, that was the, and everybody was attracted to me because\n| was different. You know, | was a completely different type of person, different\nbackground, different everything.",
        "A: Well, they didn't know the difference. Belgium, they had no idea what that was,\nso French was fine, | looked French, you know, according to their idea, just as, you\nknow, the Bronx didn't look to me like Hollywood, in their view | looked French\nbecause, you know, | did, | mean Belgium and France aren't that different and the\nclothing was French and the haircut was French and my demeanor | suppose was\nmuch more French than it was American. You know, if you took it this way. And |\nmade some good friends there that I'm still, well, at least one of them I'm still in touch\nwith. And others I'm occasionally in touch with, but, and here and there | run into\nsome of the men. But! was friendly with two women and the others were all men\nand we were very friendly, but | was the only married one, so it was a bit different\nbecause | couldn't really date anyone and | couldn't really, but | did go out with a\nbunch of people and we used to hang out in the village. | must say that over all it\nwas pretty bad, but it wasn't, there were some good moments. | mean, | enjoyed\nwhat | was doing, | enjoyed my research and | enjoyed my friends, but | didn't like my\nloneliness and, and then | had a child.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: That was 1964. So, July, 1964, and his name is Jean Pierre and he's now 32.\nAnd made it much more difficult for me to continue, but | said | was going to do it, and\nI'm going to do it. And so my mother sent me an au pair from Belgium. And\nessentially, kept me going with help until my youngest child was about, | think when\nBrian was six, | think, so for about 10 years.",

        "A: She sent me au pairs and we've had ups and downs with them. There were good\nones, there were bad ones. There was one who left us. The arrangement was that\nwe paid for their trip and we paid them a salary which was not a high salary, but it\nwas a Salary, you know, enough, and of course, room and board, and air ticket. So\nwe changed every year and one year, we had one who, so she came with us, we\nused to go, every summer we used to go home, to my parents. And my parents\nrented a house at the beach and we all went and it was just wonderful because my\nmother was just, | mean we'd come there and she rented these gorgeous homes,\nsomething like this type of home. And in fact, some of the furniture | have is\nreminiscent of that type of furniture. And she's always have, by that time they were\ndoing well and so she had full-time help, and she would just absolve me of any\nresponsibility of any kind and we'd come and we'd each have our rooms and in each\nroom there was new things hanging, clothes for me, clothes for the kids, | mean it\nwas just amazing. And so, of course, | loved going back. And so we would hire, |\nmean she would hire somebody, she would, the person would spend the month of\nAugust with us there and then come back with us and the plan was that they would\ncome back in August. One of them quit in May, she just disappeared. She left for\nthe weekend and she never came back, which was a terrible thing for me. My son\nJeane Pierre was two at the time.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: | was in school. And well, my mother-in-law didn't want to take care of him. So |\nflew home with my kid, left him to my mother and came back.",
        "A: Well, | didn't have money, she did, my mother had, she paid for it. Just flew for\nthe weekend back and forth, dropped off the child, came back to school. No, | had\nvery little money, we were making a grand total of $4,000 between the two of us. So,\nnot even enough to pay the rent, but our parents were helping us out. They really\nwere, so both, | mean his parents helped very nicely financially, but there were strings\nattached to it. And it was difficult. | mean, that relationship remained difficult for a\nlong time.",
        "A: Yeah, in the sense that | put them in Jewish school. And, but | didn't, | mean we\nobserved all the holidays, | mean | lit, and | still do, light candles Friday night, but |\nthought that this was sort of a nice family thing to do. | never told them that there\nwas a God or that they had to believe in God. It was all sort of for, really, tradition.\nAnd ethnic identification. So | never forced them to do anything, so but, we did\nobserve the holidays because | thought they were nice. | mean, | made the Sader\nand Roshhosana(ph) and all these holidays, | mean we always made big dinners, |\nstill do when | can and invite lots of people just as it had been at home. But, | mean,\n|, they, none of my kids are religious. None of them are, so, and | really don't think\nthey feel any guilt towards it at all, you know.",
        "A: Yeah. We do itt traditionally, but the truth is, we usually, it's tradition, but it's, we\nlaugh a lot, you know, we joke around the things that are being said, | mean when\nthe kids were younger we did it more authentic because they were learning the stuff\nin school and so they wanted to read parts of it, etcetera, etcetera. And so we did tt,\nbut now we do it and we go through the whole thing and usually we do it, you know,\nsome of the kids come home, some of our friend's kids, | mean there are a little bit\neverywhere, some are married, some aren't, we try and do it together with some of\nthe people that we've always done it.",
        "A: | got my doctorate.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: In pharmacology. From Brooklyn. And by the time | got my, well, what happened\nis this, | was writing my thesis, being pregnant with my second child, and Sylvan\nfinished all his residencies in general surgery and decided to do a specialization in\nchildren's surgery. So there were several possible places where he could do it and |\nsaid, we have to get out of this country. | mean, Brooklyn was such a bad experience\nthat | equated all of America to Brooklyn and | said, \"I got to get out of here\". So we\nwent to Montreal. And he did a specialty training, sub-specialty training in a Catholic\nhospital there, a French one.",
        "A: That was, well, Karin was born 1967, Jeane Pierre in 1964, he was, | think it was\n\u201866, starting \u201866.",
        "A: Montreal and | went there pregnant with the second child, starting a post-doctoral\nfellowship, but not having really defended my thesis. So | continue writing and we\nkeep sending back and forth between my sponsor, back and forth, and, but | started\nto work as a post-doctoral like this. Which was a terrible thing, too, because when |\nwent for the interview | didn't tell them that | had a child because at that time, to be a\nwoman was really not a plus. To be married was even less of a plus, to have one\nchild was pretty much lethal and to be pregnant with a second was, you were, had\nzero chances of getting any kind of position in science, none, zero. So | didn't tell\nthem | was pregnant. But then, you know, comes where it 's kind of\nhard. | don't know, | was so panicky. When | got there | said, \"Look, you know, |\nwasn't forthright, but I've got one child and the second one is on the way. But, |\npromise you | will work, | will continue to work\". And he was not pleased, the man\nwas not pleased at all. But, | had gotten an MRC Fellowship which was also quite\nprestigious and | had gotten that really based on recommendations from the people\nwho had trained me. So he necess, he really didn't have to pay me, | was getting it\nfrom the Canadian government, so he figured, okay, I'm not wasting that much\nresources on this person. And so, | went to McGill(ph) and he went to San\nTristine(ph), which is the French hospital, but since he spoke French, having studied\nin Switzerland, there was no problem and they were very grateful to have an\nAmerican who spoke French. That was a nice touch to it. And, so we were in McGill,\n| mean Canada, and then Karin was born over there. | went back to work five days\nafter she was born. And, because I, you know, | felt that | had to, | just felt that | had\nto do this. And | read the last draft of my thesis in the hospital, having had the baby.\nAnd flew to New York to defend my thesis six weeks after | gave birth, and it was\nvery funny because | couldn't sit, you know, | was really torn and | mean it was, |\nstood the entire flight and when | got to Brooklyn, | had to defend a thesis. And my\nthesis director wanted to do me a big favor and requested from the committee that |\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nshould be allowed to sit. Because | had just given birth. And | said, \"No way. I'm\nnot sitting\". | said, \"| sat on the plane, | just want to stand\". You know, and all men,\nof course. And, so | defended the thesis and that was fine and we went back to\nMontreal and we were there until 1971 where he finished his training and | kind of\nfinished my doctorate, my post-doctorate fellowship, but | didn't have a job coming\nback. So | figured | have to get a job after he gets his because, obviously, he's going\nto be making much more money than | am. And my job would never be that reliable\nas a scientist. So he got the job and we came back, we bought a house, actually his\nfather bought us a house because we certainly couldn't afford a house, and his father\ndied right after. It was terrible. By that time, | was pregnant with the third one, so...",
        "A: The house was in New Rochelle. And Sylvan was working at Montefure(ph) and\nthat's where he got, he's been working there ever since. So |, well, things kind of fell\napart in that, again, | was moved to a place where | didn't know anyone. Now I'm two\nand a half children, a mother-in-law who is in total depression. And she became like\na burden, she just wouldn't do anything and she'd come every weekend and we'd\nhave to pick her up and bring her home. And on the weekend | didn't have help\nbecause this one lady that we had hired came when Karin was six, six months old,\nby the time we came back she was three, we came back, and she followed us. So\nshe came from Belgium to Montreal and she came with us to the States, so she\nseemed like she was going to be there for awhile and that was a big help. But on the\nweekends she was off and so | was overwhelmed, | literally was overwhelmed.\nBetween my mother-in-law and the kids and the pregnancy and not knowing anybody\nand it was not a good time. And, you know, the mourning of my father-in-law. And,\nso, but decided that | wasn't going to look for a job being pregnant because with three\nthis clearly wasn't going to work. So | didn't, | stayed home for about eight months.\nAnd towards the end of my pregnancy, | started sending letters to people who had\nbeen my professors in graduate school and who had now moved on to being chair,\nyou know, chairmen in big, big departments like Columbia and so on and so forth.\nAnd | said that they have to help me in the letter, and at least grant me an interview.\nSo, one or two of them did, and one in particular, | told him, \"Look, everybody says\nthat it's no point, there is no point training women because they have children and\nthey don't work. I'm trained, | have children, but | want to work. So, are you going to\nhelp me or not?\" So he could say, he couldn't say no, so he got me a job as a\nresearch associate for, at Rockefellow University which is, obviously, very\nprestigious. And | was there for about a year and then started sending out all my\nCV's(ph) and landed a job at Yale. So | started working there in the Department of\nNeurology and became the assistant professor. And worked at Yale from about 1973\ntil '89. And sort of rose through the ranks, made it, | didn't make it to full professor,\nbut | made it to research professor because | was in a clinical department and so |\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncouldn't really become, not having the MD degree, | couldn't become a real professor,\nfull professor. And | commuted from New Rochelle to Yale which was 125 miles a\nday and did quite well, you know, established a reputation and, you know, raised the\nkids, | mean all kinds of good and bad things, you know, with the kids as usual. And\nthat's it. In 1989, | moved to New York Medical College where | am now a full\nprofessor and have my own lab, teach medical students, . That's it, my\nkids, you know as | said, Jeane Pierre is married, is business, he looks very happy\nand | really like his wife. And more than that, | think she likes me which is a rare\noccurrence because |, | know exactly what not to do. And | also know what to do.\nAnd Karin is in medical school and she's going to be, become an obstetrician. And\nBrian is sort of getting his master's, but he's a little bit in limbo as to what he wants to\ndo with it. But, I'm sure he'll find a job. And so there |, there | am.",
        "A: Hmmm?",
        "A: Songs? No, that one that | sang to you, | Know it had to do with , but\nnow | cannot remember it, | simply can't. Funny because, you know, my mother died\nin January, she was 84 years old, she remembered those songs. She remembered\nthe songs that | had sang to her coming back from that home.",
        "A: No. But, | don't feel any allegiance to any nationality. You know, we lived in\nSwitzerland, we lived in the States, we lived in Canada, | went, in between my two\njobs, | went to Israel for six months, did a sabbatical. Between Yale and this, and felt\nvery much at home, so | think I'm really, truly multi-cultural and, but of a certain type\nof culture. | mean, I'm not, | don't think | would do very well in Africa, that's not me.\nBut, in let's say, again you know, you could say I'm elitist, but among civilized\npeoples, or so-called civilized people, | manage extremely well. All over the world.",
        "A: Well, | have a picture, for instance, | have a picture of when | was in France in\nExleba, sitting on my bed with my teeth falling out, you know, this really ugly duckling.\nAnd I'm, you know, I'm smiling and I'm saying to myself, \"That's really not how | felt\".\nYou know, when | think back, it's not how | felt. And | have pictures of being this\nterrified little girl in the shelter at night, that comes back. You know, this unbelievably\nhelpless kid that, that comes back frequently, and then anger comes up. That's why,\nas | said, when | read things about Israel and, | mean | just, | really lose it, | can't deal\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwith that very well at all. And something which, you know, is maybe anti-\n, If you wish, is that, | don't have a lot of sympathy for the, you know, the\ndemands that the blacks make on us because | feel that I've had it so much worse, |\nfeel absolutely no responsibility for their plight. Zero. And I'm personally, you know,\ntouched when they say something about Jews. | mean, that just kills me. And | had\na very, very liberal attitude when | first came to this country and |, among the graduate\nstudents, there was one black fellow and | was the only one who was friendly with\nhim. You know, really friendly, | mean |, and | didn't even know that there was a\nproblem. But, what I've heard in this country and the evolution of the black\nmovement, you know, blaming the Jews and this has just turned me off completely.\nAnd the failure to take, you know, responsibility for their own lives, | think is really\nentirely their failure and | think I'm a prime example of why terrible things in childhood\ndo not necessarily lead to, you know, becoming a criminal or a drug addict or\nanything, you know, so dysfunctional. | mean, | know that | was a dysfunctional child,\nfor sure, | mean | was not normal, definitely wasn't normal. And | had real anger and\nreal, | mean you know, they say these kids grow up with drive-by shootings and stuff,\nbut who is shooting? Their own is shooting. | was terrified with bombs were falling\nand they were aimed in my country, towards me. And for reasons | couldn't\nunderstand at all. There was absolutely nothing that made, gave that any kind of\nlogic, you know, | didn't look any different, | did very well at church, you know, | mean\n| could pass for one, it wasn't hard at all. And | knew, though, that if somebody found\nout, | would be dead. And so that was really, it was petrifying and | knew that | didn't\nfunction, you know, like a normal child should function. And, you know, | definitely\ndidn't eat. | could go days without eating at all. And | didn't miss the food.",
        "A: Oh, definitely. Definitely. Because, for instance, when | left Yale it wasn't all sweet,\na new chairman came in and he essentially wanted to change the whole tenant of\nthe department, and he gave me a really tough time, others as well. But the others\nwere MD's and they were geographically mobile. And | had to go find a job and | was\n50 years old at that time, and a woman scientist, again, not a great pedigree. | mean,\n| had a good pedigree in terms of, you know, | had proven myself. But still, and |\nmanaged to land one, you know, just by never giving up. | just never give up, | mean\n| don't give up. So! know I'm a Survivor, for sure. | mean, absolutely. And you know,\n| live in luxury, but | went for six months to Israel on this sabbatical and | really lived\nin a dump and | was very happy. It just didn't matter. | don't have attachment to\nmoney, | mean, | spend a lot of money, but it's, | have it, | spend it, | don't have it,\nokay. You know, it doesn't mean anything. | have no attachment to Belgium, no, |\nmean everywhere | go, | feel at home.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Some facet of me feels at home. You know, | go to France and they think I'm\nFrench. | go to Belgium and they think I'm Belgian. I'm here and people think I'm\nAmerican. | mean, nobody ever thinks I'm not. | do have some accent, but | mean,\n| met a guy from Seattle and he heard me speak French and German and whatever,\nto a bunch of people, he said, \"Jesus, you're really the only American | know who\nspeaks that many languages\". | said, \"Well, I'm not American\". Then ,\n| said, \"Don't you hear?\" He said, \"No, | thought you were from the East\". Because\nthere are so many different people in the States that you can't really identify and |\nspeak well enough that you cannot say that this is not my native tongue. And so, |\ncan pass everywhere. I'm transparent, you know. | mean, I'm a little bit like a\nchameleon in, at least, outwardly. | can sit with people and, in the Catholic\nenvironment, they talk about certain things and | know exactly what they're talking\nabout. You know, | feel it, | know what it's like. And the same, | can be among\nextremely orthodox Jews, | mean | speak Yiddish very well and they have a certain\nway of putting things and | know exactly, and | know, | can respond in kind. See, |\ncan just play the game, | can play any game you want me to play. So, | don't have a\nproblem knowing who | am inside of me, as a person, but as far as the superficial\nstuff, it doesn't matter much. | think I'm a Jew, | mean that's really clear to me. But |\ncan camouflage that under anything else that needs to be, you know, that's\nappropriate.",
        "A: Well, it's still Belgian. For many reasons, one is, | don't feel any allegiance to this\ncountry at all, now this might land me in jail, but | don't care. And | never wanted to\ndeal with bureaucracy, | cannot stand bureaucracy. The little that | had to do with the\nimmigration service here has told me that | don't want to have anything further to do\nwith them. Now | must tell you that, in truthfulness, | might actually become a citizen\nnow because of only inheritance laws, that's the only reason. So | don't feel Belgian,\n| mean the Belgian passport is actually a European passport, so | like to hang on to\nthat because it gives you free passage through Europe, it's much nicer than an\nAmerican citizen's. And second of all, my mom lived there until, as | said, a few\nmonths ago and | used to go back several times a year to visit. And it was just so\neasy and | just fit right in, you Know. And | didn't see the advantage of being\nAmerican, | mean I, see this is where the immigrants that came before really fouled,\nyou know, but I'm resentful to this country for actually wanting my father to die. So |\nhave no respect, | think it's hypocritical, hypocritical, like no other place on earth. And\nreally, really reactionary with putting in religion, pretending that it's separate, but then\nthe Congress opens with prayers. | mean, | think the hypocrisy here is what gets me\nthe most.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

This July, amonth ago. So, to me,\nit's like the end of the road and | will be happy there in spite of all the difficulties. I'm\nvery family oriented and socially, I'm very social. | love my friends, | really love to\nspend time with them. | don't have a lot of time to spend with them, but | love the\nwhole idea.

About 17 cousins,\nand I'm not exaggerating, there's at least that many and they're all much younger\nthan | am, but | am very good friends with a few of them, really friends.

So she goes for various, but | don't know that she believes\nin God either, | mean | kind of don't think so.
