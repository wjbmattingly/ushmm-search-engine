        "Q: You had siblings?",
        "A: Yeah. One sister and three brothers. Four of us. So two brothers were married. Each one had\ntwo children. One...one was not married. My sister left in 1938. She went to Israel.

        "A: ....39 they went and took him to camp. And then in 1940 they took me to camp. So...",
        "Q: Can you...can you slow down just a minute, and back up and tell me about what happened?\nDescribe to me what happened when the Nazis came and they took your parents.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. When they came in... First of all, they took all the men out of the house, you know,\nand put them in one of them--I don't what you would call here. It's like a fire station, you\nknow. But it was a big hall. They kept all the men there (cough) all night; and in the morning\nthey made us go out to work, you know. Clean the streets, clean the...clean the stables you\nknow. They brought some horses in, you know. And they kept the horses in the synagogue.\nThey tore everything out from the synagogue, and kept the horses in there. And we had to go\nand clean and do all kinds of work. And then a lot of houses were demolished from the\nbombs, so we had to go and work. Kept us all day working. And then at night, they kept us\nagain in the in this fire station, in the big barn--whatever you call it. And that went on and on\nand on like this, 'til then they start taking the men to the camps, the work camps. And I was\nstill home. And one day - I was trying to run away, to see maybe I could ...",
        "Q: Excuse me. You're going to have to stop again.\n' Located near Cz_stochowa.",
        "A: Too fast?",
        "Q: No. You're fine. TECHNICAL CONVERSATION Can we start it back again? Tell me a\nlittle more about the work you did. You were 1n this fire house...?",
        "A: Yeah. So they they kept us there at night and in the daytime they took us out you know to\nclean up the ruins from the houses and what they bombed the houses you know. On all kind\nof work, whatever's got to be done you know like clean the stables ...\nPAUSE",
        "Q: Tell me about working from the fire house. You were in a fire house at night?",
        "A: Yeah. So every morning we went out, they took us out you know to do all kind of work you\nknow like I said, to clean clean up the ruins you know and working for them you know, the\nGermans. So that was going on for day after day you know and then they start taking men\nyou know to the camps. Send them off to camps you know. Every time they just picked out\nyou know the...I was the youngest you know so...and then later - that was in '39 when it was\nthe war broke out - and in '40 I was trying to run away somewhere to hide, but there was no\nway to hide. There were just, you were thinking that if you ran away they may not catch you,\nbut they caught you and everywhere, so I was away maybe ten, twelve kilometers - that\nwould be about eight miles - so I got caught inside a little town. They caught me right away\nthere. Put me in there in a fire station; and they accumulated until they had enough people,\nyou know. They brought a bus and take us to camp. But I was trying from there to escape. So\nI walked out, say a hundred...maybe a hundred twenty feet...yards away from there; and I\nheard a shot. So somebody there mentioned to the Germans that I am trying to escape. So I\nheard a shot. From then, I heard to say, \"Halt!\" That means \"stop.\" So I was afraid the next\nbullet would be me; so I just turned around and just walked back. And then the bus came.\nThey load us up in the bus, and he put me right next to the driver. That was a German. So he\ntold him to watch me, because I was already trying to escape once. And they took us to\nAnnaberg.\u2019 That's this first camp there. Got over there. We worked in the autobahn.\u2019 I'm sure\nyou have heard of the autobahn. We worked there; and worked all day, came home, got a\nlittle something to eat. So that was in the beginning, in...in the work camps. So they gave us\na little you know, a piece of bread, a little soup, you know. And that was for next day\nalready...you ate it up in the evening and next day you was working all day long. When you\ngot home, you got again a little piece of bread, you know, ration. So...and it was going on.\nAnd then (cough)...\n\u201cNB: St. Annaberg. Forced labor camp for Jews, located in Annaberg, Upper Silesia.\n* According to Arolsen, this would have been the Reichsautobahn Breslau-Kattowitz--e.g., from\nWroc_aw to Katowice.",
        "Q: What was it like in the camp among your friends? What was it like? Tell me a little more\nabout.....",
        "A: In there, nothing. Just...there was nothing to do. Just... I mean, you went out...we went out to\nwork every day. And in the evening, you came home. You were so tired you wouldn't...you\ndidn't even feel like talking or doing, you know. Just went and laid down. And you...think\nthat...so that on. Then when the war broke out...the Russians, when they went in, so they\ntook us from this camp and they sent us a camp a few miles away from from there because\nthey brought in the Russian war uh PL... No. War...war prisoners they brought in there to this\ncamp. And so we went out to work in the same job, you know, on the autobahn; and they\nworked over there too, them Russians. And that went on. They took us to a camp by the\nname of Markstadt.* That was the third camp there. And there we worked on the...this\nautobahn, too. You see I worked with this...this firm, Schallhorn.\u2019 And they were doing the\nbridges you know and the planning you know from the...and then in '40...1943, they made\nconcentration camp. 'Til '43, it was the work camps. And then they came in one day,\neverybody had to strip their clothes. It was the winter, January. About two or three feet\nsnow, frost. They took us in one barrack. Take off all the clothes. We had to run to the other\nbarracks, naked in this snow and freezing cold. And they gave us them stripey uniforms. I'm\nsure you've heard from them, uniforms what we were wearing. And that's all we wore in the\nwinter and the summer. No warm clothes. Just them stripey cotton uniforms. And then it got\nto be real tough. I mean, tough. Rain or snow, we stayed out there and worked hard. And\nthey went around with the like umm - what what did the policeman... What did you call\nthem?",
        "Q: , whips?",
        "A: No, the whips. Yeah, but they were special whips. Some rubber hose and some wire in it.\nWhen they laid it on you, you felt it. They went around and just beat and make you work.\nWork you to death. One time, I mean...and the food - one evening I was so desperate, so I\nwas trying. And everybody was asleep; I was trying to get around the kitchen to get in the\ndumpster, you know, to find some potato peels or something. And they spotted me there.\nGuard there, night guard, you know. So I went back to the barrack. I thought they didn't\nfollow me, but...but they did follow me. And they came in. So they said, \"Who was out\nthere?\" So I was afraid if I don't come out, they're going to take all - there was around three\nhundred people in the barrack - they would take all of them out, you know, and beat every\none of them. So I just got up. And they got the living Hell out of me that I thought that I will\nnot get up next morning. But I don't know - it's like you say, I got...I had nine lives. It's a few\nincidents I had like this, and I pulled it through. So...and then...\n* Forced labor camp for Jews. Located in Lower Silesia. Opened March/April 1942. Prisoners\nevacuated 23 Mar 1944 to Funfteichen, a subcamp of Gross Rosen.\n> This was the firm of Julius Schallhorn, based in Berlin.",
        "Q: Tell me about the Nazis",
        "A: ..after this got through, after they got through beating on me... In the morning, the...luckily,\nthere--whatever you call it--you know, the one in charge of the block, came in and say again,\n\"Who was out last night?\" So the same thing again. I was afraid he was going to be beating\neverybody, so I went up to him. So I thought after the beating I got that's he going to have a\nlittle mercy. Didn't have no mercy. He gave me another one. And I could barely walk; but I\ntried my best to get to work. Because so soon if you said you're sick, they took you in that uh\nclinic and you didn't come out no more. This...that was sure thing; that if you went 1n there\nyou didn't come out, no matter what. So I just pulled it together and went to work, you know.\nAnd we held together on the same thing every day again the same. Then they took us... Oh,\nyeah; from this they took us to Fiinfteichen\u00ae from Markstadt, you know. There where they\nhad the electric wire around, you know. And all this, I mean, real. Then when the Russians\nstart coming in to Poland closer, you see, because we were close to Poland. Them camps that\nwe...that I was, they took us from this camp; and that was...I remember it was in...1n\nJanuary.\u2019 They took...picked out some people; so we didn't know what they picked for.\nBecause of the time when they were picking they were picking for the gas chamber, you see,\nso everybody was afraid but you didn't have no choice. You had to go when they say. So\nthey took us down to the camp uh...that's all I know is the name of the camp. Wolfsberg,\u201d\nyou know.",
        "Q: Will you tell me... Tell me how you got there.",
        "A: Where? To the camp?",
        "Q: To the camp.",
        "A: Oh, they took us in...in...1n them cars what they transport animals, you know. Cows and\nhorses, you know. In closed up cars. So the trip was miserable, because every...people going\nfor two days in this train and every morning when they start, they just took out dead. You\nwere slee...you were laying overnight and in the morning you got up, you realized you were\nlaying on dead people. So they took them out you know and then they took us out of the train\nand they marched us to this camp over there. So they took us, they start, when they took us\nanother place so we thought we're going to the ga...gas chambers. It was a disinfection place,\n\u00b0 Subcamp of Gross Rosen. Located in Lower Silesia.\n\"He appears here to be referring to the evacuation from Fiinfteichen. According to Arolsen,\nFunfteichen was evacuated 21 Jan 1945.\n* Subcamp of Gross Rosen. Administered through Wustgiersdorf Subcamp. Located in Lower\nSilesia.\nto disinfect us you know. We had to go under under the water you know. Come out. Glad we\ncame out alive again. We kept going, but everybody was afraid that's already, that's it,\nbecause we knew that they take you from one place to the other it's most likely that they take\nyou to the gas chambers. So they took us to this camp over there. And we worked there a\nshort time, and again the Russian came closer. And closer they came, they took us further\ninto Germany, you see. So from Wolfsberg, they took us to P\u00e9litz.\u2019 That was a murder camp.\nI mean, lucky we weren't there too long, because I wouldn't be here. Because there was...we\nwere there in a short time. We worked there. And one day, a cement truck got stuck. And it\nwasn't a cement truck like here, like on wheels and so on--I mean, rubber wheels, all things.\nIt was just a regular cement mixer. And muddy. And they made us push this. And it was ha...\nhalf of the wheels was in the mud. And we were standing over the an... the ankles in mud,\nand we had to push this. And how could we push it? And he went around, this German went\naround with one of them clubs, just beating on the head; and I seen stars. And thank God we\ngot this thing out of there. Back at the...in the camp. And so then...and that was...1f you heard\nfrom Stettin [Pol: Szczecin], you heard. And we were on Politz. So we were on this side of\nthe Oder; and we could see the Russian cannon on the other side of the Oder, you see. And\nall night, they were knocking in them factories that. They were producing oil, whatever they\nwere producing there. At night. Because in the daytime, they knew we were working there--\nthat they got the people from the concentration camp working--so they didn't hit. But at\nnight, all night, they were bombing them places. So they took us from there, and transported\nus to ...[ mean, to ship us further in. But they stopped us in Bergen-Belsen. In Bergen-\nBelsen, we were there ten days because another day or two we couldn't make it. Because\nthey was had so filled up, the place there, that that we were standing all day, all night. Just\nlike sardines, standing ; because they were bringing people in and shipping them out.\nAnd that's all you got over there is once, one time a day, a cup of soup. And if you were\nlucky, if somebody walked by and pushed you, your soup were gone. So your food for the\nwhole day was going. So we stayed there only a few days. Then they took us from there,\nbecause they came closer. They took us to Barth-am-der-Ostsee'\u2019 over there; and there we\nwere were building bunkers. Did I say bunkers? Excuse me--where they had them planes--\nthe Germans, you know. So they could hide them planes 1n there. And then it started. They\ncame and start bombing. Bombing. So they took us out from there and gave everybody small\nloaf of bread with a little jelly, and walking.'' No more transportation. We walked there three\ndays. At night, they put us in some barns; you know, at the farmers. We started the same\nthing again in the morning. We got up. We realized we were laying just on dead people. It\njust took your . And the ones that could walk kept marching. We walked there three\ndays. So we ate up...the first day, we ate up; because you were hungry like a wolf. So you\n\u201d Also: Stettin-P6litz.

Located in Pomerania, on the Baltic Sea.\n'' According to Arolsen, Barth was evacuated 30 Apr - 01 May 1945.\ncould eat anything, uh you ate it up. And the morning, again start marching. The third day, in\nthe afternoon, we were marching. We realized that some of them guards, the SS,\ndisappearing. There were woods we walking. They were disappearing; and so we said to\neach other...I say, \"Boys, I think it's over.\" But we couldn't do nothing so long as still was\nsome around, you see. So slowly they were disappearing, disappearing; and when nightfall\ncame, so I said to some boys, I say, \"You know, why don't we sneak in in the woods there, in\nthe bushes. And just lay down and just wait what happen.\" We went in there, lay down\nthere. Stayed in our overnight. And in the morning, we heard some horses running. And we\nlooked up and we see some Russians. So we got up. And they seen us, you know; and they\nknew who were...we were. And they say, \"You're free. Go where you want. Do what you\nwant.\" And that was April the 30th in 1949--I mean, excuse me, '45. So what do you...do\nyou do first? You go and look for something to eat. So we went in some houses. The\nGermans, you know, they seen us; they got scared. They gave us what we wanted. And\nsometimes the Russians came with us, because they see how we looked. I weighed eighty\npounds when I came out. So they came with us to the ho...the German to the houses you\nknow. Try to find us some food, you know, and some clothes. The only thing I found a pair\nof pants. They went around three times. (Laughter) I just wanted to get rid of this uniform,\nyou know; but that was it. So like they say, a cat got nine lives. And I had; because I had a\nfew incidents what I didn't think I'm going to make it.",
        "Q: How about describing it?",
        "A: One time, I was trying to get me some water to wash myself up. They caught me. They beat\nthe living hell out of me, just because I was getting a little water to wash myself. Because\nyou never had a chance to. So for any little thing ... I mean, it's... (Pause). Yep.",
        "Q: OK. Let me go back a little. I want to know more. Can you go back a little ...",
        "A: Yeah. Just ask me about...",
        "Q: Yeah. About some of the different experiences. I want to go back to the ghetto a little bit.",
        "A: I have not been in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Let's go back to your town.",
        "A: You mean home?",
        "Q: Your home, your hometown. And tell me about when they came for your parents.",
        "A: When they came 1n, they first...the first thing they did... You've seen the picture of my father,\nhad the beard. You know, the religious people had beards. First thing, they get any Jew with\na beard, they took with the knife and cut it, you know. So right away then,\npeople...everybody had their...shaved their beards off. Because they seen you with the beard,\neither they beat you to death or different things. Or they took the knife, you know, and cut\nthe beard, you know. And they did anything they could do to the Jewish people there. And\nthey... I mean, they made work. I mean, impossible things. I mean, tt's...it's hard to describe.\nIt's very hard to describe; because, you know, for survival everybody will do anything. You\nknow, to survive. And so...and this, and this what we had to do. Nothing else. They took out,\nyou know, the men. At night, they went 1n in the houses and raped the women, them soldiers.\nAnd if any little incident, they could take out a bunch of people, put them against the wall\nand just like dogs. Shoot them down like dogs, you see. So one time, somebody was trying,\nto...to a German, tried to do something to him; so they took out some people. They just, it\nwas - I mean, we weren't humans. We were dogs, you see. Worser than dogs they was\ntreating us, you see; because to kill some people, it was nothing. It was...it was like you kill a\nfly today. That's all. And it's... I mean, it's...it's hard. No matter how...how you tried to\nexplain all this, it's kind of hard, you see. It's hard--the details and so--because if you want to\nstart with details, you could stay for days and days. There wouldn't be an end, you see.",
        "Q: We need a little more, though. We need some details here today.",
        "A: From what the...you mean, from the camp? From the camps?",
        "Q: Let's... I want to find out... Tell me again about your parents, because... What happened to\nthem?",
        "A: OK. The parents...when they took me to camp, my father was still home with my mother.\nYeah. And so they took my father to the camp. This I find out, you know, when they took\npeople from one camp to the other, you know. And some from my hometown came and say;\nso they were telling me that they took my father down there. And my brother, he...when the\nwar broke out, he had a nervous breakdown. So he could hardly walk. So they took my\nbrother and my mother, and they shot them in the backyard. Buried them there in the\nbackyard. And my father went to the camp. And then somebody came to the camp where\nthey...where my father was; and they told me that he died over there. So...and the same with\nmy brothers. I heard from there, you see, that they... they were in the camp. And, of course,\nmy two brothers, they were very religious; and they didn't eat, you know, when we got the\nsoup. And so they didn't...they wouldn't touch the soup. The only thing what they ate is just a\npiece of bread. So they they didn't make it too long, you see. So...and, yeah.",
        "Q: You were in that work camp for quite a while?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. 'Til...'til beginning '43, 'til they changed it to concentration camp. You see, all\nthem camps where I was, they were branches of Gross Rosen. I don't know if you\nheard...you heard of Gross Rosen. All them camps that I was, they were branches from Gross\nRosen. And it started Anna...Annaberg. And they give all them...they belong to Gross-\nRosen. That was the main camp, you see; and...and we were in them little camps because we\nwere on the autobahn, you see. So we worked on the autobahn. And that's why we ... And\nlater, when they couldn't work no more because the Russians closed in, so they took us in\nthere to the other camp, and got us away from there.",
        "Q: You said in '43 that things changed. What camp were you in then?",
        "A: In '43, I was in Markstadt. Then they came and they took us to Fiinfteichen.'* And there\nwhere they took us...you see, 'til then we were wearing uh civil clothes, you know. And then\nthey took the old clothes; we had to take off, and they gave us them stripey clothes. Took us-\n-that was not far away from Markstadt--they took us in this camp. And that was already you\nknow, electric wires. Them other camps were just, you know, the barbed wire. Over there,\nthat was already the barbed wire with electric wires on it, you see. You couldn't get close to\nit. You'd just touch it and that was... And many people did commit. They jumped and they\nthrow themselves on there, because they couldn't take it. I mean, it wasn't things... They'd\nthrow themselves on the wires just to get it over with, you see. But I just don't know. Now\nI'm just thinking... I mean, I don't know how I did go through it. Was a lot of them dead. A\nlot of them dead.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about a day, a typical day at Fiinfteichen, when it changed? Tell me about a\ntypical day in the camp.",
        "A: Even day and the year and so. That is hard. I know it was in the winter time. It could be\neither January or February could it be, when they took us from Markstadt to Finfteichen\nthere.",
        "Q: What did you do in the morning in Funfteichen when you got up?",
        "A: In the morning? Went to work. Went to the same spot. You know... I mean, this...there we\nworked in the ammunition factories over then when they started Fiinfteichen. We worked in\nammunition factories there. So we got up in the morning, dressed, and out; and marched a\nfew miles. I mean, to the work, you know. So...and then we were working. There were some\noffices, too, where people were working. So at lunch time, you see, you had a half an hour\nrest, you see. So right then we worked in the office around. Some time people will throw out\nthe piece of a sandwich, you know. That's all. And this what we do...did in...1n Funfteichen,\nwhen it changed. And we were guarded; I mean, stricter than...than in the work camp, you\nsee. And there was Hell started. Real Hell...real Hell started in the concentration camp. For\nany little thing, they took you right and...you know, and either they made a transport they\nsent to Auschwitz. You know, they picked out weak ones; you see, the weak what couldn't\ndo the...produce the work like they wanted, you know. They took them all, you know, and\neither send them off or just made them disappear... See my wife. She has more; because she\nwas in Auschwitz, you see. She has more to tell about it than me ... Doesn't sound so bad, but\nwent through it. That was real bad.\n'\u00b0 This took place 23 Mar 1944.",
        "Q: Can you tell me what was working, what did you do in the ammunition factory?",
        "A: Uh, the I was 1n the things where we were concrete work, concrete you see. We were\nbuilding like concrete blocks, all kinds of concrete--cement, you know. Was doing this over\nthere.",
        "Q: And what were working conditions like in the factory? What was it like in the factory?",
        "A: Not...not in the factory. I was outside, you know, making all the concrete work, you know.\nAnd some people working inside, you see; but I was outside always. You know, first on the\nautobahn and building on the bridges; and then I was in the same...with the same company.\nSee, this company was just uh mason... I mean...yeah, mason, you would say. Know\nconcrete. And so they were just doing like building the walls, you know. Building the\nbuilding. Mixing the things. So...",
        "Q: When you went to Politz, you said...",
        "A: Politz.",
        "Q: ...Politz, you said things were very bad there.",
        "A: Over there, yeah. Very bad. You see, like I said, when they were bombing in the daytime\nthey knocked them plants, them factories out. In the daytime, they took us out, you know,\nand worked on them to re...rebuild. I mean, to replace it, to rebuild it. Because they were\ndesperate. They needed the...whatever they fabricated there, you see, they needed all this.\nBut the next night, the same thing happened, you see. And that was going on and off, on and\noff, 'til they couldn't do it no more. Couldn't do nothing. So they took and shipped us out,\nbecause they've seen the Russians already closed in on them, you see. So they took us away\nand shipped us to Politz. Was it Politz? Let me think. I mean, from... This was Politz. Yeah,\nfrom Politz they...we went. Now I'm already confused.",
        "Q: That's OK. (Pause)",
        "A: Oh, yeah. We went to Wolfsberg there. Yeah. And Wolfsberg we didn't stay long either, and\nwe didn't do much work over there. The same what we did there was mountains, you know.\nAnd there they were trying to make the bunk...bunkers for the planes there too, you see. So\nthat what we were doing was digging...digging, you know, for them planes there. And the\nsame thing we did in Barth. The same. Because, see, was going already to the end of war.\nAnd that's all they... with them planes, trying to hide them, you see. Because they were\nbombing. The Americans came in; and they were day and night, day and night. They didn't\nknow where to go, the Germans, you see. So it was going to the end.",
        "Q: What did you do? What did the prisoners do while they were bombing?",
        "A: Oh, when they bombing, they went in the things. We had them...to lay down in them... How\ndo you call them?",
        "Q: Bunkers?",
        "A: Not really bunkers. It was open on top. It's just ditches, you know.",
        "Q: Trenches.",
        "A: Trenches, right. So they made us all ran out, and... But they knew where they were throwing\nthe bombs, you see. They hardly ever hit the camp. Never hit the camp, because they knew\nwhere the camps are. So they're only hit, you see... Like we were in the camp on them\nfactories there, wasn't too far away. They knocked them factories out; but it didn't touch it,\nnothing things. That's all we seen is just lit up. The camp was lit up, you know. So\nthey never touched them.",
        "Q: How did you get to Bergen-Belsen?",
        "A: With a train. With a train, yeah. They took us from the... from Wolfsberg.",
        "Q: A cattle car, or passenger train?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. That's the only thing. Passenger car, nobody's seen this. Didn't know what it\nwas. (Laughter) In the cattle things.",
        "Q: Can you tell me what you saw when you got off the cattle car at Bergen-Belsen? What was\nthe first things that happened to you?",
        "A: I wish I wouldn't see it. I've seen...we've got...I've seen that, you know, people when they're\nweak they take you to the... No. When you sick, where you taken? It's not a hospital, but in\nthe...",
        "Q: A krankenbau? A sick bay?",
        "A: Yeah, sick...sick bay. Yeah. You seen people walk, barely walking...walking in. And in the\nother door, they took him, wheeled him out in the wheelbar...wheelbarrow. And dumped him\non the mountain. There was a mountain of people laying; and that was going on all day. All\nday. Because you knew when you went in there, you didn't come out. They wheel you out. In\nluck, you didn't stay there too long. Just a few days. Because it was impossible to... This,\nthen they took us, took us to Barth on the train again.",
        "Q: Let's go back to Belsen. What else did you see in Belsen?",
        "A: That's all you seen over there, is mountain of dead and nothing else. Because there they\ndidn't...we didn't go out to work there. We were just waiting for a transport to...we were just\na transit over there, you see. So we didn't, didn't see much except mountain of dead and\nnothing else. And you didn't even want to stick your head nowhere, because it might have\nbeen the wrong place. So just kept your head in there. Because we knew that we just in\ntransfer, you see. So I seen enough. Didn't want to see no more. (Pause)",
        "Q: Can you tell me anything more? You've told me from the labor camps about some of the\nbeatings you took. Can you tell me any other incidents in any of those camps, things that\nhappened to you?",
        "A: Yeah, it's ...(pause)... I told you about the ce...cement truck, but... went out... (pause) Yeah.\nOne time, you know...when we worked on the autobahn, we worked in the fields, you know.\nSo one time, I got...we went through a potato field, you see. We...so I got me some few\npotatoes, you know, take in to the camp. And I got caught with this. So you know what you\ngot. Went in. They took me in the room, you know; and I had to bend over and they gave me\ntwenty-five. And you had to count yourself. And if you missed you had to start over. And\nyou missed again. You had to start over. So lucky, I just missed one time. So... just for a few\nraw potatoes I brought in there. (Pause)",
        "Q: Did you have friends in the camp?",
        "A: Uh, yeah. I mean, but you see there was everybody for himself. Because nobody could help\nyou. Everybody got the same food, you know. Everybody got the same...this little soup, you\nknow, and this piece of bread. So nobody could help you. See, everybody was trying just to\npass by the day, you know, and try to survive. Because actually nobody of us were thinking\nthat we're going...that we're going to survive. It's just another day, you see. That's all we were\nthinking. Just another day. Another day. Because we weren't thinking that we survive; but\nwhen it got to around 1944, then when we've seen that the Russians closing in, then we were\nhoping we have a chance if...1f we're still alive. Because of we've seen...they took us, and\nthen they told us, \"We're going to kill you even if you loose the war, or we win the war.\nWe're going to kill you all, anyway.\" You see. So there you are. You knew it. But everyday\nit counted, and you survived, you see. So ... (pause)",
        "Q: By the time you got to Barth-am-der-Ostsee...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: ...1t was towards the end of the war.",
        "A: Right. Was a short time we were there, yeah.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about what conditions were? About what you did?",
        "A: Well, in there, what kind of work? Yeah. We were building the bunkers on the airfield, you\nknow, for the airplanes. And there we stayed...not in barracks, but it was military housing\nbefore, you see. So we stayed about four people in a little room, you know. So it wasn't... I\nmean, the housing wasn't so bad. But, fish. They give us fish every day. . (Laughter)\nSo...and then one day, they came and they gave everybody a towel and a piece of soap. And\neverybody said now goodbye; because we knew if they send you to take a shower... 'Cause it\nlooked too good to give you a towel and a piece of soap. In all them five years, I've never\nseen a towel and a piece of soap. So we looked at each other, and said everybody was scared\nto go first. But you had. So it was really to go and take a shower. It was already the last few\ndays. They were already slacking down, you know. So, and then alar...I mean, the alarm\nsound. Everybody out. And gave us a little loaf of bread, little jelly and start walking. We\nwalked a way, I don't think 1t was a mile, and this whole thing was up. They already bombed\nit right behind us. So...and we kept walking and walking. Three days, until we got to the end\nof the road.",
        "Q: Tell me about liberation? Who liberated you?",
        "A: The Russians. So they were nice. They were nice. They seen...seen how we looked. They\nknew where we come from. So they were nice. They took us, you know, around, so we can\nget some food to eat, and we kept walking. Just walking. We didn't know where we were\ngoing. Was five of us were together. One was from mine hometown, one boy. And three\nfrom somewhere else. So we held together. We kept walking. We didn't know where we\nwere...we go. But we said, \"Let's go towards Poland to go back home.\" OK. So on the road,\nwe seen some Germans coming on with some bicycles. So we took the bicycles from them.\nAnd we start bicycling, you know, going towards... And then we hitch-hiked, you know, 'til\nwe got to the border Poland. And I've seen some Jewish boy coming back. And I say, \"What\nhappened?\" They say, \"The Poles trying to take on to the Army.\" I say, \"Oh, no. I never\nliked them before, and I don't like them now. So I'm staying right here where Iam.\" Stayed\nin Germany. Didn't...didn't go back to Poland. Because I knew my whole family is gone, so I\ndidn't have nothing to look for over there. So...and I wasn't ready to go to the Polish Army\nafter the concentration camp. (Laughter) So I just stayed there in Germany; and then I\nstayed in a little town there in Germany, not far from one of them camps--Politz--what I was.\nSo I went over there a few times to look at it after. And then I went to Berlin, met my wife.",
        "Q: Tell us about that. How did that happen? How did you get to go to Berlin?",
        "A: To Berlin? Because Berlin was the big city and I was young, you know. So I went over\nthere, you know; and through somebody, I stayed with some people there in Berlin. And in\nthe same house, two sisters were living there. They were in the concentration camp, too. So\nwe start talking. So...and they knew, they were think... I think they knew my wife, that she\nwas... And they introduced me to her. Again, so that...so we went together and then we got\nmarried. We had one child. Born in 1949. I mean, we were in East Germany; and from East\nGermany you couldn't go nowhere out to other country, except Israel. You see, I couldn't get\nno visa to America. None of the western countries. Only to Israel I could. So we went to\nIsrael. But the climate wasn't good for my wife. She was sick all the time. So we had to look\nfor a way out. It was kind of hard, but we got out. We went to Switzerland. From\nSwitzerland, we went through the border, you know, to Germany...back to Germany. And\nthen I find out my cousin is here in America. And he sent me the visa. And in '55 I came\nhere, to Atlanta. And there I am since.",
        "Q: Is there anything more you want to tell us about the camps or about your experiences?",
        "A: I think the most...the main thing is, you see another beating, another beating... It's...1t's aren't\nthings too much, all things. If you have to count all them beatings... I mean, it's like one time\nI felt my foot right here underneath had a sore; and it had gotten to be bigger and bigger. It\nhad gotten so big I could put my finger in there. And I were limping. I couldn't walk; but I\nwas scared to go to the doctor. So because I knew when I go... 1f you go in there, they make\nyou disabled. And then you're disabled for good, you see. So I just held on, you know, to\nsome friends when we went to work. You know, walking. Did the best I could. I mean,\ntrying to hold on. And then it just start healing, so it was alright. Just luck, I don't know. It's\njust sheer luck. Like I say, some people got nine lives, and I'm the one of them. Yeah.",
        "Q: You've described a lot of beatings.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. I mean, there wasn't one came out without. I mean, for any little thing. If you\nmoved your head wrong, if you turned wrong, you know, they went over. Because they\nwalked around with billy-clubs. You see, they enjoyed it. And sometime if you did\nsomething wrong, they took you in the washroom--two of them. And the water were\nrunning; and they were beating on you 'til they carry you out. Lucky it didn't happen this\nincident to me. Because when they took you in the...1n the washroom, you know, to beat,\nthen that was it. They enjoyed it. So it's...it's... I don't know. I look back, I myself I couldn't\nbelieve that I am out after all this. (Pause)",
        "Q: By the time you got to Belsen, you had been through an awful lot.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Belsen was already close...close to the end, you see. It was close to the end of\nBelsen. I mean, there... I mean, we couldn't...couldn't stay any longer, just a few days.\nBecause there was an extermination lager camp. Because it's all...when you looked\naround, that's all you seen. Mountains of things; and bulldozers, you know, digging and just\npushed them in. That's all you've seen over there, you see. Because they couldn't ship to\nAuschwitz, because Auschwitz was already was going twenty-four hours a day. You know,\nthe ovens were burning twenty-four hours a day. So whatever they could, they burned. But\nthe others, they buried, you know.",
        "Q: Did you go through a selection when you arrived at Belsen?",
        "A: In Bel...no. No, no. This whole group we came, they just put in one thing. Just 'cause we\nwere supposed to be shipped out, you know. So after few days, they shipped. (Pause)\nBecause I don't think, I'm not sure but I don't even think that in Belsen they were working.\nThere was just working in the camp, you know. People were put there.",
        "Q: What else do you want to tell us about the camps?",
        "A: I think I told all I could. Main...main...main things. And so...it's rough, rough, and rough.\nThat's all. Because then...because every time when they shipped a transport from one camp\nto the other, so many they shipped was always just... Arrived less and less from every\ntransport, you know. Because right away, they picked out...you know, if they see you weak,\nyou couldn't work. And so they just put them in the side. Since they always picked out the\nmost looked a little healthy, you know, able to work. And so they picked them out and put\nthem to work; and the one who couldn't work, was no use for them. (Pause)",
        "Q: When you were in the labor camps, sub-camps, did you know what was going on at Gross\nRosen?",
        "A: We heard. We heard, you see. We heard; because always came in some people from one\ncamp to the other, you know. So we heard what was going on in the war. We knew\neverything from the...from Auschwitz, from Dachau. We heard; because they switched\naround, you know. They took from one camp, shift over here; you know, from here over\nthere. So we knew everything. I mean, we didn't hear no news or no papers we had; but from\nthe people coming in, you know, we...we heard all the things what was going on. That's the\nonly thing we knew.",
        "Q: At the end, when you left your last camp and you started on the march...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You were marching for how long?",
        "A: Three days.",
        "Q: Three days.",
        "A: Three days. The third day, in the afternoon, the... I mean, the third day we seen already some\nof them SS went in the woods, you know. We could see they throwing their clothes off,\nputting some civilian clothes on. So we just ...late in the afternoon, we just disappeared then\nin the woods. Because we already seen what was going on, that they disappearing; so we\nwas afraid if we not going to run and hide that they...some of them might kill us, you know,\nfor evidence. Not to leave them evidence. So...but we went in; and at night it happened. In\nthe morning, we had the Russians there. Because it...that was the only thing they would tell\nus. They were telling us all the time, \"No matter we win or loose, we kill you all. And none\nof you will be alive.\" This...this...this song you heard every day from them. Yeah, but it\nchanged.",

There were just, you were thinking that if you ran away they may not catch you,\nbut they caught you and everywhere, so I was away maybe ten, twelve kilometers - that\nwould be about eight miles - so I got caught inside a little town. They caught me right away\nthere. Put me in there in a fire station; and they accumulated until they had enough people,\nyou know. They brought a bus and take us to camp. But I was trying from there to escape. So\nI walked out, say a hundred...maybe a hundred twenty feet...yards away from there; and I\nheard a shot. So somebody there mentioned to the Germans that I am trying to escape. So I\nheard a shot. From then, I heard to say, \"Halt!\" That means \"stop.\" So I was afraid the next\nbullet would be me; so I just turned around and just walked back. And then the bus came.\nThey load us up in the bus, and he put me right next to the driver. That was a German. So he\ntold him to watch me, because I was already trying to escape once. And they took us to\nAnnaberg.\u2019 That's this first camp there. Got over there. We worked in the autobahn.\u2019 I'm sure\nyou have heard of the autobahn. We worked there; and worked all day, came home, got a\nlittle something to eat. So that was in the beginning, in...in the work camps.

You were so tired you wouldn't...you\ndidn't even feel like talking or doing, you know. Just went and laid down. And you...think\nthat...so that on. Then when the war broke out...the Russians, when they went in, so they\ntook us from this camp and they sent us a camp a few miles away from from there because\nthey brought in the Russian war uh PL... No. War...war prisoners they brought in there to this\ncamp. And so we went out to work in the same job, you know, on the autobahn; and they\nworked over there too, them Russians. And that went on. They took us to a camp by the\nname of Markstadt.* That was the third camp there. And there we worked on the...this\nautobahn, too. You see I worked with this...this firm, Schallhorn.\u2019 And they were doing the\nbridges you know and the planning you know from the...and then in '40...1943, they made\nconcentration camp. 'Til '43, it was the work camps. And then they came in one day,\neverybody had to strip their clothes. It was the winter, January. About two or three feet\nsnow, frost. They took us in one barrack. Take off all the clothes. We had to run to the other\nbarracks, naked in this snow and freezing cold. And they gave us them stripey uniforms. I'm\nsure you've heard from them, uniforms what we were wearing. And that's all we wore in the\nwinter and the summer. No warm clothes. Just them stripey cotton uniforms. And then it got\nto be real tough. I mean, tough. Rain or snow, we stayed out there and worked hard. And\nthey went around with the like umm - what what did the policeman... What did you call\nthem?",
        "A: No, the whips. Yeah, but they were special whips. Some rubber hose and some wire in it.\nWhen they laid it on you, you felt it. They went around and just beat and make you work.\nWork you to death. One time, I mean...and the food - one evening I was so desperate, so I\nwas trying. And everybody was asleep; I was trying to get around the kitchen to get in the\ndumpster, you know, to find some potato peels or something. And they spotted me there.\nGuard there, night guard, you know. So I went back to the barrack. I thought they didn't\nfollow me, but...but they did follow me. And they came in. So they said, \"Who was out\nthere?\" So I was afraid if I don't come out, they're going to take all - there was around three\nhundred people in the barrack - they would take all of them out, you know, and beat every\none of them. So I just got up. And they got the living Hell out of me that I thought that I will\nnot get up next morning. But I don't know - it's like you say, I got...I had nine lives. It's a few\nincidents I had like this, and I pulled it through. So...and then...\n* Forced labor camp for Jews. Located in Lower Silesia. Opened March/April 1942.

In the morning, the...luckily,\nthere--whatever you call it--you know, the one in charge of the block, came in and say again,\n\"Who was out last night?\" So the same thing again. I was afraid he was going to be beating\neverybody, so I went up to him. So I thought after the beating I got that's he going to have a\nlittle mercy. Didn't have no mercy. He gave me another one. And I could barely walk; but I\ntried my best to get to work. Because so soon if you said you're sick, they took you in that uh\nclinic and you didn't come out no more. This...that was sure thing; that if you went 1n there\nyou didn't come out, no matter what. So I just pulled it together and went to work, you know.\nAnd we held together on the same thing every day again the same. Then they took us... Oh,\nyeah; from this they took us to Fiinfteichen\u00ae from Markstadt, you know. There where they\nhad the electric wire around, you know. And all this, I mean, real. Then when the Russians\nstart coming in to Poland closer, you see, because we were close to Poland.

You had to go when they say. So\nthey took us down to the camp uh...that's all I know is the name of the camp. Wolfsberg,\u201d\nyou know.",
        "A: Where? To the camp?",
        "A: Oh, they took us in...in...1n them cars what they transport animals, you know. Cows and\nhorses, you know. In closed up cars. So the trip was miserable, because every...people going\nfor two days in this train and every morning when they start, they just took out dead. You\nwere slee...you were laying overnight and in the morning you got up, you realized you were\nlaying on dead people. So they took them out you know and then they took us out of the train\nand they marched us to this camp over there. So they took us, they start, when they took us\nanother place so we thought we're going to the ga...gas chambers. It was a disinfection place,\n\u00b0 Subcamp of Gross Rosen. Located in Lower Silesia.\n\"He appears here to be referring to the evacuation from Fiinfteichen. According to Arolsen,\nFunfteichen was evacuated 21 Jan 1945.\n* Subcamp of Gross Rosen. Administered through Wustgiersdorf Subcamp. Located in Lower\nSilesia.\nto disinfect us you know. We had to go under under the water you know. Come out. Glad we\ncame out alive again. We kept going, but everybody was afraid that's already, that's it,\nbecause we knew that they take you from one place to the other it's most likely that they take\nyou to the gas chambers. So they took us to this camp over there. And we worked there a\nshort time, and again the Russian came closer. And closer they came, they took us further\ninto Germany, you see. So from Wolfsberg, they took us to P\u00e9litz.\u2019 That was a murder camp.\nI mean, lucky we weren't there too long, because I wouldn't be here. Because there was...we\nwere there in a short time. We worked there. And one day, a cement truck got stuck. And it\nwasn't a cement truck like here, like on wheels and so on--I mean, rubber wheels, all things.\nIt was just a regular cement mixer. And muddy. And they made us push this. And it was ha...\nhalf of the wheels was in the mud. And we were standing over the an... the ankles in mud,\nand we had to push this. And how could we push it? And he went around, this German went\naround with one of them clubs, just beating on the head; and I seen stars. And thank God we\ngot this thing out of there. Back at the...in the camp. And so then...and that was...1f you heard\nfrom Stettin [Pol: Szczecin], you heard. And we were on Politz. So we were on this side of\nthe Oder; and we could see the Russian cannon on the other side of the Oder, you see. And\nall night, they were knocking in them factories that. They were producing oil, whatever they\nwere producing there. At night. Because in the daytime, they knew we were working there--\nthat they got the people from the concentration camp working--so they didn't hit. But at\nnight, all night, they were bombing them places. So they took us from there, and transported\nus to ...[ mean, to ship us further in. But they stopped us in Bergen-Belsen. In Bergen-\nBelsen, we were there ten days because another day or two we couldn't make it. Because\nthey was had so filled up, the place there, that that we were standing all day, all night. Just\nlike sardines, standing ; because they were bringing people in and shipping them out.\nAnd that's all you got over there is once, one time a day, a cup of soup. And if you were\nlucky, if somebody walked by and pushed you, your soup were gone. So your food for the\nwhole day was going. So we stayed there only a few days. Then they took us from there,\nbecause they came closer. They took us to Barth-am-der-Ostsee'\u2019 over there; and there we\nwere were building bunkers. Did I say bunkers? Excuse me--where they had them planes--\nthe Germans, you know. So they could hide them planes 1n there. And then it started. They\ncame and start bombing. Bombing. So they took us out from there and gave everybody small\nloaf of bread with a little jelly, and walking.'' No more transportation. We walked there three\ndays. At night, they put us in some barns; you know, at the farmers. We started the same\nthing again in the morning. We got up. We realized we were laying just on dead people. It\njust took your . And the ones that could walk kept marching. We walked there three\ndays. So we ate up...the first day, we ate up; because you were hungry like a wolf. So you\n\u201d Also: Stettin-P6litz.

Located in Pomerania, on the Baltic Sea.\n'' According to Arolsen, Barth was evacuated 30 Apr - 01 May 1945.\ncould eat anything, uh you ate it up. And the morning, again start marching. The third day, in\nthe afternoon, we were marching. We realized that some of them guards, the SS,\ndisappearing. There were woods we walking. They were disappearing; and so we said to\neach other...I say, \"Boys, I think it's over.\" But we couldn't do nothing so long as still was\nsome around, you see. So slowly they were disappearing, disappearing; and when nightfall\ncame, so I said to some boys, I say, \"You know, why don't we sneak in in the woods there, in\nthe bushes. And just lay down and just wait what happen.\" We went in there, lay down\nthere. Stayed in our overnight. And in the morning, we heard some horses running. And we\nlooked up and we see some Russians. So we got up. And they seen us, you know; and they\nknew who were...we were. And they say, \"You're free. Go where you want. Do what you\nwant.\" And that was April the 30th in 1949--I mean, excuse me, '45. So what do you...do\nyou do first? You go and look for something to eat. So we went in some houses. The\nGermans, you know, they seen us; they got scared. They gave us what we wanted. And\nsometimes the Russians came with us, because they see how we looked. I weighed eighty\npounds when I came out. So they came with us to the ho...the German to the houses you\nknow. Try to find us some food, you know, and some clothes. The only thing I found a pair\nof pants. They went around three times. (Laughter) I just wanted to get rid of this uniform,\nyou know; but that was it. So like they say, a cat got nine lives. And I had; because I had a\nfew incidents what I didn't think I'm going to make it.",
        "A: One time, I was trying to get me some water to wash myself up. They caught me. They beat\nthe living hell out of me, just because I was getting a little water to wash myself. Because\nyou never had a chance to. So for any little thing ... I mean, it's... (Pause). Yep.",
        "A: Yeah. Just ask me about...",
        "A: I have not been in the ghetto.",
        "A: You mean home?",
        "A: When they came 1n, they first...the first thing they did... You've seen the picture of my father,\nhad the beard. You know, the religious people had beards. First thing, they get any Jew with\na beard, they took with the knife and cut it, you know. So right away then,\npeople...everybody had their...shaved their beards off. Because they seen you with the beard,\neither they beat you to death or different things. Or they took the knife, you know, and cut\nthe beard, you know. And they did anything they could do to the Jewish people there. And\nthey... I mean, they made work. I mean, impossible things. I mean, tt's...it's hard to describe.\nIt's very hard to describe; because, you know, for survival everybody will do anything. You\nknow, to survive. And so...and this, and this what we had to do. Nothing else. They took out,\nyou know, the men. At night, they went 1n in the houses and raped the women, them soldiers.\nAnd if any little incident, they could take out a bunch of people, put them against the wall\nand just like dogs. Shoot them down like dogs, you see. So one time, somebody was trying,\nto...to a German, tried to do something to him; so they took out some people. They just, it\nwas - I mean, we weren't humans. We were dogs, you see. Worser than dogs they was\ntreating us, you see; because to kill some people, it was nothing. It was...it was like you kill a\nfly today. That's all. And it's... I mean, it's...it's hard. No matter how...how you tried to\nexplain all this, it's kind of hard, you see. It's hard--the details and so--because if you want to\nstart with details, you could stay for days and days. There wouldn't be an end, you see.",
        "A: From what the...you mean, from the camp? From the camps?",
        "A: OK. The parents...when they took me to camp, my father was still home with my mother.\nYeah. And so they took my father to the camp. This I find out, you know, when they took\npeople from one camp to the other, you know. And some from my hometown came and say;\nso they were telling me that they took my father down there. And my brother, he...when the\nwar broke out, he had a nervous breakdown. So he could hardly walk. So they took my\nbrother and my mother, and they shot them in the backyard. Buried them there in the\nbackyard. And my father went to the camp. And then somebody came to the camp where\nthey...where my father was; and they told me that he died over there. So...and the same with\nmy brothers. I heard from there, you see, that they... they were in the camp. And, of course,\nmy two brothers, they were very religious; and they didn't eat, you know, when we got the\nsoup. And so they didn't...they wouldn't touch the soup. The only thing what they ate is just a\npiece of bread. So they they didn't make it too long, you see. So...and, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. 'Til...'til beginning '43, 'til they changed it to concentration camp. You see, all\nthem camps where I was, they were branches of Gross Rosen. I don't know if you\nheard...you heard of Gross Rosen. All them camps that I was, they were branches from Gross\nRosen. And it started Anna...Annaberg. And they give all them...they belong to Gross-\nRosen. That was the main camp, you see; and...and we were in them little camps because we\nwere on the autobahn, you see. So we worked on the autobahn. And that's why we ... And\nlater, when they couldn't work no more because the Russians closed in, so they took us in\nthere to the other camp, and got us away from there.",
        "A: In '43, I was in Markstadt. Then they came and they took us to Fiinfteichen.'* And there\nwhere they took us...you see, 'til then we were wearing uh civil clothes, you know. And then\nthey took the old clothes; we had to take off, and they gave us them stripey clothes. Took us-\n-that was not far away from Markstadt--they took us in this camp. And that was already you\nknow, electric wires. Them other camps were just, you know, the barbed wire. Over there,\nthat was already the barbed wire with electric wires on it, you see. You couldn't get close to\nit. You'd just touch it and that was... And many people did commit. They jumped and they\nthrow themselves on there, because they couldn't take it. I mean, it wasn't things... They'd\nthrow themselves on the wires just to get it over with, you see. But I just don't know. Now\nI'm just thinking... I mean, I don't know how I did go through it. Was a lot of them dead. A\nlot of them dead.",
        "A: Even day and the year and so. That is hard. I know it was in the winter time. It could be\neither January or February could it be, when they took us from Markstadt to Finfteichen\nthere.",
        "A: In the morning? Went to work. Went to the same spot. You know... I mean, this...there we\nworked in the ammunition factories over then when they started Fiinfteichen. We worked in\nammunition factories there. So we got up in the morning, dressed, and out; and marched a\nfew miles. I mean, to the work, you know. So...and then we were working. There were some\noffices, too, where people were working. So at lunch time, you see, you had a half an hour\nrest, you see. So right then we worked in the office around. Some time people will throw out\nthe piece of a sandwich, you know. That's all. And this what we do...did in...1n Funfteichen,\nwhen it changed. And we were guarded; I mean, stricter than...than in the work camp, you\nsee. And there was Hell started. Real Hell...real Hell started in the concentration camp. For\nany little thing, they took you right and...you know, and either they made a transport they\nsent to Auschwitz. You know, they picked out weak ones; you see, the weak what couldn't\ndo the...produce the work like they wanted, you know. They took them all, you know, and\neither send them off or just made them disappear... See my wife. She has more; because she\nwas in Auschwitz, you see. She has more to tell about it than me ... Doesn't sound so bad, but\nwent through it. That was real bad.\n'\u00b0 This took place 23 Mar 1944.",
        "A: Uh, the I was 1n the things where we were concrete work, concrete you see. We were\nbuilding like concrete blocks, all kinds of concrete--cement, you know. Was doing this over\nthere.",
        "A: Not...not in the factory. I was outside, you know, making all the concrete work, you know.\nAnd some people working inside, you see; but I was outside always. You know, first on the\nautobahn and building on the bridges; and then I was in the same...with the same company.\nSee, this company was just uh mason... I mean...yeah, mason, you would say.

        "A: Politz.",
        "A: Over there, yeah. Very bad. You see, like I said, when they were bombing in the daytime\nthey knocked them plants, them factories out. In the daytime, they took us out, you know,\nand worked on them to re...rebuild. I mean, to replace it, to rebuild it. Because they were\ndesperate. They needed the...whatever they fabricated there, you see, they needed all this.\nBut the next night, the same thing happened, you see. And that was going on and off, on and\noff, 'til they couldn't do it no more. Couldn't do nothing. So they took and shipped us out,\nbecause they've seen the Russians already closed in on them, you see. So they took us away\nand shipped us to Politz. Was it Politz? Let me think. I mean, from... This was Politz. Yeah,\nfrom Politz they...we went. Now I'm already confused.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. We went to Wolfsberg there. Yeah. And Wolfsberg we didn't stay long either, and\nwe didn't do much work over there. The same what we did there was mountains, you know.\nAnd there they were trying to make the bunk...bunkers for the planes there too, you see. So\nthat what we were doing was digging...digging, you know, for them planes there. And the\nsame thing we did in Barth. The same. Because, see, was going already to the end of war.\nAnd that's all they... with them planes, trying to hide them, you see. Because they were\nbombing. The Americans came in; and they were day and night, day and night. They didn't\nknow where to go, the Germans, you see. So it was going to the end.",
        "A: Oh, when they bombing, they went in the things. We had them...to lay down in them... How\ndo you call them?",
        "A: Not really bunkers. It was open on top. It's just ditches, you know.",
        "A: Trenches, right. So they made us all ran out, and... But they knew where they were throwing\nthe bombs, you see. They hardly ever hit the camp. Never hit the camp, because they knew\nwhere the camps are. So they're only hit, you see... Like we were in the camp on them\nfactories there, wasn't too far away. They knocked them factories out; but it didn't touch it,\nnothing things. That's all we seen is just lit up. The camp was lit up, you know. So\nthey never touched them.",
        "A: With a train. With a train, yeah. They took us from the... from Wolfsberg.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. That's the only thing. Passenger car, nobody's seen this. Didn't know what it\nwas. (Laughter) In the cattle things.",
        "A: I wish I wouldn't see it. I've seen...we've got...I've seen that, you know, people when they're\nweak they take you to the... No. When you sick, where you taken? It's not a hospital, but in\nthe...",
        "A: Yeah, sick...sick bay. Yeah. You seen people walk, barely walking...walking in. And in the\nother door, they took him, wheeled him out in the wheelbar...wheelbarrow. And dumped him\non the mountain. There was a mountain of people laying; and that was going on all day. All\nday. Because you knew when you went in there, you didn't come out. They wheel you out. In\nluck, you didn't stay there too long. Just a few days. Because it was impossible to... This,\nthen they took us, took us to Barth on the train again.",
        "A: That's all you seen over there, is mountain of dead and nothing else. Because there they\ndidn't...we didn't go out to work there. We were just waiting for a transport to...we were just\na transit over there, you see. So we didn't, didn't see much except mountain of dead and\nnothing else. And you didn't even want to stick your head nowhere, because it might have\nbeen the wrong place. So just kept your head in there. Because we knew that we just in\ntransfer, you see. So I seen enough. Didn't want to see no more. (Pause)",
        "A: Yeah, it's ...(pause)... I told you about the ce...cement truck, but... went out... (pause) Yeah.\nOne time, you know...when we worked on the autobahn, we worked in the fields, you know.\nSo one time, I got...we went through a potato field, you see. We...so I got me some few\npotatoes, you know, take in to the camp. And I got caught with this. So you know what you\ngot. Went in. They took me in the room, you know; and I had to bend over and they gave me\ntwenty-five. And you had to count yourself. And if you missed you had to start over. And\nyou missed again. You had to start over. So lucky, I just missed one time. So... just for a few\nraw potatoes I brought in there. (Pause)",
        "A: Uh, yeah. I mean, but you see there was everybody for himself. Because nobody could help\nyou. Everybody got the same food, you know. Everybody got the same...this little soup, you\nknow, and this piece of bread. So nobody could help you. See, everybody was trying just to\npass by the day, you know, and try to survive. Because actually nobody of us were thinking\nthat we're going...that we're going to survive. It's just another day, you see. That's all we were\nthinking. Just another day. Another day. Because we weren't thinking that we survive; but\nwhen it got to around 1944, then when we've seen that the Russians closing in, then we were\nhoping we have a chance if...1f we're still alive. Because of we've seen...they took us, and\nthen they told us, \"We're going to kill you even if you loose the war, or we win the war.\nWe're going to kill you all, anyway.\" You see. So there you are. You knew it. But everyday\nit counted, and you survived, you see. So ... (pause)",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right. Was a short time we were there, yeah.",
        "A: Well, in there, what kind of work? Yeah. We were building the bunkers on the airfield, you\nknow, for the airplanes. And there we stayed...not in barracks, but it was military housing\nbefore, you see. So we stayed about four people in a little room, you know. So it wasn't... I\nmean, the housing wasn't so bad. But, fish. They give us fish every day. . (Laughter)\nSo...and then one day, they came and they gave everybody a towel and a piece of soap. And\neverybody said now goodbye; because we knew if they send you to take a shower... 'Cause it\nlooked too good to give you a towel and a piece of soap. In all them five years, I've never\nseen a towel and a piece of soap. So we looked at each other, and said everybody was scared\nto go first. But you had. So it was really to go and take a shower. It was already the last few\ndays. They were already slacking down, you know. So, and then alar...I mean, the alarm\nsound. Everybody out. And gave us a little loaf of bread, little jelly and start walking. We\nwalked a way, I don't think 1t was a mile, and this whole thing was up. They already bombed\nit right behind us. So...and we kept walking and walking. Three days, until we got to the end\nof the road.",
        "A: The Russians. So they were nice. They were nice. They seen...seen how we looked. They\nknew where we come from. So they were nice. They took us, you know, around, so we can\nget some food to eat, and we kept walking. Just walking. We didn't know where we were\ngoing. Was five of us were together. One was from mine hometown, one boy. And three\nfrom somewhere else. So we held together. We kept walking. We didn't know where we\nwere...we go. But we said, \"Let's go towards Poland to go back home.\" OK. So on the road,\nwe seen some Germans coming on with some bicycles. So we took the bicycles from them.\nAnd we start bicycling, you know, going towards... And then we hitch-hiked, you know, 'til\nwe got to the border Poland. And I've seen some Jewish boy coming back. And I say, \"What\nhappened?\" They say, \"The Poles trying to take on to the Army.\" I say, \"Oh, no. I never\nliked them before, and I don't like them now. So I'm staying right here where Iam.\" Stayed\nin Germany. Didn't...didn't go back to Poland. Because I knew my whole family is gone, so I\ndidn't have nothing to look for over there. So...and I wasn't ready to go to the Polish Army\nafter the concentration camp. (Laughter) So I just stayed there in Germany; and then I\nstayed in a little town there in Germany, not far from one of them camps--Politz--what I was.\nSo I went over there a few times to look at it after. And then I went to Berlin, met my wife.",
        "A: To Berlin? Because Berlin was the big city and I was young, you know. So I went over\nthere, you know; and through somebody, I stayed with some people there in Berlin. And in\nthe same house, two sisters were living there. They were in the concentration camp, too. So\nwe start talking. So...and they knew, they were think... I think they knew my wife, that she\nwas... And they introduced me to her. Again, so that...so we went together and then we got\nmarried. We had one child. Born in 1949. I mean, we were in East Germany; and from East\nGermany you couldn't go nowhere out to other country, except Israel. You see, I couldn't get\nno visa to America. None of the western countries. Only to Israel I could. So we went to\nIsrael. But the climate wasn't good for my wife. She was sick all the time. So we had to look\nfor a way out. It was kind of hard, but we got out. We went to Switzerland. From\nSwitzerland, we went through the border, you know, to Germany...back to Germany. And\nthen I find out my cousin is here in America. And he sent me the visa. And in '55 I came\nhere, to Atlanta. And there I am since.",
        "A: I think the most...the main thing is, you see another beating, another beating... It's...1t's aren't\nthings too much, all things. If you have to count all them beatings... I mean, it's like one time\nI felt my foot right here underneath had a sore; and it had gotten to be bigger and bigger. It\nhad gotten so big I could put my finger in there. And I were limping. I couldn't walk; but I\nwas scared to go to the doctor. So because I knew when I go... 1f you go in there, they make\nyou disabled. And then you're disabled for good, you see. So I just held on, you know, to\nsome friends when we went to work. You know, walking. Did the best I could. I mean,\ntrying to hold on. And then it just start healing, so it was alright. Just luck, I don't know. It's\njust sheer luck. Like I say, some people got nine lives, and I'm the one of them. Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. I mean, there wasn't one came out without. I mean, for any little thing. If you\nmoved your head wrong, if you turned wrong, you know, they went over. Because they\nwalked around with billy-clubs. You see, they enjoyed it. And sometime if you did\nsomething wrong, they took you in the washroom--two of them. And the water were\nrunning; and they were beating on you 'til they carry you out. Lucky it didn't happen this\nincident to me. Because when they took you in the...1n the washroom, you know, to beat,\nthen that was it. They enjoyed it. So it's...it's... I don't know. I look back, I myself I couldn't\nbelieve that I am out after all this. (Pause)",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Belsen was already close...close to the end, you see. It was close to the end of\nBelsen. I mean, there... I mean, we couldn't...couldn't stay any longer, just a few days.\nBecause there was an extermination lager camp. Because it's all...when you looked\naround, that's all you seen. Mountains of things; and bulldozers, you know, digging and just\npushed them in. That's all you've seen over there, you see. Because they couldn't ship to\nAuschwitz, because Auschwitz was already was going twenty-four hours a day. You know,\nthe ovens were burning twenty-four hours a day. So whatever they could, they burned. But\nthe others, they buried, you know.",
        "A: In Bel...no. No, no. This whole group we came, they just put in one thing. Just 'cause we\nwere supposed to be shipped out, you know. So after few days, they shipped. (Pause)\nBecause I don't think, I'm not sure but I don't even think that in Belsen they were working.\nThere was just working in the camp, you know. People were put there.",
        "A: I think I told all I could. Main...main...main things. And so...it's rough, rough, and rough.\nThat's all. Because then...because every time when they shipped a transport from one camp\nto the other, so many they shipped was always just... Arrived less and less from every\ntransport, you know. Because right away, they picked out...you know, if they see you weak,\nyou couldn't work. And so they just put them in the side. Since they always picked out the\nmost looked a little healthy, you know, able to work. And so they picked them out and put\nthem to work; and the one who couldn't work, was no use for them.

        "A: We heard. We heard, you see. We heard; because always came in some people from one\ncamp to the other, you know. So we heard what was going on in the war. We knew\neverything from the...from Auschwitz, from Dachau. We heard; because they switched\naround, you know. They took from one camp, shift over here; you know, from here over\nthere. So we knew everything. I mean, we didn't hear no news or no papers we had; but from\nthe people coming in, you know, we...we heard all the things what was going on. That's the\nonly thing we knew.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Three days.",
        "A: Three days. The third day, in the afternoon, the... I mean, the third day we seen already some\nof them SS went in the woods, you know. We could see they throwing their clothes off,\nputting some civilian clothes on. So we just ...late in the afternoon, we just disappeared then\nin the woods.
