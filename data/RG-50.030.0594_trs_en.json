        "A: We had a very happy childhood. My father was a very productive merchant. We\nhad a wonderful family life. My family was very active in our congregation, and our\ncongregation in Berlin encompassed and really was the \u2014 the last of the giant\nsynagogues that were built in Berlin. When I say giant synagogues, I\u2019m talking\nabout a synagogue that housed in excess of a thousand people. But it was the very\nlast one that ga \u2014 its inauguration came about in 1930, the year that I was born, and\nit died, or was extinguished in 1938, on Kristallnacht.",
        "Q: Do you recall the name of this synagogue?",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 yes I do. The synagogues in Berlin were not named for a\ncongregation whatever the name was. The large synagogues were named for the\nstreets that they were on. And the street that \u2014 that my synagogue was on was\nPrince \u2014 Prince Regenten Strasse, Prince Regent Street. I was about 10 minute \u2014\nless than a 10 minute walk from \u2014 from my home to the synagogue.",
        "Q: What denomination was it? Was it Orthodox?\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: It was a lit \u2014 what we call in Germany was called Liberal. It had a choir, it had\nan organ, it had those things that Orthodoxy would not have smiled on.",

        "A: My father had a \u2014 along with his brothers owned a wholesale \u2014 wholesale\nmerchant of women\u2019s hosiery. I think that was really the main part of their business,\nand some other accessories 1n addition thereto. But mainly \u2014 mainly their business\nconsisted of wholesale hosiery. Remember everything at \u2014 during those \u2014 those\nyears was constituted by Mom and Pop businesses, and my father was a very\nsuccessful merchant. And also, very sharing, very sharing a-as far as his willingness\nto share his good fortune with the community. My father also was a front line\nsoldier in World War I. And he was active \u2014 he was \u2014 he was in the \u2014 he was very\nactive in the congregation.",
        "Q: So, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m guessing that that means that your family didn\u2019t only go to high\nholiday services, they would \u2014 they would have practiced every week, or how \u2014\nhow did that work at the time?",
        "A: I\u2014I would \u2014 I would generally go t \u2014 with my father almost every Friday night\nto services. Maybe some once in a while on Saturday, but Friday night was a\u2014a\nnorm for us.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "Q: What \u2014 what did your mother do during the day? Did she have a job, or did she\nstay at home?",
        "A: My father \u2014 my \u2014 my mother was a home \u2014 a home-keeper, if that\u2019s the proper\nterminology. We had a \u2014 we had a beautiful apartment and my mother kept things\nflowing.",
        "Q: You mentioned that your father was a successful businessman. Would you\ndescribe your family as middle class, upper-middle class \u2014",
        "A: Upper-middle class.",
        "Q: Can you describe the apartment or house that you used to own?",
        "A: Well, if I took you there I could tell you \u2014 show you exactly where it 1s, as I have\ntaken members of my family. Unfortunately it\u2019s not standing any more. I can\nvisualize the apartment in my head exactly. My \u2014 my room was towards the end \u2014\nthe rear of the \u2014 of the apartment building. I had a balcony, and \u2014 where I raised\nvegetables, tomatoes, occasionally flowers. We had a lovely residence, beautiful\nresidence.",
        "Q: Was this in the garden, the vegetables and flowers?",
        "A: No, this \u2014 this was in a \u2014 on a \u2014 on the window box in \u2014 on the balcony.",
        "Q: Do you recall how many rooms were in this house?",
        "A: Substantial number of rooms, that\u2019s all I can tell you, I\u2019ve no idea.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "Q: Did your family have any housekeepers or \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, we had a\u2014 we had a \u2014 we had a housekeeper.",
        "Q: Okay, any nannies, or \u2014",
        "A: Yes, [had a nanny. And a matter of fact, at home, I think we have a picture of\nmyself dressed up as little boys were during that time period, with my nanny.",
        "Q: Do you recall whether your nanny was Jewish or Gentile?",
        "A: Definitely not Jewish.",
        "Q: Do you remember going to school in Germany?",
        "A: Yes, when my \u2014 my parents enrolled me in public school in Berlin, it was\ndecided that\u2019s where I would go, and I lasted in that school for about maybe a day,\nmaybe two days, three days, I don\u2019t know. Very, very quickly, I was beaten during\nthat time period and \u2014 because the other boys asked me what I was, who I was, and\nth-the minute I said Jew, I was put to the test immediately. And my mother was\ncalled to school, she was told by the principal of the school that it would be best for\nmy \u2014 my protection to be taken out of that school. So I\u2014 my experience of public\nschool may have been extinguished then after one day, or \u2014 or two days at the most.",
        "Q: Do you recall what year this was, was this first grade \u2014",
        "A: Well, would have been \u2014 it would have been 19 \u2014 roughly about 1936, I would\nimagine.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "Q: Because you just mentioned that they had asked you who they were and you\nreplied you were a Jew, I know this might be hard to answer, but did you have a\nsense that this was something you could talk about? Did your parents warn you not\nto say that you were a Jew, or conversely did they say that that\u2019s fine?",
        "A: I think my parents tried to protect me by not saying much of anything. And I was\nnever told what to say or what not to say. But I think I, from that experience, I\nlearned rather quickly as to what I was, who I was. And I think my parents shielded\nme from all the discriminatory acts that had been ongoing in the mid-1930s. For\nexample, I had an uncle of mine, a brother of my \u2014 of my \u2014 my mother, who was a\nvery successful attorney in Germany and Berlin. And of course he was \u2014 you\nknow, I found out later on why he wasn\u2019t working any more, because he was\nexcluded from \u2014 from that possibility. But generally I would say my parents really\nshielded me up to that time period. That\u2019s about the best way I can \u2014 I can put it.",
        "Q: So you said you were taken out of school almost immediately.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And then what happened?",
        "A: I was enrolled in a school, in a Jewish school with obviously, Jewish students,\nbut not a religious school, okay? So, there were no \u2014 there \u2014 there was \u2014 there were\nno re \u2014 Jewish religious courses given. It was taking the regular curriculum within a\nOctober 15, 2010\nframework of Jewish teachers and \u2014 and just a framework of \u2014 of Jews \u2014 Jewish\nchildren.",
        "Q: Do you recall some friends or friendships from that time?",
        "A: Yes, Ido. We \u2014 we get a\u2014a bulletin from the municipality of Berlin, where I\nrecognized a young lady \u2014 a young lady \u2014 a\u2014 a\u2014a person\u2019s name, and I wrote to\nher, and she sent me back, she recognized my name immediately, and I don\u2019t know\nhow, and sent me back a picture of our class, which was unbelievable. So yes, I \u2014 I-\nI think that\u2019s the \u2014 the only person that I \u2014 that I have recog \u2014 I have a memory\nthereof. When we \u2014 when we left Berlin, we had \u2014 when we \u2014 I should sa \u2014 correct\nthis; when children were fortunate enough to leave school, to go out of the country\nin some fashion or other, we would all have little autograph books and we would\nsign off on a little note to that st \u2014 t-to that boy or girl. Maybe it was just putting our\nname and saying in German, best wishes for the future, maybe a little poem, maybe\na little picture. But I do have a book like that at home, with about \u2014 the names of\nabout maybe 15 to 20 different students, and \u2014 and likewise a \u2014 a number of\nteachers who \u2014 whose classes I attended, wishing me well.",
        "Q: Since you went to a Jewish school, I suppose most of your friends came from\nthat circle. Do you recall having any Gentile friends?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t \u2014 do not, no.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "Q: What are your first memories of Nazis or Nazism?",
        "A: I th\u2014I think probably that experience in school was probably the \u2014 the \u2014 the first\nexperience that I had at that point. My parents were no longer able to subdue their \u2014\ntheir thoughts as to trying to shield and protect me. And I do remember very clearly\nthat either with my father or my mother, I went to a grocery store nearby, and the \u2014\nthe merchant, the owner of that establishment, who knew my parents, looked at me\nwith my blond hair at that time, and said, he doesn\u2019t look like a Jew. And that\nscared the hell out of me, because I knew what that meant. And then in 1938,\nobviously the \u2014 my father and \u2014 and I, every Sunday would go to a park that was\nlike two or three minutes away from our home, and we would sit on the bench and\nmy father would schmooze, if that\u2019s the correct word, with neighbors who would\ncome by. And my father delighted in showing me off as \u2014 as his son, and \u2014 and then\none day we could no longer sit on the park bench, we had to sit on a\u2014 on a yellow\nbench, which said, nur fir Juden, for Jews only. And several times when we did\nthat, we sat down, we were stoned.",
        "Q: That means people threw stones at you.",
        "A: Threw stones, yeah.",
        "Q: How did your father react, what did he do?\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: My father always said to me, I always \u2014 I told my father the last time that I went\nto synagogue with him that I was afraid for my life. And my father said to me that\nhe had fought for Germany in World War I, and nothing would happen to me, that\nGermany had had waves of anti-Semitism previously, they come and they go, and\nbecause of our \u2014 of our nature, of what my father has achieved, what he had done,\nhe would protect me, and nothing would happen to us. Whether he actually believed\nthat, I don\u2019t know. It di-didn\u2019t \u2014 after those words, while they were encouraging, I\nhave to tell you that I honestly did not feel very much better.",
        "Q: Do you remember a moment where you started feeling unease, or fear, or did it\njust build gradually?",
        "A: It built gradually, and I \u2014 I think it gradually \u2014 and the \u2014 the \u2014 the heightened\nmoment of fear was about a week or two weeks prior to Kristallnacht, when as I\nsaid, we went to \u2014 we, my father and I, went to services generally every Friday\nevening. And on this particular Friday evening, uniformed members of brown\nshirts, black shirts, call 1t whatever you want, uniformed Nazis, came into the front\ndoor of our synagogue, and threatened \u2014 threatened the congregation, threatened our\nrabbi, and our rabbi was magnificent in defending us verbally, and ultimately the\nNazis retreated. And at that moment, as I said, when we walked home I told my\nOctober 15, 2010\nfather I was afraid for my life. Then two weeks later, you know, we experienced\nKristallnacht.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to ask you about that in just a moment, but I\u2019d like to get back to your\nnanny. You mentioned that she was not Jewish. Do you recall how long she stayed\nin your household, and when she would have to leave?",
        "A: I \u2014I think \u2014 by the time I was six years old, I did not have one any more. So my\n\u2014 my recollection of her are more \u2014 more photographic than \u2014 than anything that\nmight have transpired between us. I will say this, that on Kristallnacht, my parents,\nby some fluke of miracles, were not with me. They were on vacation, and I learned\nlater on that my father really, physically was not doing well. But they were not with\nus, and I was with my grandmother. My grandmother had a non-Jewish worker \u2014\nservant in the house and I think \u2014 I certainly can recall that \u2014 that she told my\ngrandmother that she needed to get out of the house because something \u2014 something\nwas going to happen that evening.",
        "Q: So what did your grandmother do?",
        "A: Really nothing, except to \u2014 she was a very, very tight \u2014 tightfisted. [knocking]",
        "Q: One moment. [break] You had said that you were with your grandmother on\nKristallnacht \u2014",
        "A: Right.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "Q: \u2014 and that one of the people who worked for her had warned her that she should\nleave the house, is that correct?",
        "A: No, that \u2014 that she was going to leave the house.",
        "Q: She was going to leave the house.",
        "A: She was not \u2014 she was not going to stay all day, that \u2014 that she had some ideas\nthat something of an \u2014 she wouldn\u2019t say what, and maybe she didn\u2019t even know, but\nshe felt that she should not stay there all day, and left. And my grandmother was a\nvery primped, starched lady, never smiled. You know, it\u2019s one of those\ngrandmothers that \u2014 you know. And I experienced Kristallnacht in her hou \u2014 in \u2014\nin her home. And unfortunately, her apartment that she lived in overlooked the\nsynagogue, over \u2014 was \u2014 e-even though our synagogue was a block or two \u2014 I think\none block away, I think we were on the floor where we could look and see the top\nof our synagogue. And I could see the \u2014 you know, I could see the fires bursting\nthrough the \u2014 through the roof.",
        "Q: So, can you describe basically that day, and/or that night to me? What happened\nin the building that you were, and what were you seeing outside?",
        "A: Well that \u2014 that night I \u2014 I was in my \u2014 my grandmother\u2019s apartment, I had a\nroom that was mine, that was facing out in the street, that overlooked a block away\nthat \u2014 what did overlook our synagogue. And during the night, two uncles of mine\nOctober 15, 2010\ncame. One on my mother\u2019s side, who hid in a linen closet, one on my father\u2019s side,\nwho hid underneath the bed that I was supposed to be sleeping in. And the only th \u2014\nonly thought wi \u2014 these are terrible thoughts to have \u2014 the only thought that I had,\nthat if my uncle is found underneath my bed, should the Nazis come and invade the\nhouse, I would be taken also. So I really hadn\u2019t \u2014 had little \u2014 little hope that I would\nlive through the night. I heard all the screams of the \u2014 of \u2014 of what was \u2014 what\nmight be or what was going on in the streets below us. And \u2014 and every knock on\nthe door, my heart \u2014 was everybody\u2019s heart in that apartment stopped \u2014 stopped\nrunning, because we all \u2014 always thought that maybe the Nazis would come to \u2014 to\nthe door, break in the hou \u2014 break into the apartment, search the apartment and only\n\u2014 God only knows what would happen at \u2014 at that particular point. It was the most\nhorrific night of my life. I have never, never, never experienced a night of fear, that\nI did on that night, never. And I remember it to this day, and I will remember it for\nthe rest of my life.",
        "Q: What happened in the morning, and did anyone end up breaking in that night?",
        "A: No, we\u2019re \u2014 as luck would have it, there were no, other than neighbors just\nchecking on us and so forth, and my two uncles, I said, who came to the door and\nsought sanctuary \u2014 shelter. The apartment was not broken into. The next morning, I\nleft the apartment. I don\u2019t know how in the hell my \u2014 my grandmother would ha \u2014\nOctober 15, 2010\nwould have let me go, but she did. And I walked myself back to our home, which\nwas maybe five minutes away, to see whether our home had been broken into \u2014 our\napartment had been broken into. And what I \u2014 what I saw ... indescribable.",
        "Q: You were unaccompanied? You were alone?",
        "A: I\u2014 unaccompanied.",
        "Q: Did you go into the apartment?",
        "A: No, I did not go into the apartment. I saw the door was closed, I saw there was\nno damage to the outside of the \u2014 of the apartment. But when I came out, we were\njust maybe a hundred yards away from a\u2014 from a square, and I \u2014 I\u2019ve told my\nchildren this, there was a huge stain on the \u2014 on the pavement, on the \u2014 and one of\nthe Nazis asked another one, what is that? And he said, that is the blood of a Jew.\nEvery store in our \u2014 in our neighborhood that was Jewish owned had been broken\ninto, had been vandalized, had been vandalized, not only broken into and \u2014 and \u2014\nand \u2014 but it was painted Jew, star of David, and it was \u2014 it was the most \u2014 and \u2014 and\npeople were cheering. That was the beginning of death.",
        "Q: Were you still alone at this time on the streets?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Where did you end up going?",
        "A: I think ultimately I went back to my grandmother\u2019s apartment.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "Q: Did you find members of your family there?",
        "A: No. My \u2014 my \u2014 in the meantime, I think my \u2014 my \u2014 my mother and father had\ncalled, because they had heard \u2014 I don\u2019t know where they were, but they were on\nvacation. They had heard what had gone on, and I think my grandmother told them\nto stay away and not come back from where they \u2014 and they did not come back for\nseveral days later on.",
        "Q: How were you reu-reunited with an adult at that point?",
        "A: Well, I stayed with my grandmother until my \u2014 until my parents returned from\nwherever they were.",
        "Q: What happened when your parents returned?",
        "A: For me it was just a continuation of fear. And I think \u2014 I think at that time, I\nthink we \u2014 I think my parents showed fear for the first time as well. Openly. I\u2019m\nsure they were \u2014 they were \u2014 they were in fear previously. My father, as I found out\nlater on, had to take on a non-Jewish partner into the business, in order for the\nbusiness to continue. And that happened maybe a year or two years even before that\ntime. I didn\u2019t know the reasons for 1t, why someone else had to be taken in the\nbusiness. But these were things that were kept from me, to shield me as much as\npossible from a family, a Jewish family, that was descending into hell.",
        "Q: How soon after \u2014\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: I do know \u2014 do know one thing. That during this time period, my father was\nalways was \u2014 was cognizant of the need to help those that were less fortunate, that\ncould not help themselves. And I remember on several occasions, my father would\nask my mother to load up a bag of groceries, as me to u \u2014 to take some of my best\ntoys, and he had a list of \u2014 of names of people that we would drive to, and we would\nwalk up in the apar \u2014 to the apartment dwellings, and be greeted by name,\nsometimes just with smiles, and my father would always hand them an envelope,\nand I knew that that was mor \u2014 was money, and you know, these people were so\nthankful. And I\u2019m sure none of them survived.",
        "Q: At this point, were you still living in your apartment or house \u2014 at home?",
        "A: Yes, yeah. Immediately after my \u2014 my parents returned, which was within days\nafter Kristallnacht, I returned and we lived in our apartment until \u2014 until I left\nGermany.",
        "Q: When did you first hear that you were leaving? How was the news broken to\nyou?",
        "A: Well, let me take you back in time a little bit. Kristallnacht was November 9\",\n1938, and I don\u2019t know the reasons for it, but in \u2014 sometime in December of 1938,\non a winter day, I was walking with my sister, not far from \u2014 from where our\napartment was, and something within me, I lashed out \u2014 physically I lashed out at a\nOctober 15, 2010\n\u2014 at a member of the Hitler youth who was collecting money for whatever,\nwhatever the purpose was, I have no idea, okay, for whatever the Hitler youth was\ncollecting money for. And when I say lashed out, I\u2019m talking about physically\nassaulted. And inflicted damage to the uniform, inflicted damage to that person. My\nsister dragged me home, told my \u2014 my \u2014 my parents. I guess they found out very\nquickly who it was, that individual that I had accosted. I cannot give you the reason\nfor it, I don\u2019t know. And at that juncture, the \u2014 my p \u2014 my parents, my mother,\ncontacted the parents of this individual. I can\u2019t even tell you whether it was male or\nfemale that I accosted, but I do know the individual was a good \u2014 good head taller\nthan I was. That I can tell you. My mother promised to pay whatever damages they\n\u2014 they wanted to have for this incident not to be reported to the Hitler youth leader,\nwhich could possibly lead to my being taken away permanently. That did not\nhappen, and a week or two later, I found myself with my mother. We went to\nwhat\u2019s considered a court in this \u2014 in this Hitler youth leader\u2019s home, where I was\ngoing to be judged one way or the other. Either I wasn\u2019t coming home, or\nsomething would happen. And I guess my mother gave me my life for the second\ntime.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about that court proceeding?\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Yes. Tha-That \u2014 I heard my mother screaming, crying, pleading, begging and\nmyself sitting silently in an \u2014 an outside room, because I was not immediately in the\nroom. I cannot tell you the \u2014 the words that were exchanged, but certainly the\ndescription I\u2019ve given you 1s accurate, I know that it is. And then after a while, I\nwas called into the room, and my mother said \u2014 I was told in advance that if I had\nthe chance to apologize, to do so, and I apologized in the most profuse manner that I\ncould, and my life was spared. My mother gave me my second life.",
        "Q: What happened next? Did your parents get a sense that they needed to leave?",
        "A: I think I \u2014 and again, here\u2019s where the guesswork comes in. An eight year old 1s\nnot told too much, an eight year old, and maybe today they are, but in those times\nan eight year is told what to do and when to do it and how to do it. And at that\npoint, I am sure my mother and father must have thought how they were going to\nget me out of \u2014 out of Berlin, and do it fast, before anything changes, before \u2014\nbefore somebody in the Hitler youth group that had decided \u2014 by the way, my \u2014 my\nparents, my mother dis \u2014 paid a \u2014 a very substantial fine, I was told \u2014 before\nsomeone changed their mind. I think that \u2014 my guesstimate is that I got onto the\nKindertransport list possibly a little faster, and maybe I got onto the list at all\nbecause of \u2014 of this terrible incident. And I left \u2014 I left Berlin sometime in \u2014\nOctober 15, 2010\ntowards the end of January. So roughly about a \u2014 within four weeks after this \u2014 after\nthis incident, I was out of \u2014 out of Berlin.",
        "Q: What were you told, where were you going to be going and why?",
        "A: Well, we had \u2014 we had had papers to come to America for some time, except\nthat they were taken out rather late. My \u2014 my parents, or my mother had a third or\nfourth cousin living in America, somebody who I\u2019d never met, somebody whose\nname I\u2019d never heard of before. But anyway, they had given us the affidavit to\ncome to America. What was lacking to come to America was the quota number,\nbecause my parents, my mother, my father, I guess, always believed to the end that\nthings would not get to that point in time. So we \u2014 we had the affidavit, but no quota\nnumber to come to America. Had we stayed and had I stayed in \u2014 in England \u2014 or\nhad I stayed in, excuse me, had I stayed in Germany for my quota number to\nappear from the American consulate there, I would have been dead. So I went to\nEngland, and my \u2014 my \u2014 my family did have \u2014 did have \u2014 we did have family in \u2014\nin England, but I was bounced around all over the place in \u2014 in \u2014 in England,\nincluding I lived with a wonderful Christian family in a small town about two and a\nhalf hours north of London for about half a year or so, and went to church with\nthem. They shared what they shared with \u2014 whatever they had they shared with me.\nThey were wonderful, caring, giving people, and only a year ago, did I lose contact\nOctober 15, 2010\nwith \u2014 with that family. We would exchange Christmas cards or Thanksgiving\ncards, and it was only last year that I finally failed to get a card, and that \u2014 as a\nmatter of fact, only recently, I wrote to the ca \u2014 the municipality, asking whether\nthey had any records as to what might have happened to this, you know, person of\nthat \u2014 of that family. So I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m very, very grateful. And you should know\nKindertransport, I mean, people tell you, Kindertransport came about because of\na group of Quakers persuading Parliament to take action, and \u2014 which \u2014 that\nallowed 10,000 un-unaccompanied children to enter England. So Christians have\nbeen very, very good to me, and | have a great love and admiration for \u2014 for\nChristians. And to this day, where I participate in a lot of Christian activities.",
        "Q: We do want to hear about your time in England and exactly how that unfolded,\nbut let\u2019s go back a bit to the Kindertransport itself. Do you recall the date?",
        "A: End of January, or \u2014 and it \u2014 when I say end, roughly of \u2014 I\u2019ve tried to look that\nup several times. To the best of my abilities to come up with records, it looks like\nthe third week in January. That\u2019s why I said roughly about a month after this\nterrible incident, which was an act of sheer stupidity on my part. It wasn\u2019t bravery,\nit was stupidity that could have cost me my life. I \u2014 I should have wound up in\nTheresienstadt or in one of the \u2014 probably in that camp, and \u2014 and that only the\nlove of my mother pleading kept me from that.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "Q: Do you recall the train itself?",
        "A: Yes, I remember standing on the platform in \u2014 in Berlin, on the Hauptbahnhof,\nand that \u2014 and the \u2014 the \u2014 the Nazi official calling out the list of names. And I\nremember that my name was not immediately called on the first go-round. All the\nother names were there, and I started to cry, because I knew down deep in my heart,\nthat if I didn\u2019t get out, 1t would cost me my life. Now that\u2019s a hell of a thought for\nan eight year old to have, but those were my thoughts. And \u2014 and I cried, and my\nmother and father who I re \u2014 I already separated from, they were standing on one\nside, and I was on the other side, we had already had our goodbyes. And my mother\nsaid, he doesn\u2019t want to leave us. And I didn\u2019t have the courage to tell her that the\nreason I was crying because my name wasn\u2019t \u2014 was not on the list, and my life\nwasn\u2019t going to be saved. And then the second go-round, my \u2014 my name was called.\nYeah, it was \u2014 it was a horrendous \u2014 horrendous day at a train station, parents and\nchildren were \u2014 were kissing, hugging. Most children would never see their parents;\nI was fortunate to some degree, but nevertheless, whatever the circumstance was,\nfor the child and parent, it was traumatic. Absolutely traumatic. What \u2014 what parent\ntoday would part with their seven, eight year old, nine year old, 10 year old, no,\ndoesn\u2019t really matter. And say, and realize that it might be the final goodbye hug or\nkiss that they would \u2014 would receive. Train \u2014 train went to \u2014 went to Holland. We\nOctober 15, 2010\nsat \u2014 I remember sitting on \u2014 I should tell you, I \u2014 we were allowed \u2014\nKindertransport told us that \u2014 that each child could bring along one specified size\nsuitcase. I should tell you about two weeks before that time, my father took me to\nthe leading store in \u2014 in Berlin, and bought every suit that he could \u2014 that I had an\neye on, and he was going to deck me out in as many suits and coats and jackets as\nhe could find, and \u2014 and ultimately it was all reduced down to nothing, because all\nthose things had to be left behind.",
        "Q: Did they have to be left behind before you packed, or was 1t somehow on the\ntrain \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, this all had to \u2014 the train \u2014 the only thing we could take on the train\nwas one small suitcase, that was it. Whatever fit in that suitcase was fine, but seven\nor eight suits were not going to fit into that suitcase. So \u2014 but my father always\nwanted to do the best for \u2014 for \u2014 for me, all the time.",
        "Q: Once you\u2019re on the train, what was happening? How many kids were around\nyou?",
        "A: I\u2014I would s \u2014 I would say \u2014 well, the train \u2014 we \u2014 we sat in a \u2014 each \u2014 ea \u2014 the\ntrain was sectioned off with little compartments, and each compartment had maybe\nsix or eight chil \u2014 six or eight people, in this case children, in the compartment. And\nall I can tell you 1s that I think we all sat stone-faced, afraid to say a word, either to\nOctober 15, 2010\neach other, or to anyone. We were told to be as quiet as possible, not to say\nanything, not to say anything at all. And 1t wasn\u2019t until we crossed the border into\nHolland that some words were said to \u2014 between each other.",
        "Q: So you were aware of the border crossing?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you \u2014",
        "A: And we were aware at that point before \u2014 before \u2014 obviously before the train left\nBerlin, and the train, 1n going across the border at that \u2014 at both junctures, Nazis\ncame on, and \u2014 to inspect our \u2014 our documentation. Which was also a terrible\nmoment because God forbid they\u2019d saw something that we were unaware of, that\nmight cause you to be pulled off the train. Which did not happen, to the best of my\nknowledge, but that thought was always with us.",
        "Q: What happened once the train was in Dutch territory?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know where \u2014 ultimately we were given food. We were g \u2014 we \u2014 we were\ngiven food and hot chocolate, and it was welcomed. The ultimate port that we went\nto, I can\u2019t tell you the name. And we then embarked o-on \u2014 some people may call it\na ferry. I call it a terrifying boat ride across the English channel. Terrifying because\nthe waves, and I think everybody got seasick. But terrifying only from \u2014 from the\nOctober 15, 2010\nphysical aspect of \u2014 of crossing water, by crossing a \u2014 a rather \u2014 I would say \u2014 not a\ndangerous body of water, but certainly a body of water that was not smooth.",
        "Q: Do you remember arriving in Britain?",
        "A: Yeah. From there \u2014 from \u2014 again, I don\u2019t know the \u2014 the name of the port that we\narrived at, but from there we took a train to London, and where we were welcomed\nby lots of individuals, organizations, people. You know, little bit of normalcy crept\ninto \u2014 there wasn\u2019t any normalcy in our lives, none.",
        "Q: Di-Did you know anyone on the train?",
        "A: No, nobody. I should say \u2014 or, I ta-take that back, my sister was on the train. But\nI don\u2019t remember whether she sat with me in my compartment. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: We haven\u2019t spoken about your sister yet, was she \u2014 is she older, younger?",
        "A: Yeah, she\u2019s seven years older. So as far as I\u2019m concerned, my sister was a \u2014 and\nI\u2019m not denigrating, or talking down about my sister. But my sister was a person\nthat I really had little relationship with as I was growing up, because she was a\ncompletely different age group than I was. So my sister was a \u2014 a sister in \u2014 1n\nname, but not in actuality, if \u2014 if \u2014 if \u20141if I can say that a \u2014 openly and honestly.",
        "Q: So the two of you tra-traveled together to Britain?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: And you disembark.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Are you at that point together, are you being separated, what happens?",
        "A: Separated, but I can\u2019t tell you where \u2014 where my sister went. I do know that for a\ntime period, I was fortunate enough to \u2014 to live with an uncle of mine for a short\nperiod of time, and \u2014 and then I got moved around, and ultimately I wound up in \u2014\nas I said, in this town called Kettering, in \u2014 two and a half hours away from \u2014 from\nLondon as \u2014 as war \u2014 war came to \u2014 to pass. And before \u2014 before \u2014 just before war\n\u2014 war broke out, my parents were able to come extricate. The \u2014 the interesting thing\nis [indecipherable] terrible thing for me, is that I had a very close, loving\nrelationship with my father, and \u2014 and I never heard from my father during this\nwhole time that I was in England. And \u2014 and at that point I thought that my father\nhad a\u2014 had abandoned me, that \u2014 and no longer wanted me, and I felt completely a\n\u2014 completely abandoned. And it was only later on that I found \u2014 found out that my\nfather had suffered a very severe stroke within days after my leaving, and was\nunable to communicate, write, do anything. And my parents got out of \u2014 got out of\nGermany, I would say, just weeks before the \u2014 before the war started. I lived with\nthem briefly when \u2014 up until the time that war broke out, and then I was moved, as I\nsaid, to \u2014 to this community up in \u2014 1n northern England.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "Q: Okay, so I \u2014 I would like a little more information on this part, because it seems\nthat there\u2019s a lot \u2014 a lot of details going on. You get to England some time at the\nend of January, is that correct?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: War breaks out in September.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So there\u2019s a-about seven or eight months, and at first you\u2019re with an uncle.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Is that right?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: And then you get moved around a few times, but you do end up in one place for\nmost of the time?",
        "A: Well Pm \u2014 Tm \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 mainly I\u2019m with \u2014 I\u2019m really with my uncle in th \u2014 in\ntheir residence, but mentally, I really \u2014 mentally I\u2019m totally confused. I don\u2019t know\nwhether I\u2019ll ever see my parents again. Living with an uncle is not the same as\nliving with \u2014 with \u2014 with parents. I had nobody that I could \u2014 could talk to, and \u2014\nand I would \u2014 I remember \u2014 I'll tell you one quick incident. I remember one\nafternoon I was so distraught that I went to a nearby park and I sat down and I start\nto cry. I didn\u2019t know what the hell else to do. And a \u2014 an English lady stopped, with\nOctober 15, 2010\nher \u2014 with her little \u2014 little daughter, maybe two or three years even younger than \u2014\nthan me, and asked me \u2014 cause I couldn\u2019t speak English very well at that point,\ncause nobody gave a damn whether I learned the English language or not \u2014 asked\nme what was wrong, and in my halting English I explained to her that \u2014 how \u2014 how\nlost I was. And that was \u2014 she was the first person that \u2014 that offered a shoulder to \u2014\nto cry on, and \u2014 and gave me some hopeful encouragement. And when she \u2014 when\nshe left, she put a couple of coins in my hand, which I thought was so gracious, and\nso nice. It was the first person that really showed that they \u2014 they really did care. So\nmost of that time, I was with my \u2014 lived in my uncle\u2019s home. I was moved around\nfrom school to school, I can\u2019t tell you why. Nobody really gave me any \u2014 any real\ninstruction on the English language. We were told to be quiet, not to \u2014 not to\ncomplain, not to speak German loudly or anything like that. And weeks before the\nwar, and maybe \u2014 maybe a month or so before the war broke out, my parents were\nable to extricate themselves from \u2014 from Berlin, came t \u2014 came to e \u2014 to England,\nand I moved in with them for a short period of time, maybe weeks or a couple of\nmonths, until war broke out and it was decided that I would be evacuated, as it was\ncalled, to this country \u2014 country place. And I stayed there until \u2014 I stayed there for\nat least six months\u2019 time, came back to London under very unfavorable\nOctober 15, 2010\ncircumstances, because at that point, my father had suffered a second stroke, and\nwas in the hospital, and I knew that there would be no hope for him.",
        "Q: During those eight months when you were separated from your parents, you said\nthat you weren\u2019t getting any news of them, and you later found out that your father\nhad suffered a stroke. Do you know why your mother was \u2014",
        "A: My mother wrote \u2014 my mother wrote to me, and it was \u2014 it was very pleasant,\nvery nice. But I had the \u2014 it\u2019s not that I did not appreciate words from my mother, I\ncertainly did. But not hearing from my father led me to believe that my father\nwanted to ba \u2014 had abandoned me and did not want to talk to me any further. And I\n\u2014 and I wrote back to my mother several times, what I \u2014 what had I done to deserve\nthat, when I always cared and loved my father.",
        "Q: How did your parents get out?",
        "A: We had \u2014 as I said, we had documentation, we \u2014 we had the affidavit to come to\nAmerica, the family did, but nobody \u2014 but the visa number we did not have. And\nsomehow, England took my parents in as transients, knowing that they would not\nstay there for a prolonged period of time. Wer \u2014 you know, how long that time\nperiod might be until their \u2014 until their quota number was called, or whatever the\ncircumstances were that would allow them to travel on to America. And that\u2019s the \u2014\nOctober 15, 2010\nthat\u2019s the way that my parents were able to convince the authorities for them to exit\nGermany, Berlin.",
        "Q: Do you know what they were doing \u2014 oh, first of all wer \u2014 where were they,\nwere they in London \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 when they arrived? Were they working?",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 no. My father \u2014 my father \u2014 as I said, my father had been recovering\nfrom a stroke that he had \u2014 that he had suffered, and my father was no longer able to\nwork at all. My mother had no \u2014 without saying anything adversely about my \u2014 my\nmom, had no skills. Had no skills. As most \u2014 as most German wives, who were\ngood wi \u2014 good wives, home \u2014 home-keepers, homemakers to their husbands and\ntheir families, but they really possessed no \u2014 no real skills, and females in the\nworking place was not something that was a common occurrence in \u2014 in that time\nperiod.",
        "Q: So your family at this point was staying with your uncle?",
        "A: My \u2014 what my uncle did was, my uncle paid for \u2014 for us to have an apartment, a\nseparate apartment.",
        "Q: And at one point \u2014 and this is afterwards, you\u2019re being sent away to the\ncountryside, is that correct?\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: D-Do you know how much time elapsed between your parents arrival and you \u2014\nyou being sent away.",
        "A: I would say se \u2014 only several months. Maybe a month or two months, because a\n\u2014 they only came shortly \u2014 they only arrived in England shortly before the outbreak\nof war, and I was evacuated out of London. I\u2019d say I was evacuated out of London\nrelatively quickly. I can\u2019t tell you how quickly, but relatively quickly. And I will s \u2014\nwill say that \u2014 that I missed \u2014 I missed London, I missed not \u2014 not being in touch\nwith my \u2014 my mother and father, even though my mo \u2014 my father was no longer\nphysically well. And I really wanted to get back to \u2014 to London, and ultimately,\nafter six, seven months I guess, being \u2014 being in the countryside, it was decided that\nbecause I really wanted to come back, even though London at that time was really\nbeing bombed. We had five, six, 700 bombers overnight. I mean, I can remember\nthe nights, one night after the other, was worse than the other one. And I was back\nin \u20141n London, and shortly after I was back, my father suffered his second stroke\nand that was debilitating, that was the end.",
        "Q: When you were sent away to the countryside \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 what were you told, why was this being done?\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: That is \u2014 is being \u2014 it was being done for my safety and well-being, because\neveryone feared that London would be bombed, and that \u2014 and children \u2014 it was\nvery common for children at that time to be evacu \u2014 as we call it, evacuated. I can\u2019t\ntell you whether \u2014 whether \u2014 how I got evacuated, whether it was with my school or\nmy class, I have no idea. But it was a common occurrence for large groups of \u2014 of\nEnglish kids to be evacuated.",
        "Q: At that point were you placed with a family, or was it an institutional situation \u2014",
        "A: I was \u2014 and \u2014 when I was \u2014",
        "Q: Evacuated.",
        "A: \u2014 I was placed \u2014 all I know \u2014 remember, somebody walked around with \u2014 with\nboys and girls, somebody knocked on the door, that person would knock on the\ndoor of a home and say, we have a boy, or we have a girl, or in this case, we have a\nboy, he needs a home, and a \u2014 and a family took me in. A very proper, straight-\nlaced English family. Looking back on that, I don\u2019t know anybody else, coming\nback to if that would be here today, I don\u2019t know whether \u2014 whether a family here\ntoday would do what this family did for me.",
        "Q: By that time, what \u2014 what was your command of English like?",
        "A: Poor. I\u2014 I hadn\u2019t \u2014 there was nobody giving me any English instruction. The\nonly English \u2014 the only English that I had was picking up a word now and then, and\nOctober 15, 2010\nmaybe I\u2019d string two or three words together and make myself understood. And\nthere were \u2014 there was nothing \u2014",
        "Q: Did anyone react to the fact that you were foreign, and especially that you were\nfrom Germany?",
        "A: No, I-I\u2019d say in \u2014 1n the \u2014 in this particular town \u2014 village, as I call it, everyone\ntreated me extremely kindly, extremely fairly. I will tell you one \u2014 one incident in\nLondon that I\u2019d experienced. In prior \u2014 in the \u2014 in the morning we\u2019d kind of\ncongregate outside of \u2014 before going into the building, and I was constantly being\ncalled a\u2014a dirty Nazi. And by \u2014 by the boys, and that \u2014 that was all right, I \u2014 I was,\nyou know, at that point I was able to \u2014 that flowed off me like water off a duck\u2019s\nback. And one day, a \u2014 a\u2014 there was one other Jewish student in the \u2014 1n that class\nof mine, and I guess he didn\u2019t \u2014 he felt that he wasn\u2019t getting his licks in on me, and\nhe called me a dirty Jew. And he probably regretted that, because his face was a\nbloody mess within \u2014 within less than a minute. I picked him up in my arms, and I\nsaid, Raymond, you were supposed to be my friend, and I threw him down on the\nfloor and never spoke to him again. And no one ever picked on me again either, that\nwas the end of it.",
        "Q: This was once you had returned to London, is that correct?",
        "A: Yes, yeah.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "Q: Now, in this small town in the \u2014 in the countryside, do you know whether people\nknew you were Jewish?",
        "A: Oh I\u2019m sure they had to know. They had to know because the people that I was\nwith, being that \u2014 that I couldn\u2019t speak English very well, they were told \u2014 they\nknew that I was Jewish, and I\u2019m sure they, you know, when \u2014 when \u2014 when their\nneighbors asked who I was, I\u2019m sure they explained \u2014 they c \u2014 explicitly, who I\nwas. There was never \u2014 never a word said against me at all.",
        "Q: So you arrived back in London.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What happens next?",
        "A: Well, the blitz is on, you know, the blitz is on within \u2014 within, I'd say within \u2014 I\nwas going to say days, but it might have been within weeks of my return to\nLondon, my father suffers the second stroke, he\u2019s taken into hospital in the middle\nof the night, and I knew that it was a terrible night, because I remember what was \u2014\nI wasn\u2019t told what was happening, but I knew what was happening, and I knew that\nwould be the last time that \u2014 that the day before was the last time that I would have\nbeen able to speak to my father. He was paralyzed on one side, he had lost \u2014 he had\nno sight, he had no speech. I mean, I wasn\u2019t told it was the beginning of the end, or\nthe end was \u2014 I knew that was \u2014 was a matter of wha \u2014 only time.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "Q: Where was your sister during these months?",
        "A: I can\u2019t even tell you.",
        "Q: Was she there in London at that point?",
        "A: Yes. I can\u2019t tell you, I don\u2019t know. Maybe \u2014 maybe my world \u2014 my world was so\ninsular, if that\u2019s the proper word, that \u2014 that \u2014 that I really had no \u2014 no real thoughts\nabout anything. It\u2019s cruel to say it, but my thoughts were, you know, what am I\ngonna do the next hour, tomorrow and so forth.",
        "Q: Do you recall the bombings?",
        "A: My \u2014 my \u2014 my parents, I should tell you, that my parents, in going back to\nGermany took \u2014 actually my mother and my fa \u2014 my \u2014 my \u2014 my mother and my\nsister, in retrospect, took English lessons in Germany during the last maybe six\nmonths or so in ninet \u2014 of maybe \u2014in \u2014 1n the beginning of 1938. They would\nalways close the door to the \u2014 to the living room, or they wou \u2014 the room where the\n\u2014 where the English teacher came, and I was told it was not for me to know what\nwas going on. I was e \u2014 I was excluded from certain things, and that\u2019s \u2014 you know,\nthat\u2019s a common occurrence. But a couple of English words wouldn\u2019t have hurt me.\nI did not learn \u2014I really did not learn English \u2014 did not learn to speak as well as I\nmight until I came to America and that \u2014 I started going to the movies and I would\nlisten to Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable and \u2014 and Henry Fonda, and I would\nOctober 15, 2010\nmimic their words, mimic they \u2014 the way that they pronounced words. When I came\nout of the \u2014 th-the movie theater, I would try to remember the words that I\u2019d heard,\nthat some which I did not know, and \u2014 many which I did not know. And when \u2014\nwhen I went to school the following Monday, I would try to memorize those words\nfrom the movies, and \u2014 and then I would look them up 1n the dictionary. So I\nlearned \u2014 I-I would say my \u2014 my prime teachers for the English language were the\nstars of the \u2014 of the 1940s, and the best of them.",
        "Q: So you said you were in London during the blitz \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 1s that correct?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s when your father passes away\u201d?",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t pass away. He\u2019s \u2014 my father lingered for a long time, a long time. I\nwould say from some time in \u2014 sometime in 1940 to 1941. So I'd say my father was\npar-paralyzed, incapacitated \u2014 totally incapacitated during this whole time period,\nand did not pass away until I would say maybe three, four months, five months after\nI came to America. And then one day my aunt told me that she had to sit down and\ntell me something rather seriously, and I knew already what it was, and it wasn\u2019t a\ngreat big shock, even I was, at that time I was \u2014 I was 10 years old. You know, it\nOctober 15, 2010\nwas \u2014 it was sad news for me, but what was sad really was \u2014 the saddest moment for\nme in England really was separation from my father, because at that point when \u2014\nwhen I was supposed to come to America, I was taken to the hospital. And my\nfather could understand, but he couldn\u2019t talk. My father was told that I was going to\nAmerica the following day, and this would be the last time that he would \u2014 that I\nwould be in his presence, or that I would be able to see him. And ... my father\nplaced his hand on my \u2014 on my head. I didn\u2019t know what that meant, and \u2014 and I\ndidn\u2019t have \u2014 eight, nine year olds, 10 year olds, don\u2019t ask anything, we just listen.\nAnd then, when I was 13, I was Bar Mitzvahed in New York, and a rabbi put his\nhand on my head, and I knew what my father was doing. That probably was the\nsaddest day that I had in England. And my mother came to America. My mother\nstayed in \u2014 in England with my father obviously, to the end, which was maybe a\nhalf a year or so after I came to America. At that time, even as I came to America\non a ship \u2014 and I have the \u2014 the boarding pass still at home, and I even have a\npicture of the ship which one of my assistants dredged up for me from the internet.\nThat was a ship that took me from Liverpool to Montreal. Took about 10 days, 10\n- 12 days. We were in a convoy for about the first two or three days. We were a\nrelatively modest sized ship, passenger cargo ship. Had a \u2014 as I said, a convoy for\nthe first two or three days\u2019 time, which you \u2014 where you felt relatively safe, because\nOctober 15, 2010\nthe destroyers were throwing depth charges around, and you never knew whether\nthey were firing at somebody \u2014 something 1n reality, or just as a \u2014 a precaution. And\nthen maybe on the the third or fourth day, the convoy was gone, and you were\nalone. And there you were in the north Atlantic, and as I found out later on, maybe\nonly 30 or 40 percent of the ships that sailed on the north Atlantic during that time\nperiod actually got through. I was de \u2014 certainly much aware of the fact that the\nchances of getting through were \u2014 were at best 50 \u2014 50, and a life jacket was\nsomething that was on me continuously, but hell, if that ship was torpedoed, I knew\nthat we were gone, all of us were gone.",
        "Q: So I\u2019m very interested in exactly what you knew at the time as a child, and going\nback to when you\u2019re still in London, how was the decision made that you were able\nto get to America? How much did you know in advance that you were able to \u2014 to\ndo this and where were you spatially, were you still living at your uncles? Were the\nbombs coming down, did you need to go underground? Can you describe that for\nme?",
        "A: I\u2019m going to take it back to Kristallnacht. I was eight years, eight and a half\nyears old on November eighth. On November ninth I was 18 years old. I had\nperipheral vision at that point. I could see what was going on. I had fear built into\nme. There wasn\u2019t anything that I was not prepared to do or see. So I did not \u2014 I was\nOctober 15, 2010\nnot any more \u2014 and I don\u2019t want to use the word normal, I was not normal any more\nat that time. And there was \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I could \u2014 I did things \u2014 I\u2019d experienced\nlife as no other eight year old ever had, and as a result was able to cope with life on\nmy own in a way that no eight, nine or 10 year old ever would. During the time\nperiod of the London blitz, I was with \u2014 I lived with my \u2014 with my mother and\nfather, and it was my \u2014 there was \u2014 the blitz started every \u2014 every evening, every\nnight time from \u2014 from as soon as it got dark, til early in the morning, four or five\nhours of intense bombing. It was unbelievable. As I said the \u2014 you know, you could\nhear the \u2014 the roar of the planes, it was \u2014 it was frightening, it was dreadful. In the\nmorning you could see the glow, you could s \u2014 buildings would shake around us.\nYou could see buildings that had been b-bombed out, you could see fires on the\nstreet. All the \u2014 all the wreckage \u2014 the only thing that was not wrecked was the\nspirit of the London people, who always remained calm, and had their brooms in\nhand to tidy up the best way they could. They were \u2014 they were miraculous.\nAbsolutely miraculous. Once in a while we did s-sleep in the \u2014 in the underground,\nwhich was deep underground. Underground being subway, but which protected us\nfrom \u2014 from bombs up above. And once in a while \u2014 actually I remember one day\nwhen I went to school, that the air raids started in \u2014 in the day time, and that was\nunusual because most of the bombing runs, the air raids started in the \u2014 1n the early\nOctober 15, 2010\nevening. And at that point I was in a bomb shelter from early in the morning to\nmiddle of the afternoon. I rushed home, and within an hour later, I was back in the\nbomb shelter. So I spent maybe 20 hours that day in various bomb shelters. So I\ndon\u2019t get too excited any more about people saying that you know, you don\u2019t know\n\u2014 you don\u2019t know what it like \u2014 what it\u2019s like being bombed, I certainly do know\nwhat it\u2019s like. And I do know what it means to have four or five, six, seven, 800\nplanes overhead in London, bombing the \u2014 the [indecipherable] city to daylights.\nWas unbel \u2014 unbelievable. And then one \u2014 one day I was told by my mother that \u2014\nthat my papers had \u2014 that our papers had come due to come to America, and I\ngather they came due faster than \u2014 than people had thought. Because basically,\npeople were being eradicated, or people were not able to leave Germany because of\nthe war, they had \u2014 they \u2014 they might have had papers also, or they were in\nconcentration camps now, and as a result our \u2014 our number \u2014 our quota number\ncame up somewhat faster than \u2014 that had been an-anticipated, and say my \u2014 our\nquota number came up in September, October of 1940, and that\u2019s when I exited\nfrom \u2014 from \u2014 from \u2014 from London. And my mother would have been free to go,\nhad she decided to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 but she wasn\u2019t going to leave my father there.",
        "Q: How long did it take to cross the Atlantic?\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: I would say somewhere between 10 and 14 days. It was a \u2014 it was quite a\nvoyage, quite a voyage. And as I said, the \u2014 the lifeyacket, this cork lifejacket,\nbulky, was part of \u2014 part of my \u2014 my attire. Almost tha \u2014 or certainly all day, and at\nnight it was always right there for me to wear. But it was frightening as all hell to\nthink that \u2014 that death would await us in the water, which it certainly was a \u2014 a great\npossibility of that happening. Ships were being torpedoed left and right.",
        "Q: Were you many \u2014 were you one of many children, or were you the only\nunaccompanied child at that point?",
        "A: My sister was on that ship. How many passengers on the ship, I have no idea.",
        "Q: So at this point your sister is 17?",
        "A: Yeah. My sister\u2019s always seven years older than I am, okay? If I am 10, she\u2019s 17,\nif I \u2014 she\u2019s always \u2014 she always is ahead of me, and as I said, there is no\nrelationship per se, between a 10 year old and a 17 year old. It\u2019s a\u2014 it\u2019s a different\nelement.",
        "Q: Did you know where you were going?",
        "A: To America \u2014 yes I did. I knew that we were going, that this cousin, this third or\nfourth cousin who I had never heard of before, who was kind enough to \u2014 they came\nto America from Germany, roughly about 1935 \u2014 \u201936 from what I was told, and\nhad settled in New York, they had given my parents the affidavit to come to\nOctober 15, 2010\nAmerica. And that\u2019s where I was bound for. So I landed in Montreal. I should tell\nyou when we \u2014 when I \u2014 the 10 hours or so, six hours prior to landing, somebody \u2014\nsomebody said, it smells differently. And it does smell differently on the water,\nwhen land is nearby. And ultimately somebody said, land. And you couldn\u2019t \u2014\ncouldn\u2019t believe the cheers that went up from all the people on deck. And of course\nme, being the internal pessimist said Jesus, ships can get torpedoed just as easily fro\n\u2014 you know, five or six hours away from shore, than \u2014 than \u2014 than out on the \u2014\nfurther out on the waters. And ships actually were torpedoed closer, I found out\nlater on. And we \u2014 we went to \u2014 to Montreal, exited the ship in Montreal, took a\ntrain from Montreal to New York, and we \u2014 we was welcomed by my uncle and\naunt, as I said, third \u2014 third or fourth cousins, who welcomed me to New York and\ntried to, you know, who accepted me, who \u2014 who cared \u2014 who had no other\nchildren, who cared for me. They had very limited means. My \u2014 my uncle was \u2014\nthese \u2014 these people had a \u2014 a small dry goods \u2014 they had a successful dry goods\noperation in Germany, I\u2019m not quite sure where, I think in Stettin. And came to\nAmerica, realized what was happening, and my father \u2014 my \u2014 my uncle rather,\nbecame an elevator operator, local 32B. And ran an elevator in a \u2014 in a freight\nbuilding. My aunt did something that you probably don\u2019t even know, called\npiecework. Wa \u2014 were \u2014 meaning that she embroidered sweaters. And I would help\nOctober 15, 2010\nher to embroider these sweaters, and a result, at the end of the week I would get my\ndime allowance, and I would spend that on the movies. And after I felt a little bit\nsure of myself, I would use some of that money for a comic book. And I graduated\nfrom \u2014 once I \u2014 once I mastered the art of comic books, I then graduated to real\nbooks, and that\u2019s how I learned to read, write. I had some wonderful teachers in \u2014 in\nNew York, the first school I went to, who decided I would \u2014 should go back a\ngrade, should be set back so I wouldn\u2019t have the pressure to perform. I-I was \u2014 I did\nthat for about oh, several months\u2019 time. And then they decided I was ready,\nlanguage-wise, skill-wise, and they moved up \u2014 moved me up to grade level. And\nI\u2019ve \u2014 we moved into a \u2014 an area of New York called Washington Heights, which\nmany ca \u2014 many people called what the \u2014 the fourth or fifth Reich, because there\nwere So many Germans \u2014 German Jewish people living up in that area. And then I\ngot moved around.\n[break]",
        "Q: So, was your sister put in school?",
        "A: No, my sister obviously at that \u2014 that time, I think, to the best of my knowledge,\nand the best as I recall, my sister became a \u2014 a \u2014 an au \u2014 au pair, not a domestic, an\nau pair in a family somewhere in mid-town, and took care of a \u2014 a child for that\nfamily. And she did that immediately upon coming here.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "Q: What was America like for you? What does \u2014 what did it seem like?",
        "A: Well, America was very scary for me, it was \u2014 it was a-adjusting to a \u2014 a brand\nnew environment. Give you another \u2014 another aside. Obviously I-I gravitated to\nsome children, Jewish children that were in my school to play with after \u2014 after\nhours. You know, we play on the street and play some games. And that happened\nfor about a week or two \u2014 two, and those children, those boys asked me how \u2014 who\nI was and told me \u2014 asked me about something about my background. And I told\nthem very freely and o-openly where I came from, what I had experienced, the war,\nand so forth and so on. And one of them said, well why don\u2019t you come up, my \u2014\nmy parents would like to meet you. So I went upstairs to their apartment, and spoke\nto the parents, father, and again I repeated, you know, my \u2014 what we had gone\nthrough, and what life was like. And the next day the boy came to me and said, my\nfather doesn\u2019t wish \u2014 wish me to play with you anymore, because your stories are\nnot believable, and they\u2019re too dark. And from that point on I gravi \u2014 I stayed away\nfrom Jewish children altogether. And my best friend during this time period, that\nwas New York, before I moved elsewhere, was a Methodist family, who almost\nadopted me. Took me wi \u2014 on \u2014 I lived with them after school, and observed\nholidays, they bought gifts for me at Christmastime. They made me feel as part of\nthe family. They were Methodists. And again, non-Jews had more compassion for\nOctober 15, 2010\nme than Jewish people. And that Jewish people here in New York could not have it,\ncould not find it in their hearts to believe what I was talking about, I found it\nindescribable. It \u2014 it really was destroying to me. But I said at that point in time, I\nwould not \u2014 I would not play with a Jewish child again, period.",
        "Q: When did your mother come over to United States?",
        "A: Well, after about \u2014 living here in New York for about, I would say maybe eight,\nnine months or so, my aunt and uncle here in New York had a rather small\napartment, and actually my \u2014 my bed was a collapsible one that was set up in the\nkitchen. And it became more and more difficult for my aunt and uncle to take care\nof me, I think financially as well. And an uncle \u2014 another uncle of mine, during this\ntime period had \u2014 had gone \u2014 had emigrated from Berlin to London and then from\nLondon to California, and it was decided that I would move to California. And I\ndid something that probably no 10 year old had ever done before, and probably\nnever will, I flew \u2014 my uncle paid for me to fly to California, and th \u2014 and to fly to\nCalifornia in the year 1940 was a\u2014 was something, very, very, very exceptional.\nTook about almost 18 hours to fly to \u2014 from New York to California. My uncle, as\nI said, had been a successful lawyer. He had a very lovely apartment in \u2014 in Los\nAngeles. I was enrolled in school in Los Angeles. My uncle had a \u2014 had some\nwonderful, well-to-do friends. I learned how to live a little bit again, I learned how\nOctober 15, 2010\nto smile again, a little bit. My \u2014 my uncle was \u2014 was a \u2014 had a great love of classical\nmusic which I \u2014 which I \u2014 not adopted, but which came off \u2014 which rubbed off on\nme, which I also, I think received from my father, going back in time. He too, had a\ngreat love of classical music. And \u2014 but I did learn something in addition to that. I\nlearned how to live \u2014 I learned how to talk with people, and I learned something\nabout finance in my \u2014 in that early age, because I \u2014 my \u2014 my uncle would be glued\nto the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the radio every afternoon to listen to the outcome of the financial\nmarkets. And from that, I would listen to my uncle with \u2014 with bated breath, as to\nwhat was going on in the financial markets \u2014 didn\u2019t understand it that well, but\nbecame very interested in it, and I believe because of that interest, 1t undoubtedly\nsparked my further interest into seeing what went \u2014 what was out in this \u2014 in this\nworld, which had served my uncle so well, and which ultimately has served our\nfamily well, because that \u2014 that became my profession.",
        "Q: At this point you were living in California?",

        "A: In Los Angeles.",
        "Q: How long were you there?\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: I would say maybe a \u2014 also another \u2014 a year, a year and a half or something like\nthat. Probably a year and a half.",
        "Q: And at this point \u2014",
        "A: I went \u2014 I learned \u2014 I learned what a hamburger was, I learned what a drive-in\nwas. I learned how live | \u2014 live life again, the way that we had \u2014 that I had not\nexperienced possibly for the preceding three years before that time, before leav \u2014\nleaving Berlin.",
        "Q: And during this year or so, where 1s your mother and where is your sister?",
        "A: My \u2014 my \u2014 my sister is in New York, still doing exactly \u2014 I think she might have\nmi\u2014 been moved \u2014 might have moved her position to another family. But\nessentially doing that \u2014 that type of work. And my mother was still in England.\nAnd my mother came from England to the U.S. \u2014 and I\u2019m guessing here \u2014\nsomewhere around 1943, maybe very late \u00b042, but I would \u2014 I would judge very\nearly \u00b043.",
        "Q: What happens after you leave California, where do you go?",
        "A: New York. I come back here, I again embark on an adventure of a lifetime as a\nchild, and come back, my uncle just asks me \u2014 I mean, what child is asked these\nkinds of questions, he asked me, how would you like to go back to New York? I\nsaid, what are my choices, I remember. He said, well, you can fly back to New\nOctober 15, 2010\nYork, or you can take a train back to New York. He said, taking a train back to\nNew York will probably take roughly about five days. I said, let\u2019s take the train. I'd\nflown one way, I said, let me see what it\u2019s like seeing America through the\nwindows of a train.",
        "Q: And what was it like?",
        "A: It was terrific, terrific. People were \u2014 the people on the train were very, very\nkind, making sure that I went into the dining car. And of course my \u2014 my uncle had\ngiven me su-sufficient monies to go into the dining car for \u2014 for my meals, and\ngiven me a long \u2014a\u2014a-\u2014a kit with cookies that I know that I \u2014 I would enjoy, and\nthings of that sort. But it was fantastic, seeing America through the windows of a\ntrain.",
        "Q: Did you feel that you felt differently about say the British, as opposed to the\nAmericans, or was that one group for you?",
        "A: I felt \u2014I\u2014If-\u2014 Ive always felt that my \u2014 my \u2014 my blood is red, white and blue,\nfor \u2014 for England and for America. I am thankful beyond words for what England\ndid for me. If my parents would not have gotten out at all, I would have gotten out,\nand \u2014 and I should also tell you that two years ago, a \u2014 the \u2014 a Holocaust museum in\nour area asked me to do a kinder \u2014 a program on the Kindertransport. I told them I\nwould only do such a program if we brought somebody up from the English\nOctober 15, 2010\nconsulate to express my \u2014 my gratitude in person. Approximately two years ago, I\ndid run a program for the \u2014 for the Holocaust museum of our area on the\nKindertransport, and \u2014 and I had made contact with the consul general\u2019s office in\nNew York, and the \u2014 the vice-consul and deputy consul general came up and IIsa\nand I had enjoyed his company, we had ka \u2014 the private company with him for\nlunch and then we brought him up to the program, and I said to Ilsa, I said, we\u2019ll\nprobably have 50 people at the program, I said, nobody ever comes to listen to any\nof these things. And \u2014 and 350 people came. I \u2014 I couldn\u2019t believe it. 350 people\ncame and \u2014 and listened to the program, which consisted mainly of my s \u2014 my\nspeech, and obviously a \u2014 some remarks from \u2014 from the consul general. And we\u2019ve\nstayed in contact with each other, and \u2014 and if I can carry that on a little bit further,\nwe ve also established a relationship with the consul general o-of the \u2014 the German\nconsul general in \u2014 in New York and \u2014 and Ilsa and I will be s \u2014I wish it \u2014 I wish \u2014\nI can\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t like to use this word, being recognized, honored, we\u2019re being \u2014\nwe\u2019re going to be recognized, honored by our Holocaust center next Sunday, a\nweek from today. And again, I \u2014 I said I wanted the consul generals to come up, and\nthat\u2019s the way I wanted it, and I was sure that he would, and \u2014 because we had\nestablished a \u2014 a previous relationship with him already, and \u2014 and he was only too\nhappy to do that. So he will be our guest speaker next Sunday and \u2014 and I\u2019m kind of\nOctober 15, 2010\nshaking, quivering in my boots, because even though I am not afraid of anything, I\nam \u2014 I am very tenuous about the \u2014 about what I \u2014 what I am going to say, or what I\nmight say or not say and do. But it will be an exciting evening, and we do have a\u2014a\nsubstantial number of people coming to that dinner.\nA2: A record number.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you went back to New York. What happened next?",
        "A: When I came back to New York, we moved \u2014 when I say \u2014 at that point, my\nmother took an apartment in \u2014 in uptown Washington Heights. It\u2019s an \u2014 an area\nknown as really Inwood. Inwood, Washington Heights. My mother went to work\ndoing factory work. Had never done this \u2014 had never done the kind of work that she\nwas now doing. She was working 10 - 12 hours a night, in the most menial position,\nto sustain us. And I moved into the apartment \u2014 we moved into an apartment house,\nI said, in Inwood. And there were many families, like families of our \u2014 called\nrefugee status, or whatever. And I formed a bond with three other boys, very close\nin age proximity, not all having gone through a similar type of experience that I had\nto undergo, but boys that also had fled with their families from Germany. And we\nformed a very close bond, and we called ourselves the boys of 1815, because it was\n1815 Riverside Drive. And it was \u2014 unfortunately, the last one of those boys \u2014 the\nOctober 15, 2010\nlast one 1s me, but the last other one passed on last year, which was a very sad\nevent. And we would work together in the Catskills and Fleischmanns, New York.\nWe made our first \u2014 first money, we became rich, at least tho \u2014 so we thought,\nearning 500 bucks for the \u2014 500 dollars for the season, in 50 cent and dollar tips.\nBut it gave us our first entry into earning some money.",
        "Q: What year was this? When did you earn your first dollar?",
        "A: I would say \u2014 I would say the minute \u2014 I \u2014 I would say, when I was 14. I \u2014 I told\n\u2014 I told a \u2014 the \u2014 the hotel \u2014 hotel people I was 16. I did. I\u2014 cause you weren\u2019t\nsupposed to work at that time \u2014 at that \u2014 at that age yet. You could not get work \u2014\nnot get working papers, but still you weren\u2019t \u2014 you were only supposed to work\nlimited number of hours, and you had to fudge the truth. Not lie, fudge the truth.\nThere\u2019s a difference. So we \u2014 we worked in \u2014 in \u2014 in Fleischmanns New York. It\nwas a hell of an experience, and we \u2014 we gained financial independence from our\nparents, which was very important.",
        "Q: I suppose you were aware of the fact that America had entered into the war?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did you feel about that?",
        "A: We followed the n \u2014 the \u2014 the news of America\u2019s involvement in the war. I\nprobably could \u2014 could show you the maps of what was happening with greater\nOctober 15, 2010\naccuracy than any other American, because I knew Europe. What I could not quite\nunderstand, is at the onset of the war, which was still the \u2014 the end of the Great\nDepression here in this country, and people again in this country, who really did not\nquite fathom the depravity that had occurred in \u2014 in Europe, and how bad \u2014 how\nbadly things had gotten, and the reason I really mention this, because there were\nstill people here in America that were striking for benefits. And looking back on \u2014\non the scene now, I could understand what was happening here. People were\nconcerned about eking out a living here. They were \u2014 they were more concerned\nabout that until really the onset \u2014 once war broke out, then I think the country really\nbecame \u2014 became \u2014 the country became unified as nothing I\u2019d ever seen before, the\nsame way as it would happen in England.",
        "Q: Were you able to be in touch with anyone back in Germany during those years,\nor al-all ties were severed at that \u2014",
        "A: All ties were severed. All ties were severed. I did have family remaining in\nEngland, and I would say contact was at best intermittent. Letter writing was still\nsomething that went on, and \u2014 and who wants to write letters at let \u2014 when you\u2019re\n12 - 13 - 14 years old, you know, that\u2019s not a great \u2014 1f my mother would write a\nletter to \u2014 to our relatives, I would \u2014 I would be asked to \u2014 to join in, I would wr-\nwrite one sentence, you know? For t \u2014 for boys and girls do at that age. But we went\nOctober 15, 2010\n\u2014 we went back \u2014 we had been back \u2014 we\u2019ve gone back to Berlin rather quickly, I\nwould say probably within five or six years at the end of the war. We\u2019ve been back\nto Berlin, I would say at least \u2014 at least every two years\u2019 time, from the 50s on, and\nas recently as \u2014 as the \u2014 the commemoration of Kristallnacht, the 70\" anni-\nanniversary. We \u2014 we were in \u2014 in Berlin with Chancellor Merkel at the Reich(ph)\nstrasse synagogue. Wonderful ceremony, sad ceremony. I took my \u2014 my \u2014 my\nchildren \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t say my children, I took my daughter \u2014 we have three children,\nI took my daughter, my son-in-law. They had been to Berlin with me previously.\nAnd I also took one of their children who was free at that time, a young lady. And\nwe went to the ceremony. That \u2014 that was all aided, the \u2014 the logistics of attaining\nthat ceremony was all aided by the consul general\u2019s office, who we got to know\nvery closely during that time period as an extremely fine gentleman. And he aided\nus to make sure that we were included in that \u2014 in that ceremony. When I say\nincluded, being able to attend that ceremony. And we spent a day with \u2014 with our\nchildren, showing them where our synagogue had been, what had transpired, and I\nstood at \u2014 at the site where my synagogue was, where there is now a large bronze\nplaque, which I say unashamedly is there because I asked the [indecipherable] to\nfix that \u2014 that \u2014 that plaque. There had been a \u2014 there had been a \u2014 there had been a\nsmall marker as to where \u2014 what had been on the site previously, and many, many\nOctober 15, 2010\nyears ago I had contacted the Berlin authorities, asked them to renew that plaque\nwith an \u2014 with one that really was more meaningful, which they did almost\nimmediately. Germans are the \u2014 are the most thorough people, and the most \u2014 they\nare the most willing to \u2014 to please, and they are most willing to understand what\ntranspired. Chancellor Merkel spoke at \u2014 at that ceremony spoke about the past,\nJewish relationship, the present, of never having something like that again, spoke\nabout the future, of \u2014 of Israeli German relationship and of the danger of the Iranian\nsituation. So she covered all the bases, spoke eloquently about them. And I again\nsaw Chancellor Merkel in a rather small ceremony, roughly about a month ago,\nwhen I was asked to attend a ceremony at the Leo Beck Institute in New York\nCity, where Chancellor Merkel was given the Leo Beck Medal of Freedom, which\nis a very high commendation. And I later found out that ch \u2014 that Leo Beck, a\nwonderful, distinguished rabbi, theologian, rabbi, was the guest speaker in 1930 at\nthe synagogue that I\u2019d mentioned to you previously, my synagogue was inaugurated\nby cha \u2014 by chancellor Leo \u2014 Rabbi Leo Beck, which I found an absolutely\nwonderful coin-coincidence.\nA2: I have pictures of a lot of stuff that we saw in \u2014 two years ago, and previously.",
        "A: We - we have \u2014\nA2: [indecipherable] tomorrow.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 we have tried to \u2014 we have tried to \u2014 I have tr \u2014 I have tried, we have tried to\nshare our history in a way that \u2014 all \u2014 we\u2019ve taken all of our children to \u2014 to\nGermany. We have taken some of our children to Germany as either th \u2014 based\nupon their availability, based upon their \u2014 what we felt was their age group, that\nthey would be able to comprehend what \u2014 what \u2014 what it was like, and what the past\nwas like, so it was not just a \u2014 a vacation for them.",
        "Q: So, I'd like to know a little bit more about 1944 and 1945 for you. You said you\nwere looking at the news very, very closely. Was there any news about the Jewish\ncommunity in Berlin?",
        "A: Not that I \u2014",
        "Q: [background noise] Just waiting for the door to close. Okay.",
        "A: No, I did not know any specific facts about the Jewish community in Berlin, or\nknow any specific facts about any Jewish community. But, I knew on November \u2014\nNovember 9\"\", 1938, that conc \u2014 I knew of concentration camps, and I knew that\nJews were being taken away to concentration camps on a regular basis. So I knew\nwhere \u2014 where \u2014 where Jews were. And I didn\u2019t have to be shown pictures, or \u2014 or\ntold something and say God, I never knew that. I knew \u2014 I knew what was\nhappening. As I left, I kn-knew what was ha \u2014 I knew what was happening while I\nwas in Germany. As I said, the sad \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the sad thing that I remember\nOctober 15, 2010\ncoming to New York was this father not wanting \u2014 wanting to evade the truth of\nwhat was happening.",
        "Q: Do you recall the end of the war? Do you remember V-E Day?",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: What was that day like?",
        "A: A miracle. A miracle. Absolutely a miracle. Couldn\u2019t \u2014 you know, I think, I\ndon\u2019t \u2014 wh-what was V Day? In \u2014 in August of \u2014 I don \u2014 I forget exactly what \u2014",
        "Q: Well, the end of the war in Europe was in May \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 and the end of the war in the Pacific was in August.",
        "A: Yeah, well, at \u2014 at that time, in \u2014 in August, we were \u2014 we were working in\nFleischmanns, New York, okay? And that \u2014 and again, this was \u2014 Fleischmanns,\nNew York was a haven for German Jews on vacation. And yes, we experienced V-\nE Day there, and as I remember, this was pandum \u2014 joy of pandemonium\nproportions, that\u2019s the only way \u2014 that\u2019s the only way I can describe it. And \u2014 and as\nfar as \u2014 as far as the end of the \u2014 the war in Europe, there was \u2014 there was a great\ndeal of \u2014 of \u2014 I hate to say it, of joy on my part when I heard that Dresden was \u2014\nwas carpet firebombed, that Berlin was firebombed, that other cities were\nfirebombed. Remember, I was in \u2014 in \u2014 in England when Coventry was leveled,\nOctober 15, 2010\nokay? And I saw London being leveled, and Coventry being leveled because there\nwas a church there they wanted to \u2014 to bomb. So I had no \u2014 I had absolutely zero\ncompassion, zero heart. I wanted to see as much destruction of Germany as\npossible, as much destruction. And the first \u2014 the first time that we were back in\nGermany, you know, you \u2014 I could s \u2014 I would say a large proportion of people had\namputated limbs. And I knew what were they from, they were from bombings.\nEither they \u2014 either they had fought in the war, the men had fought in the war, or\nthey had been com \u2014 had been civilians. I had no compassion for them, none.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s interesting, you said that you had no compassion for them, yet you went\nback to Germany five or six years after the war.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What was your motivation to go back?",
        "A: I survived. I had survived. I am not a religious Jew, but I will tell you, every time\nthat we go back to Berlin, I made sure that our time period in Berlin is over the\nSabbath. And I insist that we always, that anybody who\u2019s with me, knows that\nwe're going to services. And I'll tell you also something special. There\u2019s a\nsynagogue in Berlin, it\u2019s not very f\u2014 not f \u2014 it\u2019s within walking distance of the \u2014 of\nthe Kempinski Hotel on Kurfuirstendamm, that \u2014 we go to 10 services. That\nsynagogue sits within a courtyard of apartment dwellings, apartment buildings. As a\nOctober 15, 2010\nresult, the synagogue was ransacked, but not burned down, because had it been\ntorched, buildings and surrounding buildings would have also gone down; they\nweren\u2019t going to do that. I found out later on here in the U.S. from my sister that\nthat was a synagogue that my uncle, a \u2014 a brother of my father, had been the\npresident of in 1930s. And from a diary, from a written diary of my grandfather,\nthat my grandfather wrote that he celebrated his 75\" birthday in that particular\nsynagogue. I want you to know that I too celebrated my 75\" birthday in that\nsynagogue and was called to the Torah.",
        "Q: Well, thank you very much, do you have \u2014\nA2: [inaudible]",
        "Q: That was wonderful note. If you have any other comments you would like to\nmake at this time.",
        "A: No, I\u2019ve probably taken up too much of your time.",
        "Q: Absolutely not. Thank you very much for your interview today.",
        "A: I\u2019ve probably bored you with too much \u2014",
        "Q: Absolutely not.",
        "A: \u2014 and I apologize if I\u2019ve taken up \u2014",
        "Q: No need to apologize, this was wonderful.\nA2: Just one interesting postscript.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "Q: Sure.\nA2: When we were in Berlin two years ago for the 70\" anniversary, and we went to\nJohn\u2019s old neighborhood and we saw the plaque at the synagogue and the benches\nthat had \u2014 you know, a \u2014 in the square there were various commemorative things up\non these lampposts. The \u2014 the tow \u2014 the commu \u2014 whatever, the borough, had put\nup a big floral arrangement at the site.",
        "Q: At the site of \u2014 at the site of my synagogue, where this lar \u2014 it\u2019s a really large\nbronze plaque, and on that bronze plaque 1-is an inscription of my \u2014 of our rabbi, o-\nof \u2014 of Kristallnacht, saying in essence, we had believed that \u2014 that Germany was\nour future, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, whate-whatever it was, very appropriate \u2014\nvery appropriately put words. And the borough had placed two large wreaths on \u2014\non the site, on \u2014 on the \u2014 on \u2014 yeah, anniversary of Kristallnacht. And I spoke to\nmy \u2014 my children and my \u2014 my granddaughter, exactly what I\u2019d experienced.\nWithin \u2014 within seconds, I had a group of German citizens who lived in \u2014 right\nthere, came \u2014 came around and listened to me. And one woman came with a\nmemorial candle that she lit. It was amazing, absolutely amazing, and \u2014 and people\nexpressed their \u2014 you know, spoke in \u2014 you know, they \u2014 they heard that I could\nalso speak German, and \u2014 and you know, they expressed their \u2014 their \u2014\nQ2: [indecipherable] English.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, th-th \u2014 they expressed in words their \u2014 the \u2014 you know, how they felt\nabout what had \u2014 what had \u2014 what had transpired. And a Christian group, again\nChristian, okay? They are so important in my life. A Christian group in \u2014 in \u2014 in my\narea had set up a storefront and boarded it up and put on a Star of David, and c-call\nit Jude, and \u2014 and desecrated the front of a \u2014 of a storefront as a kind of a replica as\nto what we had endured during that time period. And I found that touching. And as\nmy \u2014 my wife said, on the lampposts around \u2014 around the park where we lived,\nthere were signs as to what had transpired against Jews in that period. What I also\nfound very interesting is that two blocks away from where we lived \u2014 and my\nparents never told me this, I\u2014 Albert Einstein lived. Okay? And there\u2019s a large \u2014 a\nlarge stone \u2014 I can\u2019t say a memorial, what do you \u2014 lar \u2014 large \u2014 a very, very large\nstone plaque that this was the residence of Albert Einstein. I said, my God, I never\nknew that I lived in such a \u2014 such a prestigious neighborhood. But \u2014 but \u2014 but ger \u2014\nGerman \u2014 German citizens are much more aware \u2014 I \u2014 I think \u2014 my gut feeling tells\nme that the Holocaust will be \u2014 will be nothing other than a museum piece in years\nto come, that who knows whether even our Jewish grandchildren or their children\nwill have knowledge of the Holocaust? I think it\u2019s going to \u2014 I think \u2014 I think it will\ndisappear in time, and you will \u2014 you will stay around. When I say you, I\u2019m talking\nabout the Holocaust Museum, and maybe a couple of other ones wi-will stay\nOctober 15, 2010\naround. But I \u2014 we\u2019ll se \u2014 I \u2014I \u2014I see that in the next 10 years town, some of the\nHolocaust centers, unless they\u2019re well-endowed, will not make it. Because that\ngeneration that has supported them will no longer be there, and the next generation\nwill not ha \u2014 will not step up to the plate.\nA2: But the German schools are actively teaching the Holocaust.",
        "A: There is nobody \u2014 there is nobody that is \u2014 maybe that\u2019s why I have a great\naffinity for Germany at this time, because number one, I can say I have survived,\nand the others are dead, because they \u2014 they have passed on, and it\u2019s a new\ngeneration of Germans. And that\u2019s why I c \u2014I get along with \u2014 wa \u2014 you know, I\nget along on a first name basis with the consul general, and with other Germans, I \u2014\nI greet them. They are, as far as I\u2019m concerned, part of \u2014 part of my life, part of a\nnew life. Lot of \u2014 lot of my generation cannot, have not, will not say what I\u2019ve just\nsa \u2014 told you. They will live in the past and say they will never forgive or forget. I\ncan never forgive and forget, but I can move on. And maybe that\u2019s why life has also\nbeen somewhat more successful for me than maybe some other people, because I\u2019ve\nalways believed in looking \u2014 1n \u2014 1n being a forward-looking person.",

The \u2014 the tow \u2014 the commu \u2014 whatever, the borough, had put\nup a big floral arrangement at the site.",

And the borough had placed two large wreaths on \u2014\non the site, on \u2014 on the \u2014 on \u2014 yeah, anniversary of Kristallnacht. And I spoke to\nmy \u2014 my children and my \u2014 my granddaughter, exactly what I\u2019d experienced.\nWithin \u2014 within seconds, I had a group of German citizens who lived in \u2014 right\nthere, came \u2014 came around and listened to me. And one woman came with a\nmemorial candle that she lit. It was amazing, absolutely amazing, and \u2014 and people\nexpressed their \u2014 you know, spoke in \u2014 you know, they \u2014 they heard that I could\nalso speak German, and \u2014 and you know, they expressed their \u2014 their \u2014\nQ2: [indecipherable] English.\nOctober 15, 2010",

        "A: We had a very happy childhood. My father was a very productive merchant. We\nhad a wonderful family life. My family was very active in our congregation, and our\ncongregation in Berlin encompassed and really was the \u2014 the last of the giant\nsynagogues that were built in Berlin. When I say giant synagogues, I\u2019m talking\nabout a synagogue that housed in excess of a thousand people. But it was the very\nlast one that ga \u2014 its inauguration came about in 1930, the year that I was born, and\nit died, or was extinguished in 1938, on Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 yes I do. The synagogues in Berlin were not named for a\ncongregation whatever the name was. The large synagogues were named for the\nstreets that they were on. And the street that \u2014 that my synagogue was on was\nPrince \u2014 Prince Regenten Strasse, Prince Regent Street.

I can\nvisualize the apartment in my head exactly. My \u2014 my room was towards the end \u2014\nthe rear of the \u2014 of the apartment building. I had a balcony, and \u2014 where I raised\nvegetables, tomatoes, occasionally flowers. We had a lovely residence, beautiful\nresidence.",

Very, very quickly, I was beaten during\nthat time period and \u2014 because the other boys asked me what I was, who I was, and\nth-the minute I said Jew, I was put to the test immediately. And my mother was\ncalled to school, she was told by the principal of the school that it would be best for\nmy \u2014 my protection to be taken out of that school. So I\u2014 my experience of public\nschool may have been extinguished then after one day, or \u2014 or two days at the most.",

        "A: I think my parents tried to protect me by not saying much of anything. And I was\nnever told what to say or what not to say. But I think I, from that experience, I\nlearned rather quickly as to what I was, who I was. And I think my parents shielded\nme from all the discriminatory acts that had been ongoing in the mid-1930s. For\nexample, I had an uncle of mine, a brother of my \u2014 of my \u2014 my mother, who was a\nvery successful attorney in Germany and Berlin. And of course he was \u2014 you\nknow, I found out later on why he wasn\u2019t working any more, because he was\nexcluded from \u2014 from that possibility. But generally I would say my parents really\nshielded me up to that time period. That\u2019s about the best way I can \u2014 I can put it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I was enrolled in a school, in a Jewish school with obviously, Jewish students,\nbut not a religious school, okay? So, there were no \u2014 there \u2014 there was \u2014 there were\nno re \u2014 Jewish religious courses given. It was taking the regular curriculum within a\nOctober 15, 2010\nframework of Jewish teachers and \u2014 and just a framework of \u2014 of Jews \u2014 Jewish\nchildren.",
        "A: Yes, Ido. We \u2014 we get a\u2014a bulletin from the municipality of Berlin, where I\nrecognized a young lady \u2014 a young lady \u2014 a\u2014 a\u2014a person\u2019s name, and I wrote to\nher, and she sent me back, she recognized my name immediately, and I don\u2019t know\nhow, and sent me back a picture of our class, which was unbelievable. So yes, I \u2014 I-\nI think that\u2019s the \u2014 the only person that I \u2014 that I have recog \u2014 I have a memory\nthereof. When we \u2014 when we left Berlin, we had \u2014 when we \u2014 I should sa \u2014 correct\nthis; when children were fortunate enough to leave school, to go out of the country\nin some fashion or other, we would all have little autograph books and we would\nsign off on a little note to that st \u2014 t-to that boy or girl. Maybe it was just putting our\nname and saying in German, best wishes for the future, maybe a little poem, maybe\na little picture. But I do have a book like that at home, with about \u2014 the names of\nabout maybe 15 to 20 different students, and \u2014 and likewise a \u2014 a number of\nteachers who \u2014 whose classes I attended, wishing me well.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t \u2014 do not, no.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: I th\u2014I think probably that experience in school was probably the \u2014 the \u2014 the first\nexperience that I had at that point. My parents were no longer able to subdue their \u2014\ntheir thoughts as to trying to shield and protect me. And I do remember very clearly\nthat either with my father or my mother, I went to a grocery store nearby, and the \u2014\nthe merchant, the owner of that establishment, who knew my parents, looked at me\nwith my blond hair at that time, and said, he doesn\u2019t look like a Jew. And that\nscared the hell out of me, because I knew what that meant. And then in 1938,\nobviously the \u2014 my father and \u2014 and I, every Sunday would go to a park that was\nlike two or three minutes away from our home, and we would sit on the bench and\nmy father would schmooze, if that\u2019s the correct word, with neighbors who would\ncome by. And my father delighted in showing me off as \u2014 as his son, and \u2014 and then\none day we could no longer sit on the park bench, we had to sit on a\u2014 on a yellow\nbench, which said, nur fir Juden, for Jews only. And several times when we did\nthat, we sat down, we were stoned.",
        "A: Threw stones, yeah.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: My father always said to me, I always \u2014 I told my father the last time that I went\nto synagogue with him that I was afraid for my life. And my father said to me that\nhe had fought for Germany in World War I, and nothing would happen to me, that\nGermany had had waves of anti-Semitism previously, they come and they go, and\nbecause of our \u2014 of our nature, of what my father has achieved, what he had done,\nhe would protect me, and nothing would happen to us. Whether he actually believed\nthat, I don\u2019t know. It di-didn\u2019t \u2014 after those words, while they were encouraging, I\nhave to tell you that I honestly did not feel very much better.",
        "A: It built gradually, and I \u2014 I think it gradually \u2014 and the \u2014 the \u2014 the heightened\nmoment of fear was about a week or two weeks prior to Kristallnacht, when as I\nsaid, we went to \u2014 we, my father and I, went to services generally every Friday\nevening. And on this particular Friday evening, uniformed members of brown\nshirts, black shirts, call 1t whatever you want, uniformed Nazis, came into the front\ndoor of our synagogue, and threatened \u2014 threatened the congregation, threatened our\nrabbi, and our rabbi was magnificent in defending us verbally, and ultimately the\nNazis retreated. And at that moment, as I said, when we walked home I told my\nOctober 15, 2010\nfather I was afraid for my life. Then two weeks later, you know, we experienced\nKristallnacht.",
        "A: I \u2014I think \u2014 by the time I was six years old, I did not have one any more. So my\n\u2014 my recollection of her are more \u2014 more photographic than \u2014 than anything that\nmight have transpired between us. I will say this, that on Kristallnacht, my parents,\nby some fluke of miracles, were not with me. They were on vacation, and I learned\nlater on that my father really, physically was not doing well. But they were not with\nus, and I was with my grandmother. My grandmother had a non-Jewish worker \u2014\nservant in the house and I think \u2014 I certainly can recall that \u2014 that she told my\ngrandmother that she needed to get out of the house because something \u2014 something\nwas going to happen that evening.",
        "A: Really nothing, except to \u2014 she was a very, very tight \u2014 tightfisted. [knocking]",
        "A: Right.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: No, that \u2014 that she was going to leave the house.",
        "A: She was not \u2014 she was not going to stay all day, that \u2014 that she had some ideas\nthat something of an \u2014 she wouldn\u2019t say what, and maybe she didn\u2019t even know, but\nshe felt that she should not stay there all day, and left. And my grandmother was a\nvery primped, starched lady, never smiled. You know, it\u2019s one of those\ngrandmothers that \u2014 you know. And I experienced Kristallnacht in her hou \u2014 in \u2014\nin her home. And unfortunately, her apartment that she lived in overlooked the\nsynagogue, over \u2014 was \u2014 e-even though our synagogue was a block or two \u2014 I think\none block away, I think we were on the floor where we could look and see the top\nof our synagogue. And I could see the \u2014 you know, I could see the fires bursting\nthrough the \u2014 through the roof.",
        "A: Well that \u2014 that night I \u2014 I was in my \u2014 my grandmother\u2019s apartment, I had a\nroom that was mine, that was facing out in the street, that overlooked a block away\nthat \u2014 what did overlook our synagogue. And during the night, two uncles of mine\nOctober 15, 2010\ncame. One on my mother\u2019s side, who hid in a linen closet, one on my father\u2019s side,\nwho hid underneath the bed that I was supposed to be sleeping in. And the only th \u2014\nonly thought wi \u2014 these are terrible thoughts to have \u2014 the only thought that I had,\nthat if my uncle is found underneath my bed, should the Nazis come and invade the\nhouse, I would be taken also. So I really hadn\u2019t \u2014 had little \u2014 little hope that I would\nlive through the night. I heard all the screams of the \u2014 of \u2014 of what was \u2014 what\nmight be or what was going on in the streets below us. And \u2014 and every knock on\nthe door, my heart \u2014 was everybody\u2019s heart in that apartment stopped \u2014 stopped\nrunning, because we all \u2014 always thought that maybe the Nazis would come to \u2014 to\nthe door, break in the hou \u2014 break into the apartment, search the apartment and only\n\u2014 God only knows what would happen at \u2014 at that particular point. It was the most\nhorrific night of my life. I have never, never, never experienced a night of fear, that\nI did on that night, never. And I remember it to this day, and I will remember it for\nthe rest of my life.",
        "A: No, we\u2019re \u2014 as luck would have it, there were no, other than neighbors just\nchecking on us and so forth, and my two uncles, I said, who came to the door and\nsought sanctuary \u2014 shelter. The apartment was not broken into. The next morning, I\nleft the apartment. I don\u2019t know how in the hell my \u2014 my grandmother would ha \u2014\nOctober 15, 2010\nwould have let me go, but she did. And I walked myself back to our home, which\nwas maybe five minutes away, to see whether our home had been broken into \u2014 our\napartment had been broken into. And what I \u2014 what I saw ... indescribable.",
        "A: I\u2014 unaccompanied.",
        "A: No, I did not go into the apartment. I saw the door was closed, I saw there was\nno damage to the outside of the \u2014 of the apartment. But when I came out, we were\njust maybe a hundred yards away from a\u2014 from a square, and I \u2014 I\u2019ve told my\nchildren this, there was a huge stain on the \u2014 on the pavement, on the \u2014 and one of\nthe Nazis asked another one, what is that? And he said, that is the blood of a Jew.\nEvery store in our \u2014 in our neighborhood that was Jewish owned had been broken\ninto, had been vandalized, had been vandalized, not only broken into and \u2014 and \u2014\nand \u2014 but it was painted Jew, star of David, and it was \u2014 it was the most \u2014 and \u2014 and\npeople were cheering. That was the beginning of death.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: I think ultimately I went back to my grandmother\u2019s apartment.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: No. My \u2014 my \u2014 in the meantime, I think my \u2014 my \u2014 my mother and father had\ncalled, because they had heard \u2014 I don\u2019t know where they were, but they were on\nvacation. They had heard what had gone on, and I think my grandmother told them\nto stay away and not come back from where they \u2014 and they did not come back for\nseveral days later on.",
        "A: Well, I stayed with my grandmother until my \u2014 until my parents returned from\nwherever they were.",
        "A: For me it was just a continuation of fear. And I think \u2014 I think at that time, I\nthink we \u2014 I think my parents showed fear for the first time as well. Openly. I\u2019m\nsure they were \u2014 they were \u2014 they were in fear previously. My father, as I found out\nlater on, had to take on a non-Jewish partner into the business, in order for the\nbusiness to continue. And that happened maybe a year or two years even before that\ntime. I didn\u2019t know the reasons for 1t, why someone else had to be taken in the\nbusiness. But these were things that were kept from me, to shield me as much as\npossible from a family, a Jewish family, that was descending into hell.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: I do know \u2014 do know one thing. That during this time period, my father was\nalways was \u2014 was cognizant of the need to help those that were less fortunate, that\ncould not help themselves. And I remember on several occasions, my father would\nask my mother to load up a bag of groceries, as me to u \u2014 to take some of my best\ntoys, and he had a list of \u2014 of names of people that we would drive to, and we would\nwalk up in the apar \u2014 to the apartment dwellings, and be greeted by name,\nsometimes just with smiles, and my father would always hand them an envelope,\nand I knew that that was mor \u2014 was money, and you know, these people were so\nthankful. And I\u2019m sure none of them survived.",
        "A: Yes, yeah. Immediately after my \u2014 my parents returned, which was within days\nafter Kristallnacht, I returned and we lived in our apartment until \u2014 until I left\nGermany.",
        "A: Well, let me take you back in time a little bit. Kristallnacht was November 9\",\n1938, and I don\u2019t know the reasons for it, but in \u2014 sometime in December of 1938,\non a winter day, I was walking with my sister, not far from \u2014 from where our\napartment was, and something within me, I lashed out \u2014 physically I lashed out at a\nOctober 15, 2010\n\u2014 at a member of the Hitler youth who was collecting money for whatever,\nwhatever the purpose was, I have no idea, okay, for whatever the Hitler youth was\ncollecting money for. And when I say lashed out, I\u2019m talking about physically\nassaulted. And inflicted damage to the uniform, inflicted damage to that person. My\nsister dragged me home, told my \u2014 my \u2014 my parents. I guess they found out very\nquickly who it was, that individual that I had accosted. I cannot give you the reason\nfor it, I don\u2019t know. And at that juncture, the \u2014 my p \u2014 my parents, my mother,\ncontacted the parents of this individual. I can\u2019t even tell you whether it was male or\nfemale that I accosted, but I do know the individual was a good \u2014 good head taller\nthan I was. That I can tell you. My mother promised to pay whatever damages they\n\u2014 they wanted to have for this incident not to be reported to the Hitler youth leader,\nwhich could possibly lead to my being taken away permanently. That did not\nhappen, and a week or two later, I found myself with my mother. We went to\nwhat\u2019s considered a court in this \u2014 in this Hitler youth leader\u2019s home, where I was\ngoing to be judged one way or the other. Either I wasn\u2019t coming home, or\nsomething would happen. And I guess my mother gave me my life for the second\ntime.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Yes. Tha-That \u2014 I heard my mother screaming, crying, pleading, begging and\nmyself sitting silently in an \u2014 an outside room, because I was not immediately in the\nroom. I cannot tell you the \u2014 the words that were exchanged, but certainly the\ndescription I\u2019ve given you 1s accurate, I know that it is. And then after a while, I\nwas called into the room, and my mother said \u2014 I was told in advance that if I had\nthe chance to apologize, to do so, and I apologized in the most profuse manner that I\ncould, and my life was spared. My mother gave me my second life.",
        "A: I think I \u2014 and again, here\u2019s where the guesswork comes in. An eight year old 1s\nnot told too much, an eight year old, and maybe today they are, but in those times\nan eight year is told what to do and when to do it and how to do it. And at that\npoint, I am sure my mother and father must have thought how they were going to\nget me out of \u2014 out of Berlin, and do it fast, before anything changes, before \u2014\nbefore somebody in the Hitler youth group that had decided \u2014 by the way, my \u2014 my\nparents, my mother dis \u2014 paid a \u2014 a very substantial fine, I was told \u2014 before\nsomeone changed their mind. I think that \u2014 my guesstimate is that I got onto the\nKindertransport list possibly a little faster, and maybe I got onto the list at all\nbecause of \u2014 of this terrible incident. And I left \u2014 I left Berlin sometime in \u2014\nOctober 15, 2010\ntowards the end of January. So roughly about a \u2014 within four weeks after this \u2014 after\nthis incident, I was out of \u2014 out of Berlin.",
        "A: Well, we had \u2014 we had had papers to come to America for some time, except\nthat they were taken out rather late. My \u2014 my parents, or my mother had a third or\nfourth cousin living in America, somebody who I\u2019d never met, somebody whose\nname I\u2019d never heard of before. But anyway, they had given us the affidavit to\ncome to America. What was lacking to come to America was the quota number,\nbecause my parents, my mother, my father, I guess, always believed to the end that\nthings would not get to that point in time. So we \u2014 we had the affidavit, but no quota\nnumber to come to America. Had we stayed and had I stayed in \u2014 in England \u2014 or\nhad I stayed in, excuse me, had I stayed in Germany for my quota number to\nappear from the American consulate there, I would have been dead. So I went to\nEngland, and my \u2014 my \u2014 my family did have \u2014 did have \u2014 we did have family in \u2014\nin England, but I was bounced around all over the place in \u2014 in \u2014 in England,\nincluding I lived with a wonderful Christian family in a small town about two and a\nhalf hours north of London for about half a year or so, and went to church with\nthem. They shared what they shared with \u2014 whatever they had they shared with me.\nThey were wonderful, caring, giving people, and only a year ago, did I lose contact\nOctober 15, 2010\nwith \u2014 with that family. We would exchange Christmas cards or Thanksgiving\ncards, and it was only last year that I finally failed to get a card, and that \u2014 as a\nmatter of fact, only recently, I wrote to the ca \u2014 the municipality, asking whether\nthey had any records as to what might have happened to this, you know, person of\nthat \u2014 of that family. So I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m very, very grateful. And you should know\nKindertransport, I mean, people tell you, Kindertransport came about because of\na group of Quakers persuading Parliament to take action, and \u2014 which \u2014 that\nallowed 10,000 un-unaccompanied children to enter England. So Christians have\nbeen very, very good to me, and | have a great love and admiration for \u2014 for\nChristians. And to this day, where I participate in a lot of Christian activities.",
        "A: End of January, or \u2014 and it \u2014 when I say end, roughly of \u2014 I\u2019ve tried to look that\nup several times. To the best of my abilities to come up with records, it looks like\nthe third week in January. That\u2019s why I said roughly about a month after this\nterrible incident, which was an act of sheer stupidity on my part. It wasn\u2019t bravery,\nit was stupidity that could have cost me my life. I \u2014 I should have wound up in\nTheresienstadt or in one of the \u2014 probably in that camp, and \u2014 and that only the\nlove of my mother pleading kept me from that.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Yes, I remember standing on the platform in \u2014 in Berlin, on the Hauptbahnhof,\nand that \u2014 and the \u2014 the \u2014 the Nazi official calling out the list of names. And I\nremember that my name was not immediately called on the first go-round. All the\nother names were there, and I started to cry, because I knew down deep in my heart,\nthat if I didn\u2019t get out, 1t would cost me my life. Now that\u2019s a hell of a thought for\nan eight year old to have, but those were my thoughts. And \u2014 and I cried, and my\nmother and father who I re \u2014 I already separated from, they were standing on one\nside, and I was on the other side, we had already had our goodbyes. And my mother\nsaid, he doesn\u2019t want to leave us. And I didn\u2019t have the courage to tell her that the\nreason I was crying because my name wasn\u2019t \u2014 was not on the list, and my life\nwasn\u2019t going to be saved. And then the second go-round, my \u2014 my name was called.\nYeah, it was \u2014 it was a horrendous \u2014 horrendous day at a train station, parents and\nchildren were \u2014 were kissing, hugging. Most children would never see their parents;\nI was fortunate to some degree, but nevertheless, whatever the circumstance was,\nfor the child and parent, it was traumatic. Absolutely traumatic. What \u2014 what parent\ntoday would part with their seven, eight year old, nine year old, 10 year old, no,\ndoesn\u2019t really matter. And say, and realize that it might be the final goodbye hug or\nkiss that they would \u2014 would receive. Train \u2014 train went to \u2014 went to Holland.

I should tell you about two weeks before that time, my father took me to\nthe leading store in \u2014 in Berlin, and bought every suit that he could \u2014 that I had an\neye on, and he was going to deck me out in as many suits and coats and jackets as\nhe could find, and \u2014 and ultimately it was all reduced down to nothing, because all\nthose things had to be left behind.",
        "A: Yes, yes, this all had to \u2014 the train \u2014 the only thing we could take on the train\nwas one small suitcase, that was it. Whatever fit in that suitcase was fine, but seven\nor eight suits were not going to fit into that suitcase. So \u2014 but my father always\nwanted to do the best for \u2014 for \u2014 for me, all the time.",
        "A: I\u2014I would s \u2014 I would say \u2014 well, the train \u2014 we \u2014 we sat in a \u2014 each \u2014 ea \u2014 the\ntrain was sectioned off with little compartments, and each compartment had maybe\nsix or eight chil \u2014 six or eight people, in this case children, in the compartment. And\nall I can tell you 1s that I think we all sat stone-faced, afraid to say a word, either to\nOctober 15, 2010\neach other, or to anyone. We were told to be as quiet as possible, not to say\nanything, not to say anything at all. And 1t wasn\u2019t until we crossed the border into\nHolland that some words were said to \u2014 between each other.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And we were aware at that point before \u2014 before \u2014 obviously before the train left\nBerlin, and the train, 1n going across the border at that \u2014 at both junctures, Nazis\ncame on, and \u2014 to inspect our \u2014 our documentation. Which was also a terrible\nmoment because God forbid they\u2019d saw something that we were unaware of, that\nmight cause you to be pulled off the train. Which did not happen, to the best of my\nknowledge, but that thought was always with us.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know where \u2014 ultimately we were given food. We were g \u2014 we \u2014 we were\ngiven food and hot chocolate, and it was welcomed. The ultimate port that we went\nto, I can\u2019t tell you the name. And we then embarked o-on \u2014 some people may call it\na ferry. I call it a terrifying boat ride across the English channel. Terrifying because\nthe waves, and I think everybody got seasick. But terrifying only from \u2014 from the\nOctober 15, 2010\nphysical aspect of \u2014 of crossing water, by crossing a \u2014 a rather \u2014 I would say \u2014 not a\ndangerous body of water, but certainly a body of water that was not smooth.",

But my sister was a person\nthat I really had little relationship with as I was growing up, because she was a\ncompletely different age group than I was.

I do know that for a\ntime period, I was fortunate enough to \u2014 to live with an uncle of mine for a short\nperiod of time, and \u2014 and then I got moved around, and ultimately I wound up in \u2014\nas I said, in this town called Kettering, in \u2014 two and a half hours away from \u2014 from\nLondon as \u2014 as war \u2014 war came to \u2014 to pass. And before \u2014 before \u2014 just before war\n\u2014 war broke out, my parents were able to come extricate. The \u2014 the interesting thing\nis [indecipherable] terrible thing for me, is that I had a very close, loving\nrelationship with my father, and \u2014 and I never heard from my father during this\nwhole time that I was in England. And \u2014 and at that point I thought that my father\nhad a\u2014 had abandoned me, that \u2014 and no longer wanted me, and I felt completely a\n\u2014 completely abandoned. And it was only later on that I found \u2014 found out that my\nfather had suffered a very severe stroke within days after my leaving, and was\nunable to communicate, write, do anything. And my parents got out of \u2014 got out of\nGermany, I would say, just weeks before the \u2014 before the war started. I lived with\nthem briefly when \u2014 up until the time that war broke out, and then I was moved, as I\nsaid, to \u2014 to this community up in \u2014 1n northern England.\nOctober 15, 2010",

I don\u2019t know\nwhether I\u2019ll ever see my parents again. Living with an uncle is not the same as\nliving with \u2014 with \u2014 with parents. I had nobody that I could \u2014 could talk to, and \u2014\nand I would \u2014 I remember \u2014 I'll tell you one quick incident. I remember one\nafternoon I was so distraught that I went to a nearby park and I sat down and I start\nto cry. I didn\u2019t know what the hell else to do. And a \u2014 an English lady stopped, with\nOctober 15, 2010\nher \u2014 with her little \u2014 little daughter, maybe two or three years even younger than \u2014\nthan me, and asked me \u2014 cause I couldn\u2019t speak English very well at that point,\ncause nobody gave a damn whether I learned the English language or not \u2014 asked\nme what was wrong, and in my halting English I explained to her that \u2014 how \u2014 how\nlost I was. And that was \u2014 she was the first person that \u2014 that offered a shoulder to \u2014\nto cry on, and \u2014 and gave me some hopeful encouragement. And when she \u2014 when\nshe left, she put a couple of coins in my hand, which I thought was so gracious, and\nso nice. It was the first person that really showed that they \u2014 they really did care. So\nmost of that time, I was with my \u2014 lived in my uncle\u2019s home. I was moved around\nfrom school to school, I can\u2019t tell you why. Nobody really gave me any \u2014 any real\ninstruction on the English language. We were told to be quiet, not to \u2014 not to\ncomplain, not to speak German loudly or anything like that. And weeks before the\nwar, and maybe \u2014 maybe a month or so before the war broke out, my parents were\nable to extricate themselves from \u2014 from Berlin, came t \u2014 came to e \u2014 to England,\nand I moved in with them for a short period of time, maybe weeks or a couple of\nmonths, until war broke out and it was decided that I would be evacuated, as it was\ncalled, to this country \u2014 country place. And I stayed there until \u2014 I stayed there for\nat least six months\u2019 time, came back to London under very unfavorable\nOctober 15, 2010\ncircumstances, because at that point, my father had suffered a second stroke, and\nwas in the hospital, and I knew that there would be no hope for him.",

And one day, a \u2014 a\u2014 there was one other Jewish student in the \u2014 1n that class\nof mine, and I guess he didn\u2019t \u2014 he felt that he wasn\u2019t getting his licks in on me, and\nhe called me a dirty Jew. And he probably regretted that, because his face was a\nbloody mess within \u2014 within less than a minute. I picked him up in my arms, and I\nsaid, Raymond, you were supposed to be my friend, and I threw him down on the\nfloor and never spoke to him again. And no one ever picked on me again either, that\nwas the end of it.",

They had to know because the people that I was\nwith, being that \u2014 that I couldn\u2019t speak English very well, they were told \u2014 they\nknew that I was Jewish, and I\u2019m sure they, you know, when \u2014 when \u2014 when their\nneighbors asked who I was, I\u2019m sure they explained \u2014 they c \u2014 explicitly, who I\nwas.

        "A: My \u2014 my \u2014 my parents, I should tell you, that my parents, in going back to\nGermany took \u2014 actually my mother and my fa \u2014 my \u2014 my \u2014 my mother and my\nsister, in retrospect, took English lessons in Germany during the last maybe six\nmonths or so in ninet \u2014 of maybe \u2014in \u2014 1n the beginning of 1938. They would\nalways close the door to the \u2014 to the living room, or they wou \u2014 the room where the\n\u2014 where the English teacher came, and I was told it was not for me to know what\nwas going on. I was e \u2014 I was excluded from certain things, and that\u2019s \u2014 you know,\nthat\u2019s a common occurrence. But a couple of English words wouldn\u2019t have hurt me.\nI did not learn \u2014I really did not learn English \u2014 did not learn to speak as well as I\nmight until I came to America and that \u2014 I started going to the movies and I would\nlisten to Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable and \u2014 and Henry Fonda, and I would\nOctober 15, 2010\nmimic their words, mimic they \u2014 the way that they pronounced words. When I came\nout of the \u2014 th-the movie theater, I would try to remember the words that I\u2019d heard,\nthat some which I did not know, and \u2014 many which I did not know. And when \u2014\nwhen I went to school the following Monday, I would try to memorize those words\nfrom the movies, and \u2014 and then I would look them up 1n the dictionary. So I\nlearned \u2014 I-I would say my \u2014 my prime teachers for the English language were the\nstars of the \u2014 of the 1940s, and the best of them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t pass away. He\u2019s \u2014 my father lingered for a long time, a long time. I\nwould say from some time in \u2014 sometime in 1940 to 1941. So I'd say my father was\npar-paralyzed, incapacitated \u2014 totally incapacitated during this whole time period,\nand did not pass away until I would say maybe three, four months, five months after\nI came to America. And then one day my aunt told me that she had to sit down and\ntell me something rather seriously, and I knew already what it was, and it wasn\u2019t a\ngreat big shock, even I was, at that time I was \u2014 I was 10 years old. You know, it\nOctober 15, 2010\nwas \u2014 it was sad news for me, but what was sad really was \u2014 the saddest moment for\nme in England really was separation from my father, because at that point when \u2014\nwhen I was supposed to come to America, I was taken to the hospital. And my\nfather could understand, but he couldn\u2019t talk. My father was told that I was going to\nAmerica the following day, and this would be the last time that he would \u2014 that I\nwould be in his presence, or that I would be able to see him. And ... my father\nplaced his hand on my \u2014 on my head. I didn\u2019t know what that meant, and \u2014 and I\ndidn\u2019t have \u2014 eight, nine year olds, 10 year olds, don\u2019t ask anything, we just listen.\nAnd then, when I was 13, I was Bar Mitzvahed in New York, and a rabbi put his\nhand on my head, and I knew what my father was doing. That probably was the\nsaddest day that I had in England. And my mother came to America. My mother\nstayed in \u2014 in England with my father obviously, to the end, which was maybe a\nhalf a year or so after I came to America. At that time, even as I came to America\non a ship \u2014 and I have the \u2014 the boarding pass still at home, and I even have a\npicture of the ship which one of my assistants dredged up for me from the internet.\nThat was a ship that took me from Liverpool to Montreal. Took about 10 days, 10\n- 12 days. We were in a convoy for about the first two or three days. We were a\nrelatively modest sized ship, passenger cargo ship. Had a \u2014 as I said, a convoy for\nthe first two or three days\u2019 time, which you \u2014 where you felt relatively safe, because\nOctober 15, 2010\nthe destroyers were throwing depth charges around, and you never knew whether\nthey were firing at somebody \u2014 something 1n reality, or just as a \u2014 a precaution. And\nthen maybe on the the third or fourth day, the convoy was gone, and you were\nalone. And there you were in the north Atlantic, and as I found out later on, maybe\nonly 30 or 40 percent of the ships that sailed on the north Atlantic during that time\nperiod actually got through. I was de \u2014 certainly much aware of the fact that the\nchances of getting through were \u2014 were at best 50 \u2014 50, and a life jacket was\nsomething that was on me continuously, but hell, if that ship was torpedoed, I knew\nthat we were gone, all of us were gone.",
        "A: I\u2019m going to take it back to Kristallnacht. I was eight years, eight and a half\nyears old on November eighth. On November ninth I was 18 years old. I had\nperipheral vision at that point. I could see what was going on. I had fear built into\nme. There wasn\u2019t anything that I was not prepared to do or see. So I did not \u2014 I was\nOctober 15, 2010\nnot any more \u2014 and I don\u2019t want to use the word normal, I was not normal any more\nat that time. And there was \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I could \u2014 I did things \u2014 I\u2019d experienced\nlife as no other eight year old ever had, and as a result was able to cope with life on\nmy own in a way that no eight, nine or 10 year old ever would. During the time\nperiod of the London blitz, I was with \u2014 I lived with my \u2014 with my mother and\nfather, and it was my \u2014 there was \u2014 the blitz started every \u2014 every evening, every\nnight time from \u2014 from as soon as it got dark, til early in the morning, four or five\nhours of intense bombing. It was unbelievable. As I said the \u2014 you know, you could\nhear the \u2014 the roar of the planes, it was \u2014 it was frightening, it was dreadful. In the\nmorning you could see the glow, you could s \u2014 buildings would shake around us.\nYou could see buildings that had been b-bombed out, you could see fires on the\nstreet. All the \u2014 all the wreckage \u2014 the only thing that was not wrecked was the\nspirit of the London people, who always remained calm, and had their brooms in\nhand to tidy up the best way they could. They were \u2014 they were miraculous.\nAbsolutely miraculous. Once in a while we did s-sleep in the \u2014 in the underground,\nwhich was deep underground. Underground being subway, but which protected us\nfrom \u2014 from bombs up above. And once in a while \u2014 actually I remember one day\nwhen I went to school, that the air raids started in \u2014 in the day time, and that was\nunusual because most of the bombing runs, the air raids started in the \u2014 1n the early\nOctober 15, 2010\nevening. And at that point I was in a bomb shelter from early in the morning to\nmiddle of the afternoon. I rushed home, and within an hour later, I was back in the\nbomb shelter. So I spent maybe 20 hours that day in various bomb shelters. So I\ndon\u2019t get too excited any more about people saying that you know, you don\u2019t know\n\u2014 you don\u2019t know what it like \u2014 what it\u2019s like being bombed, I certainly do know\nwhat it\u2019s like. And I do know what it means to have four or five, six, seven, 800\nplanes overhead in London, bombing the \u2014 the [indecipherable] city to daylights.\nWas unbel \u2014 unbelievable. And then one \u2014 one day I was told by my mother that \u2014\nthat my papers had \u2014 that our papers had come due to come to America, and I\ngather they came due faster than \u2014 than people had thought. Because basically,\npeople were being eradicated, or people were not able to leave Germany because of\nthe war, they had \u2014 they \u2014 they might have had papers also, or they were in\nconcentration camps now, and as a result our \u2014 our number \u2014 our quota number\ncame up somewhat faster than \u2014 that had been an-anticipated, and say my \u2014 our\nquota number came up in September, October of 1940, and that\u2019s when I exited\nfrom \u2014 from \u2014 from \u2014 from London. And my mother would have been free to go,\nhad she decided to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 but she wasn\u2019t going to leave my father there.",
        "A: I would say somewhere between 10 and 14 days. It was a \u2014 it was quite a\nvoyage, quite a voyage. And as I said, the \u2014 the lifeyacket, this cork lifejacket,\nbulky, was part of \u2014 part of my \u2014 my attire. Almost tha \u2014 or certainly all day, and at\nnight it was always right there for me to wear. But it was frightening as all hell to\nthink that \u2014 that death would await us in the water, which it certainly was a \u2014 a great\npossibility of that happening. Ships were being torpedoed left and right.",
        "A: My sister was on that ship. How many passengers on the ship, I have no idea.",
        "A: Yeah. My sister\u2019s always seven years older than I am, okay? If I am 10, she\u2019s 17,\nif I \u2014 she\u2019s always \u2014 she always is ahead of me, and as I said, there is no\nrelationship per se, between a 10 year old and a 17 year old. It\u2019s a\u2014 it\u2019s a different\nelement.",
        "A: To America \u2014 yes I did. I knew that we were going, that this cousin, this third or\nfourth cousin who I had never heard of before, who was kind enough to \u2014 they came\nto America from Germany, roughly about 1935 \u2014 \u201936 from what I was told, and\nhad settled in New York, they had given my parents the affidavit to come to\nOctober 15, 2010\nAmerica. And that\u2019s where I was bound for. So I landed in Montreal. I should tell\nyou when we \u2014 when I \u2014 the 10 hours or so, six hours prior to landing, somebody \u2014\nsomebody said, it smells differently. And it does smell differently on the water,\nwhen land is nearby. And ultimately somebody said, land. And you couldn\u2019t \u2014\ncouldn\u2019t believe the cheers that went up from all the people on deck. And of course\nme, being the internal pessimist said Jesus, ships can get torpedoed just as easily fro\n\u2014 you know, five or six hours away from shore, than \u2014 than \u2014 than out on the \u2014\nfurther out on the waters. And ships actually were torpedoed closer, I found out\nlater on. And we \u2014 we went to \u2014 to Montreal, exited the ship in Montreal, took a\ntrain from Montreal to New York, and we \u2014 we was welcomed by my uncle and\naunt, as I said, third \u2014 third or fourth cousins, who welcomed me to New York and\ntried to, you know, who accepted me, who \u2014 who cared \u2014 who had no other\nchildren, who cared for me. They had very limited means. My \u2014 my uncle was \u2014\nthese \u2014 these people had a \u2014 a small dry goods \u2014 they had a successful dry goods\noperation in Germany, I\u2019m not quite sure where, I think in Stettin. And came to\nAmerica, realized what was happening, and my father \u2014 my \u2014 my uncle rather,\nbecame an elevator operator, local 32B. And ran an elevator in a \u2014 in a freight\nbuilding. My aunt did something that you probably don\u2019t even know, called\npiecework. Wa \u2014 were \u2014 meaning that she embroidered sweaters. And I would help\nOctober 15, 2010\nher to embroider these sweaters, and a result, at the end of the week I would get my\ndime allowance, and I would spend that on the movies. And after I felt a little bit\nsure of myself, I would use some of that money for a comic book. And I graduated\nfrom \u2014 once I \u2014 once I mastered the art of comic books, I then graduated to real\nbooks, and that\u2019s how I learned to read, write. I had some wonderful teachers in \u2014 in\nNew York, the first school I went to, who decided I would \u2014 should go back a\ngrade, should be set back so I wouldn\u2019t have the pressure to perform. I-I was \u2014 I did\nthat for about oh, several months\u2019 time. And then they decided I was ready,\nlanguage-wise, skill-wise, and they moved up \u2014 moved me up to grade level. And\nI\u2019ve \u2014 we moved into a \u2014 an area of New York called Washington Heights, which\nmany ca \u2014 many people called what the \u2014 the fourth or fifth Reich, because there\nwere So many Germans \u2014 German Jewish people living up in that area. And then I\ngot moved around.\n[break]",
        "A: No, my sister obviously at that \u2014 that time, I think, to the best of my knowledge,\nand the best as I recall, my sister became a \u2014 a \u2014 an au \u2014 au pair, not a domestic, an\nau pair in a family somewhere in mid-town, and took care of a \u2014 a child for that\nfamily. And she did that immediately upon coming here.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Well, America was very scary for me, it was \u2014 it was a-adjusting to a \u2014 a brand\nnew environment. Give you another \u2014 another aside. Obviously I-I gravitated to\nsome children, Jewish children that were in my school to play with after \u2014 after\nhours. You know, we play on the street and play some games. And that happened\nfor about a week or two \u2014 two, and those children, those boys asked me how \u2014 who\nI was and told me \u2014 asked me about something about my background. And I told\nthem very freely and o-openly where I came from, what I had experienced, the war,\nand so forth and so on. And one of them said, well why don\u2019t you come up, my \u2014\nmy parents would like to meet you. So I went upstairs to their apartment, and spoke\nto the parents, father, and again I repeated, you know, my \u2014 what we had gone\nthrough, and what life was like. And the next day the boy came to me and said, my\nfather doesn\u2019t wish \u2014 wish me to play with you anymore, because your stories are\nnot believable, and they\u2019re too dark. And from that point on I gravi \u2014 I stayed away\nfrom Jewish children altogether. And my best friend during this time period, that\nwas New York, before I moved elsewhere, was a Methodist family, who almost\nadopted me. Took me wi \u2014 on \u2014 I lived with them after school, and observed\nholidays, they bought gifts for me at Christmastime. They made me feel as part of\nthe family. They were Methodists. And again, non-Jews had more compassion for\nOctober 15, 2010\nme than Jewish people. And that Jewish people here in New York could not have it,\ncould not find it in their hearts to believe what I was talking about, I found it\nindescribable. It \u2014 it really was destroying to me. But I said at that point in time, I\nwould not \u2014 I would not play with a Jewish child again, period.",
        "A: Well, after about \u2014 living here in New York for about, I would say maybe eight,\nnine months or so, my aunt and uncle here in New York had a rather small\napartment, and actually my \u2014 my bed was a collapsible one that was set up in the\nkitchen. And it became more and more difficult for my aunt and uncle to take care\nof me, I think financially as well. And an uncle \u2014 another uncle of mine, during this\ntime period had \u2014 had gone \u2014 had emigrated from Berlin to London and then from\nLondon to California, and it was decided that I would move to California. And I\ndid something that probably no 10 year old had ever done before, and probably\nnever will, I flew \u2014 my uncle paid for me to fly to California, and th \u2014 and to fly to\nCalifornia in the year 1940 was a\u2014 was something, very, very, very exceptional.\nTook about almost 18 hours to fly to \u2014 from New York to California. My uncle, as\nI said, had been a successful lawyer. He had a very lovely apartment in \u2014 in Los\nAngeles. I was enrolled in school in Los Angeles. My uncle had a \u2014 had some\nwonderful, well-to-do friends. I learned how to live a little bit again, I learned how\nOctober 15, 2010\nto smile again, a little bit. My \u2014 my uncle was \u2014 was a \u2014 had a great love of classical\nmusic which I \u2014 which I \u2014 not adopted, but which came off \u2014 which rubbed off on\nme, which I also, I think received from my father, going back in time. He too, had a\ngreat love of classical music. And \u2014 but I did learn something in addition to that. I\nlearned how to live \u2014 I learned how to talk with people, and I learned something\nabout finance in my \u2014 in that early age, because I \u2014 my \u2014 my uncle would be glued\nto the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the radio every afternoon to listen to the outcome of the financial\nmarkets. And from that, I would listen to my uncle with \u2014 with bated breath, as to\nwhat was going on in the financial markets \u2014 didn\u2019t understand it that well, but\nbecame very interested in it, and I believe because of that interest, 1t undoubtedly\nsparked my further interest into seeing what went \u2014 what was out in this \u2014 in this\nworld, which had served my uncle so well, and which ultimately has served our\nfamily well, because that \u2014 that became my profession.",

And my mother was still in England.\nAnd my mother came from England to the U.S. \u2014 and I\u2019m guessing here \u2014\nsomewhere around 1943, maybe very late \u00b042, but I would \u2014 I would judge very\nearly \u00b043.",

I come back here, I again embark on an adventure of a lifetime as a\nchild, and come back, my uncle just asks me \u2014 I mean, what child is asked these\nkinds of questions, he asked me, how would you like to go back to New York? I\nsaid, what are my choices, I remember. He said, well, you can fly back to New\nOctober 15, 2010\nYork, or you can take a train back to New York. He said, taking a train back to\nNew York will probably take roughly about five days. I said, let\u2019s take the train. I'd\nflown one way, I said, let me see what it\u2019s like seeing America through the\nwindows of a train.",

I am thankful beyond words for what England\ndid for me. If my parents would not have gotten out at all, I would have gotten out,\nand \u2014 and I should also tell you that two years ago, a \u2014 the \u2014 a Holocaust museum in\nour area asked me to do a kinder \u2014 a program on the Kindertransport. I told them I\nwould only do such a program if we brought somebody up from the English\nOctober 15, 2010\nconsulate to express my \u2014 my gratitude in person. Approximately two years ago, I\ndid run a program for the \u2014 for the Holocaust museum of our area on the\nKindertransport, and \u2014 and I had made contact with the consul general\u2019s office in\nNew York, and the \u2014 the vice-consul and deputy consul general came up and IIsa\nand I had enjoyed his company, we had ka \u2014 the private company with him for\nlunch and then we brought him up to the program, and I said to Ilsa, I said, we\u2019ll\nprobably have 50 people at the program, I said, nobody ever comes to listen to any\nof these things. And \u2014 and 350 people came. I \u2014 I couldn\u2019t believe it. 350 people\ncame and \u2014 and listened to the program, which consisted mainly of my s \u2014 my\nspeech, and obviously a \u2014 some remarks from \u2014 from the consul general. And we\u2019ve\nstayed in contact with each other, and \u2014 and if I can carry that on a little bit further,\nwe ve also established a relationship with the consul general o-of the \u2014 the German\nconsul general in \u2014 in New York and \u2014 and Ilsa and I will be s \u2014I wish it \u2014 I wish \u2014\nI can\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t like to use this word, being recognized, honored, we\u2019re being \u2014\nwe\u2019re going to be recognized, honored by our Holocaust center next Sunday, a\nweek from today. And again, I \u2014 I said I wanted the consul generals to come up, and\nthat\u2019s the way I wanted it, and I was sure that he would, and \u2014 because we had\nestablished a \u2014 a previous relationship with him already, and \u2014 and he was only too\nhappy to do that. So he will be our guest speaker next Sunday and \u2014 and I\u2019m kind of\nOctober 15, 2010\nshaking, quivering in my boots, because even though I am not afraid of anything, I\nam \u2014 I am very tenuous about the \u2014 about what I \u2014 what I am going to say, or what I\nmight say or not say and do. But it will be an exciting evening, and we do have a\u2014a\nsubstantial number of people coming to that dinner.\nA2: A record number.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: When I came back to New York, we moved \u2014 when I say \u2014 at that point, my\nmother took an apartment in \u2014 in uptown Washington Heights. It\u2019s an \u2014 an area\nknown as really Inwood. Inwood, Washington Heights. My mother went to work\ndoing factory work. Had never done this \u2014 had never done the kind of work that she\nwas now doing. She was working 10 - 12 hours a night, in the most menial position,\nto sustain us. And I moved into the apartment \u2014 we moved into an apartment house,\nI said, in Inwood. And there were many families, like families of our \u2014 called\nrefugee status, or whatever. And I formed a bond with three other boys, very close\nin age proximity, not all having gone through a similar type of experience that I had\nto undergo, but boys that also had fled with their families from Germany. And we\nformed a very close bond, and we called ourselves the boys of 1815, because it was\n1815 Riverside Drive. And it was \u2014 unfortunately, the last one of those boys \u2014 the\nOctober 15, 2010\nlast one 1s me, but the last other one passed on last year, which was a very sad\nevent. And we would work together in the Catskills and Fleischmanns, New York.\nWe made our first \u2014 first money, we became rich, at least tho \u2014 so we thought,\nearning 500 bucks for the \u2014 500 dollars for the season, in 50 cent and dollar tips.\nBut it gave us our first entry into earning some money.",
        "A: I would say \u2014 I would say the minute \u2014 I \u2014 I would say, when I was 14. I \u2014 I told\n\u2014 I told a \u2014 the \u2014 the hotel \u2014 hotel people I was 16. I did. I\u2014 cause you weren\u2019t\nsupposed to work at that time \u2014 at that \u2014 at that age yet. You could not get work \u2014\nnot get working papers, but still you weren\u2019t \u2014 you were only supposed to work\nlimited number of hours, and you had to fudge the truth. Not lie, fudge the truth.\nThere\u2019s a difference. So we \u2014 we worked in \u2014 in \u2014 in Fleischmanns New York. It\nwas a hell of an experience, and we \u2014 we gained financial independence from our\nparents, which was very important.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We followed the n \u2014 the \u2014 the news of America\u2019s involvement in the war. I\nprobably could \u2014 could show you the maps of what was happening with greater\nOctober 15, 2010\naccuracy than any other American, because I knew Europe. What I could not quite\nunderstand, is at the onset of the war, which was still the \u2014 the end of the Great\nDepression here in this country, and people again in this country, who really did not\nquite fathom the depravity that had occurred in \u2014 in Europe, and how bad \u2014 how\nbadly things had gotten, and the reason I really mention this, because there were\nstill people here in America that were striking for benefits. And looking back on \u2014\non the scene now, I could understand what was happening here. People were\nconcerned about eking out a living here. They were \u2014 they were more concerned\nabout that until really the onset \u2014 once war broke out, then I think the country really\nbecame \u2014 became \u2014 the country became unified as nothing I\u2019d ever seen before, the\nsame way as it would happen in England.",
        "A: All ties were severed. All ties were severed. I did have family remaining in\nEngland, and I would say contact was at best intermittent. Letter writing was still\nsomething that went on, and \u2014 and who wants to write letters at let \u2014 when you\u2019re\n12 - 13 - 14 years old, you know, that\u2019s not a great \u2014 1f my mother would write a\nletter to \u2014 to our relatives, I would \u2014 I would be asked to \u2014 to join in, I would wr-\nwrite one sentence, you know? For t \u2014 for boys and girls do at that age. But we went\nOctober 15, 2010\n\u2014 we went back \u2014 we had been back \u2014 we\u2019ve gone back to Berlin rather quickly, I\nwould say probably within five or six years at the end of the war. We\u2019ve been back\nto Berlin, I would say at least \u2014 at least every two years\u2019 time, from the 50s on, and\nas recently as \u2014 as the \u2014 the commemoration of Kristallnacht, the 70\" anni-\nanniversary. We \u2014 we were in \u2014 in Berlin with Chancellor Merkel at the Reich(ph)\nstrasse synagogue. Wonderful ceremony, sad ceremony. I took my \u2014 my \u2014 my\nchildren \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t say my children, I took my daughter \u2014 we have three children,\nI took my daughter, my son-in-law. They had been to Berlin with me previously.\nAnd I also took one of their children who was free at that time, a young lady. And\nwe went to the ceremony. That \u2014 that was all aided, the \u2014 the logistics of attaining\nthat ceremony was all aided by the consul general\u2019s office, who we got to know\nvery closely during that time period as an extremely fine gentleman. And he aided\nus to make sure that we were included in that \u2014 in that ceremony. When I say\nincluded, being able to attend that ceremony. And we spent a day with \u2014 with our\nchildren, showing them where our synagogue had been, what had transpired, and I\nstood at \u2014 at the site where my synagogue was, where there is now a large bronze\nplaque, which I say unashamedly is there because I asked the [indecipherable] to\nfix that \u2014 that \u2014 that plaque. There had been a \u2014 there had been a \u2014 there had been a\nsmall marker as to where \u2014 what had been on the site previously, and many, many\nOctober 15, 2010\nyears ago I had contacted the Berlin authorities, asked them to renew that plaque\nwith an \u2014 with one that really was more meaningful, which they did almost\nimmediately. Germans are the \u2014 are the most thorough people, and the most \u2014 they\nare the most willing to \u2014 to please, and they are most willing to understand what\ntranspired. Chancellor Merkel spoke at \u2014 at that ceremony spoke about the past,\nJewish relationship, the present, of never having something like that again, spoke\nabout the future, of \u2014 of Israeli German relationship and of the danger of the Iranian\nsituation. So she covered all the bases, spoke eloquently about them. And I again\nsaw Chancellor Merkel in a rather small ceremony, roughly about a month ago,\nwhen I was asked to attend a ceremony at the Leo Beck Institute in New York\nCity, where Chancellor Merkel was given the Leo Beck Medal of Freedom, which\nis a very high commendation. And I later found out that ch \u2014 that Leo Beck, a\nwonderful, distinguished rabbi, theologian, rabbi, was the guest speaker in 1930 at\nthe synagogue that I\u2019d mentioned to you previously, my synagogue was inaugurated\nby cha \u2014 by chancellor Leo \u2014 Rabbi Leo Beck, which I found an absolutely\nwonderful coin-coincidence.\nA2: I have pictures of a lot of stuff that we saw in \u2014 two years ago, and previously.",
        "A: We - we have \u2014\nA2: [indecipherable] tomorrow.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 we have tried to \u2014 we have tried to \u2014 I have tr \u2014 I have tried, we have tried to\nshare our history in a way that \u2014 all \u2014 we\u2019ve taken all of our children to \u2014 to\nGermany. We have taken some of our children to Germany as either th \u2014 based\nupon their availability, based upon their \u2014 what we felt was their age group, that\nthey would be able to comprehend what \u2014 what \u2014 what it was like, and what the past\nwas like, so it was not just a \u2014 a vacation for them.",
        "A: Not that I \u2014",
        "A: No, I did not know any specific facts about the Jewish community in Berlin, or\nknow any specific facts about any Jewish community. But, I knew on November \u2014\nNovember 9\"\", 1938, that conc \u2014 I knew of concentration camps, and I knew that\nJews were being taken away to concentration camps on a regular basis. So I knew\nwhere \u2014 where \u2014 where Jews were. And I didn\u2019t have to be shown pictures, or \u2014 or\ntold something and say God, I never knew that. I knew \u2014 I knew what was\nhappening. As I left, I kn-knew what was ha \u2014 I knew what was happening while I\nwas in Germany. As I said, the sad \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the sad thing that I remember\nOctober 15, 2010\ncoming to New York was this father not wanting \u2014 wanting to evade the truth of\nwhat was happening.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: A miracle. A miracle. Absolutely a miracle. Couldn\u2019t \u2014 you know, I think, I\ndon\u2019t \u2014 wh-what was V Day? In \u2014 in August of \u2014 I don \u2014 I forget exactly what \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, well, at \u2014 at that time, in \u2014 in August, we were \u2014 we were working in\nFleischmanns, New York, okay? And that \u2014 and again, this was \u2014 Fleischmanns,\nNew York was a haven for German Jews on vacation. And yes, we experienced V-\nE Day there, and as I remember, this was pandum \u2014 joy of pandemonium\nproportions, that\u2019s the only way \u2014 that\u2019s the only way I can describe it. And \u2014 and as\nfar as \u2014 as far as the end of the \u2014 the war in Europe, there was \u2014 there was a great\ndeal of \u2014 of \u2014 I hate to say it, of joy on my part when I heard that Dresden was \u2014\nwas carpet firebombed, that Berlin was firebombed, that other cities were\nfirebombed. Remember, I was in \u2014 in \u2014 in England when Coventry was leveled,\nOctober 15, 2010\nokay? And I saw London being leveled, and Coventry being leveled because there\nwas a church there they wanted to \u2014 to bomb. So I had no \u2014 I had absolutely zero\ncompassion, zero heart. I wanted to see as much destruction of Germany as\npossible, as much destruction. And the first \u2014 the first time that we were back in\nGermany, you know, you \u2014 I could s \u2014 I would say a large proportion of people had\namputated limbs. And I knew what were they from, they were from bombings.\nEither they \u2014 either they had fought in the war, the men had fought in the war, or\nthey had been com \u2014 had been civilians. I had no compassion for them, none.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I survived. I had survived. I am not a religious Jew, but I will tell you, every time\nthat we go back to Berlin, I made sure that our time period in Berlin is over the\nSabbath. And I insist that we always, that anybody who\u2019s with me, knows that\nwe're going to services. And I'll tell you also something special. There\u2019s a\nsynagogue in Berlin, it\u2019s not very f\u2014 not f \u2014 it\u2019s within walking distance of the \u2014 of\nthe Kempinski Hotel on Kurfuirstendamm, that \u2014 we go to 10 services. That\nsynagogue sits within a courtyard of apartment dwellings, apartment buildings. As a\nOctober 15, 2010\nresult, the synagogue was ransacked, but not burned down, because had it been\ntorched, buildings and surrounding buildings would have also gone down; they\nweren\u2019t going to do that. I found out later on here in the U.S. from my sister that\nthat was a synagogue that my uncle, a \u2014 a brother of my father, had been the\npresident of in 1930s. And from a diary, from a written diary of my grandfather,\nthat my grandfather wrote that he celebrated his 75\" birthday in that particular\nsynagogue. I want you to know that I too celebrated my 75\" birthday in that\nsynagogue and was called to the Torah.",
        "A: No, I\u2019ve probably taken up too much of your time.",
        "A: I\u2019ve probably bored you with too much \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and I apologize if I\u2019ve taken up \u2014\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, th-th \u2014 they expressed in words their \u2014 the \u2014 you know, how they felt\nabout what had \u2014 what had \u2014 what had transpired. And a Christian group, again\nChristian, okay? They are so important in my life. A Christian group in \u2014 in \u2014 in my\narea had set up a storefront and boarded it up and put on a Star of David, and c-call\nit Jude, and \u2014 and desecrated the front of a \u2014 of a storefront as a kind of a replica as\nto what we had endured during that time period. And I found that touching. And as\nmy \u2014 my wife said, on the lampposts around \u2014 around the park where we lived,\nthere were signs as to what had transpired against Jews in that period. What I also\nfound very interesting is that two blocks away from where we lived \u2014 and my\nparents never told me this, I\u2014 Albert Einstein lived. Okay? And there\u2019s a large \u2014 a\nlarge stone \u2014 I can\u2019t say a memorial, what do you \u2014 lar \u2014 large \u2014 a very, very large\nstone plaque that this was the residence of Albert Einstein. I said, my God, I never\nknew that I lived in such a \u2014 such a prestigious neighborhood. But \u2014 but \u2014 but ger \u2014\nGerman \u2014 German citizens are much more aware \u2014 I \u2014 I think \u2014 my gut feeling tells\nme that the Holocaust will be \u2014 will be nothing other than a museum piece in years\nto come, that who knows whether even our Jewish grandchildren or their children\nwill have knowledge of the Holocaust? I think it\u2019s going to \u2014 I think \u2014 I think it will\ndisappear in time, and you will \u2014 you will stay around. When I say you, I\u2019m talking\nabout the Holocaust Museum, and maybe a couple of other ones wi-will stay\nOctober 15, 2010\naround. But I \u2014 we\u2019ll se \u2014 I \u2014I \u2014I see that in the next 10 years town, some of the\nHolocaust centers, unless they\u2019re well-endowed, will not make it. Because that\ngeneration that has supported them will no longer be there, and the next generation\nwill not ha \u2014 will not step up to the plate.\nA2: But the German schools are actively teaching the Holocaust.",
        "A: There is nobody \u2014 there is nobody that is \u2014 maybe that\u2019s why I have a great\naffinity for Germany at this time, because number one, I can say I have survived,\nand the others are dead, because they \u2014 they have passed on, and it\u2019s a new\ngeneration of Germans. And that\u2019s why I c \u2014I get along with \u2014 wa \u2014 you know, I\nget along on a first name basis with the consul general, and with other Germans, I \u2014\nI greet them. They are, as far as I\u2019m concerned, part of \u2014 part of my life, part of a\nnew life. Lot of \u2014 lot of my generation cannot, have not, will not say what I\u2019ve just\nsa \u2014 told you. They will live in the past and say they will never forgive or forget. I\ncan never forgive and forget, but I can move on. And maybe that\u2019s why life has also\nbeen somewhat more successful for me than maybe some other people, because I\u2019ve\nalways believed in looking \u2014 1n \u2014 1n being a forward-looking person.\n"
