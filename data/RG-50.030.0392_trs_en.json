But late\n-- the most of the time, my mother grew up in Shtockerau, this is a little town near Vienna, where\nmy grandparents had a shop. They were s-selling bicycles, motorbikes and sewing machines in --\nin Shtockerau. And there they had a little house and had the four children. My mother was the\nsecond one.",

        "A: My -- my father had learned to be -- he was the youngest of nine children in a village and\nwhen -- the older children were sent to school, but when he was growing up, he was sent to -- to\n-- to a -- to learn to be a -- a kilner -- as a -- a waiter.

And then he worked in Vienna and s --\nafter the war -- and he was a soldier then, in the first World War. He was an invalid. He was --\nhis right shoulder was broken in the war and he could never lift his right hand any more. He was\nan invalid. But he came back -- he was a prisoner in Russia, but he came back half a year before\nthe war ended. He escaped. And when he escaped, back home -- this was in spring 1918, he\ncame back. I do remember that. I was four years old, yes, because I had to learn a -- a poem to\nsay to him. This was -- and had flowers in my hand and was four years old and I didn\u2019t know\nactu -- actually was -- what a father was. My mother told me -- was always talking about the\nPapa and she told me that one day I came home from the park and said, a child has said to a mum\n-- to aman, \u201cPapa,\u201d and it was for me -- as -- as -- I don\u2019t know what I imagined a Papa is. And -\n- and so the Papa came. And this I do re -- I still remember --",

        "Q: Was it strange as well as exciting to have this person come in whom you didn\u2019t --",
        "A: Oh, I -- I -- I -- I don -- I took it, I suppose, and -- but itcho said children didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t\nknow what a Papa is. Could have been a dog and -- and then I noticed that it is a man and my\nmother of course thought that I know what a Papa is. This is --",

        "Q: Was that fun, as a child?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t -- this I don\u2019t know. We were always kept very separate. Children were\nvery separate from their parents. Too much. My mother said once to me -- later on, now -- that\nshe only regrets that she was not more with her children.",
        "Q: So she was working in the restaurant?",
        "A: No, she -- she was not working directly, but she was there. I don\u2019t -- she was not cooking or\nanything, but she was there.

        "A: We had always somebody -- somebody to look after us. Some maids or anything. I do\nremember the last one, she was for years with us. She had a kindergarten course. But -- but it was\na separate life from the parents, of course, because in a restaurant, y -- you worked too -- always,\nday and night. As a -- on somedays -- in what I can remember my parents did -- because in -- in\nthe langerstein, what I remember, this restaurant was in the center of Vienna and it was more or\nless as a -- for people who are working there and came for lunch and evening and then my -- the\npeople were not working on Saturday and so my parents closed th -- closed on Saturday -- on --\nnot on Saturday, on Sunday. On Sunday it was closed.",
        "Q: Did -- did you have much of a religious identity when you grew up?",
        "A: We did know we are Jews.",
        "Q: You did know, yeah.",
        "Q: But -- but not religious upbringing. At first the maids what we had, they were all Catholics,\nbut we -- th-they didn\u2019t take us to church or anything. And in -- in my -- in -- in -- In my primary\nschool, I do remember as a -- I do remember we went sometimes to what was called\nYugenkotestines. To versidenshteten, as this was the synagogue. And for me is -- the synagogue\nstill is the nicest synagogue in the world. That -- we went there as -- to rab -- Rabbi Heiss, he\nwas a very famous rabbi -- what I heard later, pere -- and I do remember sissyougotastanst. I do\nremember we sang a song in German, it -- the Torah got -- do you understand German a bit?",
        "A: A little.",
        "Q: The Torah gotas labbit unz desala imital. This was the beginning. This --",
        "A: Will you translate it for us?",
        "Q: Atho the Torah gotas labbit unz is -- is -- gives us -- cares for us, maybe. Cares for us always -\n- imital. This was -- I do remember the beginning of that song we sang in the Yugotestines. And\nI liked to go there -- I liked to go there.",
        "Q: Did -- when you were in school and -- and at home, you were playing with friends, you had\nJewish and non-Jewish friends?",
        "A: More non-Jewish.",
        "Q: More non-Jewish.",
        "A: There weren\u2019t -- where we lived, there were not many Jews. We were only three in class. And\nthere were more non-Jewish friends.",
        "Q: Did you experience any discrimination because you were Jewish?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t understand it at that time and I didn\u2019t feel discriminated, but now I know that there\nwas, from the teacher. Because now I -- I still remember that my teacher ask me few times which\nlanga -- language we are speaking at home. My parents couldn\u2019t speak -- only German -- they\ncouldn\u2019t speak a foreign language, but I suppose she expected Yiddish or Polnish. And -- and at\nthat time, I didn\u2019t connect this with anti-Semitisms, but now I know. And then another thing,\nwhat I didn\u2019t understand at that time, was -- I had, in every subject the best mark, one -- it was a\none. Only in German, I had a -- a bad -- a -- a -- a two. This is not such a good mark. And when I\ncame to the gimnasium, this was in -- in -- in -- in the school as a -- when I came to the\ngimnasium, I never had anything else than -- than very good. And my abbietour is even -- I wrote\non very good. S-So I can\u2019t believe that my German, as a child, was so bad that I had a -- I\ndeserved a -- a -- a bad mark. I suppose this was pure anti-Semitism -- that she thought a Jewish\nchild can\u2019t speak proper German.",
        "Q: What was your relationship to your two sisters? Were you -- you were fairly close in age, at\nleast --",
        "A: To?",
        "Q: To your sisters. Your relationship with your sisters --",
        "A: Yeah my -- my sister -- wa-was from birth very short-sighted. She sees -- runs in the family,\nmy grandmother was shortsighted. And I had always to look after her, this I do remember. And\nshe was -- even when -- when she grew up, she was always a bit jealous of me. When -- I had to\nlook after her and to take her as I -- she was not trusted to go alone, I had always to take her. And\ns -- and she was always a bit jealous and still is.",

It was a -- a -- a -- for years,\nwhen I -- or when I was invited for a birthday party, I had to ask if I can bring my do -- my\nsister, too. But she -- she didn\u2019t have friends. She always was as 0 -- some ba -- hanging on -- my\nappendings. And this was not a good -- this was not very good for me and not good for her.",
        "Q: Now why did she have to be your companion on dates?",
        "A: Yeah, this -- I suppose my -- my parents thought this is quite an insurance in that way, that we\nare always together, yes.",
        "Q: When did you start dating?",
        "A: When I started dating? I was -- I wasn\u2019t allowed to date. This is -- I was then in -- up -- up to\n14, I was in a girl\u2019s school, because I didn\u2019t go to the gimnasium at 11, and actually I was in the\nnormal school what ended at 14. And in the restaurant there was a professor who liked to talk to\nus. Usually we were not allowed to talk to the guests, but he wa -- talked to us and he told my\nparents, or my father, he should let me start there. This was -- it was in -- Schpitzer was his\nname. It was a sectione [indecipherable] technical high school -- so in the techn -- techn -- in\nVienna. And then -- after 14, I came to the gimnasi -- into the gimnasium. And up to 14, there\nwere only girls. We were not allowed to play with boys, or anything, no. I suppose my father, in\na restaurant, has seen too much, so he tried to be sure that his girls are kept properly. And wh-\nwhen I came to the other school, this was a special class for peop -- for girls -- as a -- for\nchildren, who come from this normal -- from this school -- from this -- to the gimnasium. And\nthis was 1n a boy\u2019s school, in this class. We were only -- the only girls among 500 boys. And\nhere were -- I was -- I met that first time, boys, but I didn\u2019t date -- I wasn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t date or\nanything, no. And -- I wasn\u2019t allowed to go out in the afternoon, at all. And later on, I joined the\nsocialistition middulshula pund. And then I was on -- this was from six with eight, as a -- not in -\n- deny it or anything. And I was only -- every weekend -- I was only allowed to go every\nfortnight. Every -- every week was for my father too much. And I was only every fortnight\nallowed to go. And in -- in this asa socialistition middulshula pund there were from other\nschools, too, and girls and boys. And there I met Peppy, in that -- in that -- but he was not in the\nsame sc-school as I was. He was in hominastation gimnasium. He learned Greek and Latin. I\nlearned French and Latin.",
        "Q: Why did you join that group? The middleshula --",
        "A: My father was a social -- was a member of the s -- of the socialle democratition partae. This\nwas allowed. This he was. And I know they came all with somebody to -- when -- because he\npaid a membership to the -- to that club. And I know once, this man sold him, as a book -- gaves\nhim some tickets for a picture that -- and when it came to that, my parents didn\u2019t want to go. And\nthen they said we should go. And we went, my -- my sister and I, we went to -- to that place.\nThis was in Weedenhopstrassie, where -- where we went. And then we had -- at first had, and --\nand when they saw new people coming, and those three boys -- three young men, accompanied\nus at home, walked us home. And then we got -- come in touch with them, through that. There\nwas -- the leader of the group was Bruno Kaiska. It was in his district. He had been living in the\nsame district, his family, as I grew up.",
        "Q: Where was Hansie? How were you -- how were you --",
        "A: Hansie was much younger and she was very spoiled, because my father hadn\u2019t seen bringing\nus up. She was the only one he had seen grown -- growing up, because at -- at that time he was\naw-away, as a soldier. And she was very spoiled and I had to -- in -- later on, a very good\nrelationship to her. She was nearer to me than my other sister. And when it -- when she had\nsomewhere to go, 1t was always me who had -- who -- who went with her and so on. We had a\nvery good relationship.",
        "Q: Did you love reading from a very early age? Did you start reading very young, and reading a\nlot?",
        "A: Not s -- not so much, no. No, only later, because, as I told you, we were under s -- very strict\ncontrol. My mother controlled the books we had read, yes. We were very, very strictly brought\nup. And as a -- I couldn\u2019t choose many. I sa -- I was reading in the restaurant. We had what they\ncalled salated sipter as a -- and in the restaurant I wrote the newspapers, all newspapers, in -- and\n-- and this [indecipherable] was, these were magazines, who were changed regularly, for the\nrestaurant and th-this I read. And I know -- I had not -- no proper children\u2019s book or something,\nbecause only that. And I know at school we were then ask once, to -- what we have read, to\nwrite. And I wrote about a book I have read. This was the -- the -- the fourlits taleebee\ndershernotfa airtrabbit. This means the last laugh of the beautiful airtrabbit. So airtrabbit mea --\nis Hungar -- which is --means Elizabeth. And my teacher called me and said I should read\ndifferent books, because is -- she didn\u2019t find it as proper as I -- what I have written, yeah. And\nthis I do remember. And then I got -- so later on I got -- I was a very avid reader then, later on.\nThis was a secret domain, what I wanted to explore.",
        "Q: Right. Tell me how you met Peppy. You met him -- met him at a group?",
        "A: I met him -- I have -- I -- he was in same group, but he didn\u2019t impress me at all. And he -- we\nhad every -- ev -- at -- at my school, in the grammar school, we had every year a ball, on the day\nwhen we got the half te -- when the end of that term was. And at that ball, he was and he said he\ndanced with me, but he didn\u2019t impress me at all. I didn\u2019t kn -- didn\u2019t even know it, that he had\ndanced with me.",
        "Q: Now, is --",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: Yeah and -- and when I -- I was very, very happy girl, I loved school, I didn\u2019t work at school.\nI ha -- I -- I was not -- not a hard worker, I -- I didn\u2019t work at all, I think. I -- I -- I -- it was more\nentertainment that work, this school. And I went out with boys. Not only with one, with that and\nthat and that. And was very happy with it. And my mother was not in Vienna and she had written\nonce to me, I should buy something for her and send it to her. And I went with a boy to -- to that\nshop in -- in Vienna. This was not -- it was a friend. I went out with -- with Peppy and with his\nfriend and didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t mean to me and I went out with him. This was in the afternoon. I got\nwet, it was -- started to rain and he took me to his mother, to dry me. And she dried me, offered\nme strawberries with cream and the gramophone was put up and we were dancing and it was\nvery ca -- very nice afternoon. But in the evening, in the same day, it -- I had a date with Peppy,\nhis friend. And I -- I didn\u2019t take it ser -- I didn\u2019t want to go away. I liked the dancing and I left\nhim. I didn\u2019t go. And he was waiting for me. It was at eight o\u2019clock. And I didn\u2019t come. So he\nwent to his friend. And he appeared there. When -- he danced with me and told me off, when he -\n- wh -- during the dance, because I didn\u2019t come to the date. And -- and so it-- it was a hap -- very\nhap -- and so I -- it was nothing special. And Wolfgang, the other -- names in the -- name of the\nother was Wolfgang and Wolfgang walked me home, but Peppy had -- could not walk me home\nbecause he had always to be at 10 o\u2019clock home and with his mother. His mother was -- as --\ndidn\u2019t -- this was -- and -- and then these two young men said, \u201cI am going out with -- with her.\u201d\nThe one said and the other said. And once I had a date with one and a third one came, with a\nletter -- I should choose between the two. This letter happened to be there. This -- this was\nWerner Felner, it was a third one from the group. And -- and then I choose, not Peppy, I choose\nWolfgang. And -- but I was not seriously interested to go out with him. And I went then on\nholiday to San Kilton and didn\u2019t write any more. This is -- 1t was -- it -- 1t -- it was ver -- it was\nnothing serious. And there, so it dropped up and a year later, or something, I -- I am got -- once I\ngot -- I had to go to -- I wanted to go to the national library, I was writing an essay for school.\nAnd Peppy offered me to -- to show me the ropes in the library. It\u2019s a national library, where I\nhadn\u2019t been before. And he went with me and at that -- at that excursion we -- I should, of course\nha -- have my sister on my side and had -- have to meet her, but we didn\u2019t -- we let her -- let her\nand I didn\u2019t come to the national library and this was the beginning of -- of the relationship. He\nwas -- as of we -- we were -- I didn\u2019t go to the national li-library and I didn\u2019t see the ropes and\nwe were talking and this was the beginning of our relationship. And my sister, I left.",
        "Q: You left?",
        "A: Yeah. And she was complaining. She was very, very -- I -- I mean it was a mad idea to --\nalways to have my sister on my side. We -- sometimes when we -- she came home, she\ncomplained to my mother that -- that our talk was not all right. She -- we were talking about the -\n- both -- all high school students, about different subjects, where she couldn\u2019t join in and she\ncomplained to my mother. And s -- and it was an -- a terrible relationshi -- terrible -- you\nshouldn\u2019t do that to children.",
        "Q: Was -- Peppy\u2019s name was Josef [indecipherable]",
        "A: Josef, yes. Josef Olsenfet.",
        "Q: So where does Peppy come from? Is -- was that the -- was that a nickname he had that you\ngave him?",
        "A: No, everybody in every -- Josef is like here Bill. It is -- Peppy is -- is -- all J-Josephs are\ncalled Peppy in Vienna.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: This 1s -- I do -- I think 1t comes from the Italian, I don\u2019t know where is comes from, but this\nis like you here call Williams, Bill. This is nothing special.",
        "Q: E-Edith, as you\u2019re -- you graduated gimnasium in 1933?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, during this period of time, things are going on in Germany, the Nazi party was --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Are you hearing about this and concerned about it?",
        "A: Yeah, we heard the -- we heard about it, of course we heard and all that, that Hitler had -- had\ntaken over, but 1t was somewhere very away. As we -- we did not expect to -- to be mixed up\nwith it. We heard at that time --Thomas Mann came from -- from Germany, and he had a talk in -\n- in Vienna. It was a -- a closed talk. It was for members of the Socialist party, as all the talk, but\nI don\u2019t know how I got a ticket, but I had one and I know he started with the way -- with the\nwords, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the evening f-for you means,\u201d Evast evostat vas der a verseebadoit,\nthat for -- for you means, \u201cbut for me it means more.\u201d Famil fermish it itboided mere. This was\nhis first words and he explained them why he cannot be a Nazi, why he -- he -- he was jouar -- as\na -- is against it. This I do remember. And then at that time, Airish Kessler came fr-from Austria\n-- to Austria from -- from Germany and of course I heard him too. And all of this and it -- when\nwe -- and I was interested of course, what happened. I read the Kampf.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes, I did. No, of course ammen -- as somebody who 1s interested in things, I was used to\nlook into books. And I read not only the Kampf. I read Will Rosenberg too. This was a racial -- a\nracialist books.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I have read that, too. Although the Kampf was for me so vulgar. Even the language. I love\nGerman and I -- it was very, very, I -- as I loved the language very, very much at that time and I\nha --was widely read at that time and the -- the -- the writing, the German only, even the\nlanguage, it was so vulgar. And, what he wrote about it, that I couldn\u2019t believe that this can make\nan -- an impression. It was an awful book. Not only -- even when you -- objective -- not as a Jew,\neven when you objective, to go to the -- and -- and funny enough, I have read -- later now -- a\nbook by Gola Mann, this is the son of Thomas Mann. It -- it is called, \u201cAn Yugen -- Youth in\nGermany\u201d. And in that book, he had the same, this -- he wrote about the Kampf too and he wrote\nabout the same. He wrote -- he wrote in the book too, what an awful book it is and how awful the\nlanguage 1s. See he -- he -- and -- and so, as a -- I couldn\u2019t believe that this can be of any -- 0-o0-\nof any meaning to anybody.",
        "Q: Did you read it before 1933?",
        "A: I think -- I -- I can\u2019t say that, but I think ye -- I think yes.",
        "Q: Before, uh-huh.",
        "A: Yes. I think I did.",
        "Q: So then it must have been a shock to you when he became Chancellor in Germany?",
        "A: Yeah, it was, of course it was a shock.",

        "A: No, Rosen -- silly.",
        "Q: Silly?",
        "A: Silly, yes. About these racial differences and -- and -- silly.",
        "Q: Did you, during this period of time, notice thing change -- noticing things changing in\nAustria?",
        "A: Oth -- in Austria they came then -- the Schushnik periods, sess so chare der mokhaven were\nforbidden as a party and the libraries were cleaned, so we chose not to go to the library any more.\nAnd I -- we joined then -- I had a friend who brought me in touch with foiervare -- with the fire,\nfoiervare -- this is the people who look, oh -- who are against fires when the fire breaks out. And\n-- and we were in that library then, they had a very, very good library, because we didn\u2019t want --\nwe didn\u2019t want the abbetob library any more, because they were cleaned of books. This was in\nthe Schushniksat and I\u2019ve -- when the fartallend de shiffront was -- the -- was rolling and I -- we\n-- | was in -- sometimes at meetings, at forbidden meetings in -- with Bruno Kisekey. There was\n-- | do remember we -- there was a political meeting and we were told, should the police come\nbutsolt -- it is a singing, a choir meeting, what we had to sing. I was in these meetings, yes. And\nwhen I was in Itew University, after \u201833, colleagues -- I think it was my reputation, approached\nme to -- to join illical coop. And ex-explained to me the selsese thame, how it works, that you\nhave a different name and you know only the people of -- of -- of the -- this little group, so -- and\nall this he explained to me. He was studying physics and I must say, I was inclined to join. And\nPeppy was the one who said, \u201cYou can\u2019t do it.\u201d Because \u201836, when my -- at that time -- my\nfather had died and he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do -- you can\u2019t do that, you could be arrested and think of\nyour mother, and you can\u2019t.\u201d And he kept me.

But he wanted -- he was -- as of -- wanted me to study,\nmade it seem. But I wouldn\u2019t have made a good doctor. I was too sensitive for that, no. And I\ndidn\u2019t -- I thought this -- tha -- so I come to -- came to law. And I loved it from the first moment.\nBut it was after -- after the first Shtatakson. This you do in Austria in Roman law -- in church\nlaw. I had to learn church law. And -- and in all German law. I did it without any special course.\nThere are special courses for, but I -- I didn\u2019t bother to go to. I couldn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t want -- I\nalways didn\u2019t want to be too expensive for my parents. This was always my -- didn\u2019t want it to\nhave to pay a course for me. And -- and -- but I -- I passed the exam and after the exam, I -- I\nwas -- I didn\u2019t -- I decided not to do anything. This was in April, somewhere, after three terms.\nAnd when I decided not to do anything after the old term, just to be free. Just to get out and just\n[inaudible], and I did. You had to -- you had to belake, it was called belake -- as a -- to choose\nwhat you want to hear. And I had only one lecture, a nine -- nine hour lecture a week, only. And\n11 ho -- 11 hours was a minimum, but it was three years as a only silliness that I didn\u2019t have\nmore, that I had took only s -- nine lectures.

I have to make -- to stay another half a year. I went to\nsittykarn and everywhere, it was hopeless, hopeless. I was very unhappy, you can imagine. I was\nprepared to end -- to go to the exam and this silliness would have code -- code me half a year.\nAnd I didn\u2019t say to anybody -- not to my mother, not to anybody, and one colleague, I told it, one\n[indecipherable].

This -- and he had made -- had\nmade the -- the exams, the speci -- all necessary, to be a dressmaker and now she -- she had\nworked as a dressmaker during the first World War, when my father was a soldier. And because\nat that time you didn\u2019t get so much money, then in the second -- in the second World War, Hitler\nwas very generous with money and -- and he was -- and now she established herself again as a\ndressmaker.

I said my -- this was my -- in -- in the same house\nwhere I live -- where we lived, there lived a coup -- a family, Christina Denner. As a -- she lost\nher mother when she was 14. There were two girls and her father was looking for somebody to\nhelp the girls to come as a -- for the -- in the school, because you can imagine when the mother 1s\nill of TB, that the girls were not very much involved in school. And I was recommended to him. I\nhad a good name and a good reputation in [indecipherable]. And it was a house -- the concierge\nof the house. And I was recommended. I did -- I say -- I have seen them. They were living in the\nsame house, because everybody had a dog and went out with the dog. But I didn\u2019t know them.\nAnd so I came in that house and I was then every afternoon in that house and the father was\nnever there. Two girls of 14 and 11 were living on their own, practically. All on their own. And I\nwas like -- I go to them and li -- as -- at first I -- I went to them to earn some money, but I was\nthen like the elder sister. I was involved in everything and they came, like girls with everything\nto me. I went to school to ask how they are getting on. She went said, to the hundersackademi\nand I helped her, so she passed the hundersackademi. And -- and so it came that we were so near\nto each other, because there was nobody and I liked them.

        "A: Yes. More -- closer then -- closer then, yes. I was working 1-1n -- helping in the dress making\nbusiness, too. I -- I don\u2019t know when I started, actually. It came very easily to me, only for the\nsecond -- for the second shtatsberfong, I went to a course. And this was three times a week and it\nis still this ex -- still exists and this was a judge who had this course and he mentioned from nine\nto 12, or even longer, we were exposed to questions and answers around and when you got up\nwithout a break -- without a break. And when you -- were -- you got up at half past 12 or\nsomething, after such a session, you felt as though -- down -- you -- you were really drained. But\nhe sa -- did it for years and for the -- for the second shtatsberfong. And -- and you make the\nshtatsberfong, this is -- the shtatsberfong 1s made for the service in the administration. And you\nmake about the same subject a regrozum. A regrozum is made for the doctorate. But you have to\nmake two exams, about the same subjects. There\u2019s always four subjects or five. And for the -- at\nthe university, for the -- for the -- anyway, I made one exam on the 11th of October and the\nsecond exam on the 14th of October, the same subject. One for the administration service and\none for the doctorate. And as it was, when I came to university and started law, I thought I will\nmeet a lot of Jews, because in Vienna there were all the lawyers. The most of the lawyers were\nJews, but this didn\u2019t happen. There were the -- the -- there were not in -- not so many Jews on --\nat the university because the others -- the not -- the Gentiles who started, they always -- they fill\nthe administration later -- later on. You didn\u2019t see them, but the Jews had to go into business, in a\nway and work as -- in a free -- free profession, but the others were feeling a Jew wasn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t\ntaken into the administration at that time. And I don\u2019t think there were ever a Jewish judge in\nAustria. And they always -- and so this was a discrepancy. I have only heard of Jewish lawyers,\nbut they\u2019re n-not of the people in the administration who were lawyers.",
        "Q: When you describe administration, can you explain what that means, because it seems that\nit\u2019s somewhat different from -- when you say a lawyer and administration, you mean -- do you\nmean the government?",

When 1s -- it -- it was my -- would have been my wish, but\nI never regarded that as a --a real possibility in Austria. No, I never did. She promised me as a --\nwhen I finished, she will help me to get a -- a -- proposition in any firm. But I didn\u2019t have a -- a\nspecific hope or anything.

        "Q: No, no, what I mean is why, wh-what made him different from other men, at the time?",
        "A: From other -- why I got to -- I -- I don\u2019t know. This 1s -- I -- I -- he loved me and I loved him.\nThis can\u2019t -- can\u2019t be explained in any way. But we -- we had -- we had everything -- discussed\neverything together. I didn\u2019t discuss it with my sister, because my relationship was always a bit\nstrained with her and my mother was busy and was wor -- and he was nearest to me. And he had\na difficult life because of his mother. I didn\u2019t know that and I accepted it and I helped him in a --\nin -- in that way, that I went a lot to him and he went -- we went out. He had -- at 10 o\u2019clock he\nhad to be at home at an age where it is not e -- not yusherin. And so it came. When he made an\nexam, I was sitting behind him, usually. Once I was so near to him in an exam, that he was on\nthe chair, he was moving about, that I put my foot on the chair that he couldn\u2019t move. So near. At\na state exam, I was so near to him.

        "A: No, I -- Peppy didn\u2019t dare to talk about leaving Austria because his mother said, when she --\nat first -- he was brought up as a Jew and he left the Jewish religion only after Hitler came. So he\n-- after the Nuremberger laws, he was regarded as a Jew, not as a half-Jew. Even his mother was\nstill a Jew. His mother became Jewish to get married, but not with her brain or with her feeling,\njust to get married. To -- he -- to the rich Jew, to the Jewish -- and she also left then the Jewish\nreligion, but she was not a -- so that she doesn\u2019t be regarded as a Jew. But he was regarded as a --\nas a Jew and he w -- he was obliged to wear the star. He didn\u2019t do it, but he va -- he was obliged\nto do it. And of course we -- when we talked -- when he talked at home, I mentioned\nimmigration, then his mother said she\u2019s jumping out of the window, she commit suicide. He was\nher only son and his mother h-had strong will and his father had died years ago. I didn\u2019t ha -- I\ndidn\u2019t know his father. His father was -- ha -- I don\u2019t know even the illness. It was a mental\nillness, 1t was something -- he died in a mental asylum. And he was in for long time. They went\nonce a week, the mother and the son, to visit him in that -- it must have been as he was a\nteenager, it must pas -- have been a harrowing time. Yoyosee. And I think this time was when\nthe power of the mother was established, about the son -- that he was the only son. She -- the\nfamily of his father paid her a pension, she didn\u2019t work. And they gave -- and so everybody of\nthe family -- I didn\u2019t know all the family, gave something and she got it like a pension, without --\nbit -- betting -- without saying -- paying, or -- or s -- even -- she didn\u2019t have to say thank you.\nBut she didn\u2019t work to bring up the son. And -- seez -- and s-she got then married again and she\nkept her marriage secret from the family, so that she gets a pension [indecipherable] that\u2019s her\npay.",

        "A: Yes. We were all -- actually, my sister, my -- Mimi, who was near me, she -- sh -- our -- our\nconcierge where we lived in that house, as th -- she took off our -- we had a plate that my\nmother\u2019s a dressmaker. They took it off and they were worried. They thought all -- we are\nexempted because my father was an invalid and a soldier in the first World War and the Jews\nwere -- they were against it, the Nazi, they were all somewhere, so this was an abstract -- abstract\nnotion, somewhere on top, but not for us, it was and she recommended -- she didn\u2019t know the\npeople there and she put m-my sister in contact with a Jewish comasherot, it was called, as a -- in\n-- in [indecipherable]. He -- and he told her about baitar -- about this illegal transport. And my\nsister went and with -- with her -- she got married before she left on -- in December and on the\nfourth of -- of February, she went with her husband on an illegal transport. And she was -- sh --\nthis transport was a very unhappy one. It -- sh-she got Scarlet fever in Romania and she was in\nhospital there and when -- they had a -- a fire on the ship and they were saved by Italian war\nships and brought to Roldus and in Roldus they had to wait until fum -- some money comes from\nAmerica and a new ship. And she was on her way, I think until end of August. From February\nuntil the end of August. But in the end, the ship a-arrived in Natania. And the youngest sister had\njoined a -- a Jewish youth camp, Shamere Hadsa\u2019eer. And she got a visa certificate as a member\nof Shamere Hadsa\u2019eer and she went on the day when the Kristallnacht -- on the Kristallnacht --\non the tenth of -- of November, at that time, she went normally over Trieste, to Israel with\nnormal fare, they -- as a -- the illegal transport were all very expensive, because the Gestapo had\nto get their share of it and she went normally and she had a certificate from zavitzoh to a school,\nshe was 17. And she has -- must have written -- made a tour of Israel as it was and our letters --\nour correspondence was veero to Belgrade, where my mother\u2019s sisters was married. And my\nmother\u2019s sister ben -- put the letters in a different envelope and send it to Israel, because at that\ntime, was war. And so we got our letters back. And this -- my sister\u2019s letters stopped completely.\nAnd she must have written something about the country, what the censor didn\u2019t approve of it.\nThat was -- she was -- she must have had maybe a trip or something and she couldn\u2019t write any\nmore. And my mother didn\u2019t get any letters any more from her, she was crying sometimes, the\nchild does -- isn\u2019t alive any more, because she didn\u2019t [indecipherable] she\u2019s all right, but she\ndidn\u2019t believe it, because she didn\u2019t write -- my youngest sister -- no letter of my s -- youngest\nsister came through. This must be the British censor in -- in Palestine must have -- and after\nmany months, then we got a letter and she had the idea to write she had an accident, she writes\nwith the left hand. So this was not recognized as the same handwriting. But this -- my mother\nwas crying sometimes and said the child isn\u2019t alive any more.",

        "A: Well, we couldn\u2019t -- a-at first it was one after the other and my mother had to settle\nsomething, to pay for my sister\u2019s fare. We had lazaklub cecils and with a Persian carpet, when\neverybody was at that time, buying Jewish things and -- and so it -- it hadn\u2019t slo -- we didn\u2019t go\nso quickly, it was all a matter of time.

And my\nmother was working as a dressmaker and we had on the -- on -- when the Kristallnacht was, two\ndays ago, a colleague of mine came to us and ask if he can sleep that night and when the\nKristallnacht is with us, because he -- we were only women and 1n a district which was not a\ndiplomatic district.

And when they got home, they send me a parcel with\nmen\u2019s underwear, for the French prisoners. I suppose they were complaining that they didn\u2019t\nhave underwear to change or something. Now, I should give it to the prisoners. How can -- can I\ngo and give a French prisoner a present? What to do? But for me it was a holy duty to do what --\nwhat is asked for me.

But I must have been seen. When I told\nthem, the parcel was stolen, they didn\u2019t get it. So I -- somebody mu -- but I was not denounced\nfor it. Somebody must have seen me and it wasn\u2019t -- it didn\u2019t come to the Gestapo. So, the\nparcel, but they didn\u2019t get the underwear. I am so sorry.

Yes, n-not that I\u2019m staying\nwith her for longer. Dangerous person what I am. And -- and she -- she -- when I was there, she\nwas already -- atha -- I was staying -- overstaying my invi -- invitation already. Overstaying. And\nshe made -- made it clear to me that she doesn\u2019t want me too long -- that she doesn\u2019t want me\nany more. She made it clear to me. And then I had to find some -- another place where to stay.\nThis wasn\u2019t easy and I me -- once I met -- he was a Jew, a -- a -- a brother of Mr. Rumer,\nOnkefelas we called him and he took me -- he was a Jew, but h-he could live -- he had a flat in\nwhat they called Himindaball -- in the community, from -- what belongs to -- to the community.\nAnd he was -- had told them he had to bring the Aryan now -- asa -- the -- the proof that he\u2019s an\nAryan, what he didn\u2019t -- was -- he wasn\u2019t and he didn\u2019t have any proo -- proof and he told them\nthat his documents are at the moment in South Africa in the hands of her sister, because he is\nemigrating to there and he hasn\u2019t the documents. And this was again, this man does -- didn\u2019t care\nmuch. And so he was staying in that flat. And he took me -- but an -- an old man could not easily\ntake a la -- young girl into his house. I stayed the night with him -- he may have take -- kept me\nin another night or something, but an old man cannot keep a young girl in his flat, this is clear.\nSomebody would notice that there is a -- a young girl going out and in. This was -- was -- as a --\none, but in-interesting is when I was there, going round in Vienna, I met one -- he was a bit\nyounger than I was, from the socialist middulshunabrunt. He was actually the opeman at that\ntime. His name was Cootberger. And he had an idea. He wrote -- he said he is not a Jew, he was\nexchanged in the nursing home. It was in a -- a -- a difficult -- he was taken for a Jew, but this\nwas not -- are not his parents. His parents were others. And he made an application to Berlin, to\nsome office and the Nazis took that seriously. Can you imagine? That this was the Nazi time.\nThey took it seriously.

But from -- for months or years or something, I don\u2019t know exactly how long it was, he was\ngoing around and telling, as a -- because his application that he is exchanged in the nursing\nhome.

        "Q: What did she -- what -- what did Crystal do?",
        "A: Once, I wanted to go to a swimming -- swimming. So I ask Crystal f-for a swimming -- a\nswimming costume. I got it at once. I mean this was -- this was -- I -- whatever they could, they\ndid.",
        "Q: So, when you came and told her what Platner had said --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Crystal then immediately gave you her papers?",
        "A: Yes. She -- yeah, no, she had to go -- th-they wanted, in any case, to go on holiday to Minsta,\nwhere her father was in the flak and Elsa especially said as I should go with them. I should go\nwith them to -- but I couldn\u2019t -- Jews were -- were not allowed to travel on the -- on -- on the --\non the railway. I couldn\u2019t go with them and so -- and -- and then, because she said -- h-her father\nsaid there\u2019s more to eat and I should go with them, but I couldn\u2019t go and she had, in any case, I\ndon\u2019t know if she had it already, this paper, for the holiday, but the holiday was planned and -- or\nif she just get it and she gave me the paper and said -- and went to the police. Very easily -- she\nwas very -- when she did grow up in that district, she was not a stranger who comes from\nanywhere and the police -- she was -- police believed her and she ga -- she got replicas.",
        "Q: So she was the one who said I lost my --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- in the water and I --",
        "A: Yes, she told the story and -- and it was of course believed. Min -- she grew up in that district\nand it is very plausible that her handbag had fall into the weet -- into the water on the Altadona.",
        "Q: Edith, what papers did you have? You were not wearing a star?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: But you said -- I understand the Jews could not travel on the trains.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Right? But how were you identified? People knew who you were? I mean --",
        "A: No, I was -- who should ent -- identify me?",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s what I mean. Why couldn\u2019t you travel on the train? Is it --",
        "A: No -- Jews were not allowed to travel on the train.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t have papers that said you were Jewish. Or did you?",
        "A: No, but I -- I -- could be -- there could be rats here -- I could be found out. There were not --\nma-maybe in -- in one of the letters of my mother, she writes they went -- th-they walked to the\ncemetery, to my father\u2019s grave. This was very, very far away. This was about two hours walk.\nBut, I suppose she could not travel with a star on that -- on that train. Sh-She didn\u2019t write, of\ncourse. I don\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t -- but she wrote, she -- she -- she was walking to the cemetery and\nthis was very -- 1s in Vienna very, very far away. When you g-go an hour by train. And sh --\nbecause she -- I suppose she couldn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know. She could not travel by -- she wore that\nstar, she could not travel by train to the cemetery.",
        "Q: Okay. So, Crystal gets these duplicate coupons.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes? And so you get them.",
        "A: I get -- I get the original.",
        "Q: The original. All right, now what happens?",
        "A: Not the duplicate.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: She had the duplicate.",
        "Q: Now what happens?",
        "A: No th -- I had -- I had to go -- I had to leave.",
        "Q: And you decided to go where?",
        "A: I wa -- I decided to go to Munich, because I had seen a newsreel about the -- about the --\nabout Munich. About the house, the deutshenkuntz. About an art exhibition in Munich. That was\nintere -- and -- and it is and it looks ridiculous when I say it, but this afiga in this art exhibition\ntouched me so much, as is would speaking to me, as it would tell me to go. And so I decided to\nseize it, that -- things -- to go to Munich.",
        "Q: What was the -- what was the piece of art that spoke to you?",
        "A: It was -- it -- 1t was a -- a white -- white marmore --",
        "Q: Marble?",
        "A: Yes, a marble. It was a -- a li -- a -- a woman and a woman lying, but 1-1t expressed peace so\nmuch -- what I missed so much. It is worth so much what I missed that I wanted to see it. And so\nI went to Munich and in Munich I had to live somewhere, no? And then I bought the mune-\nmunestalaraisinzae only. Never before and never afterwards I bought that paper and I looked a-\namong -- among the rooms to let and there was one room to let -- not in Munich, outside\nMunich, in Disenhofen, for sewing. For wor -- for -- not for money, but for doing some sewing.",
        "Q: In exchange for the room?",
        "A: In exchange. And this fitted me because I didn\u2019t have much money, I didn\u2019t know how long I\nhave to live wi -- on the fur coat of my mother and -- and this fitted me very well and I think I\nwrote a card with -- like that -- to that place, but then I went there, to -- I went -- I traveled back\nby night and didn\u2019t know where to sleep in I -- in any case, I traveled by night and in the\nmorning, I traveled to Disenhofen and it was after lunch I arrived and I suppose this was my first\nday with the wrong papers and with all that and -- and overtired as I was, I must have looked\nawful. And I had a small suitcase and this woman, when I ope -- when they opened the door, and\nI told her who I am, she put me to bed. She didn\u2019t ask much questions. Sh-sh-she\u2019s said I shoulds\nlie down and in -- and I slept and I got coffee and cake into the bed and [indecipherable] 1s meant\nin my position. I would have worked for -- day and night for her. And then we agreed I work\nthree nights -- three days. And I made her -- and -- I kno -- did know soon her -- her stories, her\nlife stories. I told her that my father, oh, is a widower. My mother died. Had married a woman\nnot much older than I am and I couldn\u2019t get on -- on with her and so I have decided to leave\nVienna, this wa --",
        "Q: How -- how did you come up with that story?",
        "A: Is very plausible.",
        "Q: It\u2019s very plausible.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Yes, ob-obviously.",
        "A: And it is very plausible, so I -- I -- her mother -- Crystal\u2019s mother was dead, this was true, but\nI had to have a reason why I leave Vienna and people didn\u2019t ask me much. Everyone believed it\nand it was very plausible and people were very tactful, they didn\u2019t ask me more questions. And I\ndid know her st -- her life story soon. She was a nurse in -- a private nurse for the mother of an\nyusteetsrad -- a Jewish yusteetsrad, and she was living in the Jewish house. And she had -- and\nthis -- the Gestapo had arrested her because they hope that she knows something about money.\nSec, it was always a money -- there were -- this is not -- 1s -- I think it doesn\u2019t come out properly\nin all this -- this talks and they wanted to know about ma -- she didn\u2019t know anything about\nmoney, of course. But this yusteetsrad was of course, in prison, too. Suppose em -- of money and\nhe kneeled for her when they were confronted. He kneeled for her and ask her for forgiveness,\nthat she has so much to suffer, because she was employed in that house. And then they thought\nshe has a liaison with him, what wasn\u2019t, of course. And a -- a fu -- for a full fortnight she was in\npris -- she was arrested and then they let her out. And she was a Protestant and this was a\nCatholic place and nobody talked to her, because she was an outsider and this was very nice, too,\nbecause nobody asked me any questions.",
        "Q: And what was her name?",
        "A: Gell. She died of cancer. I had to -- I -- I had contact with her in London, when I was still --\nshe died of cancer.",
        "Q: But you did not -- you -- you couldn\u2019t take the chance of telling her the truth.",
        "A: No, I did -- I didn\u2019t tell anybody. I didn\u2019t take -- no, no, I didn\u2019t tell anybody. I made her a --\na dearmed lerner wasa dearmed liss. This is the -- wha -- what people in Austria were for\nholidays or -- you know what -- th-the folkstrat. Th-This is -- and out of -- of the tallah of her --\nof the joie yusteetrab, the blaiktella -- net -- he hardly -- I made her a dress of tho -- the\nblaiktella. You know, I found that this had irony for me, because as a -- as a lawyer myself, to\nmake dress out of a tallah of a lawyer, a dress. But I did it and I -- I was sewing, but I could --\nthere was no obligation. I could sew whenever I had li -- when I -- ever I wanted, when I said I\nam going to Munich, so I didn\u2019t do any sewing. It was a very easy relationship and we were very,\nvery friendly together and she had a little boy. She told me she got married on an -- in the course\nof an advertisement. Yeah, she told me all her life story. She was -- had -- had met her husband s\n-- on -- through -- through an allway advertisement. I suppose she had money after they foam the\nJews -- after they were -- to buy the house -- that she had a house there, a nice house. And she\nhad a second room to let, but I took the smallest one. And -- and another room -- I could have\nchanged for a bigger room and I was -- it was a very, very small room and I said I want that\nroom.",
        "Q: Was she close in age to you, was she much older?",
        "A: She was 1-1n the 30\u2019s.",
        "Q: In the 30\u2019s.",
        "A: In the 30\u2019s. She had a four or a five year old boy at that time. And -- and it -- I so -- 1t was a\nvery, very easy relationship and I was very free. And I went sometimes -- I couldn\u2019t stay always\nin -- in the house. I went to Munich -- I have never been before to Munich and it was a ver -- it\nwas a holiday place at that time. There were no bombs. Only it was blackout in the evening.\nThere were n -- and people from all over the country came to Munich for holidays. There was a\nexhibition and there were opera and this was a -- a -- a real holi -- what I didn\u2019t know before, but\nit was a real holiday place. And there were -- in Munich, it\u2019s a beautiful town and as ha -- as it\nhappened, there were many SS man -- men at that time, there from the Baltic. There were -- this -\n- from latee -- from -- from the Baltic. So they couldn\u2019t speak a work of eng -- of German, but\nwere SS men from the Baltic. I have seen quite a lot of them. This was -- was not my company.",
        "Q: Did you go to see the sculpt that you had seen in the film?",

I went there and I went to Munich and there were -- I zo -- as it happened, I\ndidn\u2019t have any points of ca-caretakarten and she said she -- she was very nice to me, she said\nshe has a few points over, she would give it to me. So we went to a dress shop in Munich to buy\nsomething. She was with me and I put something on, but her points were -- were not enough for\nthat. And the people said it suits me so well, that they gave it to me without points. I got the dress\nand this dress -- what -- she had a few points over, but she didn\u2019t know it, sh-she will get a new\ncard in -- in no time at all and the people in the shop said I -- as a -- it -- it -- it suits me so well,\nthat they gave it to me only for these few points.",
        "Q: So, in germ -- in -- in Germany during that period of time, it was a like a ration card for\nclothes? It was --",
        "A: Yes. There was everything ra -- you had -- you could not have your shoe -- shoes you\ncouldn\u2019t get. You could not have your shoes repaired without registered some be -- without being\nregistered some. In Bramberg when I was, my -- Werner repaired my shoes, because I couldn\u2019t\ngo to a shoemak -- to -- I couldn\u2019t have my shoes repaired. And when he was drafted -- when he\nwas -- be -- became a soldier, I did need shoes repaired. Then I went to the shoemaker and gave\nhim my shoes. He said I am not in -- on his list. I said, \u201cYou may -- you may find my husband on\nthe list.\u201d He was on the list, of course. And then he repaired my shoes. He thought, because my --\nhe thought it is -- his nagation said I\u2019m not there.",
        "Q: Was it difficult for you to be in Munich walking around with --",
        "A: No, it was -- this was not -- was very interesting in a way. I\u2019ve never been there before and I\nwent -- I wanted to go to the opera.",
        "Q: And you went once with --",
        "A: I went to -- to Bohemme -- to see Bohemme. I am -- I\u2019m still liking opera and I was --",
        "Q: Did you go alone?",
        "A: I was in a long queue for a cheap ticket and then came a soldier and ask me if he can say I am\nhis bride. So I allowed him to say I am his bride, because the -- the soldiers didn\u2019t have to queue\nfor a tick --",
        "Q: So you got in for nothing?",
        "A: No, not for nothing, but without queuing. I don\u2019t know if I paid or he paid for the ticket. I\ndon\u2019t know that any more. But I was -- I hadn\u2019t eaten anything and I said I haven\u2019t eaten, we\nwent into a restaurant. He must have been officer or something. When -- this was full, the\nrestaurant and the waitresses were serving and when we came with the -- sat down and he just\ngot to the waitress -- she was serving somebody. Took the plates and put it in front of me. And\nnobody said anything. No-Nobody -- as 0 -- went -- this is what I -- I never did know who is an\nofficer or not.

And as it happened, he --\nand so we went to the opera and he did know all the -- all the air -- arias of the opera and in the\nevening, when I went to the station, in the dark things -- he\u2019s sang all the arias to me on the way.\nIt was a very romantic things. He wanted to meet me again. I made a date, but I didn\u2019t go.",
        "Q: Was that typical for you, that you would meet [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah. I must say it was. Because I -- how should I explain somebody that I don\u2019t -- I was\nafraid then for questions and everything. When I met new people, it was easy. But people -- to\nmeet people again is more difficult. And then they may get doubt or ask question or a -- maybe --\nmay saf -- I knew in Vienna once, I was jaywalking again and somebody was on the bicycle and\nhe sprang up and then he said, he said to me, \u201cI have saved your life, now.\u201d Because -- because I\nwas in front of the bicycle. I wa -- I was walking in that way. So he can accompa -- he can walk\nwith me and accompany me, because he has saved my life. So -- but I never allowed anybody to\ngo with me as much as my cousin\u2019s house, I never did that. And he wanted to meet me again. He\n-- he was talking against the German -- the Nazis. Anyway -- and before he left me, he said, \u201cIf\nyou denounce me, I say it\u2019s all a lie, what you\u2019ll say.\u201d But then he got afraid of it, I suppose and -\n- and he wanted to meet me again and -- and made me a date and he even gave me an amulet, a\nChristian amulet, what his mother has given him, so that it 1s -- that I see how much he wanted to\nmeet me. And I had this amulet for quite a time, I don\u2019t know when I lost it. And -- and -- but I\ndidn\u2019t go, of course. I did not -- not meet him again. This was a thing I -- I couldn\u2019t do.",

And we went\ntoge -- and we went -- it was seven -- had another seven days holy day and we met every day, as\nI went.

        "A: Oh, no -- yeah I met him in the city, always. He didn\u2019t take -- it didn\u2019t go to desent -- there\u2019s\nno -- but in the end I gave him a address. He couldn\u2019t -- otherwise he could not have written to\nme. But ed -- I\u2019d -- he didn\u2019t ever go to Desenhoffen.",

        "A: -- because his holiday was over. He was epl -- employed in ba -- at Raddo in -- in\nBrandenborg.",
        "Q: And did you expect to hear from him or see him again, or you didn\u2019t think about it?",
        "A: I -- I suppose we agreed to write to each other, or -- I don\u2019t know if he -- I suppose he wrote, I\nam s-sure I didn\u2019t write at first. He wrote to me -- he send me a present.

        "A: No -- yeah, because I went -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I went to Vienna after I had finished the Red Cross\ncourse. I didn\u2019t -- I have had to go because I hadn\u2019t any winter clothes, it was beginning of\nNovember and I didn\u2019t have a coat or anything. I didn\u2019t think I need that, I thought then it\u2019s long\nfinished, the Nazi time, until the winter. I had only four or five summer dresses, I didn\u2019t have\nanything else. And I went -- I wanted to go for three days to Vienna and then I thought I can stay\nwith my cousin for the three days, but I wasn\u2019t very welcome. This was -- I noticed it, that I\nwasn\u2019t very welcome. And -- as a -- I went to see Crystal, at Crystal\u2019s I was always welcome and\nI went to see Mrs. Needelhile, but this was -- was __.

I -- I\u2019ve -- I had\nthe feeling that this was my -- was not very nice to come to the friends and not to feel welcome,\nbut I felt 1t at that time and I decided to go home after two days and not to stay three there --\nanother night in Vienna. In Vienna, I always wore dark glasses. Yes, this was my only one thing.\nAnd I never wore the Red Cross uniform in Vienna, never -- didn\u2019t -- this would give me away at\nonce.

        "A: No, they -- the Red Cross broach was worn in front -- only with the uniform. But they were --\nI never wore that because there was a little -- a swastika in the middle of the broach and I\ncouldn\u2019t go around with a swastika.",
        "Q: And did that get you into trouble in the Red Cross?",
        "A: I was ask -- of course, because the uniform wasn\u2019t complete and as a -- said, \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten\nit, \u2019'm sorry.\u201d Then I was always ask to join the women\u2019s -- the -- the women\u2019s organization for -\n- of the party.

        "Q: So how -- you come back from Vienna and then do you hear from Werner soon after that?",
        "A: Yeah, there was a telegram there that he\u2019s -- that he comes in the morning, on the same\nmorning. And, when I thought -- he has something in business or whatever.

Now he wanted -- as a -- I'd said\nyes, I love him, but you should not marry in -- you -- in war time and as all what you can say and\nwhat you can say -- I talked about it. And -- but -- and in the end, I couldn\u2019t get rid of him and he\nwanted --",
        "Q: Had you fallen in love with him?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know -- as a -- I didn\u2019t think of marrying at that time, believe me, I didn\u2019t think of\nmarrying. But I was -- I -- as a -- I was in a desperate situation at that time. But he was very, very\npressing. He wanted to meet my father, you know, I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t produce a father.

He was on the way to wor-work and just didn\u2019t go to\nthe works on -- to the -- a -- instead of going to araddo, he went to the station and came to\nMunich. It suddenly came to him. And so, in the end, that\u2019s what I said to him. And he had\nconfessed -- confessed to me that he is in divorce and has a child and is in divorced proceedings.\nHe -- he had co-confessed that to me. And then I said, I confess -- I said that I\u2019m Jewish and live\nwith somebody. He said at once like this, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d This -- he said it is good that\nsomething is not right with me, as something 1s not right with him either. He\u2019s --",
        "Q: But did you wonder that here he 1s -- was he in the -- was he a party member at this time, a\nNazi party member?",

        "Q: So did you question him? When he said it didn\u2019t matter or that 1t was [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t -- no, I -- no -- not -- he -- no, I didn\u2019t question him. When I was used -- that it\ndoesn\u2019t matter. I met other Nazi, too. But I -- he said it doesn\u2019t matter, so it doesn\u2019t matter, no.",
        "Q: So for you, the two of you were simply individuals at this moment?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",

        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- horrible situation, was not there.",
        "A: No, we -- yeah, yeah. And I -- but I said to him, positive I know that -- he should go back, I\nwill wait for him, with -- after the war. I love him, but he should go back and think it over.\nBecause he insisted that it doesn\u2019t matter, when this is -- was a crime. And -- and I -- but this,\nand I know I sh -- I should go to Brandenborg and think it over, I said to him. Should go back.\nAnd he went back in the evening of the same day and he wrote to me when -- then the worst\nthing 1s -- this 1s what you always -- he send me two or three telegrams I should come and I\ndidn\u2019t want to get telegrams. This is not so easy. And so I came.",
        "Q: To Brandenborg?",
        "A: On the 13th of December. This was in November and on -- so a munch later already, I was on\nthe way to Brandenborg. On the 13th of December. He arranged that I am staying with the wife\nof a friend of his.",

        "A: No, I vor -- I -- I went be -- and -- I went because I -- he sent me telegrams. I didn\u2019t want to\nget telegrams. I couldn\u2019t s-say to him, \u201cStop se-sending telegrams, this is dangerous.\u201d I couldn\u2019t\ndo that. And so this was a natural fi -- following that I went.",
        "Q: No, what I mean is -- I un -- I understand you were trying to stop him from --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- putting you in danger.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But now you were in another situation, where it appears you were taking a first step to saying\nyes, I will marry you. And that --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, but it was a -- as a -- this was -- I -- I went -- I was staying with Hilda Shlagel --\nhill -- and her husband was a soldier, wasn\u2019t in -- wasn\u2019t there and we were very good friends,\nvery soon. Hilda tell -- told me that they were all Nazis, [indecipherable], Hilda told me that she\nhadn\u2019t tasted butter before Hitler came. Her father was without work and she hadn\u2019t tasted butter\nbefore Hitler came. Sh-Sh-She told me. And -- and her husband was wounded and was sent to a\nlautcerett in Metz. Metz is in Emellsass. And she went to him. She had -- was six months -- six\nweeks in Ellsass, as -- as -- he\u2019s -- and went out with him. This was the nicest time of her life.\nWas her first holiday and she had six weeks with her husband and because the women got a lot\nof money in the Nazi time. When Werner was drafted, I got his full wages from the factory. I\ndidn\u2019t even know before how much he earns. And I got his full wages, automatically. And -- and\nshe had money, for the first time and had a -- a wonderful holiday in Metz. He didn\u2019t come back\nin the end. He died in Roseland, but this was later and this was -- was forgi -- forget -- forgotten\nat that time, that it can happen. The -- I -- I wondered sometimes, how easily it was -- the wo --\nthe women took the death of a soldier. I couldn\u2019t believe that. They were -- at first they were\nwritten in -- in the announcement in Schtoltzatower, in -- as a -- in Schtoltzatower, how can I\ntranslate it? I am proud -- proud -- I am sorry, but I am proud. And then [indecipherable]\nstopped. The English made once and -- and the English radio __ the ones how it stopped, as\nthough -- how many there were the first years and how many the last years. But they -- they -- I -\n- I didn\u2019t know ma -- more women where the husband had died in the war and it was taken, to\nmy -- from my feelings, too easily. But they got all money and it may be that in -- in,\n\u201cMachiavelli the Prince,\u201d you know that book? Yeah. He writes that it is easier -- that it -- he\nwrites definitely that people take -- as a -- easier the death of a person than the lo-lots of mon --\nthan the loss of money. I don\u2019t know if you have read it, but he is writing about it. And I have\nfound it is true. There -- the s-soldiers asa -- died somewhere and then they got the note, but they\ngot all money. And -- and Hitler was generous with money.",
        "Q: Did you feel any ambivalence, when you were living with Hilda Shlagel and thinking about\nbeing with Werner?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, I -- no, no.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: Personally, we went on. We went on, she -- every evening she went with me to Werner\u2019s\nwhen he came home and we had a meal together usually and some talk and when we went home.\nShe went with us to Berlin for an exe -- for an -- for a trip and so no, I didn\u2019t feel -- she was\nhonest in her way, and I didn\u2019t feel --",

        "A: No, no, it -- a -- a -- I was not allowed to talk anything about my education, anything about\nmy age. I had to pretend that I am younger. Werner sometimes, when we were in company, made\n-- made jokes about it, what only I understood. And -- and he was -- no, it -- for me it was a life\nbehind a screen. It was not easy not to -- not -- but I found out, when you don\u2019t talk, people don\u2019t\nask much. I found out. Usually people are talking more than they have to and they -- as a -- I had\n-- they were talking and I was listening.

Usually people\nare talking more than they have to and they -- as a -- I had -- they were talking and I was\nlistening. In the hospital I had a patient, a Nazi industrialer, he was a private patient because he\ncame to Brandenborg, because in Berlin were so many bombs. So that he had a sto -- stroke and\nhe came to Brandenborg in to so -- in -- into the hospital and I was -- happened to be the nurse.\nAnd he liked to talk to me. I was for him, the public opinion. He met -- yeah, he wanted to ask sa\n-- as I was very careful, but once I gave myself -- he said, \u201cSister, you are clever.\u201d\n[indecipherable] I was shocked. I was s -- 1-1-1t was -- for me it was terrible. I was shocked, I was\nafraid I have given myself away.",
        "Q: Because you were supposed to be a simple person.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. I was simple. He said it once. He wanted to take me as private nurse with him to\nBerlin, to Salandorf, where he was living. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible, I\u2019m a Red Cross nurse.\u201d He\nsaid he has enough connection to -- can do it. But then I got married, no? And he insisted that his\nsons send me moselwine. This was like gold at that time. And I -- so I got moselwine for my\nwedding, yeah. He was -- he got flowers from Spier, net -- who was at that time in -- 1n -- in the\ngovernment. Yeah, he got flowers from them. This was my compady.",
        "Q: Edith, do you think that you -- you partly married Werner for protection, as well as for\nfeelings, or did you --",
        "A: No, I -- I -- look, you have to understood, I felt jilted from th -- from Peppy. I felt that he did\nnot -- he di -- hasn\u2019t behaved properly to me. When I wrote him about Werner, he suddenly said\nthink of your mo -- no, I should not marry and all arguments you can bring. \u201cWhat would your\nmother say?\u201d And think of that and -- and everything. And he had time before. Enough time,\nyears and years and years. He had time before. And there comes somebody who doesn\u2019t know\nanything of me -- of me. He doesn\u2019t know -- he -- he even knows I have a wrong name and wants\nme. No, so it was a -- an natural reaction. I felt definitely -- and I had made up, when I went to\nMunich, that I will never marry Peppy and that I felt jilted. He did. Because, for his comfort I\nhad stayed and -- and now he has gone on a comfortable life in hi -- with his mother, but h -- I\nwas not included. I -- not even slept one night in that hou -- in that flat. So I felt -- I felt jilted. I\nfelt he -- he didn\u2019t behave properly and honestly to me. And here comes somebody, sent from\nheaven, who hasn\u2019t know me, doesn\u2019t know anything of me and knows only that I -- that it is a\ncrime to -- to marry me and he wants me. So I -- I didn\u2019t think so much of protection or\nsomething. Someone -- I really wanted to share my life with him. It was a protection, but 1t was\nnot in front -- it was not as a -- for me it was not the -- the reason to do it.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what it seemed in your -- in the way in which your letters worked.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That the anger against Peppy worked to even enhance the emotions with Werner.",
        "A: Yes, of course.",
        "Q: Werner finally gets a divorce?",
        "A: Yeah, end of January he got the divorce and then I moved into his flat, but I didn\u2019t want to get\nmarried, not before -- I was afraid of the bureaucracy and all that. We -- we lived very happily.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Yeah. When I was working and he wasn\u2019t working, he made cutoffer poofa as 0 -- and -- and\nhe was cooking and when he had an hour free, he came to the hospital, when I was working and\nin the time where I had the break or something, he came to the hospital.",
        "Q: So he was very devoted to you?",
        "A: Yeah, he was. When he was drafted, in -- in \u201844, he was in a -- in a casairner, this is a military\nestablishment in Brandenborg. He came ever --every evening home. Every evening and it was\nforbidden to go out for the soldiers. He came on his bike. At midnight he had to be there, he had\na -- a special way to come back into -- into this establishment and once he came down and a\npiece of his bicycle was stolen and he got a shock. He stole the same piece from another bicycle\nand put it quickly on his bicycle and so that he is back, yeah. It was some -- I -- I sa -- I don\u2019t\nknow a bicycle, but he had a shock that something was stolen from the bike. No, but he came\nhome every evening.",
        "Q: Do you think that he knew what was happening to Jews and did you know what was\nhappening to Jews in Poland at this time?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think that he did know. We didn\u2019t talk about that.",

        "A: No, not -- not at all, not a bit. I don\u2019t think that he did know.",

I was afraid as often as I entered a restaurant or something,\nbecause people were going around so much in the war. But I -- we didn\u2019t ta-talk about that.",
        "Q: So how did you get the marriage papers, since you couldn\u2019t produce anything?",
        "A: The marriage, as o -- I -- I had -- Peppy had, actually -- for the Red Cross, I did already, in --\nprove that I am Aryan, I did it. And, at that time, I have learned by heart my -- my grandparents\nand so forth, so -- so well, that when I came to that establishment, it was a lady in a -- in a palace\nor something and I enrolled for the Red Cross, she made a remark that it\u2019s exceptionally how\nwell I am a -- how well I know my grandparents, because she made a remark about it.",
        "Q: So that was dangerous.",
        "A: Yeah, yes. It is such [indecipherable]. And so I had these papers, I had these papers, what he -\n- and now, as a -- when I went to -- to the register office, I -- I only went because I was pregnant\nand I wanted to preg a -- pregnant, I wanted a baby and he didn\u2019t want -- I did -- I wanted an\nillegitimate baby, because I didn\u2019t want to get married, but he found that he doesn\u2019t want to be a\nfather of an illegitimate baby. Maybe the membership of the Nazi party or something, and so he -\n- he insisted we must get married. And you -- he was not so afraid. I was more afraid, but I sis --\nand took my papers and went to the register office and he looked at my papers and said, \u201cYou\nhaven\u2019t any papers from your mother.\u201d And becau -- I said, \u201cYes, my mother was from white\nRussia and I could not get any papers from Russia now, in -- during the war. He said, \u201cYeah, but\nshe could have been a Jew.\u201d Imagine. And I was standing there, then he dropped everything and\nhe looked interesting in my face -- face. I was sitting -- when you see it, he was in front of the\ndesk and I was sitting on this side. And he dropped everything. I don\u2019t know how -- I -- I can\u2019t\ntell you how long he looked at my face and then he said, \u201cIt is to see that your mother wasn\u2019t\nJewish.\u201d",

When I think of that, in the middle of\nNazi Germany -- when I went home, I was laughing all the time. I couldn\u2019t -- he says, you -- you\nget --",
        "Q: Was Werner with you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So you were alone when you were with this man?",
        "A: Yeah. And I didn\u2019t tell him about this, no, no. I said we can get married. I didn\u2019t tell him\nabout that, no.",

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So you were convinced by Werner to get married at this point?",
        "A: Yes. I -- I -- we -- we got married and I was very nervous at the wedding. I don't know\nanything about the wedding, I was so afraid I\u2019d sign unconsciously, the wrong name. I had to\nsign my real, Christina Maria Marguerita Denner and was so afraid, that I don\u2019t know anything.\nHilda Shlagel and her husband were my witnesses and -- now afterwards, we had a meal and\nnothing else.",
        "Q: So just the four of you?",
        "A: Yes, of the four -- there were no other guests or anything.",
        "Q: And how many months pregnant were you by then?",
        "A: Hm?",

I had -- when I was young, the doctor told\nme I can\u2019t have a child because of my heart condition, 1n Vienna, when I was 16. I had forgotten\nabout it and -- but I had to take pills for the heart during my pregnancy. | had to take pills.",
        "Q: So did that heart condition affect you when you were working? It didn\u2019t, did it? In the camps?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I had to work. Nobody ask if I have a condi -- heart condition or not.",
        "Q: So, how was it after you got married to Werner? Things were fine?",
        "A: Things were fine, yes. When I was pregnant, I could s-stay home, then. As soon as it was -- I\nnever went to a doctor any more and -- and I had no -- no doctor there, I wa -- felt fine. It was a\nhap -- a happy time in a way. I was waiting for her and I didn\u2019t work and was only at home.",

        "Q: So you had wanted a child for a long time, I gather?",

        "Q: So, you didn\u2019t have a doctor. So what happened the evening that you felt your labor pains?\nYou -- you said you played chess?",
        "A: Oh, he -- he -- he took the lexicon -- the convers -- co -- what you have and looked it up, what\nyou have when you have a labor pain and ask me if I have that and that and that -- what was\nwritten in -- in -- in the lexicon.

        "A: Yeah, this was now my -- yes, she was -- she was a nice baby. She was very good and she\nwas a -- people came to me and ask me h-how to bring up a baby, as if I were -- because she was\nsuch a good baby. Can\u2019t believe it. Above me, there was a woman, a -- a couple living, they\nwanted to adopt a child, but they were no Nazis, so they didn\u2019t get a child to -- for adoption, uh?\nAnd sh -- after Angela was about three months old, she came back with a baby, she had a baby.\nAnd this -- as a -- sh -- they were -- they are very devoted to the baby. As I have heard later on,\nthe father was a French prisoner and the mother was a German girl. And when our house was\nburned out in -- after the war, I was in office in the court, she came to me and she said to me,\nhow long to -- does she have to pr -- go to prison when it comes out, then? She had given her this\nchild, and it -- in another town, where she went, she gave different name, as a -- she said it is her\nchild, it wasn\u2019t hers. Because the Russians have all these mixed children from prisoners, have all\ntaking away. People who had children, who were already two or three years old, the Russian\ncollected all children and took all children away. And she had pretended that it 1s her child and\nnow she came to me and ask me how long she\u2019s -- she would have to go to prison when it comes\nout. And she said to me, \u201cThey can take everything what I have, again, but not this child.\u201d\u201d Now\nshe must be about -- over 50. I hope it never came out.",
        "Q: And how was Werner with the child?",

        "Q: Was he disappointed that it wasn\u2019t a boy?",
        "A: Yeah. He was in -- disappointed, he wanted -- because he had a girl. He loved his girl, and he\nwrote to her and -- but he was disappointed. He wanted a boy and he -- he -- the boy should be\nnamed Klaus. But it wasn\u2019t.",

        "A: Yeah, she wa -- came to me ev -- holiday.",
        "Q: And what was --",
        "A: She was six months in my hou -- six weeks in my house. Yes, she came to me and -- and we -\n- at the age of four.",

        "Q: How does the war end for you? What happens at the end, 1945?",
        "A: 1945 I was -- I -- I li -- m-my house, my flat was on the end of Brandenborg and they sent in\nto defend Brandenborg, Russians. Yes, Russian sol -- from these Russian brigade. They were\nmore afraid -- I wasn\u2019t afraid of the Russian. They were more afraid than the Germans, they were\n-- of the Russians. And they came into the flats -- not in front of it. And then the SS came and\nwith pis -- and with the pistol in the hands, they force him to go out again. But in the end they\ntook these people away and -- and then there was -- so we were in the cellar or everywhere --\neverywhere and I think I was the only one who was asleep, because I was not so afraid as the\nothers -- the others. They told us -- I didn\u2019t believe all the propaganda, even what we sa -- what\nwas true, I didn\u2019t believe any word the Nazis said of all the rapes and all, I didn\u2019t believe it. And\nthen it -- I was in the -- in the house and the artillery -- the Russian artillery, shot aw-away the ha\n-- the roof. And in the end, German soldiers came in -- this was in the night already and said we\nall have to go out and have to run away. Then I put my baby into the pram and ran with the\nothers, because -- and the -- the -- the bridges were already prepared for -- for blasting -- for\nexplosion. And this was the last what I have seen of my house and then I was running and in the\nend I ended up in a barn somewhere, I don\u2019t know which -- which [indecipherable] and I noticed\nthat my daughter has measles. We\u2019re -- I was going from house to house and ask they should a ill\nchild let into a house, nobody let me. Nobody let me in. And in the end, this was a very small\nhouse, there were two women living and they let me in. And then I was with them, I was\nsleeping -- the child was in the pram -- at least they could make it dark, because with measles\nyou shouldn\u2019t have sunlight. No, and a doctor was not to think of. A-And -- and then Russian\nsoldiers were all streaming in -- everybody had a white -- a -- a -- a white flag already and\neverybody -- and they were streaming and they came to that house too and I made pancakes for\nthem. They found some eggs somewhere and they had a -- the-there were no electricity any\nmore, but they had a battery. They heard the last speech of they -- Dernis, who was the follow of\nHitler at that time and he said that people should follow the -- the rules of the -- of the allyearten,\nand Germany 1s like a ship which has lost his direction. He\u2019s -- this I do remember and -- and\nthen the German soldiers went to the east and -- and at that time, I -- I started to -- not to talk too\nfriendly of the Nazis, I suppose and the soldier took me away and said that it\u2019s still dangerous, I\nshouldn\u2019t talk in such way. As a -- a friendly soldier, and he warned me --",
        "Q: This was a German?",
        "A: It was a German. He warned me from the Germans. So I sa -- I shut up. And they went away\nto the west. They wanted to take me with them, actually, but I couldn\u2019t go with a ill child and\nthen there was nobody there and these two women went on her -- their bra -- on -- on their\nbicycles and went away, I was alone. Didn\u2019t want to receive -- to be alone, so I went to\nBrandenborg back with the baby. I met the first Russian soldiers in the wood, they didn\u2019t look at\nme and I didn\u2019t look at them. And I must say, I was never touched and never raped by a soldier. I\nwas -- I had a watch even, on my -- my -- on my wrist and it was not taken from me. As -- I was\nlucky again. And then I went into Brandenborg and here I had the worst experience of my life.\nThere we -- the way to -- into Brandenborg was over a deep, deep ditch and this -- the bridge\nover it was -- was bla -- exploded. There was a hole in the middle and this hole was filled with\nthe door -- with a -- a lavatory door, with a heart cut out. And I had to walk over this door -- over\nthis ditch with the pram. This is an experience what still was -- I -- I still cannot see any height or\nanything. This was a -- a terrible strain on me and I could --",
        "Q: And how deep -- it was a deep ditch?",
        "A: Yeah, the -- very deep. Very, very deep. Some -- somebody told me it\u2019s filled out now and\nvery deep ditch. Not only -- as 1t would be death. And -- and then I went to the place where I\nlived -- where I had been living, the house was burned out and in the cellar there was a small\nsuitcase where my real document was. And I wanted to get to that. And it was so hot still, that I\ncouldn\u2019t go in. I -- and a Russian soldier noticed that, that I tried and he went -- as I couldn\u2019t\nspeak, he went in for me and too -- and took out this suitcase for me. He could -- and so he was -\n- he noticed that I am fighting with the heat, because we were lying -- they had taken out of the\nrest of the houses, the mattresses, put it there and they were lying about and so I -- and 1n this\nsuitcase was a book, where in the book was my -- my exam paper of law and my identity card.",
        "Q: The real one?",
        "A: The real one. This was built in between -- Peppy had done it for me -- between the covers. As\no -- then I had that book and then I met a neighbor and we kept together. We see -- she was --\nhad a pram too, and was pregnant and had a -- a baby in a pram. And we met -- we didn\u2019t know\nwhere to go and we met our doctor. The -- the baby -- the children\u2019s doctor and she told us to go\nto a home of -- of chil -- a children\u2019s home, a Protestant children\u2019s home was there and so she\nknows that and we should go there. We went there and they took us in and we were of twos --\nwhat you have -- this were -- how do you call that in English? When you have somebody ill and\nyou put the bed o-on -- it was not a normal bed, it was just such -- for an -- for emergency. And\nthis too, they put in -- in the room behind the stage and we laid down -- were lying down there\nand the children were in the pram. And in the night -- and so I didn\u2019t think of -- of locking the\ndoor or anything and in the night drunk Russian soldiers came in and all the rooms where the\nlock was, they -- and they went -- they opened the door, but as it wasn\u2019t closed, it wasn\u2019t\nimportant. When it were closed, they would have broken in. But as it wasn\u2019t closed, it -- the door\nwent and -- I saw -- up and down and was moving. And we were holding hands all the night,\nuntil the Russian soldi -- until 1t was quiet. This was our night there. And then we decided not a\nsecond night in that place and we went away. And we went in the flat which was empty, where\nthe people had run away. The doors didn\u2019t close and the win -- windows didn\u2019t close, but this ul -\n- small things we didn\u2019t mind. And we were -- and we had no water, no gas, no electricity. I had\nto go for every drop of water, to a hydrant in the street somewhere away. And there we managed\nsomewhere to survive. I don\u2019t know what we ate at that time. There was no food at [inaudible]\non top of it. And she got in contact with her mother and may -- and moved to her mother and I\nwas staying on in that flat until the people came back who were living there. And we got -- they\nwere very thankful because I hadn\u2019t stolen anything. There was all intact the house, even their\nwatches and everything and I me -- ha -- they were very thankful that nothing was stolen. And I\nlived then with that people for a month. I was very friendly with their daughter and with the\nwoman had a gruder, because -- I don\u2019t know if you know that -- this is a -- an oven, what in\nGermany, it is -- this is a long -- an oven where they have coke. And this is glowing. And you --\nto -- to cook something there, you need hours. But the woman who -- of the house, she didn\u2019t\nwant me in the kitchen, she did all the cooking for me and did everything. She didn\u2019t want -- she\ndidn\u2019t want to be disturbed, was an elderly woman there, was good, we sat up in there. I\u2019ve --\nhad been living for months with them. And sometimes they gave me an egg -- egg or something\nfor the baby. And then I moved into a-an empty house, where the people had run away. This was\nnot directly in Brandenborg, it was in a suburb of Brandenborg, in the -- on the gerdin. And he --\nI was living there and then in -- in September, half a year after the war, I applied for a job at the\ncourt. They were very glad to see me and to receive me. And because the Russians didn\u2019t allow\nNazi to be judges or something. And then I was living in that house for quite a time and then the\npeople came back. And according to th -- how it was at that time, I could have stayed in the\nhouse, but I didn\u2019t want -- I didn\u2019t forget what happened to us. I -- I moved out of the house, left\neverything. And I couldn\u2019t -- I -- I -- I couldn\u2019t be with Angela at once, and Angela went to the\npeople -- to a woman -- to a couple who was -- was looking after her when I was working then.\nAnd I was working in -- was living in a room in th -- in the courthouse and there was with the\npeople who were looking after the house, I was living with them. So it was about two months\nuntil I got the fred what I had then. And what I managed that -- to have. And then, after a time --\nand so it was empty, but people helped me to furnish it. It was very nicely furnished already.\nAnd then I --",
        "Q: Can you tell me about your work?",
        "A: Huh? I was working all the time in that time. From I -- I worked from September \u201845, I\nworked as a -- at the court.",
        "Q: Even without a law degree?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Even without the degree?",
        "A: I had -- I had -- according to German law, I had a better degree than in Austria. Because they\ndidn\u2019t ask the -- what we call the third examination. They didn\u2019t ask for -- to -- to make an\nexamination economy and inshta -- in -- in -- state in Constitutions and -- this was not asking in\nGermany. And af-after German law, they had to a -- a -- to adjust the Aus -- after the Anschluss,\nthey had to adjust the Austrian study and the German study. And I was better qualified --\nqualified in Germany than in Austria.",
        "Q: Now, did the Russians know who you really were? They -- they knew who you -- they knew -",
        "A: The Russians did. They -- at first they -- what I know -- they were examining my -- my past,\nif I had worked with the Nazis or not. My -- my past was -- was gloofsy and people told me that\nthere were -- that they were interviewed about me and then they were -- as a -- I was working\nabout -- after the Nuremberg tria-trial, the Russians wanted me to judge the Nazis, what I didn\u2019t\nwant to do. And --",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: I was the only Jew there. Whatever I say would be wrong. At first they would say is too\nstrong an -- a -- a sentence or they would say it is too low a sentence. I want -- I says, whatever I\nsay, I had no confidence that my judgment would be accepted as ob-objective judgment. And\nthis is why I didn\u2019t want to do it. And because I had -- in the two years I worked there, I had no\nappellation against my sen -- any sentence of me. Not from the attorney and not from the people.\nThey were -- it was accepted. I was -- I -- I -- [ju -- I was working in criminal law. Civil law was\nnot very important at that time and I was working in family law and in youth. They -- 1-1n -- the\nyoungsters I didn\u2019t want to send into prison -- 16 years or something. They all were black\nmarketing -- black market things. So I -- I arranged -- I don\u2019t know if it was legal at that time,\nnow it is -- I didn\u2019t -- don\u2019t know -- I arranged that they have to work civ -- do civil work,\nbecause there was so much to do. And that they have so many hours to work. This was my\ninvention. I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know if it was legal. I -- I don\u2019t know. And -- and -- but I did it,\nbecause I didn\u2019t want the youngsters to send to prison. And they had to clean up the street and --\nand work with old people or something. The 16 and 17 years old. Only one came back to -- to the\ncourt. I suppose he will -- he has become a criminal, only one. And the Russians had 0 -- all the\nprison. So they were all free. Many who were freed went into prison again and one was a special\ncase. He established himself as a doctor and after the first accidents, the first deaths, it came out\nthat he isn\u2019t a doctor. And he was then -- came then to me and was put into prison again. I know\nhis mother came to me and said what a wonderful boy he was. And he escaped from prison and\nafter awhile, I got a letter from the west -- he escaped to the west, that he did the same there. He\nestablished himself in the west as a doctor, he had -- yes, and he was caught in the west and they\nask me what happened before. So I know it. This was -- was all in -- in the war. Yes, it -- when --\nwhen it came to it. And -- but I -- I -- I had never a question, I wasn\u2019t unsure, I had no sleepless\nnight about my cases and I liked it. I was -- I -- I was very happy in my profession.",
        "Q: You -- you defended one person who was brought up on a criminal charge, a woman who had",
        "A: Yeah, yes. She had murdered her three children. And she was once my patient 1n the hospital.\nAnd she was -- she had a very -- she told me all her stories when I was -- how brutal her husband\nwas to her. And she had -- in -- on the end of the war, murdered her three children, strangled\nthem and -- and wanted commit suicide, jumped into the river. And Russian soldiers saw it and\nsaved her and -- and put her out. And she got, she -- she -- she got sent -- an ex-officer, as a -- a -\n- a lawyer and when she heard that I am in the court, who did know her story, she ask the -- the\ndirector that I should defend her. And the other lawyer, for her sake, put down his -- his -- his\ncharge. And she - -and I -- and this was the only case. I was, at that time not -- not rikes-\nrikesflaga, that I was defend -- as a -- and I played -- I had made a play toyae about her and she\ngot free. Because I didn\u2019t know her story so well. She -- she had told it to me before and she --\nshe got free, she was -- and actually, she was then working with a woman, a friend, with the\nchildren. And so it was a [indecipherable] -- 1t was the end of a very, very difficult life, what she\ndid, because she had a very brutal husband.",
        "Q: So what was your defense of her?",
        "A: What -- what I told her story and --",
        "Q: And they thought she shouldn\u2019t be punished?",

And I didn\u2019t write -- after awhile to anybody, because I know the le -- the letters are s -- I\ndidn\u2019t want to bring anybody in danger. This was my reason. And -- as 0 -- I had to come to a\npassport and then I rented in the end, a room in Berlin, what I was told by -- in -- in a British -- in\nthe British office and I applied for a passport there. And I ha -- I didn\u2019t need for that a -- a\ndocument of -- of the police, that I can come -- come through. Because it was forbidden, even for\nBerliners to come -- to lea -- to go back to Berlin.

And in\nEngland you cannot change a permit easily. It\u2019s not changed. And this -- and when I came to\nEngland then with my daughter, without luggage, because I didn\u2019t take anything. I had eve -- I\nhad not even a chane -- a dress to change. My brother-in-law was shocked that I am a refugee\nand cannot go -- he wanted me -- as -- a-actually his mother and his -- has said he should not\ninvite -- they should not invite me and they have sent me this visitor permit and it was a -- a very,\nvery big shock for them and he wanted me -- as 0 -- he said a-at first I am a liar, because I didn\u2019t\nwrite that -- how can I write that I am f-fleeing? I am a liar, a je -- an Englishman would never\nlie. This was -- yeah, he said it to me.

And -- and -- an MP -- a labor MP it was, who happened -- I don\u2019t\nknow how, about my story. And I was -- I came then in touch with the foreign people, I was then\nstaying with a cousin of mine and I came -- I don\u2019t know any more, how it all came about, I\ncame then in touch with a Dr. Davis a -- a -- a -- a late doctor, in Stamford Hill and this -- this\nlabor MP, the letter I got is in the documents, he wrote to me when -- when she has difficulty\nwith me to get the working -- is very difficult to chern -- to -- to change a visitor permit into a\nworking permit, when -- if she has difficulties, they should turn to him. He would do it. And\naccording -- when I showed that letter to the police in Piccadilly, those foreign police, I got some\nper-permission to work -- a working permission. And I was then working with -- staying with\nthis doctor and I could have stayed there for years, but I was staying for months, many months\nand she aray -- Angela went there to school in -- and she [indecipherable], she was anti-doctor\nand she went into her bed in the morning, Angela and she had no social life at all, only family\nlife. She was living with her mother. And the reason for me to leave was that I didn\u2019t hear an\nEnglish word. I couldn\u2019t stay forever. She spoke Yiddish with her mother and her mother\ncouldn\u2019t speak a word of English, they were from Romania. Her wather was one of the directors\nof Sch-Schtettna, you know this firm? This 1s a publicating firm, I think, a big one. And he was a\ndirector. And -- but I didn\u2019t meet -- and a brother of her had a hat factory in Manchester. And so\nI -- and I was treated there very nicely. I didn\u2019t want -- as a maid, I didn\u2019t want to go in when she\nhad visitor, but she said when I don\u2019t go in, she stays with me in the kitchen -- the doctor. And so\nI was really very nicely treated in that house. And -- but then in the end I decided I have to f-find\na way to -- to -- to do some Engl -- learn some English. And I put an advertisement in the Times,\nas I made it out to -- after I saw advertisement, I don\u2019t know it was the Times or the Telegraph.\nAnd a -- a -- a lady answered and it was -- the lady -- had more answers, but I couldn\u2019t -- some\npeople ha -- were living abroa -- outside, where there was no school nearby. I couldn\u2019t go to a\nplace where there was no school. And one lady -- I had an interview, it was the sister-in-law of\nAntony Eden. It was the wife of Sir Timothy Eden. And she had a school in England and --\nIdlan, and a school in Southampton. And she wanted me -- she was an Austrian and she of course\nexpected that every Austrian is a perfect cook and she wanted me to cook for her school in\nSouthampton. And there were 24 pupils in the school and I accepted. Not that I was a cook, but I\nhad a cookery book in Austrian for -- what a -- somebody gave me and you wouldn\u2019t believe it,\nbut they liked my cooking, because the girls had never eaten -- I su -- I suppose an Austrian\nwould have thrown me out nex-next day, but they -- but these girls in the school had never eaten\nmy cook -- Austrian cooking and they liked it. The kinerl and all this what I\u2019d -- I -- I so -- I\nstarted se -- very exactly the cookery book, every day and it was successful. I was there for quite\na time, I don\u2019t know any more how long. Angela was taken into the school and was exactly\ntreated, we -- like any other girl, there was no difference. They were very -- she -- I bought the\nuniform for her and she was bathed and washed by the matron. And the matron put her to bed, as\na -- I must say, I -- there were no difference at all to any other girl in the school, she was -- when\nshe was there. And in the end, I went back to -- to London.

This was the daughter\nof the British am-ambassador in Norway. But they were very -- they had a house in Kensington.\nI had one s-sh -- I had only working permission for a housemaid. I couldn\u2019t do anything else.\nAnd she engaged me as housemaid, but she didn\u2019t pay me. They were -- they hadn\u2019t any money,\nactually.

The state was only half a year old, you did need an\ninvitation. So I sent a telegram to Mimi, she should send me the invitation, but she didn\u2019t answer.\nShe didn\u2019t want -- she was always jealous of me and she didn\u2019t want me in Israel. And she didn\u2019t\nsend me the invitation so I could go. Later on, years later, I was very lonely. M-My life in Israel\nwould have been easier, because I wouldn\u2019t -- I would have joined a kibbutz and I would not\nhave been so lonely, with no English and bound with -- in the job, with a child. You couldn\u2019t go\nout anywhere. I would not -- and later on, once Angela was at school and was on holiday, I\nthought I go to Israel in a fortnight whe -- when she is in England in -- on holiday in the summer.\nAnd I wrote my sister that I want to come. And her answer was not, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to see\nyou.\u201d Her answer was, \u201cDon\u2019t give up your job.\u201d And so she was afraid now, I don\u2019t know what\nHansie has written -- that I would come and be in -- something -- so I didn\u2019t go. This was the end\nof my visit, I didn\u2019t go. I didn\u2019t see her. And -- and so I -- I was staying in -- in London and was\nworking at -- Angela was -- it was a difficulty where to live. She was in different school, in four\ndifferent school and in England at that time, I don\u2019t know if you know, they made the 11 plus.\nThis was with 11 -- at the age of 11, every child had to make an exam. If they get -- if they are\nready for grammar school. And she was in four different schools and she -- and in the end she\nwas in the Solomon Wolfser school and there were 28 pupils and only four passed the exam. And\nshe was one of the four. When she rang me up in my business, she passed, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I\nrang up at first somebody else if it\u2019s true that she passed. And then I left everything and -- and so\nshe could go to grammar school. She want -- won a -- a scholarship for a grammar school and\nshe was taken by -- by the Burlington School. This is a very old school with a good name and it\nwas -- this is where she told -- she had an interview where she told she sees her father every two\nyears.

And it was -- she_ then -- she was in Copdory and she made -- actually I\u2019m --\nI sent her after the O levels in an academic exchange to Germany. She made A level in Germany,\nthat she should learn German properly, because she couldn\u2019t speak German properly and this is\nwhere she met her future husband.

        "Q: Years later?",
        "A: Yes. I don\u2019t know exactly when it was. And consciously, to sit down and talk to her, I never\ndid, no. It came slowly. But I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t wan -- I wanted her -- sh-she had enough\nto put up with, I wanted her to grow up as a normal, English girl, not -- at the beginning she\nmixed up Austria and Australia.

        "Q: But your daughter felt as -- he was her father?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So this was very important for her?",
        "A: Yes. I know -- when he was so ill, I didn\u2019t want her to go to see him, because I had tell -- told\nhim stories. I didn\u2019t want that he knows that he\u2019s so ill. I didn\u2019t -- I -- I -- I said to -- it was a-\nabout Christmas time and I could go into the hospital at any time, because he was on the danger\nlist. I didn\u2019t want him to know that, that he\u2019s on the danger list. I said always, I -- I sneaked in to\nthe hospital, because they are pre-preparing for Christmas. And I didn\u2019t want that Angela would\n-- me -- would -- would to -- take -- talk silly things. So I left her and then she was -- as 0 --\nstricken, she was crying. I -- I don\u2019t want her to see her father. She was very, very upset. But for\nme it was a reason. I didn\u2019t want her to -- to say something what make him think of it. But he\nwas very, very ill.",
        "Q: And then, when he died, you decided to change your life?",
        "A: No, [had to. I had to. I was living in the house with -- three bedroom house with three double\nbedrooms, a garden in front and what should I do in that house? And I had the feeling -- I\ncouldn\u2019t sit in the sitting room after -- after he was dead, without him. You live in the sitting\nroom and to sit alone, it was terrible. I never went into -- I never went -- looked at television and\nwent into the sitting room and then I decide -- as I had to -- to sell the house, in any case. It did\nneed a time until it got the probate. It was -- was all in his name. A year I did need to get the\nprobate. And then I decided that -- to give up the house. And now where to go was the problem.\nAnd then, I so -- I could -- cannot drive a car and London was a difficult place to be -- Angela\nwas not living in London at that time and so I went to Israel, as -- I found that is the natural place\nfor me. And I was ha-half -- and I li -- I wanted to live in a smaller place, as I cannot drive a car,\nwhere I can walk to some -- where I can walk. And in -- in London, I was all -- when I went to\nsee somebody, was an hour on the underground. When -- do you know London? Yeah, then you\ndo, that you can imagine, I -- I was from Edgeware, this is in the north. I was always on the\nunderground. And then I gave up to meet somebody, because of the journey. And so I wanted to\nlive in a small place. I hoped -- I was afraid of the language and I hoped I will learn it, as a -- at\nthe beginning I was better, but I lost a little since I have cable television. I cannot make up my\nmind to -- to put it off, the English and to listen to the Hebrew, where I understand only partly.\nAnd this is the death of my Hebrew, the -- the cable television.",
        "Q: The cable.",
        "A: What? Can you imagine?",

        "Q: I mean your second.",
        "A: I -- so, yeah. I -- no, I -- I was not in regular contact, but when I was in Vienna, I visited him.\nHe didn\u2019t know -- he got to know my husband and -- and -- but I wasn\u2019t -- and I did know his\nwife, but it was not a regular -- not anything as it was before, not anything.",
        "Q: But when did you get the letters that you had written to him? It was after he married?",
        "A: Yeah, yes, h-he was a -- yes, it -- he was already mar -- I didn\u2019t go so early to -- to Vienna\nagain and I -- he was already married and then I ask him to -- to have it back.",
        "Q: And why did you ask him?",
        "A: I tell you, I di-didn\u2019t want that his wife is reading my love letters. This was the reason, not --\nnot -- no other reason and I said -- and he didn -- he said he wants to keep them so long he -- as\nlong as he\u2019s alive. Noneday I mention when he had something happen to him, she would put it in\nthe mill -- millima when she sees -- when she sees what that is.",
        "Q: So if he had not gotten married, we never would -- we might not have these letters.",
        "A: Yeah, may [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t know. What have -- would have -- but you can imagine\nthat I felt that this part of my life is now in his ha -- ha -- in -- in her hands, in the end. And so,\nthis was the reason, I didn\u2019t think of the histor -- historical value at that time. And so -- and then\nhe gave it to me and I -- I took it home and put it in a drawer and didn\u2019t talk about it.",
        "Q: Did you look at them?",
        "A: No.",

        "A: No, I didn -- I -- I don\u2019t know -- as -- it happened then, when I -- when I sold the house and\nwhen I -- and I had some -- wh-when did I give? I think I had some in Israel and then I was\nthinking what happens -- I can -- I -- \u2019'm e -- not immortal, I noticed. And so, if somebody ha-\nhappened to me, they would throw these letters away, too. In German, 1n small, you see how\nsmall the papers in [indecipherable] who -- whoever will read that. And then I gave it to Angela.\nI thought this is the only place -- and so she may be interested one day. And so it came. She put it\nin a Safe at first and -- and -- and so it came, I gave it to her -- as I gave her some of my jewelry.\nI gave her not only that ac -- she had -- has my jewelry as well. I gave it to her.",

But late\n-- the most of the time, my mother grew up in Shtockerau, this is a little town near Vienna, where\nmy grandparents had a shop.

        "A: My -- my father had learned to be -- he was the youngest of nine children in a village and\nwhen -- the older children were sent to school, but when he was growing up, he was sent to -- to\n-- to a -- to learn to be a -- a kilner -- as a -- a waiter. And I -- and he -- later on, when he had\nfinished his time to learn, he went to Nitsa, to the Riviera and to Francesbath and Karlsbath,\nthese are baths in -- 1n Czechoslovaki -- to -- to work. And then he worked in Vienna and s --\nafter the war -- and he was a soldier then, in the first World War. He was an invalid. He was --\nhis right shoulder was broken in the war and he could never lift his right hand any more. He was\nan invalid. But he came back -- he was a prisoner in Russia, but he came back half a year before\nthe war ended. He escaped. And when he escaped, back home -- this was in spring 1918, he\ncame back. I do remember that. I was four years old, yes, because I had to learn a -- a poem to\nsay to him. This was -- and had flowers in my hand and was four years old and I didn\u2019t know\nactu -- actually was -- what a father was. My mother told me -- was always talking about the\nPapa and she told me that one day I came home from the park and said, a child has said to a mum\n-- to aman, \u201cPapa,\u201d and it was for me -- as -- as -- I don\u2019t know what I imagined a Papa is.

Because now I -- I still remember that my teacher ask me few times which\nlanga -- language we are speaking at home. My parents couldn\u2019t speak -- only German -- they\ncouldn\u2019t speak a foreign language, but I suppose she expected Yiddish or Polnish. And -- and at\nthat time, I didn\u2019t connect this with anti-Semitisms, but now I know. And then another thing,\nwhat I didn\u2019t understand at that time, was -- I had, in every subject the best mark, one -- it was a\none. Only in German, I had a -- a bad -- a -- a -- a two. This is not such a good mark. And when I\ncame to the gimnasium, this was in -- in -- in -- in the school as a -- when I came to the\ngimnasium, I never had anything else than -- than very good. And my abbietour is even -- I wrote\non very good. S-So I can\u2019t believe that my German, as a child, was so bad that I had a -- I\ndeserved a -- a -- a bad mark.

This is -- I was then in -- up -- up to\n14, I was in a girl\u2019s school, because I didn\u2019t go to the gimnasium at 11, and actually I was in the\nnormal school what ended at 14. And in the restaurant there was a professor who liked to talk to\nus. Usually we were not allowed to talk to the guests, but he wa -- talked to us and he told my\nparents, or my father, he should let me start there. This was -- it was in -- Schpitzer was his\nname. It was a sectione [indecipherable] technical high school -- so in the techn -- techn -- in\nVienna. And then -- after 14, I came to the gimnasi -- into the gimnasium. And up to 14, there\nwere only girls. We were not allowed to play with boys, or anything, no. I suppose my father, in\na restaurant, has seen too much, so he tried to be sure that his girls are kept properly. And wh-\nwhen I came to the other school, this was a special class for peop -- for girls -- as a -- for\nchildren, who come from this normal -- from this school -- from this -- to the gimnasium. And\nthis was 1n a boy\u2019s school, in this class. We were only -- the only girls among 500 boys.

And I was only -- every weekend -- I was only allowed to go every\nfortnight. Every -- every week was for my father too much. And I was only every fortnight\nallowed to go. And in -- in this asa socialistition middulshula pund there were from other\nschools, too, and girls and boys.

And I know once, this man sold him, as a book -- gaves\nhim some tickets for a picture that -- and when it came to that, my parents didn\u2019t want to go. And\nthen they said we should go. And we went, my -- my sister and I, we went to -- to that place.\nThis was in Weedenhopstrassie, where -- where we went. And then we had -- at first had, and --\nand when they saw new people coming, and those three boys -- three young men, accompanied\nus at home, walked us home. And then we got -- come in touch with them, through that. There\nwas -- the leader of the group was Bruno Kaiska. It was in his district. He had been living in the\nsame district, his family, as I grew up.",
        "A: Hansie was much younger and she was very spoiled, because my father hadn\u2019t seen bringing\nus up. She was the only one he had seen grown -- growing up, because at -- at that time he was\naw-away, as a soldier. And she was very spoiled and I had to -- in -- later on, a very good\nrelationship to her. She was nearer to me than my other sister. And when it -- when she had\nsomewhere to go, 1t was always me who had -- who -- who went with her and so on. We had a\nvery good relationship.",
        "A: Not s -- not so much, no. No, only later, because, as I told you, we were under s -- very strict\ncontrol. My mother controlled the books we had read, yes. We were very, very strictly brought\nup. And as a -- I couldn\u2019t choose many. I sa -- I was reading in the restaurant. We had what they\ncalled salated sipter as a -- and in the restaurant I wrote the newspapers, all newspapers, in -- and\n-- and this [indecipherable] was, these were magazines, who were changed regularly, for the\nrestaurant and th-this I read. And I know -- I had not -- no proper children\u2019s book or something,\nbecause only that. And I know at school we were then ask once, to -- what we have read, to\nwrite. And I wrote about a book I have read. This was the -- the -- the fourlits taleebee\ndershernotfa airtrabbit. This means the last laugh of the beautiful airtrabbit. So airtrabbit mea --\nis Hungar -- which is --means Elizabeth. And my teacher called me and said I should read\ndifferent books, because is -- she didn\u2019t find it as proper as I -- what I have written, yeah. And\nthis I do remember. And then I got -- so later on I got -- I was a very avid reader then, later on.\nThis was a secret domain, what I wanted to explore.",
        "A: I met him -- I have -- I -- he was in same group, but he didn\u2019t impress me at all. And he -- we\nhad every -- ev -- at -- at my school, in the grammar school, we had every year a ball, on the day\nwhen we got the half te -- when the end of that term was. And at that ball, he was and he said he\ndanced with me, but he didn\u2019t impress me at all. I didn\u2019t kn -- didn\u2019t even know it, that he had\ndanced with me.",

        "A: Yeah and -- and when I -- I was very, very happy girl, I loved school, I didn\u2019t work at school.\nI ha -- I -- I was not -- not a hard worker, I -- I didn\u2019t work at all, I think. I -- I -- I -- it was more\nentertainment that work, this school. And I went out with boys. Not only with one, with that and\nthat and that. And was very happy with it. And my mother was not in Vienna and she had written\nonce to me, I should buy something for her and send it to her. And I went with a boy to -- to that\nshop in -- in Vienna. This was not -- it was a friend. I went out with -- with Peppy and with his\nfriend and didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t mean to me and I went out with him. This was in the afternoon. I got\nwet, it was -- started to rain and he took me to his mother, to dry me. And she dried me, offered\nme strawberries with cream and the gramophone was put up and we were dancing and it was\nvery ca -- very nice afternoon. But in the evening, in the same day, it -- I had a date with Peppy,\nhis friend. And I -- I didn\u2019t take it ser -- I didn\u2019t want to go away. I liked the dancing and I left\nhim. I didn\u2019t go. And he was waiting for me. It was at eight o\u2019clock. And I didn\u2019t come. So he\nwent to his friend. And he appeared there. When -- he danced with me and told me off, when he -\n- wh -- during the dance, because I didn\u2019t come to the date. And -- and so it-- it was a hap -- very\nhap -- and so I -- it was nothing special. And Wolfgang, the other -- names in the -- name of the\nother was Wolfgang and Wolfgang walked me home, but Peppy had -- could not walk me home\nbecause he had always to be at 10 o\u2019clock home and with his mother. His mother was -- as --\ndidn\u2019t -- this was -- and -- and then these two young men said, \u201cI am going out with -- with her.\u201d\nThe one said and the other said. And once I had a date with one and a third one came, with a\nletter -- I should choose between the two. This letter happened to be there. This -- this was\nWerner Felner, it was a third one from the group. And -- and then I choose, not Peppy, I choose\nWolfgang. And -- but I was not seriously interested to go out with him. And I went then on\nholiday to San Kilton and didn\u2019t write any more. This is -- 1t was -- it -- 1t -- it was ver -- it was\nnothing serious. And there, so it dropped up and a year later, or something, I -- I am got -- once I\ngot -- I had to go to -- I wanted to go to the national library, I was writing an essay for school.\nAnd Peppy offered me to -- to show me the ropes in the library. It\u2019s a national library, where I\nhadn\u2019t been before. And he went with me and at that -- at that excursion we -- I should, of course\nha -- have my sister on my side and had -- have to meet her, but we didn\u2019t -- we let her -- let her\nand I didn\u2019t come to the national library and this was the beginning of -- of the relationship. He\nwas -- as of we -- we were -- I didn\u2019t go to the national li-library and I didn\u2019t see the ropes and\nwe were talking and this was the beginning of our relationship. And my sister, I left.",
        "A: Yeah. And she was complaining. She was very, very -- I -- I mean it was a mad idea to --\nalways to have my sister on my side. We -- sometimes when we -- she came home, she\ncomplained to my mother that -- that our talk was not all right. She -- we were talking about the -\n- both -- all high school students, about different subjects, where she couldn\u2019t join in and she\ncomplained to my mother.

        "A: Yeah, we heard the -- we heard about it, of course we heard and all that, that Hitler had -- had\ntaken over, but 1t was somewhere very away. As we -- we did not expect to -- to be mixed up\nwith it. We heard at that time --Thomas Mann came from -- from Germany, and he had a talk in -\n- in Vienna. It was a -- a closed talk. It was for members of the Socialist party, as all the talk, but\nI don\u2019t know how I got a ticket, but I had one and I know he started with the way -- with the\nwords, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the evening f-for you means,\u201d Evast evostat vas der a verseebadoit,\nthat for -- for you means, \u201cbut for me it means more.\u201d Famil fermish it itboided mere.

        "A: Yes, I did. No, of course ammen -- as somebody who 1s interested in things, I was used to\nlook into books. And I read not only the Kampf. I read Will Rosenberg too. This was a racial -- a\nracialist books.",
        "A: I have read that, too. Although the Kampf was for me so vulgar. Even the language. I love\nGerman and I -- it was very, very, I -- as I loved the language very, very much at that time and I\nha --was widely read at that time and the -- the -- the writing, the German only, even the\nlanguage, it was so vulgar.

Not only -- even when you -- objective -- not as a Jew,\neven when you objective, to go to the -- and -- and funny enough, I have read -- later now -- a\nbook by Gola Mann, this is the son of Thomas Mann. It -- it is called, \u201cAn Yugen -- Youth in\nGermany\u201d. And in that book, he had the same, this -- he wrote about the Kampf too and he wrote\nabout the same.

Didn\u2019t want to receive -- to be alone, so I went to\nBrandenborg back with the baby. I met the first Russian soldiers in the wood, they didn\u2019t look at\nme and I didn\u2019t look at them. And I must say, I was never touched and never raped by a soldier. I\nwas -- I had a watch even, on my -- my -- on my wrist and it was not taken from me. As -- I was\nlucky again. And then I went into Brandenborg and here I had the worst experience of my life.\nThere we -- the way to -- into Brandenborg was over a deep, deep ditch and this -- the bridge\nover it was -- was bla -- exploded. There was a hole in the middle and this hole was filled with\nthe door -- with a -- a lavatory door, with a heart cut out. And I had to walk over this door -- over\nthis ditch with the pram. This is an experience what still was -- I -- I still cannot see any height or\nanything. This was a -- a terrible strain on me and I could --",
        "A: Yeah, the -- very deep. Very, very deep. Some -- somebody told me it\u2019s filled out now and\nvery deep ditch. Not only -- as 1t would be death. And -- and then I went to the place where I\nlived -- where I had been living, the house was burned out and in the cellar there was a small\nsuitcase where my real document was. And I wanted to get to that. And it was so hot still, that I\ncouldn\u2019t go in. I -- and a Russian soldier noticed that, that I tried and he went -- as I couldn\u2019t\nspeak, he went in for me and too -- and took out this suitcase for me. He could -- and so he was -\n- he noticed that I am fighting with the heat, because we were lying -- they had taken out of the\nrest of the houses, the mattresses, put it there and they were lying about and so I -- and 1n this\nsuitcase was a book, where in the book was my -- my exam paper of law and my identity card.",
        "A: The real one. This was built in between -- Peppy had done it for me -- between the covers. As\no -- then I had that book and then I met a neighbor and we kept together. We see -- she was --\nhad a pram too, and was pregnant and had a -- a baby in a pram. And we met -- we didn\u2019t know\nwhere to go and we met our doctor. The -- the baby -- the children\u2019s doctor and she told us to go\nto a home of -- of chil -- a children\u2019s home, a Protestant children\u2019s home was there and so she\nknows that and we should go there. We went there and they took us in and we were of twos --\nwhat you have -- this were -- how do you call that in English? When you have somebody ill and\nyou put the bed o-on -- it was not a normal bed, it was just such -- for an -- for emergency. And\nthis too, they put in -- in the room behind the stage and we laid down -- were lying down there\nand the children were in the pram. And in the night -- and so I didn\u2019t think of -- of locking the\ndoor or anything and in the night drunk Russian soldiers came in and all the rooms where the\nlock was, they -- and they went -- they opened the door, but as it wasn\u2019t closed, it wasn\u2019t\nimportant. When it were closed, they would have broken in. But as it wasn\u2019t closed, it -- the door\nwent and -- I saw -- up and down and was moving. And we were holding hands all the night,\nuntil the Russian soldi -- until 1t was quiet. This was our night there. And then we decided not a\nsecond night in that place and we went away. And we went in the flat which was empty, where\nthe people had run away. The doors didn\u2019t close and the win -- windows didn\u2019t close, but this ul -\n- small things we didn\u2019t mind. And we were -- and we had no water, no gas, no electricity. I had\nto go for every drop of water, to a hydrant in the street somewhere away. And there we managed\nsomewhere to survive. I don\u2019t know what we ate at that time. There was no food at [inaudible]\non top of it. And she got in contact with her mother and may -- and moved to her mother and I\nwas staying on in that flat until the people came back who were living there. And we got -- they\nwere very thankful because I hadn\u2019t stolen anything. There was all intact the house, even their\nwatches and everything and I me -- ha -- they were very thankful that nothing was stolen. And I\nlived then with that people for a month. I was very friendly with their daughter and with the\nwoman had a gruder, because -- I don\u2019t know if you know that -- this is a -- an oven, what in\nGermany, it is -- this is a long -- an oven where they have coke. And this is glowing. And you --\nto -- to cook something there, you need hours. But the woman who -- of the house, she didn\u2019t\nwant me in the kitchen, she did all the cooking for me and did everything. She didn\u2019t want -- she\ndidn\u2019t want to be disturbed, was an elderly woman there, was good, we sat up in there. I\u2019ve --\nhad been living for months with them. And sometimes they gave me an egg -- egg or something\nfor the baby. And then I moved into a-an empty house, where the people had run away. This was\nnot directly in Brandenborg, it was in a suburb of Brandenborg, in the -- on the gerdin. And he --\nI was living there and then in -- in September, half a year after the war, I applied for a job at the\ncourt. They were very glad to see me and to receive me. And because the Russians didn\u2019t allow\nNazi to be judges or something. And then I was living in that house for quite a time and then the\npeople came back. And according to th -- how it was at that time, I could have stayed in the\nhouse, but I didn\u2019t want -- I didn\u2019t forget what happened to us. I -- I moved out of the house, left\neverything. And I couldn\u2019t -- I -- I -- I couldn\u2019t be with Angela at once, and Angela went to the\npeople -- to a woman -- to a couple who was -- was looking after her when I was working then.\nAnd I was working in -- was living in a room in th -- in the courthouse and there was with the\npeople who were looking after the house, I was living with them. So it was about two months\nuntil I got the fred what I had then. And what I managed that -- to have. And then, after a time --\nand so it was empty, but people helped me to furnish it. It was very nicely furnished already.\nAnd then I --",
        "A: Huh? I was working all the time in that time. From I -- I worked from September \u201845, I\nworked as a -- at the court.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: I had -- I had -- according to German law, I had a better degree than in Austria. Because they\ndidn\u2019t ask the -- what we call the third examination. They didn\u2019t ask for -- to -- to make an\nexamination economy and inshta -- in -- in -- state in Constitutions and -- this was not asking in\nGermany. And af-after German law, they had to a -- a -- to adjust the Aus -- after the Anschluss,\nthey had to adjust the Austrian study and the German study. And I was better qualified --\nqualified in Germany than in Austria.",
        "A: The Russians did. They -- at first they -- what I know -- they were examining my -- my past,\nif I had worked with the Nazis or not. My -- my past was -- was gloofsy and people told me that\nthere were -- that they were interviewed about me and then they were -- as a -- I was working\nabout -- after the Nuremberg tria-trial, the Russians wanted me to judge the Nazis, what I didn\u2019t\nwant to do. And --",
        "A: I was the only Jew there. Whatever I say would be wrong. At first they would say is too\nstrong an -- a -- a sentence or they would say it is too low a sentence. I want -- I says, whatever I\nsay, I had no confidence that my judgment would be accepted as ob-objective judgment. And\nthis is why I didn\u2019t want to do it. And because I had -- in the two years I worked there, I had no\nappellation against my sen -- any sentence of me. Not from the attorney and not from the people.\nThey were -- it was accepted. I was -- I -- I -- [ju -- I was working in criminal law. Civil law was\nnot very important at that time and I was working in family law and in youth. They -- 1-1n -- the\nyoungsters I didn\u2019t want to send into prison -- 16 years or something. They all were black\nmarketing -- black market things. So I -- I arranged -- I don\u2019t know if it was legal at that time,\nnow it is -- I didn\u2019t -- don\u2019t know -- I arranged that they have to work civ -- do civil work,\nbecause there was so much to do. And that they have so many hours to work. This was my\ninvention. I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know if it was legal. I -- I don\u2019t know. And -- and -- but I did it,\nbecause I didn\u2019t want the youngsters to send to prison. And they had to clean up the street and --\nand work with old people or something. The 16 and 17 years old. Only one came back to -- to the\ncourt. I suppose he will -- he has become a criminal, only one. And the Russians had 0 -- all the\nprison. So they were all free. Many who were freed went into prison again and one was a special\ncase. He established himself as a doctor and after the first accidents, the first deaths, it came out\nthat he isn\u2019t a doctor. And he was then -- came then to me and was put into prison again. I know\nhis mother came to me and said what a wonderful boy he was. And he escaped from prison and\nafter awhile, I got a letter from the west -- he escaped to the west, that he did the same there. He\nestablished himself in the west as a doctor, he had -- yes, and he was caught in the west and they\nask me what happened before. So I know it. This was -- was all in -- in the war. Yes, it -- when --\nwhen it came to it. And -- but I -- I -- I had never a question, I wasn\u2019t unsure, I had no sleepless\nnight about my cases and I liked it.

And I was -- I came then in touch with the foreign people, I was then\nstaying with a cousin of mine and I came -- I don\u2019t know any more, how it all came about, I\ncame then in touch with a Dr. Davis a -- a -- a -- a late doctor, in Stamford Hill and this -- this\nlabor MP, the letter I got is in the documents, he wrote to me when -- when she has difficulty\nwith me to get the working -- is very difficult to chern -- to -- to change a visitor permit into a\nworking permit, when -- if she has difficulties, they should turn to him. He would do it. And\naccording -- when I showed that letter to the police in Piccadilly, those foreign police, I got some\nper-permission to work -- a working permission. And I was then working with -- staying with\nthis doctor and I could have stayed there for years, but I was staying for months, many months\nand she aray -- Angela went there to school in -- and she [indecipherable], she was anti-doctor\nand she went into her bed in the morning, Angela and she had no social life at all, only family\nlife. She was living with her mother. And the reason for me to leave was that I didn\u2019t hear an\nEnglish word. I couldn\u2019t stay forever. She spoke Yiddish with her mother and her mother\ncouldn\u2019t speak a word of English, they were from Romania. Her wather was one of the directors\nof Sch-Schtettna, you know this firm? This 1s a publicating firm, I think, a big one. And he was a\ndirector. And -- but I didn\u2019t meet -- and a brother of her had a hat factory in Manchester. And so\nI -- and I was treated there very nicely. I didn\u2019t want -- as a maid, I didn\u2019t want to go in when she\nhad visitor, but she said when I don\u2019t go in, she stays with me in the kitchen -- the doctor. And so\nI was really very nicely treated in that house. And -- but then in the end I decided I have to f-find\na way to -- to -- to do some Engl -- learn some English. And I put an advertisement in the Times,\nas I made it out to -- after I saw advertisement, I don\u2019t know it was the Times or the Telegraph.\nAnd a -- a -- a lady answered and it was -- the lady -- had more answers, but I couldn\u2019t -- some\npeople ha -- were living abroa -- outside, where there was no school nearby. I couldn\u2019t go to a\nplace where there was no school. And one lady -- I had an interview, it was the sister-in-law of\nAntony Eden. It was the wife of Sir Timothy Eden. And she had a school in England and --\nIdlan, and a school in Southampton. And she wanted me -- she was an Austrian and she of course\nexpected that every Austrian is a perfect cook and she wanted me to cook for her school in\nSouthampton. And there were 24 pupils in the school and I accepted. Not that I was a cook, but I\nhad a cookery book in Austrian for -- what a -- somebody gave me and you wouldn\u2019t believe it,\nbut they liked my cooking, because the girls had never eaten -- I su -- I suppose an Austrian\nwould have thrown me out nex-next day, but they -- but these girls in the school had never eaten\nmy cook -- Austrian cooking and they liked it. The kinerl and all this what I\u2019d -- I -- I so -- I\nstarted se -- very exactly the cookery book, every day and it was successful. I was there for quite\na time, I don\u2019t know any more how long. Angela was taken into the school and was exactly\ntreated, we -- like any other girl, there was no difference. They were very -- she -- I bought the\nuniform for her and she was bathed and washed by the matron. And the matron put her to bed, as\na -- I must say, I -- there were no difference at all to any other girl in the school, she was -- when\nshe was there. And in the end, I went back to -- to London. I was very lonely, of course and her -\n- her -- s-son of them, who was at that time a young man, he came from Eden and he was -- he\nwas living there. Now he is an MP in -- in the House of Parliament and the kitchen maid what\nthey had, was a Hungarian Baroness at that time, because they were the Russians and she came\nto London and was a 19 year old girl. She was working there and she was [indecipherable] a\nHungarian Baron -- aristocrat. And so -- in any case, then I went back to London with Angela\nand I went -- I could give -- I -- I -- I was working -- living in the house. This was the daughter\nof the British am-ambassador in Norway. But they were very -- they had a house in Kensington.\nI had one s-sh -- I had only working permission for a housemaid. I couldn\u2019t do anything else.\nAnd she engaged me as housemaid, but she didn\u2019t pay me. They were -- they hadn\u2019t any money,\nactually. He was studying at -- architecture, a young couple and I work -- went out to work, I\nworked illegal. People who -- who did surgical belts engaged me.",
        "A: Surgical belts.",
        "A: This is for people who have operations. They made -- and I came to that place and she said,\nyou ha -- toos -- to teach me s -- s -- with electric machine, to sew. And when I saw what she did,\nI said to her I can do the same what she did, she --and then I did the cutting out and was in\ncharge of the -- of -- of the room, because at that time, the health service was new in England and\nyou can only get the working permission if they haven\u2019t got any Englishmen to do the work, or\nEnglish women. And I was in -- and the cert -- in this business. The ba -- both was a Viennese. In\nthis business they didn\u2019t have workers, because it was so new, the health service. And so I got\nthe working permission. When I got the working permission on -- on -- in the labor exchange,\nshe was co -- ringing up other labor exchanges at first, if they have somebody for the job, but\nthey didn\u2019t. And so I got the working permission there. I did send the cutting out and fitting for\nsurgical belts and I went into hospitals to measure people and had -- there were eight people\nsewing these belts. And this I did for years, for many years there in -- in that job.",
        "A: No, I haven\u2019t heard from her for -- for years [inaudible]",
        "A: Yeah. I had a very loose -- sometime -- once -- as a -- actually, it was agreement that Angela\nstays with her until the school starts, because there was no school at that time and suddenly she\nrang me up, I must take Angela away at once from her, because her husband has an examination\nat the law school and when he doesn\u2019t pass, he will say Angela -- it\u2019s Angela\u2019s fault that he\ndoesn\u2019t. Yeah, 1-it -- this was -- he was horrible. And so I told it to the doctor and she said, \u201cTake\nit, she can come before the school starts.\u201d",

So I sent a telegram to Mimi, she should send me the invitation, but she didn\u2019t answer.\nShe didn\u2019t want -- she was always jealous of me and she didn\u2019t want me in Israel. And she didn\u2019t\nsend me the invitation so I could go. Later on, years later, I was very lonely. M-My life in Israel\nwould have been easier, because I wouldn\u2019t -- I would have joined a kibbutz and I would not\nhave been so lonely, with no English and bound with -- in the job, with a child. You couldn\u2019t go\nout anywhere. I would not -- and later on, once Angela was at school and was on holiday, I\nthought I go to Israel in a fortnight whe -- when she is in England in -- on holiday in the summer.\nAnd I wrote my sister that I want to come. And her answer was not, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to see\nyou.\u201d Her answer was, \u201cDon\u2019t give up your job.\u201d And so she was afraid now, I don\u2019t know what\nHansie has written -- that I would come and be in -- something -- so I didn\u2019t go. This was the end\nof my visit, I didn\u2019t go. I didn\u2019t see her. And -- and so I -- I was staying in -- in London and was\nworking at -- Angela was -- it was a difficulty where to live.

If they get -- if they are\nready for grammar school. And she was in four different schools and she -- and in the end she\nwas in the Solomon Wolfser school and there were 28 pupils and only four passed the exam. And\nshe was one of the four. When she rang me up in my business, she passed, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I\nrang up at first somebody else if it\u2019s true that she passed. And then I left everything and -- and so\nshe could go to grammar school. She want -- won a -- a scholarship for a grammar school and\nshe was taken by -- by the Burlington School. This is a very old school with a good name and it\nwas -- this is where she told -- she had an interview where she told she sees her father every two\nyears. And the headmistress -- in when I had the interview, she ask me what -- what it means. So\nI told her I\u2019m divorced, she didn\u2019t know that I\u2019m divorced, no.
