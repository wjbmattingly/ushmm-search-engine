        "FRED DEUTSCH\nAugust 18, 1995",
        "Question Would you begin by stating your name, date of birth and where you were born?\nAnswer Yes. My name is Fred Deutsch. I was born in Czechoslovakia in a town named",
        ", which 1s not far away from the Polish border. I was born on November 13,\n1932. That was about one year before Hitler came to power. The town I spent my childhood in\nas far as I can remember, was a large industrial town which had big steel mills and coal mines.\nMy father was a dentist. A very well to do dentist. I have a sister. We grew up in a large\napartment in the center of the town. The first event that I remember from my childhood was\nwhen my father took me to a movie to see Snow White and Seven Dwarfs. Other significant\nevent comes to mind that when we walked through the town, the town was full of men who\nexercised civil readiness against air attacks. Consequently, each member of my family received\na gas mask and we had to exercise how to put it on and off. In my early childhood I contracted a\nmiddle ear infection, and consequently, I was more in hospitals than at home. One has to\nremember that penicillin was not invented as yet and therefore infections, they were very serious\nillnesses in those days. Because of my ear infection, I was unable to attend regularly school. At\nany rate, in 1938 I would have been going only to the first grade anyhow, and between my\nhospital visits, I had a private tutor who taught me how to write and read. At that time of course,\nI was a very little boy. I do not remember or did not know the reasons for our move, but in about\n1938 or 1939 we moved away from to a town called , which\nwas more inland of the republic and further away from the Polish border. Looking at the move\nin retrospect today, I know that the region of was considered part of the",
        "and it was not quite certain whether it will not revert to Poland and taken\naway from the Czech republic. So, we moved to a town called which was a\nplace of birth of my father. It was a pleasant, nice little town with a population of about 10,000\npeople as opposed to 50,000 or 60,000 of . SO, It was a move to a much",
        "smaller town, but it was pleasant, quiet. It had a district and I remember every Thursday or\nFriday, peasants used to come to the town to set a market with their produce and life went on in a\nvery pleasant leisurely pace.\nQ. Before you go any further, let me ask you a couple questions. When in\nyou were all given gas masks and taught about the civil preparedness, what was this for?\nA. At that time, in everybody's mind was one thing that remembering that the Germans in\nfirst World War used gas and everybody assumed that should an air attack materialize, the\nenemy will revert to gas.\nQ. So there was already an awareness or concern about what was going on in Germany?\nA. Yes. Now, looking in retrospect, it's easy to be a Monday morning quarterback, but in\nthose days I didn't know about it, but Germany threatened that if Czechoslovakia doesn't\nsurrender they simply will come with airplanes and bomb Czechoslovakia and everybody\nassumed that these would be gas attacks. For reasons obvious today but not known at that time,\nmany people especially Jewish population of the Czech part of the republic, the majority of Jews\nspoke German where the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia, there the Jews spoke Hungarian and\nEurope being a relatively small continent, the radio at that time was the main media of\ncommunication. Many people who wanted to know what goes on in the world listened to foreign\nbroadcast. It was very easy and very simple to catch radio from Berlin or Vienna and get their\npoint of view across. Because the Czech newspapers unfortunately always tried to minimize the\nthreat that is actually hanging over the country and one act of appeasement took place after\nanother. The Czech government always hoped that this action will finally satisfy the German\ndemands and that nothing more serious will come out of it.\nQ. Do you remember your family listening to the radio or your parents talking about what\nwas going on?\nA. No. My parents didn't speak in front of the children about these things. That was the\ncustom of those days that you send the children to bed before you started speaking of serious\nevents. Something else comes back to my mind that friends of my parents, many of them started",
        "to disappear. Later on, when I began to ask what happened to such and such, I was told that they\nleft Czechoslovakia and settled in foreign countries. Namely, I think that there were people who\nsaw what was coming and took steps while time was still available. I remember specifically two\nfamilies that immigrated to Palestine. At that time the state of Israel didn't exist. They\nimmigrated to Palestine. A couple of people emigrated to England. Some of them went to\nEgypt. Now, why some people were guessing correctly, I don't know. My father, unfortunately\nwas not one of those that guessed correctly. He always thought that whatever exists is only a\ntemporary situation and it will pass away, and therefore, we stayed.\nQ. Was your family religious?\nA. No. That is another interesting situation. The Czech intelligencia if I may call it that\nway, was not religious, including the Jews. It used to be said that the higher education you will\nobtain, the less religious you are. And my father, being a medical doctor, under Austro-\nHungarian monarchy you first had to be a medical doctor before you were permitted to specialize\nin dentistry. So, we were not religious. When we did move away from to\n, we used to attend a synagogue but attendance usually was not done for\nreligious purposes. It was more done for social gathering. That's where you met your friends\nand your acquaintances.\nQ. Did you mix with Christian kids? Did you parents have Christian friends?\nA. I do not remember specifically Christian friends, except we did have a maid and my\nfather had an apprentice who learned the technical side of dentistry. Otherwise, I do not\nremember coming into contact with Christians. However, you know, I was six or seven years of\nage and religion in those days didn't mean anything at all to me. I used to go part time to school,\nbut whether my fellow students were Jewish or Christians, I simply don't know, but I don't think\nI would have cared.\nQ. You don't remember other kids coming up to you and calling you a Jew?\nA. No, no in those days prior to the war, no. Simply I think I was too well shielded because\nof the frequent illnesses. The ear infections, having a maid who took me to park for a walk. I do",
        "not remember, with exception of one of my father's friends who had a daughter my age.\nOccasionally she and I met and we played together, but otherwise I don't remember in those days\nhaving any friends. But, you know that was probably childhood stuff, typical childhood for\nthose days. I do not think Judaism had much to do with it. It was probably more because of my\nfrequent ear infections that influenced that kind of sheltered life than having grown up in a\nmiddle class family.\nQ. You moved to in what year?\nA. That must have been in 1939, I think. The move itself I do not remember.\nQ. Do you think this was before the Germans annexed the Czech republic?\nA. I honestly do not know. That seems to me, but that is looking in retrospect, I think the\nGermans annexed Czechoslovakia March 15, 1938, I think.\nQ. 1939.\nA. Okay, '39, but whether we moved before or after, I do not remember. My next memory\nof is I remember sitting in either the first or second grade elementary school\nand going there for maybe a half of year when all of a sudden I had to stop going. I was then\ntold that as a Jew no longer can I attend this school. How soon thereafter the belt started\ntightening up, I cannot give you in terms of dates. I only remember more or less events. All of a\nsudden it usually I was told either by my father or by my mother that for example I cannot go\nthrough certain streets with the exception of between the hours of three and five in the afternoon.\nMany stores in suddenly had a sign to Jews entry is forbidden. Other stores\npermitted visit from Jews between the hours of three and five. I knew I cannot leave the\nboundaries of the town. I knew I cannot go to a movie or a soccer game or to a public place. I\ncan not go to a municipal swimming pool. I cannot go skiing because that would mean to go out\nof town. There was a whole host of things which were forbidden. Then as a next step I\nremember each Jew had to wear a star of David. A yellow star that had to be affixed over one's\nheart. That star always had to be made visible. You were not permitted to cover it up with\nanything. Jews were given special 1.d. cards which had to be produced whenever policeman",
        "stopped you and asked for it. Because even in the Czech republic, every citizen of\nCzechoslovakia has an 1.d. card but Jews had a special 1.d. card. Not having an 1.d. card was\npunishable under any Czech law. Jews were issued ration cards which were much smaller than\nthose of the Christian population. Events took place and I don't know in what order exactly it\nfollowed. We were, by we I mean Jews were requested or ordered to surrender cameras, radios.\nWe had to surrender any passports if you had any. We had to dismount any brass objects from\nthe apartment. Jews were not permitted to have any pets. The explanation for that was that the\npets were slaughtered by Germans and that grease or fat was used to lubricate machinery. All\nthe towns, including , lost their church bells. The paradox is that thanks to\nGerman occupation, Czechoslovakia acquired electricity of 220 volts instead of 110 which they\nused to have under the old republic. The reason for it is that the 110 volts were sent via copper\nwires and copper offers low resistance to electricity, but copper was needed very badly by the\nnazi machinery and all the wiring, copper wiring was replaced by lower conductivity wires\nwhich provided greater resistance to electric current, so therefore, they had to raise the voltage\nfrom 110 to 220. How beneficial it is, I don't know, but that was one benefit.\nQ. What did a boy of eight years old, seven years old, do you remember how you felt about\nall of these restrictions? Did it make sense to you? Did it bother you?\nA. I'm not quite certain whether it did bother me or not, because you have to keep in mind\none that, that European societies especially those who used to be under Austria-Hungarian\nmonarchy are very obedient people. They have much greater respect, always had much greater\nrespect for authority than here, in a free society. In the old republic everybody had 1n his\npossession hundreds of documents. It was a society obsessed with documents. It's difficult to\nexplain the futility of these documents because it's so laughable, but the bureaucracy was\nunbelievable. Therefore, when an order came, even if a foolish one, nobody asked whether it\nmakes sense or not. The only unpleasant situations began to develop, but again, gradually,\nwhere came an order that Jews are forbidden to communicate with non Jews. That started to\ncreate problems. Now, I do not know what the Christian boys were told by their parents, but I do",
        "remember that when I walked through certain streets that boys my age and older ones, ganged up\non me and used to beat me up and calling me not only Jew, that would have been too simple, but\nthey were infected by their parents. At that time, they used to call Jew, Christ killer, and by\nbeating me up they believed that they are revenging the crucification of Christ that somehow I\nam responsible for it. That is one part of it which I never could have reconciled in my mind.\nHow am I, if it is true that the Jews sold out Christ and crucified him, what part did I play in it, or\nmy parents. Why am I being punished for something 1,945 years later. When I came to my\nparents with these questions, there were no answers. Simply, I do remember that certain things I\nasked once and then I did not get satisfactory answer or answer that I could have at that age\ncomprehend, I didn't pursue it anymore. Because usually my parents' answer was when you are\nolder you will understand better. Now you are still too young to understand. That is what I\nreconciled myself with. Perhaps when I will be older I will understand, so therefore, I didn't\npursue many of these open questions.\nQ. When you said that you generally accepted whatever rules were established because that\nwas the way life was, still maybe I would question why these rules only applied to Jewish\npeople?\nA. Again, I do not have a clear cut answer because I'm not quite certain that at that age I was\nconcerned with us Jews. I think I was more concerned with myself, why I cannot do something.\nI'm not quite certain I understood that there are others in town that suffer with the same\nrestriction.\nQ. Right, but what I'm suggesting is you couldn't do something but the boy next door could.\nA. Yes, I was told simply because he was a Christian and that was the rule. I didn't ask why\nhe and I not. I was told because you are Jewish and the rules said you as a Jew could not do that.\nQ. At the time of all of these restrictions were you still able to go to the synagogue like you\nhad been doing?\nA. That comes the next step. Again, I do not know if it was 1941, certain things started to\ndevelop slowly. First of all, was a town which had a large Jewish section.",
        "It was called , Jewish town. All of a sudden, I began to realize that that part of\n, the population of that part, begins to increase in size. Namely, because I\nas a Jew was not permitted to associate with Christians, I used to go every day to the Jewish part\nof the town to play with boys my age. Not all the streets were closed to Jews or entry permitted\nfrom three to five, only the main streets. If I went in circles, I was always able to reach the\nJewish part of town and play with the Jewish boys. That part of the town, the population began\nto swell. Everyday there were more and more people in that part of town. I was delighted\nbecause there were more boys to play with. It never occurred to me to ask why does the\npopulation of that part of town keep increasing. It simply didn't signal anything unique. The\nhouse which we occupied which we owned, also got additional tenants, so that finally we were\nsqueezed into one room. We shared the house with people from other towns throughout the\nregion who all were sent to to the Jewish, and slowly it became a ghetto.\nNow, I do not remember any specific events except that Germans did not have any military\ncontingent in - that resided there. The nearest gestapo contingent was in\n, which was a larger town that . The Czech police played\nsome ambivalent role in the whole situation. Some Czech policemen remained faithful to the\nfact that they were policemen and not nazis. Others saw an opportunity to enrich themselves and\njoined the side of the Germans against the Jews. So, it depended on your sin and who actually\naccused you of it whether you went free or not. The Gestapo came many a times and arrested\npeople without any specific reason. Usually see bits of news you learned through the grapevine\nthat such and such was taken away yesterday by the gestapo. Usually you never saw that person\nagain or that family again. So, the Jewish part of town began really to explode in seams from\ninflux of people, of the Jews.\nQ. Your house was not in that area?\nA. Our house was just on the border of the Jewish part of the town but not 1n it.\nQ. So, when you wanted to go there to play with boys your age, did you feel safe? Did you\nparents show any concern about you wandering around?",
        "A. No, not as long as they knew I was in that part of town. The only worry was that every\nJew had to be off the street at 8:00 and if you were caught after 8:00 that was reason to be\ndeported. But as long as I was home before 8:00 there was no particular worry. At least my\nparents never indicated to me that they were worried what I'm doing all day. They knew where I\nwas. The only problem was not to commit some mischief, for example, not to go fishing.\nhad a very pleasant river, plenty of fish, and that again was taboo. So, it was a",
        "tense situation, but I think that at that age, maybe you are looking at these things as more of an\nadventure rather than sensing the danger in it. Because after all, don't forget that the Germans\natrocities that they committed, were all committed elsewhere until you actually got there, you\ndidn't have the slightest knowledge of what is happening. We didn't have radio. The news came\nonly through grapevine. The news was sanitized. In those early days of the second world war,\nthings went extremely well for the Germans. They conquered France without too many\nproblems. They conquered Poland. They were very close deep into Russia. The news that\npeople were listening to, let's say the broadcasts from London or from Moscow were not very\nencouraging in those days. I may add one additional thing that in those days every radio\nthroughout or even under the Czech republic was registered in the post office.\nYou had to renew your radio license every year by buying a stamp. So, that the authorities knew\nof every radio, who owns it, and where it is. One of the first things the Germans did when they\noccupied Czechoslovakia they removed the tubes from the radio. In those days they had huge\nvacuum tubes that enable you to listen to London or Moscow. That means short waves or long\nwaves. We are not talking about am or fm. In those days, they had different waves in Europe, so\nyou were left with a radio that was only able to let you listen to Central Europe radio stations,\nand Central Europe in those days almost completely occupied by the Germans. So, you always\nheard one and the same newscast and the Germans were singing praises to the victorious armies.\nSo, situation did not look very rosy at all. As a matter of fact, one sort of a habit we used to have\nis we used to have a map of Europe and we used to tuck pins which town was conquered by the\nGermans so we had more or less create a picture how far the German armies had advanced.",
        "Then you had another problem, you did not know exactly what was propaganda and what is\nreality.\nQ. How much of what you're talking about were you aware of or did you even think about at\nthat age?\nA. Well, again, as I said at that age you look upon any military as something that you want\nto become part of when you grow up and being a small town, occasionally a\nmilitary convoy passed through and I remember I don't know exactly why one day came and\ncontingent of German soldiers that were outfitted in African clothes they were the Africa corp\nthat fought under , and strangely enough shortly thereafter after that contingent\npassed through town, the whole block was required to surrender leather\nmade luggage, pieces of luggage and leather made goods. We were told that that is needed to\nmanufacture for the Africa corp shoes. They need a lot of shoes. We were then asking well\nwhat suppose the rest of the population to do? For example, if your shoe soles were worn out.\nSo, then somebody introduced old tires from cars and used that rubber for shoe soles. As the\nnext item, old tires had to be surrendered. People who used to have bicycles became very\ninventive. After surrendering the tires from the bicycles they mounted on a wire in very close\nproximity to each other, corks from bottles and ride the bicycle on corks. Gasoline was\nunobtainable because private cars were either confiscated or not permitted to be driven at all, and\nthe buses were converted I do not know exactly how it worked mechanically but each bus had a\nboiler mounted on the side and I think it was propelled by steam. You had to create steam\npressure in the boiler and then you were able to ride in it. Of course when the pressure went\ndown, everybody had to go out. If the bus driver had some wood with him, then he again fired\nup the boiler. If not everybody had to go and gather pieces of wood and again simulate the steam\npressure of the boiler before the bus was able to continue. These are some memories and bits\nand pieces that you heard through the grapevine about economic conditions and situations.\nQ. You weren't riding on the busses?",
        "A. Later on I had the opportunity. Later on in the war I had the opportunity to ride on one of\nthose busses and experience it first hand, but that was after we fled.\nQ. So, were you and your family ever forced to live within this ?\nA. No. I do not think that because it was so close to the that we were\nactually in a way considered part of it. Maybe geographically not, but the distance was maybe a\nhundred yards to the . The only difference being was that the\nat some point it had about four entries to it and there were guards posted\nthere, and I think a gate was erected and anybody that went in or out had to show his 1.d. card,\nbut because we were outside of it, we didn't have to do so. So, if that 1s considered some\nprivilege, I don't know.\nQ. Who were the guards, do you know? Were they Jewish guards?\nA. Yes, they were Jewish guards.\nQ. So, did your general living conditions become more difficult in terms of was your father\nstill able to practice dentistry?\nA. No, no, father didn't practice. I think that we lived from our savings. The food rations\nwell, if you saw that, they were minuscule. Even that which you obtained on the ration cards had\na very dubious quality. For example, I do remember that we got periodically a cube of honey\nand I don't know why I still remember it, I was told that the honey was made from coal. I do not\nknow chemistry. I heard it was made from coal. I do not know whether you have seen a book of\ncoupons, but every week we were entitled to something. Let's say one week you were scheduled\nto obtain marmalade. Glass was not available, so you went to a grocery store and they put a\npiece of wax paper and weighed in to it marmalade. By the time you came home, not much was\nleft. It all seeped out. Potatoes I think were our main staple. Bread which we got, was black in\ncolor. As a matter of fact, somebody made for me a friend a chess set from that black bread\nbecause that bread if you didn't consume it within a few hours, was hard like rock. I don't know\nwhat that bread was made of. One by product of the economic shortage was that the black\nmarket flourished 1n an unbelievable fashion. Unfortunately in every time of adversity, black",
        "market flourishes and many people enrich themselves by being black marketeers. There was\nblack market for gasoline. There was black market for cigarettes. Again, cigarettes were not\navailable for Jews. I and a friend of mine became a little inventive. We wanted to make some\nextra money. In as much as cigarettes to Jews, however, what was available were filters,\ncigarette filters, and we used to buy in a store a hundred empty cigarette filters and used to utilize\ndried leaves and stuff that instead of tobacco and we were selling it. So, we made a little bit\nextra money by selling these awful smelling and tasting cigarettes. We were very inventive for\nexample I remember my father used to have a fishing rod so we mounted on the tip of the fishing\nrod a sack made of linen and we used to extend that fishing rod to a garden which my neighbor\ngrew apples and we used to steal apples from his trees with a fishing rod. There are childhood\nmemories and it's interesting that poverty and hunger and need can be stimulate within you\ncreativity and inventiveness and I think that's what made it 1n a way fun for us kids at that age.\nQ. Your father, he was not working any more?\nA. No, he was not working.\nQ. So, how did your parents spend their time?\nA. I think that the Jewish men of the of the Jewish section used to spend\nmost of their day playing cards and exchanging stories and trying to outguess the political\nsituation and trying to guess when the war will end. That was the main occupation. That\nsituation sort of a limbo if you will I think lasted for about a year, year and a half. Then the\nsituation began to change very, very rapidly and very dramatically. By that I mean the order\ncame that in alphabetical order by the last name each Jew has to come to local high school a\nregister. There you obtained a number, a registration number which gain didn't mean very much\ntome. With the registration number, you were given a list and that list stated that the registration\nnumber will be your personal 1.d. from here on and you should prepare for the relocation to the\neast. In order to provide supplies for the relocation you were permitted to take with you no more\nthan 50 kilograms per person, 50 kilograms being about 80 pounds and it specified exactly what",
        "you were not permitted to take with you. It left the relocation date open, but you should slowly\nget ready for it.\nQ. What were you not allowed to take with you?\nA. Well, again the Germans itemized the list for forbidden items that they took away from\nyou a long time ago, but they wanted to make sure that somehow you didn't forget to surrender\nthese articles. You were not permitted to take any gold, any jewels, radios, cameras, items which\nnobody had anymore anyhow. Now, a strange game started to develop. Everybody through\ngrapevines started asking well what do we take with us. East, we are going east. Nobody knew\njust how far or where to or what time of year would it be. Do we take winter articles. Do we\ntake food with us. What exactly do we take. There the grapevine started working. We still\ndidn't know where we would go, but everybody was advised to take food. Now, with the ration\ncoupons again the question was well what food do we take, how much. After all, the food is of\nso dubious quality it might spoil. I do remember that my mother used to prepare huge cubes of\nyeast. I never tried to analyze why yeast but maybe it has some unique nutritional value. We\nused to accumulate cubes with honey. I do remember that we purchased cubes of toothpaste and\nopen the cubes in the back and stuffed into the toothpaste gold coins which we still had because\nnobody surrendered everything. So, in that way, we started preparing for a journey that we didn't\nknow when would take place or where to.\nQ. Let me ask you a couple questions and then we'll change tapes. Approximately what\ntime period are we talking about?\nA. That was about '41 or '42.\nQ. When you got this information about going to the high school and getting a number and\nwhat you would take, did this come through some sort of Jewish representatives of the\ncommunity or how did you get this information?\nA. In retrospect in general I can make that statement. Everything that the community, that\nthe authorities wanted the community to know, usually came via two systems of media. One was\nthrough loudspeakers which I think the Germans had mounted almost on every corner of the",
        "main street. Then number two they had public bill boards on which they posted the huge\nplacards and always writing and adding to whom it concerns and not reading the placards,\nadvertisement was no excuse for not obeying the law was again punishable because every citizen\nwas forced to listen to the loudspeakers or read it on the public bulletin boards.\nEnd of Tape 1",
        "Tape 2\nQ. So, when we stopped we were talking about the registration and relocation.\nA. Now, at home we did all sorts of exercise. The problem was that in as much as the\nleather luggage was taken away, we had paper type of luggage and the problem was how many\npounds the paper luggage can handle. Then the question was do we carry it in two pieces of\nluggage or do we take a sack or where do we put what. But, I have to deviate a little bit from\nthat to tell you a very important side of the story, namely now comes seeing my grandfather. My\ngrandfather was a medical doctor who at that time was living on the Slovak side of the border.\nBefore the war, he used to be a medical doctor in a glass factory that was situated exactly in the\nmiddle of the international border between Czech lands and Slovak lands. The factory was a\nglass kind of factory owned by Germans. When Hitler came to town, the Germans sold the\nfactory and fled to Germany, and when that happened, my grandfather lost the place as a\nphysician for the glass blowers and moved from that village to a town on the Slovak side called\nwhere he opened a private practice. All the glass blowers that used to live in",
        "the village of whom he took care remained his patient and used to come visit him for\nconsultations to . When the emerged the Slovak part of\nCzechoslovakia became independent and became a puppet state under a president who was a\npriest. was his name. He was a catholic priest. The Slovaks traditionally\ndidn't like very much the union with the Czechs. The Czechs probably didn't like the Slovaks\nmuch either. They viewed the Slovaks like a bride who didn't bring into the marriage a dowry\nlarge enough, and therefore, the marriage was a very uneasy one. Furthermore, the Slovaks were\nalways fiercely nationalists and the Slovak population was very clearly divided between the\ncatholic population and the Lutheran population. So, Slovaks had a very small minority of\ngypsies but they didn't amount to much. But whenever later on we wanted to know whether a\nperson is reliable sufficiently we always ask as a first question whether he's a catholic or whether\nhe's a Lutheran but that came a little bit later. However, the Slovak part of the land was not\noccupied initially by Germans and the economy in Slovakia was flourishing. It was extremely",
        "good going as compared to the side of the country. My grandfather was always\nable to smuggle goods, food stuff, to us. Namely, the international board of in\nSlovakia who went exactly through the middle of the village and the population from one\ncountry worked in the second country so that the German guards after a while already knew the\npeople by sight and didn't ask anymore for 1.d. cards and as long as you were dressed according\nto the local customs and habits and didn't behave in any conspicuous fashions the Germans\nusually didn't bother to stop you for an i.d. card. At least not during the regular day hours. They\nlet the people cross the borders without any problems. And consequently, many of these farmers\nused to come to , which was not very far away from the border and brought us\nmessages from Grandfather and brought smuggled food stuff. So, we were always a little bit\nbetter off than the other people who didn't have any contacts. The messages that my grandfather\nsent us usually were written on a piece of linen and sewed in a lining of a coat so that even if the\nGermans frisk you they wouldn't feel paper. My grandfather had his sources of information\nbecause the Slovaks were able to listen to radios easier in a freer form than we and he knew\nabout these transports and where they are going. So, he kept warning us, alerting us, but at that\ntime he did not indicate anything about being in a position to help us. So, after registration about\na couple weeks later, suddenly again on these billboards came an announcement that registration\nnumbers of between these and these numbers should report to the local railroad station on such\nand such date. Luckily enough, one farmer came on that day and brought us food stuff from our\ngrandfather and on his way back to Slovakia we gave him a message that we have been\nscheduled for transport two weeks from today and this is goodbye. The farmer as we know\ntoday, succeeded and gave that message to our grandfather. About three or four days before we\nwere to appear at the railroad station I was playing with the boys in the as\nusually. Suddenly my sister came to fetch me and said quietly, go quickly to grandma, my\ngrandmother from my father's side, the grandfather that was living in Slovakia was from my\nmother's side. This grandmother was from my father's side. She lived in the ;\ngo say goodbye to her and I will take you immediately home. Don't ask any questions. So, I",
        "went to grandma and said goodbye to her. She apparently knew already and she started to cry. I\ndidn't understand the reason for her crying, I said bye grandma and I left with my sister. That\nwas late in the afternoon. When I came home, there I realized the flurry of activity. My mother\nwas taking all sorts of clothes and bringing it to neighbors who lived across from our house. I\nremember the neighbor being a tailor and my mother always brought it over and came back\nempty handed and took another load and brought it again to the neighbors. I asked my mother\nwhat's going on. She said don't ask any questions, just get dressed very warmly. Take two\nlayers of clothes and don't ask any questions. I didn't ask any questions. It was winter. I think it\nmust have been Christmas day, probably 1942, 1943 Christmas. At about 8:00 my father, my\nmother, and my sister and myself gathered. We shut off the lights which was sort of a useless\nexercise anyhow because I should mention that in those days all the windows had to have heavy\ncurtains because of air attacks. We waited and suddenly at about 8:00 in the evening somebody\nknocked on the door and we saw a stranger that told us are you ready and mother and father said\nyes and we left the house. We followed the stranger. We walked through the town which was\nalready dark and heavy snow. We knew that we are out after 8:00 if we got caught that would be\nthe end of it, but nobody paid too much attention to us. Because we are not situated\ngeographically in the , that was in our favor. So, we in that evening we already\nbroke all the rules and we broke through the edge of the town, where that gentleman had a car, a\ntaxi. He motioned us to enter the taxi and he drove us away from . Well,\nwe left and at the edge of the town was a taxi waiting and the\ngentleman pointed that we should enter the taxi. So, my sister, my mother my father and myself\nentered the taxi and the taxi car started slowly, slowly edging away from . Ido\nnot remember how long we traveled in the taxi but 1t must have been a couple of hours because\nvisibility was miserable. It was snowing very heavily and he was driving very slowly. After\nseveral hours we arrived at our destination. At that time I didn't know where we were but the\ntaxi driver again said we should exit the taxi. He stopped, we should exit the taxi and outside\nwas waiting for us a gentleman who took us to his farm. We walked for about a hundred yards",
        "and we entered his farm. The taxi driver said goodbye to us and he continued in his journey. I\ndidn't know where he came from or where he was going to. In the farmer's house we caught our\nbreath, we got something to eat, and I was told that we will have to wait. I was not told why or\nfor how long. After waiting for quite a while the farmer came back in dressed in a heavy coat\nand boots and said okay let's go. I didn't know where to, but as a good boy I didn't ask many\nquestions and all four of us left the farmhouse led by the farmer. The farmer walked with us on\nthe main road for about half a mile and then he left the main road and started walking towards\nthe forest. We walked in heavy, heavy snow for about half a mile in the direction of the forest\nand when we entered the forest, we kept walking. I do remember the snow was coming down\nvery, very heavily. I think at some point I lost even my shoes but we kept walking. I do\nremember as we were walking suddenly I saw a window from which light was shining. I heard\nsome dogs barking and I heard singing and my father and the farmer indicated with their finger\nto keep quiet and to keep walking. After an additional half an hour or hour of walk we came\nagain to a farmer's house where they already were waiting for us. We were totally lost, and we\nwere led to an attic in which there was some hay and some straw and we laid and rested for a\ncouple of hours. Only then I was told that we crossed the international border from\nto Slovakia. We are now in Slovakia. In that attic grandfather and",
        "grandmother were waiting for us. We rested for a couple more hours and the farmer took us\nagain to the main highway on the Slovak side of the border where there was a sled waiting for us\ndrawn by horses. They took us deeper into Slovak territory to a farm house where we entered a\nbarn and we were hiding there. Now, from events that later on took place, I understood that my\ngrandfather and grandmother were afraid that once our escape will be made known the Germans\nwill of course very easily figure out that we must have fled to Slovakia and in all likelihood will\nnotify the Slovak authorities to arrest us. So, from that point on, we stayed in hiding until the\nend of the war, with grandfather and grandmother. For some period of time there was six of us,\nbut at some point my sister separated from us because she was able to learn the Slovak language\nand being a woman it was virtually impossible to prove that she was Jewish for obvious reasons",
        "and she lived out the rest of the war in Brataslava which was the capital of Slovak Republic\nworking under an assumed name and forged papers and she worked as a secretary.\nQ. A couple things, when you went by that house and your father told you to be quiet, who\nwere those people?\nA. That was a guard house, the nazi German guard house that during the day the soldiers\nwere staffing the border crossing. Like majority of international borders you have that wooden\nbar that is down and the soldiers check your 1.d.s but during the night when everybody 1s home\nand it being Christmas there was no traffic there. The soldiers instead of being outside freezing\nthey went to the guard house to celebrate Christmas. Because after all, they were also away from\ntheir families and being in a warm cozy house, they were celebrating Christmas and singing. In\nall likelihood they had some alcoholic beverages too. That's how our journey into hiding began.\nQ. Wasn't there some fear of reprisal from the Germans?\nA. Yes, that was the reason why our grandparents left their home of the Slovak side and\njoined us in hiding because of the fear that the nazis, the Slovak nazis will put two and two\ntogether that we must have obtained help from the Slovak side and the logic would have pointed\ntowards our grandparents that they must have engineered our escape. The assumption was a\ncorrect one because the neighbors of our grandparents later on told us that not long after the\ngrandparents had left, the Slovak fascists came to the house to look for them. These are the\ndistances are very minuscule and one telephone call arranges many, many things, especially\nwhen the caller is a gestapo high official so that we had a window of about two days because we\nfled about three days before the transport should have departed. Therefore we had some window\nin which to breath a little bit more freely, but once everybody reported to the railroad station they\ndiscovered very quickly that we are missing and they started very seriously looking for us. From\nthat point on, we never stayed very long in any one place of hiding. Because of my grandfather's\ncollections of a medical doctor, many farmers owed their lives to him. Many of them were\nhelping us very willingly. There were a few who did it purely for monetary reasons and to those\nwe had to pay very heavily. But the majority of them did it as gratitude to grandfather. The",
        "problems were why we couldn't stay in any place too long, the reasons were very obvious.\nNumber one, in those parts of the country people know one another. The grocer knows that\nwhen a farmer comes to buy his supply he used to buy for years and years the same amount of\nsupplies. Suddenly he buys three times as much. So, it raises suspicion. Why do you suddenly\nneed so much food. Problem number two, visibility. You always had to stay away from\nwindows because someone may see you through the window. People know one another to such\nan extent that they know exactly in which room you are eating, your stove. Suddenly through a\nchimney that was not used for years, smoke comes out. So, these were all signs that some\nunusual activity is taking place in the house and therefore to lower the level of suspicion we had\nto be continuously on the move. Furthermore, the Germans from issued a large\nmonetary reward for our capture and that was very tempting to some farmers who always lived\non the edge of poverty. Simply, we had to go from one place to another.\nQ. As a boy, was this difficult or was it an adventure?\nA. That already began to be difficult. I stopped seeing it as an adventure. Why was it\ndifficult? Number one because I was a growing boy. My movement was very restricted because\nwe had to stay in one room or always be on a lookout how we exit the room and where to. My\nmovement was restricted and number two whenever we moved from one hiding place to another\nwe did it in the middle of the night. I never knew how long we would stay in a certain place,\nhow far away we would move and whether we would be for the next month living in an attic or a\ncellar. That at that point became very, very irritating.\nQ. Did you know most of the people who hid you? Or did your grandfather know who they\nwere beforehand?\nA. In most cases he knew who these people were, in most cases. In several cases the\nrelatives of those whom he knew but for almost all the time he knew the collections, how it all\nwent.\nQ. Do you maybe want to go back and get specific. Tell me about these places and describe\nwhat they were for us.",
        "A. That part of Slovakia I do not believe has any thing compatible that I can relate to in the\nUnited States. That part in those days Slovakia had isolated farms. They were about two or\nthree miles apart from each other. You could have seen from one farm to the other providing the\nweather was good, providing the terrain permitted you to do so. The farmers, during the summer\nmonths were farming. They had a cow or two. They had some pigs, they had some chickens.\nThey had some small fields where they raised various things. During the winter, they used to\nsupplement their income by tending the forests. They were also lumberjacks. Some of them\nduring the long winter months supplemented their income by producing toys from wood or\nwomen were gathering feathers. In those days, most of these farms did not have electricity. All\nof it was done by kerosene lamp so that the life was very, very slow, but it was sort of a friendly\nrelation because they all depended on one another. Most of the farmers knew that if they got\ncaught, they would be shot. You were 1n no position to hide Jews and go to the police station\nand say hey I'm hiding Jews and want my reward. It did not work that way. If you wanted your\nreward you had to say that farmer over there is hiding Jews or partisans. Then you may have\ngotten your reward. If the Germans didn't feel like giving it to you, they may have accused you\nof being a collaborator and shot you together with that farmer who was hiding those Jews or\npartisans. With the Germans or Slovak fascist who learned all the tricks of the game from the\nnazis, you never knew where you were standing. You would never be able to outguess them.\nQ. Did they have a large presence in the area? Were they always around?\nA. We did discover an interesting phenomenon. The closer the farm was situated to a forest,\nthe more often the Germans seemed to make their presence known. Namely, there were German\nunits mixed with the Slovak fascists units who periodically conducted raids into the forest not so\nmuch with trying to find Jews but trying to find partisans. In one of such raids, we were caught.\nQ. That's a little bit later is it not?\nA. Maybe.",
        "Q. I'd like to get back to a certain chronology, if you don't mind. The first place -- the\nsecond place you went after you came into Slovakia, you were in a barn or an attic with your\ngrandparents. Exactly where was that and how long were you there?\nA. How long I do not know myself. I only know that we never stayed in any one place\nlonger than a few weeks, maybe a month and it would be futile to try to look upon a map and\nfind the way we progressed because number one depending on the political situation, some\nfarmers may have indicated willingness to provide shelter for us and a day later change their\nminds. Some farmers had various excuses. Yes, we would hide you but we have small children\nwho go to school and they may say something. It took lots and lots of cooperation to find\nsomebody who was willing to hide five or six people. As I said before some places we stayed\nlonger, some places we stayed a short time. I remember one farmer had a pregnant wife so all of\na sudden she started in birth. We had to leave. Although my father was a doctor, my grandfather\nwas a doctor, but we didn't know ahead of time what complications may emerge and she may be\nforced to go to the hospital. So, that we continuously moved from one place to another. Some\nwere better, others were worse but basically the pattern stayed the same. Avoid windows.\nAlways ask if everything is clear if you want to go out, and when we did go out, it was usually\nduring the night, complete darkness. We usually went out just to take a breath of fresh air and\nmaybe walk a little bit, otherwise we were continuously most of the time in darkness and if we\nwere in an attic the farmer usually erected a false wall between the house and the stacks of hay\nand we were separated by bales of hay. Because again, it was assumed that if a German patrol\nwill come and search the house, maybe they do not realize that the space in the attic does not\nconform to the length of the house. But of course, looking at it later on when such raids were\nmade, those units that were trained in finding partisans or Jews knew all the tricks of the game.\nThey were not even afraid to set the house on fire if they had suspicions that somebody was there\nand they could not find him.\nQ. Did that ever happen to you?",
        "A. No, that did not happen to us, with exception as I said before that on one occasion we did\nget caught.\nQ. When was that?\nA. That was again, it happened because of a unit mixed Germans and Slovaks were\nsearching for partisans, and I do not remember whether they came to the farm on their way back\nbut I think that they must have come to the farm before their raid actually started and their\ndestination was the forest, but they came to the farm to get some drink of water and they\nsearched the house for partisans and they stumbled upon us. So, the commandant of the unit had\na dilemma. In all likelihood six Jews, he did not want to abort his raid and bring six Jews with\nhim to the barracks and show this as a product of a days work so he decided to continue his raid\nof the partisans and made us swear that next day we will voluntarily appear in his barracks. To\nemphasize, to stress the point that he means business, he ordered one of the soldiers to rape my\nmother. Her father, her husband and her son had to watch it. At that point we knew what was\nwaiting for us. After the unit left, we fled the farm. It was in deep snow in winter and these\nunits never ventured very deeply into the forest. They were afraid of the partisans. They usually\nwent into the forest about a hundred yards and started widely shooting into the forest hoping that\nthey will hit someone and some occasions they hit someone, but once they heard a human voice\nthey entered the forest and dragged the partisans out. We knew they went in a different direction\nand we fled into the forest away from the farmer's house. The farmer sent after us a couple of his\nfriends who inside the forest dug out for us a bunker in the ground in which we went in hiding.\nAbout two days later another farmer whom we did not know came to visit us and brought food\nsupplies and told us that the unit returned two days later to the farmer's house and burned the\nhouse to the ground and shot the farmer and all of his family for harboring us. We spent from\nthat point on time in that bunker underground. You know when I'm talking about forests, these\nwere very, very deep forests. The forest stretch for miles and miles. There is\nno end to them. We got a small stove and during the night we kept warm by feeding the forest\nwith dried wood because dried wood does not emit any smoke. We were heating only during the",
        "night. One time the sense that some German patrols didn't pass too far away from our bunker\nand when the farmers came next time, we dug out another bunker and we moved away from the\nold place to a new bunker. There was another horrible story. We discovered that not far away,\nby not far away I don't mean a hundred miles, I mean several miles from us, there were a couple\nother bunkers and the young men kept visiting the other bunker and while he was on his way to\nvisit the other bunker the German patrol discovered this bunker in which his parents were hiding.\nThey shot them. He visited his friends in the other bunker who were alive. He left them, after a\nhalf an hour went back to his own bunker. He found his parents shot. He returned back to his\nfriends' bunker who in the mean time was discovered by the Germans and found them shot too.\nHe was simply saved by the fact that he was on a trip between the two bunkers and the German\npatrol never stumbled upon him.\nQ. How did you know about that?\nA. Later on when he found his parents and his friends dead, he came to us and told us about\nit. We were a few times visited by injured partisans because of two doctors. They sought us out\non several occasions. My father and my grandfather removed the bullets of the wounded ones.\nQ. So there was some sort of communication information being passed between all of you in\nhiding?\nA. Well, very careful, very limited, but there was some communication, yes.\nQ. Were there a lot of other refugees in this area?\nA. No, very, very few. After the war, a long time after the war has ended I found out I was\nalready in Israel I found out that one family was hiding not far away from us and the German\npatrol was shooting into the forest and the father was hit by a bullet and he screamed the\nGermans came and dragged the whole family and sent them to a concentration camp, but they\nsurvived the war.\nQ. Was the fear constant? Were you always very guarded about your movements? Were\nyou frightened?",
        "A. Well, in the forest time lost its meaning because what you were mostly observant you\nwere worried about the weather. When it didn't snow, the forest was beautiful. The snow was\nclean, the trees were beautiful. The problem began when it rained because we lived in a bunker\nthat was covered by tar paper. It did not keep the rain completely away, so we were\ncontinuously freezing, always cold. Cold and hungry because the provisions that we received\ndidn't have many vitamins. For example, each scratch, the smallest scratch caused infection. So,\nyou were always suffering from something. The life was simply I think the time lost its\nmeaning. The only joy was when a farmer came to bring some provisions and telling you the\nlatest news from the front. And logic kept telling us that when the Germans began to retreat they\nstarted slowly, slowly losing interest in catching Jews. Then apparently they reached a point in\ntheir philosophy that they considered the and Slovakia to be free of Jews. So,\nthey began to venture less and less frequently on these raids. The danger of course remained\nconstantly that somebody will sell you out for the reward. That held true until the very end.\nThat never ceased.\nQ. This area that you were in, can you just for the record, name a few of the nearby villages?\nA. I don't know if it's going to exist because as I said before I think, many of these villages\nwere consolidated. Some of them even changed their names but we are talking in the vicinity of",
        ". The villages of , ; ;",
        ", otherwise all under normal conditions beautiful villages. Very, very\nfriendly people under normal conditions.\nQ. How would you spend an average day, if there was such a thing?\nA. Doing absolutely nothing but sleeping. Sleeping, sleeping and sleeping and trying to\nsave strength. Maybe once a day leaving the bunker for maybe half an hour and trying to gather\ntwigs fallen from trees so that we will be kept warm during the night. But otherwise, doing\nabsolutely nothing, not even talking.\nQ. Was that your primary responsibility, bringing in the firewood?\nA. Yes, that was my responsibility because I was the youngest.",
        "Q. Did you have any contingency plans when you were in a place?\nA. Yes, and that would have been something I definitely would have forgotten to tell you\nhad you not asked. I did realize on several occasions that my grandfather had five or six buttons\nin his pocket and I was told they contain poison, which he would have given to each one of us to\ndrink had he sensed that we were caught. That was the only contingency plan that we had.\nLuckily enough, we never had to make use of it, and that one time that we did get caught, it came\nso quickly that he was unable to distribute it anyhow, but that was because we were caught in a\nfarm house where the dogs were already barking giving us warning. We saw already that human\napproaching from a distance. In the forest, I don't know -- I cannot describe to you a scenario\nhow we would have gotten caught, whether the Germans would have had dogs with them, I don't\nknow. But that I asked once Grandfather years after the war what was in those bottles and he\ntold me, poison.\nQ. You did not know at the time?\nA. At the time I did not know.\nQ. Now, was there ever a point when you were separated from the rest of your family?\nA. Yes, I had a where at some point my grandfather made some arrangement\nfor me to attend alone by myself for one an half years a school in a very distant small village\nunder an assumed name and under an assumed religion. But after about a year and a half living\nin that village, the residents began to ask my identity. Some of them started to suspect that I am\nJewish and one old lady asked me I should show her my penis, whether I am circumcised or not.\nSo, when that came, the people who were hiding me said you have to go back to your\ngrandparents and join your parents to hide.\nQ. Why had your family decided to send you out?\nA. Mainly because of the schooling because I had attended regular school. That was the\nonly year that I had school out of the nine grades required by Czech law, I had three years all\ntogether, and that was one of the three.\nQ. And they decided that even in this extraordinary times, you should go to school?",
        "A. Yes, because again it was already when Slovakia was considered to be free of Jews so\nthey thought that there will be no suspicion.\nQ. Who was the family that did that?\nA. That was a Lutheran minister and unfortunately he was imprisoned under the communists\nand died in jail for Lutheran religious activities against the communist state.\nQ. And your grandfather knew him?\nA. Yes, he knew him.\nQ. I'm going to ask you more about that, but why don't we change types.\nEnd of Tape 2",
        "Tape 3",
        "A. The life in that village was very, very pleasant change. It was a very picturesque village.\nThe Lutheran minister was a bachelor. He owned I think it probably came with the territory, he\nhad a little farm. There was a cow, and he raised angora rabbits. Each winter the rabbits had to\nbe clipped and he had a sister also an old spinster who was living with him who kept house, and\nshe was processing the wool from the rabbits, so there was a lot of spinning going on and\ncombing the wool and knitting and again that village was without electricity so women used to\ngo from one household to the other and block feathers, and all sorts of stories were told by\nblocking the feathers. The village had a post office which had a telephone. It was the only\ntelephone in the whole village. Later on by pure accident I found that the minister had a car\nwhich was hidden in a barn under a stack of hay and that explained to me the occasional noise of\nan engine. Namely, what was he doing? He was recharging the battery by the engine and he\nused the battery for listening to a short wave radio. I caught him once listening to London and\nMoscow and he knew the latest news about movement on the fronts. There was only one\nimpediment in the otherwise beautiful setting. That with him was living a young school teacher\nwho was teaching in a neighboring village and he pretended to be a great enticement who always\nvoiced his suspicion. Many, many years later I found out that he did it purposely to keep them\non their toes. To keep me always alert. But otherwise, life in the village was very, very pleasant,\nvery serene because the village was in a valley, mountains surrounded it. was\nabout two hours away by bus that used to depart from the village very early in the morning and\nused to come back late afternoon and usually the villages took a ride once a week to the nearest\ntown when they had to buy something not obtainable in the village store. On one such occasion I\ntook a ride to the town and strangely enough the town had a catholic church which the president\nof Slovakia at that time, was his name, was a priest of, and he used to\nconduct every Sunday services in that church. was the name of the town and on\none such occasion, I went to the town and saw him giving this service in a catholic church. So,",
        "when the people of the village began to ask my religion, apparently the Lutheran minister got in\ncontact with my grandparents and I was shipped back to the bunker.\nQ. While you were in this village, did you have false papers, did you try to pass as a\nChristian boy?\nA. Yes. One of my grandfather's friends used to be a school teacher who issued in my name\na false school certificate under an assumed name. I was named of Lutheran\nreligion. To cover up my inadequate Slovak language, it was stated in the certificate that I came\nfrom a town called which was exactly on the border of the Czech and Slovak\nlands where they spoke a very mixed Czech Slovak language, the same that I was talking. But\nthat persistent woman who wanted to know if I was really Lutheran, that certificate didn't mean\nmuch. She still wanted me to put my pants down.\nQ. Now, did you learn prayers, did you go to church? What sorts of things did you have to\ndo to pass?\nA. Okay. To pass, that village was so small that it had a school with only one classroom.\nThe teacher always divided the blackboard into various segments and while he lectured to one\ngrade he gave assignment, written assignment to another grade. In the morning before we started\nthe school we Lutherans had to get up and had to pray with our hands hanging loose by our sides.\nThe catholics used to pray crossing their hands in this fashion. And they used to cross\nthemselves where we Lutherans did not. Because I was living with a Lutheran minister I\naccompanied him every Sunday to the church in which in conducted the services and I had two\ntasks in the church. I was helping an older guy to ring the bells to call 1n worshipers to services.\nThat was a great, great challenge, because I was very small and I think there were three bells. I\nwas never able to master my bell to fall into step with the other two bells the other guy was\npulling on because the rope of my bell when it went up, always took me along with it. I was not\nheavy enough to bring the rope down again, so I was jumping from one side to another. Then,\nbecause the village didn't have electricity, but the church had an organ, our school master played\nthe organ, but somebody had to keep pumping the organ. So, again I took place among the other",
        "volunteers to pump the organ. And again, I was very small and light in weight to pump the\norgan so that the sound of it did not diminish. So, these were some of the challenges I was faced\nwith. Also, on one or two occasions, the farm help took me to pasture to guard the cows and\nonce or twice the cow escaped from me and I had great difficulty finding the cow while he was\ntaking a nap I had to gather the cow. But all in all, I think that one year that I was in that village\nwas probably the most pleasant time during all those years of war that I remember.\nQ. Even though you were separated from your family?\nA. Even though I was separated from my parents and my grandparents.\nQ. Did you have to memorize prayers?\nA. There was always only one prayer in the morning which I still think I vaguely remember\nsomething like \"Dear Father, give us our daily bread and forgive all our sins, like we forgive our\nsinners,\" something of that nature. It was not very long. Something came back to me, while I\nwent to school in the in the first grade for the short time I was permitted to attend\nwe were learning to recite the alphabet and at that time the Czech alphabet has h and after h\ncomes a combination of C and H which is pronounced and when we came to that it\nwas pronounced . In as much as the president of the was a\nfellow named , we had to stand up for that split of a second when we recited\nthe alphabet. But going back to Slovakia, the prayer was always one in the same. For\nappearances sake, I also went to Sunday school where we learned the theory of Lutheran\nreligion. Inasmuch as I never was deeply involved in Jewish religion, it was quite pleasant,\nrelaxing to learn about Lutheran religion. There was not a trace of animosity in it. The religion\nwas not used in that particular village to antagonize anyone. It was just there to serve the people\nand to unite them under the umbrella of religion.\nQ. Was there anything particularly striking about the sermon that Father gave\nwhen you had gone to that town?\nA. No, because number one it was a very large church. The church was a catholic church. It\nhad very good attendance. I suspect that had Father not been a fascist, probably",
        "fewer people would have attended his services. The only striking thing about it was the church\nwas very well guarded by armed tanks while he was giving the service. But when he came out,\nhe looked very benign, very meek kind of fellow that probably wouldn't be able to kill even a fly.\nI do not believe that he made any everlasting impression on anybody. He of course was a\nhypocrite of first grade and as far as I know, he was the only priest that ever ended up on the end\nof arope. After the war he was hung, which he deserved.\nQ. You didn't feel particularly strange or uncomfortable being there?\nA. No, it was something new, something never experienced before. It was curiosity that\nprobably drove me there more than anything else.\nQ. So, you went back to the bunker?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Can you just -- you told me a little bit about your life during that time, but what\nphysically was this place like because you were there quite a while it seems on and off in this\nbunker?\nA. It was a hole in the ground. In one corner a small stove and the long side a platform\nmade of logs from fallen trees and on top of the logs was straw covered with a blanket and you\nhave to visualize, we were -- our feet were facing each other. On one side grandmother with\ngrandfather and on the other side my father, my mother and myself and we were touching with\nfeet our grandparents. The bunker had a couple steps, I don't remember, three or four, and there\nwas a make believe sort of a door that was blocking it so that 1t was always semi-dark in the\nbunker. When somebody had to go out, he had to go a couple yards from the bunker and relieve\nhimself. So, before we went out, we always checked the weather and we tried to go out when it\nwas either snowing or raining so to hide. There were wild, wild animals in the forest. We got a\ncouple visits from deer. I think on one occasion I encountered a wild boar, but I think the boar\nwas more afraid of me than I was of him, because he ran away but scared me. On one occasion I\nremember that it was snowing heavily and the farmer was unable to reach us with supplies. We\nwere already starved almost close to death. My parents sent me to find out why the farmer",
        "wasn't coming. So in the deep snow I was walking to the farmer's house, and I came upon a\nclearance in the forest, and as I came upon the clearance I heard the sound of airplanes. All of a\nsudden it stopped snowing. The clouds parted and brilliant sun was shining and I looked up\nskyward and I saw allied airplanes either going on a raid or coming back from a raid because the\nairplanes were glistening in the sun leaving a vapor trail and throwing small cuttings of\naluminum foil. Allied planes always threw it to confuse German radar. But all of a sudden I\nheard a terrible noise and in the distance I saw a cow. I don't know, the cow was not attended.\nSome farmer may have let her to feed herself, and then I heard a tremendous explosion. What\nhas happened? One of the airplanes, an empty gas tank and that gas tank hit the cow and killed\nher on the spot. That didn't happen very far away from me. I could have been killed instead of\nthe cow. I reached the farmer and the farmer explained that not only heavy snow but also illness\nof his wife prevented us from supplying us, but he gave us some food supplies and he\naccompanied back to the bunker and brought us some supplies of food so we were saved once\nagain from starvation.\nQ. What kind of food?\nA. We were talking about bread, potatoes, bacon, but all that had to eat very slowly and with\ngreat restrain because when you are not having food regularly over eating can kill you. Cheese,\nmilk and he even brought us some bandages and that was one time when really we were in\ndanger of starving to death.\nQ. When you saw the allied planes, did that give you hope?\nA. No. Number one the planes were very, very high. Then, I was not quiet certain whether\nthey are allied planes or not. One plane made me to believe that it was not German because of\nits configuration, and I think many, many later I looked it up and I think it was a P-38 airplane\nthat has a duel fuselage and that was a fighter which usually accommodated fuel for the bombers\nas an escort. At that time it was always our wishful thinking why can't they land and take us on\nboard, but that was wishful thinking.",
        "Q. When you were wishing did you think that you would get through this, that it would all\nbe over with soon.\nA. Well, at that time, when we saw the allied airplanes we began to sense that the end cannot\nbe far away because the airplanes flew unopposed from the Germans. I had never experienced\nany bombing raids, but it seemed to me that when Germany 1s not opposing the allied planes that\nin all likelihood they don't have enough planes to do anything about it to begin with. So, we\nthought that the end cannot be too far.\nQ. What other difficulties, or what were the greatest difficulties you had in hiding?\nAnything that you haven't mentioned?\nA. Only the constant fear of getting caught. The constant fear of getting caught. That was\nthe main, main issue item on our minds. When finally the war ends, that was the second item.\nAdditional difficulty, not knowing whether the information we get is truthful. What does it\nmean. The people who were listening to the news kept always telling us which town fell into\neither Russian hands or allied hands, so we were always trying to figure out how many miles left\nbefore they reached us. Then came the disappointing news that the Germans counterattacked\nand reconquered the town that they had lost a week earlier. Or the news came that either the\nRussians or the allies suddenly stopped, stalled, not advancing fast enough. Then the question on\nour minds was what will the Germans do when once they begin to retreat. Will they scorch\neverything while retreating. What route will they take when they do retreat. Many, many thing,\nthe majority of them I probably forgot already but these are some of the points that come to my\nmind today.\nQ. Did you know anything about the camps at that time?\nA. No.\nQ. Did you know anything about the Slovak National uprising in the summer of '44?\nA. Yes. Yes, we knew about that because when the uprising failed the partisans who\nparticipated dispersed through the mountains and some small units from it came to us with their\ninjured. I should perhaps mention that my father voluntarily worked for one year in a Slovak",
        "concentration camp as a dental doctor. I never found out how it came all about. Somebody\narranged for him to work as a dentist. The name of the camp was Wilno. It is on the Slovak map\nof camps. He must have made arrangement with the commandant of the camp that he will\nvoluntarily work there for one year and that at the end of the year he was let go. He was not part\nof the prisons that inhabited the camp, but I was never able to find out all the details about it.\nQ. So, at that time he was not living with you?\nA. At that time he was not with us in hiding. He joined us when the year expired, and\nstrangely enough, I do not know whether the Germans knew about it, because they never made\nclaim upon him. But again, from what I understand, the Germans lost interest in us not long\nafter we disappeared because they had other worries than one Jewish family. Furthermore, there\nis an interesting point which probably very few people know or are aware of. The Germans\nshipped from Slovakia the Jews to concentration camps but the Slovaks had to pay for it. The\nGermans didn't do it for the Slovaks free of charge. So, therefore, the Slovaks on one hand yes,\nwe want to get rid of the Jews but on the other hand we don't have money to pay you Germans\nfor the shipments of Jews. I have some place at home a balance sheet of how much each Jew\ncost the Slovak government in money for his shipment to Auschwitz or wherever he went.\nQ. Was there a sense of isolation?\nA. Yes, that was -- we felt very, very badly, the loneliness, the isolation from the rest of the\npopulation. Always the shining star was that one day the war will end and things will be back to\nnormal.\nQ. Do you have clear memories of any of your rescuers, any of the farmers that helped you\nor housed you?\nA. Only of one, because simply I have his photo at home. My sister sent it to me. He was\nprobably the most decent fellow under the sun. His name was , very simple\nfarmer. I'm not certain he knew how to read or write. He had a very, very small farm, but you\nhave to look with a magnifying glass to find a more decent person than he and his wife were.\nThat was a couple who practiced everything that was written in the Bible from A-Z, everything.",
        "At that time, he was already in his sixties. He died a natural death. That unfortunately, when the\nwar ended and I left for my trip to Israel. I left in 1949. I came back the first time for a visit in\n1965. Most of the people who helped us during the war were dead already. Additionally those\npeople who helped Jews during the second world war were not looked upon very favorably by\nthe communist government for reasons that I don't quite understand but that's how things took\nturn later on after the war had ended.\nQ. How were you liberated?\nA. Oh, about a week before we actually were liberated the farmer came very excited that the\nRussian front is very nearby and we actually heard artillery nearby and he said that it's a question\nof days or weeks before the whole front will collapse. Two days later he came and said yes, I\nthink it's safe for you to leave the bunker and you can join me and we will go to my farm and we\nwent straight to the attic, because we were not liberated yet. I remember that wall of the attic\nthat did not contain the hay had breaks in the wooden panels and I was looking outside and I saw\nsoldiers fleeing, German soldiers fleeing. While running they took off their jackets, their\ntrousers. Many times running only in their underwear, and then suddenly there was silence. The\nfarmer came up and said it's all over, you can come down. We came down we stayed for another\nday or two. I think that was the first time I took a bath. So did my parents after many years. My\nfather shaved for the first time. We threw away our clothes and got new ones and we went to the\nclosest town which was already liberated. But the town was not liberated by the Russians, it was\nliberated by Rumanian units because about a year before the second world war ended the\nRumanians switched sides and joined the Russians. My parents deposited me in an orphanage\nhome run by catholic nuns while they went to to see what happened to our\nhouse and grandparents went back to to see what happened to their house.\nQ. Do you remember the date of your liberation and the name of that town?\nA. The name of the town was . It must have been in May of '45. I stayed\nin that orphanage for about two or three days until my parents came back to fetch me and took\nme back to . We got the house back and they arranged for me private lessons",
        "with a school teacher because it was hoped and assumed that in September I would start a regular\nschool year. So, I spent the whole summer trying to catch up what I missed for the past five\nyears.\nQ. You were just given the house back? It was that easy?\nA. Well, it was not easy. We had to sue, but the police evicted the people who were in the\nhouse and said that should they win the case they will be permitted to reenter the house, but in\nthe mean time we have the first right to our own house.\nQ. When you returned was there a general feeling of welcome? How did the local people\naccept you?\nA. Well, the neighbors where my mother hid so many of our possessions claimed that\nnothing of it survived, that the Russians stole everything from them, which generally the\npopulation claimed whenever Jewish property was given to them for safe keeping, they claimed\nthat the Russians took it. The Russians were thieves, no doubt about it. When they saw an\nopportunity to steal something they did it. But they didn't do it wholesale, they did it\nsporadically here and there. In Germany they did it wholesale, but 1n Czechoslovakia they didn't\ndo it on a whole sale scale. So, it was an excuse and many Christians enriched themselves with\nJewish property.\nQ. In general how did they treat you?\nA. Many people came an openly apologized for not having talked to us during the war when\nthe law said that Christians cannot speak to Jews and Jews cannot speak to Christians. Many\nstore owners who had these signs, Jews not welcome, didn't know what to say so it was a very\nsort of an ambivalent situation. There were some Christians who openly said we are very sorry\nthat Hitler didn't kill all of you. It is difficult to generalize.\nQ. What did it feel like going back to this atmosphere?\nA. I think that our initial feelings were okay. Nobody now shoots at us. We can eat. We\ncan sleep in our own beds. We can start living or go back to normal life. I think it was a\ntremendous sense of relief. I do not believe that anyone that survived this holocaust had any",
        "desire for revenge at least not from those people who survived the war in the form in which we\nsurvived it. Now, I cannot speak on behalf of those in a concentration camp, but we had\npersonal beef against that unit that participated in raping my mother. We went to the trial and\nwere called as witnesses against the Slovak members of that unit. The German soldiers, they\ndisappeared. They went back to Germany, but the Slovaks were caught, because they\nparticipated in other atrocities, and each member of the Slovak party got the rope. That was\nsome satisfaction.\nQ. Any uneasiness when you came back?\nA. Well, uneasiness we did not know exactly how the future will evolve. There were of\ncourse trials. There were many Czechs who occupied high positions in the nazi government, but\nto what extent they influenced actually our departure of the transports, it was hard to ascertain.\nBecause the atrocities were usually committed by the small guys, the big guys up in the\nhierarchy, they just signed the documents giving the order, but the actual killing was committed\nby the little guys with the rifles, the bayonets. So, you are wondering how do you divide the\nguilt. Is that guy with the pen guiltier than the guy with bayonet. I don't know, I'm not God.\nQ. So, did you continue on? Did you go to school in the fall?\nA. Yes. I went to school. My father got replacement for his dental practice but in a different\ntown. We sold the house in and we moved to a different town where my father\nopened a dental practice. I kept going to school. I finished the required number of years of\nschooling by the Czech law, but then another disaster struck. The communists came, 1948.\nSomewhere and that now comes history into play, Truman Churchill and Stalin divided Europe\nand decided that Czechoslovakia will be under the Soviets influence, and the Czech government\nagreed. There again were traders that sold out the democratic government, the communist\ngovernment, which was in exile. There were two Czech governments in exile. One in London,\nwhich came back and was governing until 1948 and there was a lessor government in Moscow\nthat also came back and was undermining the democratic government and succeeded\noverthrowing the democracy in 1948 and took away its power and came to existence as the",
        "communist government of Czechoslovakia. We Jews who survived always thought about the\nSoviet and Russian pogroms under the Czars and we were afraid once Russian come to\nCzechoslovakia once again the anti-semitism for which the Poles and the Soviets are so very\nwell known that there will be another Holocaust. So, the majority of Jews, I among them,\nemigrated to Israel which in 1948, in May became a nation. My parents never accompanied me\nto Israel because the Czech government, again even under the communist realized that too many\ndoctors are leaving and they considered doctors to be of great importance to the national\neconomy and my father was caught in it and not permitted to accompany me to Israel, and I\nnever saw my parents again.\nQ. They lived out their life there?\nA. My mother committed suicide in 1953 and my father died of natural death in 1962 or\n1963. I came for my first visit in 1965 back to Czechoslovakia. I left Israel in 1959 and came to\nthe U.S. so in 1965 I finally had enough money to afford a trip back to Czechoslovakia, but by\nthen my father was dead already.\nQ. I know that this 1s a difficult thing to speculate on, but do you think that your mother's\ndeath was very much affected by these war time experiences?\nA. No doubt about it. No doubt. As a matter of fact I have proof and I'm in the middle of a\nfight with the Czech government about it. We were helped during our hiding years by two\nCzech fellows. These two fellows after liberation of Czechoslovakia joined an organization\ncalled American Czechoslovakia Friendship Club. When the communists took over\nCzechoslovakia, they became possession of membership lists of this club and they arrested all\nthe members on the list. These two fellows, somebody alerted them to the fact that they will be\narrested and because we lived not too far away from the Austrian border, they came to us trying\nto cash on their favor they did for us and my mother tried to arrange for the two of them an\nescape to Austria. Somebody revealed that plan to communist police and they arrested my\nmother. And they tortured her. So, under nazis she was raped and under communists she was\ntortured. On one occasion while at the police station, she jumped from a window and committed",
        "suicide. I have her death certificate issued by the Czech government but they are not willing to\nadmit that she committed suicide because of the torture by the communist police. That I cannot\nforgive them.\nQ. This must have been hard on your father?\nA. Yes, but I was never able to talk to him about it because when I came he was already\ndead some two or three years.\nQ. You weren't able to correspond with him while you were in Israel?\nA. Yes, we did but you have to understand that correspondence was censored. You never\nknew what to write whether that which you are writing will not be detrimental to them.\nQ. Now, the grandparents, you left behind, did you ever see them again?\nA. You mean my grandfather and grandmother who were with us in bunker?\nQ. No.\nA. Oh, my grandmother, she went with a transport and I do not know exactly whether she\ndied in or in Auschwitz. That transport, the had 900 people\nwent with the transport. I think 26 came back. There were in Czechoslovakia I think about\n270,000 Jews. After those that came back and went to Israel, Czechoslovakia was left with\nabout 12,000.\nQ. What happened to your sister?\nA. My sister survived the war under the false papers. She came back. She joined us, but she\nnever from that point on, was living as part of the family. I think the years that she was living\nunder the false papers as a secretary gave her a feeling of independence and after a few weeks of\nliving with us, she left and lived always in different towns completely independent. She worked\nas a secretary. She had great aptitude for foreign languages. I think she also for a time a teacher\nina school of languages. She knew extremely well German. Later on she got\nmarried and had children of her own.\nQ. As a Christian or a Jew?",
        "A. She married a Christian and I think that she raised her daughters without any religious\naffiliation. She still lives in . One of her daughters unfortunately was killed\nin a freak accident. She was a school teacher. The other daughter lives I think at the present\ntime in the capital of the Czech republic in Prague and I think she works in a hotel as a\nreceptionist.\nQ. How difficult was it for you to rebuild your life in Israel and in the United States? Was it\neasy to sort of start all over on your own?\nA. Well, I think that each country provided me with different challenges. I don't think you\ncan put them under one umbrella. The Israeli experience I think was the harder one of the two\nbecause I was much younger. I was only 17 when I came to Israel. About a half a year after\ncoming to Israel, I was already in the Israeli military. It was a newly established state which still\nhad many, many problems with their neighbors. First of all, in Israel, I was completely on my\nown. There is absolutely no resemblance of the Hebrew language to the Czech language, so the\nIsraeli experience was much harder than the American experience.\nQ. Were you lonely?\nA. In Israel? Very lonely. Very lonely, because in Israel, unfortunately we were always told\nof the harrows under the Nazis. The Israeli government was hoping to keep all the emigrants\nthere by reminding them that only in unity is there strength. And that is one of the reasons why I\nnever liked Israel because I always felt that the wound of the holocaust will never heal if you will\nbe continuously reminded of it every day and every day.\nEnd of Tape 3",
        "Tape 4",
        "Q. You stayed in Israel until when?\nA. 1959.\nQ. Why did you decide to leave?\nA. Well, those relatives that I had in Israel they were number one, very distant relatives.\nThey all had families of their own. Israel was a new country which at that time was in a constant\ndanger from its neighbors. Israel every day another group of emigrants came to Israel. There\nwas a great deal of unemployment and I was there as a seventeen year old boy when I came. I\nwas barely 20 when I exited the Israeli army, when I was discharged from the military\nobligation. I didn't have any schooling. I didn't have any skill and under conditions that existed\nat that time in Israel and my non existing support from relatives I was unable to learn any skill.\nFurthermore, the Israeli economy was very hard to figure out. You never knew what would be\nworthwhile studying or learning because of the influx of immigrants. Furthermore, the political\nline that Israel in those days pursued didn't give me any hope that one day there will be peace\nwith the neighboring countries. Additionally, every year I was at least two or three times called\nto serve in the military reserves. Inflation was tremendous. I was always on the edge of\nsubsistence and I didn't see any future for myself in Israel. So, I contacted my grandfather who\nsaved us from the holocaust and he once again put his machinery into work. Alerted the Israeli\nrelatives who were dispersed through the war, whether one of them could help. For a long time I\nwas led to believe that it will be my uncle who will be in the best position to help me. My\nfather's brother who did not participate in the holocaust. My father's brother was a very wealthy\ntextile merchant in Czechoslovakia who used to travel every year for his vacation to Switzerland.\nWhen the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia he was in Switzerland, so he never came back to\nCzechoslovakia. He lost most of his fortune, because the nazis confiscated and closed all the\nJewish accounts, but he was still left with a comfortable amount of money in Switzerland. But\nthe Swiss made clear to him that he cannot remain and he purchased from someone an entrance\nvisa to Canada. While on boat to Canada it was discovered that the Canadian visa was forgery",
        "and instead of landing in Canada he ended in the U.S. That is also something that he never\nwanted to reveal to me how he did it. But, elaborating on something which I did not cover\nearlier, there were people who already with the rise of Hitler sensed that the catastrophe facing\nEurope and left Europe in time. There were others who waited until the last minute and who in\none way or another succeeded leaving Europe. I have relatives who for example found a safe\nhaven in Shanghai having been occupied by Japanese. But the Japanese by far didn't match the\nbrutality of the Germans visa vie the Jews, and the emigrated after the war to Australia. My\nuncle emigrated to the U.S. Other distant relatives emigrated to Palatine. So, my grandfather\nmanufactured for me exit from Israel either to Australia or to the United States, but my uncle, for\nreasons of his own, never sent me the required documents. Those day, there was a crucial\ndocument for coming to U.S. called Affidavit of Support. That I finally obtained from much\nmore distant relatives in the United States and I was able to come in 1959 after having to wait\nfive years for the entrance to come. The United States had a quota system. I don't know whether\nthey still have it, and Czechoslovakia having been a very small country has a very small quota\nsystem, so the wait was very long.\nQ. When you first got there, what were your first impressions?\nA. Number one, because I came from Israel that despite its small size, Israel is a democracy,\nmany tourists from United States are visiting Israel, so I was very, very informed as to what I can\nexpect to find in the U.S. Once I was able to overcome the disappointment that it was not my\nuncle who sent me the Affidavit, I was able to take off almost immediately. I landed in New\nYork. I was living in a rooming house. I found employment as a shipping clerk. I started going\nto night school. I was finally able to finish evening high school. I enrolled in a college. I paid\nfor it from my own pocket. I finished that in ten years. I joined the U.S. Secret Service, which\npaid for my master's degree. After I got my B.S. I went back to Czechoslovakia and married my\nsweetheart and brought her over here. I was fine once I came to the U.S. When compared to\nIsrael or Czechoslovakia it was a cinch. The labor, the investment was visible immediately here",
        "in the U.S. if you are willing to work, there is no limit how high you can go. Absolutely no\nimpediment.\nQ. You were pretty resilient?\nA. I think the nazis had something to do with that. I think that I personally find in U.S.\neverything I was seeking. Let me put it this way. It's a love and hate relationship. It depends on\nwhat you read in the newspapers, how many murders we have. There are many aspects of life in\nthe U.S. that are not very nice, but when you put everything on a scale, I think that there is no\nother country that comes even close to the United States in its opportunities.\nQ. What did all the experience -- did it impact your sense of being Jewish or sense of being\nreligious at all, or the fact that you were hidden by Christians make you think differently about\nbeing Jewish?\nA. You know something, people always ask me do you think Judaism is a religion or is it a\nrace. I'm not certain. It depends where, when and under what conditions. The Germans\nconsidered it a race. In Israel I think it's considered a nationality because you would be surprised\nwhen I came to Israel how very, very few Jews ever attended synagogue. The feeling there in\nthose days was that now that Iam among my own people, why should I go to synagogue. The\nchildren in Israeli schools learned about the old testament, not from a religious point of view but\nfrom a historical point of view because it's Jewish history. Yes, I think that the feeling of\nJudaism which I have has been instilled on me by wearing the Jewish yellow star. By the years\nof reading the signs, Jews, to entry is forbidden. By being called Christ killer, these are the\nthings that make me aware of my Judaism.\nQ. Stigmatized?\nA. Stigmatized.\nQ. Do you feel any of the positive or spiritual aspects of it?\nA. No. I still keep looking over my shoulders and try to remain inconspicuous as possible.\nQ. So that's an obvious statement?",
        "A. Yes, definitely. You know, occasionally I do meet people who went through the same\nthing that I did, but those people who experienced it at a later stage in their lives, 1t seems to me\nwere able to better cope with it than I. It didn't seem to have left such an everlasting impression.\nAt least the first part of their lives was normal. In the middle of it they had a break, a bad break,\nbut because they were older when it happened to them, maybe they were able to figure it out in a\nmore sensible form than I was. I experienced that 1t became part of my growing up, part of my\nchildhood and definitely the nazi era has changed my life from A to Z. I have no doubt that\nmillions of other people have the same problem. Many of us immigrants wouldn't be here in the\nUnited States had it not been for the holocaust. I don't know whether the state of Israel would\nexist today had it not been for the holocaust.\nQ. Let me talk to you a little bit more about how it has this impact on you, how it has\naffected who you are today?\nA. Number one, if I can retrace my step and draw a line number one I would have had\nregular schooling that every child has. I would have been able to judging by the fact that my\nfather was a very well known dentist, I grew up in a middle class family, upper middle class\nfamily, I probably would have been in able to have a professional background in the Czech\nsociety. Probably instead of going to night school I would have been going to a regular school,\nand I would have achieved self actualization stage at a much earlier age. I would not have been\nforced to learn two foreign languages. Had I learned foreign languages, it would have been\nbecause I wanted to learn them and not because I needed to make livelihood under their\numbrella. It's pure speculation.\nQ. What about emotional or behavioral scars, have you thought about that?\nA. Yes. I do get very easily intimidated, very easily. I always seem to be looking for\nexcuses. I'd rather switch than fight.\nQ. Because?",
        "A. Because I'm afraid to confront an unpleasant situation head on. I would never be able to\noccupy a position like Ralph Nadar. He always confronts head on every situation. I would make\na very bad politician.\nQ. How do you think that seeing what your mother went through affected you?\nA. I cannot clarify it entirely because when I left Czechoslovakia it only began.\nQ. I'm talking about her attack.\nA. Oh, you mean when she was raped. I do not know. I cannot isolate that instance and take\nit out from the whole thing. I don't know how I would feel had it not taken place. I also cannot\nspeculate that the raiding party caught us on the way back to the barracks rather than on their\nway out, and had they taken us with them. There are many, many things left to speculation.\nQ. Are there certain other images that stick with you that you dream about at night that you\nhave never lost sight of?\nA. Yes. One image of that light coming from that guard house when we were crossing the\nborder to Slovakia. The noise of the dogs barking and the singing of the German soldiers that\nkeeps coming back and back and back again. I don't know because it's relatively benign, but I\nstill see that window. They had electricity in that hut. They didn't have any curtain. The light\nmust have been visible for miles.\nQ. What do you think got you through all of this?\nA. Luck and please don't ask me to define luck, I don't know. If you want to be more\nrealistic and not satisfy it with a phrase luck, I think that it was our grandfather who got us\nthrough it. Without him, never. We would have never been able to survive. But once that\nwhole move was put into motion, the whole thing was luck nothing more and nothing less.\nQ. Is there anything else you'd like to add?\nA. Probably not.\nQ. Thank you.\nA. My pleasure.",
        "A. (Viewing pictures) Now, you are seeing a star which every Jew throughout\nhad to wear over his heart. It was against laws to have it obscured in any\nfashion and the problem was that it had to be sewn on. You could not use any temporary\nattachment of the star to your jacket or to your shirt. You were responsible always for having the\nstar visible.\nQ. How did it make you feel wearing it?\nA. Well, have you read Harthorwn's Scarlet Letter? Like you are branded like cattle. What\nyou see here are two passports of my now deceased relatives who exited Austria in 1939. At that\ntime Austria was already under German occupation and it was considered part of Germany and\nas you can see the German passports were especially stamped with the letter J to alert the\nexaminer of this passport that this holder is Jew. Women had inserted after their first name,\nmiddle name Sarah, to fortify the fact that she's Jewish. As you can see, the photos all are\nstamped by Nazi stamp with the usual swastika and obtaining such a passport in 1939 was\nextremely difficult. There are many phases to these which are somewhat obscure because in\nsome cases the Germans permitted Jews to exit Europe but later they stopped it completely.\nWhat divided that line of thinking 1s not even very clear to historians and there are still many\ndebates about it. Here you see a photo of me with my mother and father and it was taken in 1933\nin . At that time still unoccupied Czechoslovakia. Here you see on this\nphoto my grandfather. The photo was taken in , here I am probably four\nyears of age. This is my grandfather's dog. I remember his name was and I\nam also with my sister. In all likelihood we are there on vacation.\nQ. And this is the grandfather who saved you?\nA. Yes, who saved our lives, yes. This picture shows me in the Israeli military and was\ntaken in all likelihood in 1951. That of course was taken in Israel.\nConclusion of Interview",
