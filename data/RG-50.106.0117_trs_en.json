        "Question: This is an interview for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Charles Stein conducted by Esther Finder on\nJune 8\"\", 1999 in Rockville, Maryland. This interview is part of the museum\u2019s\nproject to interview Holocaust survivors and witnesses who are also volunteers\nwith the museum. This is a follow-up interview that will focus on Mr. Stein\u2019s post-\nHolocaust experiences. In preparation for this interview I listened to the interview\nyou conducted with the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation on\nFebruary 27\", 1997. I will not ask you to repeat everything you said in that\ninterview, instead I will use this interview as an opportunity to follow up on that\ninterview and focus on your post-Holocaust experiences. This is tape number one,\nside A. What was your name at birth?",
        "Answer: My name was Karl Robert Stein. The only thing that is different from \u2014\nfrom present time is the first name. Karl was changed to Charles, but it \u2014 actually,\nI didn't change it. It was changed by the authorities in Luxembourg when they\nissued me a passport. They simply wrote in there, and my name in \u2014 in that\nLuxembourg stateless passport on which I traveled after I left Austria was \u2014 they\nJune 8, 1999\ntranslate it into the French, Charles, which is the same as \u2014 same spelling as\nCharles and that\u2019s remained that way.",
        "Q: Did you ever consider going back to the original spelling?",
        "A: No, no. Actually, when I was \u2014 even as \u2014 in Vienna, my friends, since I \u2014 I was\n\u2014 well, I was the only one in the group who \u2014 who spoke eng \u2014 en \u2014 of my friends\nthat spoke English, knew English. I\u2019d studied English. And so \u2014 I\u2019d seen, you\nknow, American movies and all that. So my \u2014 they called me, and \u2014 Charlie.\nActually, th-the way it sounded then, as they pronounced it, it sounded more like\nSharlie. So, it was nothing really new to me, and I remained with that.",
        "Q: Can you just tell me also your place of birth and your date of birth?",
        "A: Yes, I-I was born in Vienna, Austria on November 28\", 1919.",
        "Q: What languages did you speak in 1945?",
        "A: In 1945 I spoke English and German. German because I was at the time a\nprisoner of war interrogator in the army.",
        "Q: Where were you on V-E day?",
        "A: On V-E day I was somewhere on the Elbe river, facing the Russians on the\nother side, that\u2019s where we had to stop. I was with the ninth infantry division, 60\"\ninfantry regiment and I was at the time a captain in the U.S. Army and commander\nof a military intelligence unit, a prisoner of war interrogation team.\nJune 8, 1999",
        "Q: By V-E day, how long have you been in the service?",
        "A: By V-E day, I\u2019ve been in the service for just about four years. I was \u2014 originally\nI was drafted on October 7\u201c, 1941, two months before Pearl Harbor.",
        "Q: Had you seen combat in Europe?",
        "A: Yes, I saw combat. I got into \u2014 I was in the Normandy landings on the day after\nD-Day \u2014 I \u2014 after D-Day on \u2014 on June seventh. I was up on the beach, and my\nduties then were, again, I \u2014 I had a \u2014 an interrogation team and we were\ninterrogating prisoners of war. But under the \u2014 at that point, of course, it was\ncombat. It was combat and interrogating and shooting some more and so forth.\nEverybody was in combat then.",
        "Q: On your way through Europe, did you \u2014 did you encounter any concentration\ncamps that had just been liberated?",
        "A: Through Europe? Yes, the only one that I encountered on the way through the \u2014\nin the campaign was Nordhausen, concentration camp Nordhausen, which we\ncame upon not knowing where we \u2014 that there was a concentration until we \u2014 til we\nran into it. It was a \u2014 1t was a horrible experience. Knowing that my parents must\nbe in one of those, I \u2014 I sort of instinctively started looking around to see if I could\nsee my parents. It wa \u2014 it was a \u2014 an impression that stayed with me for a long\ntime. It was the \u2014 bodies lying around, people wandering around in a daze. We tried\nJune 8, 1999\nto, the little time that we had, we were moving pretty fast at the time, chasing the\nrest of the Germans in the direction of the \u2014 of the Russians. And we were there for\nabout a day or two, I did interrogate some of the guards. They \u2014 some of them, as I\nrecall, were Ukrainian guards that the survivors of \u2014 of the camp \u2014 many of them\nby the way in Nordhausen w-was one of the camps that had a lot of slave labors\nfrom eastern Europe, a lot of Yugoslavs that I encountered there. They wanted\nthose guards. And if I lost any of them on the way, I \u2014 I-I can\u2019t remember. But they\n\u2014 the guards were scared. I recall one guard, who absolutely refused to talk. And\nwe had ways of, you know, interrogate \u2014 ways of interrogate \u2014 this \u2014 this was not a\nfriendly interrogation, so we made them talk. Not by physical force in any way, but\nby \u2014 oh, various things. Like we have him take off his clothes. And when a man\nstands there in front of you without his clothes on, he\u2019ll start talking pretty soon,\nwe found out. That\u2019s an interesting thing we learned over \u2014 over the \u2014 we sort of\npicked up as we went through the war and \u2014 interrogation techniques that they\ndidn\u2019t teach us in school. But he f \u2014 he talked and I got \u2014 I got his story, of course, I\ncan\u2019t remember the details now. But I did get a \u2014 the story of some of the atrocities\nthat the \u2014 they were \u2014 they committed. I turned the people over \u2014 the \u2014 the guards\nover to the military police that picked them up and took them back to prison camps.\nJune 8, 1999",
        "Q: The guards that you said you \u2014 if you misplaced them along the way, you \u2014 you\ndon\u2019t remember, do you know what happened to those guards?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t. I have no idea.",
        "Q: You also said that you employed techniques that you didn\u2019t learn in school. Can\nyou tell me a little bit about your training in \u2014 in some of the techniques that you\nwere trained to use and some of the ones you learned along the way\u201d?",
        "A: Yes, well, in the military I was \u2014 I was \u2014 I went to \u2014I was originally in field\nartillery. I went to officer candidate school and became \u2014 I was an artillery officer.\nAnd then I was, shortly after graduation at Fort Sill, Oklahoma where the artillery\nschool was, I was tapped for intelligence because of my background in languages\nand so forth. I was called one night \u2014 one evening I was called in and was told that\nWashington, in quotes, at that time wanted me to go to \u2014 wanted me to go to the\nintelligence school, which was at Fort Ritchie, right in \u2014 1n Maryland here, then\ncalled Camp Ritchie. That was the military intelligence school and we went\nthrough interrogation training and all kinds of intelligence training. Oh, we learned\nall kinds of things like Morse code, which I have never used in my life. Don\u2019t\nknow anybody who ever did, and folder interpretation, map reading of foreign\nmaps, which was important because some of the captured maps we had to \u2014 to\nknow what we saw, and we had all kinds of field training with those. These were\nJune 8, 1999\nMaryland \u2014 Maryland maps, maps of the \u2014 of the Ritchie area, but printed in\nvarious languages including Japanese. I remember one night that they dropped me\noff someplace at a place and gave me this \u2014 this map. And from landmarks and all\nthat, you identified where you were and which way you were going. Well, that was\nimportant but in \u2014 basically for me that was not a problem because I was fluent in\nGerman, of course, my native language, I also knew French. And that\u2019s the\ndirection we went in, so once we got there, I could easily read those maps if \u2014 if\nnecessary. We were trained in order of battle, identifying \u2014 we learned everything\nabout the German \u2014 we knew more about the German army, their uniforms, their \u2014\ntheir insignia. That was all part of \u2014 of the training and the units, the organization\nof the German army, what units looked like, what they were, how ba \u2014 how strong\nthey were, etcetera. That was all part of it because that was all part of \u2014 of the\ninterrogation process. And so when we \u2014 when I got into \u2014 to the combat are \u2014\nzone, interrogating the people was simple. One thing, for example, was that every\nGerman had what was called a soldbuch, a paybook. Now that soldbuch \u2014\nsoldbuch had all his military a-assignments listed in there. And it was easy to\nfigure out who he was and what he was. So the first thing we\u2019d ask them is, give\nme your soldbuch. And they would hand it over and you had them right there, that\nwas \u2014 now you knew. And so then you would say, oh you were from the 338\"\nJune 8, 1999\nFisilier-Batallion(ph), yeah? And he\u2019d say yeah, and take it from there. Most of\nthe interrogations were actually not difficult. Most of them talked. Now you ran\ninto some, officers mainly, who said name, rank and serial number, that\u2019s all they\nwould give you. But again, you \u2014 we \u2014 all of us, I think, found ways to \u2014 to break\nthem. For example is one thing, a German, regardless of whether you were friend\nor enemy, respected rank. So you made sure that the insignia you were \u2014 you were\nwearing at the time, and we had a complete collection of it, were at least one rank\nhigher than the man we had, and we could read that. So we \u2014 we played that game,\nit was \u2014 if you had time for it. Now a lot of \u2014 most of it was right up in the front\nlines, so you didn\u2019t have time to \u2014 to play games. And at those times we would just\nplay tough, yeah. Threaten, all kinds of things, you know, we would \u2014 we \u2014 we\u2019d\nsay \u2014 we\u2019d tell them, okay, we\u2019ll let you walk back home, right through the front\nlines. Of course they wouldn\u2019t do that cause they\u2019d get shot. And things like that,\nand they would \u2014 I don\u2019t really recall anyone I could not break in an \u2014 in an\ninterrogation, and I\u2019ve interrogated thousands of them. Now, what we did with the\ninformation, and we \u2014 we \u2014 in my case, being in the front lines, I would \u2014 my\ntargets were who was opposing us, how strong are they, where are they located,\nwhat kind of weapons do they have, where\u2019s their artillery. And I would\nimmediately call in to artillery to give them the coordinate of locations so that they\nJune 8, 1999\ncould fire on it, and my infantry units that I supported would get all the information\n\u2014 the \u2014 the intelligence officer of the unit would get all the information that was\nrelevant to who \u2014 who was on the other side of the line, what was their morale, how\n\u2014 how strong were they, what kind of weapons did they have. And that went \u2014 well,\nwe had a lot of good results. One of the things that I and my team always did was\nwhen we had specific targets that we could identify, after we had pushed through\nthe area we checked those targets to make su \u2014 to see if they had been hit like we \u2014\nand I think most of them were. So, it was \u2014 in Normandy it was \u2014 is rough, cause\nwe were going from hedgerow to hedgerow, you know, one hedgerow at a time,\nand you know, a hundred \u2014 a hundred yards a day, things like that. But after that, of\ncourse, on the run, that was a little different. Once we broke through, it was \u2014 it\nwas a different story, it was easier then.",
        "Q: You mentioned in your interview for the Shoah Foundation that British\nintelligence was superior to American intelligence. Can you clarify that point for\nme?",
        "A: Yes, I\u2014I went to \u2014I was shipped to England in December of 1943. I was in\nEngland until \u2014 until D-Day, so that was six months from \u2014 in England. And at\nthe time I was sent to \u2014 from where we were out in the near \u2014 in the country\nsomewhere, I was sent to London to study with \u2014 with British intelligence. They\nJune 8, 1999\nhad some schools and they \u2014 they took us into \u2014 and gave us some \u2014 some\ninformation. The British had a lot more experience. We had absolutely no\nexperience, we were new. We were \u2014 all of \u2014 not \u2014 I\u2019m not just talking about the \u2014\nthe front line type intelligence, but the OSS didn\u2019t exist until just about that time.\nAnd they had never, the people in the OSS were not what the British had trained\nfor years and years as intelligence officers. We all learned fr \u2014 by \u2014 by doing. The \u2014\nI had some contact with OSS people afte \u2014 on \u2014 well, on \u2014 actually still in Europe,\nbut on the way home. They were going home at the same time, and I listened to\nsome of their stories. They were dropped \u2014 one particular I remember, who was an\nartist, or at least that is what he \u2014 he faked. He was of Italian descent, a New\nYorker who spoke Italian. He was dropped into Normandy and he sat around\npainting. He was \u2014 to the Germans he was an Italian painter visiting here, and was\nfriendly right, to \u2014 Italy was a friendly country. And that\u2019s the way he collected\nintelligence. But he said he had absolutely no idea what he was doing when he first\ngot in there. He got in by parachute, got \u2014 the French helped him \u2014 French\nunderground helped him. And then he \u2014 he sat aro \u2014 he tha \u2014 he started painting and\nreporting and they had equipment to \u2014 to report. And he was around Normandy\nand the Sherbrooke(ph) peninsula doing this artwork. Course na \u2014 he brought\nnothing home. He all gave that to \u2014 to his French comrades there. But again, no\nJune 8, 1999\nexperience. Everything was \u2014 whatever we did was done for the first time, on the\nU.S. side. And now, as I said, the British, of course, had been doing their in-\nintelligence work, collection of intelligence all over the world with the \u2014 with the\ncolonies and all that. So \u2014 a-and in World War II, of course, they\u2019d been in the war\nfor three years before we came in, or almost three years. That was wa-why I said\nthat their \u2014 their intelligence was better, they were better organized. We were just\nlearning, but we got there. We \u2014 just like everything else, I think, in the \u2014 1n the\nU.S. Army. That army had absolutely no experience, we came from all over the\nplace. Nobody \u2014 there were no real soldiers at th \u2014 in 1941. By 1944 we did the \u2014\nthe biggest \u2014 biggest job ever done in any \u2014 any invasion. And it was successful. So\nI guess as Americans, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re quick learners. We picked up an awful lot\nfrom the British. They were very helpful. They taught us then. The schools that I\nwent to in \u2014 in London during that period were very informative, because we\ntalked to people who had been there, who had been there, done that and told us how\n\u2014 how they did whatever we were doing later on. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s about \u2014 that\u2019s\nabout it for \u2014 on that.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you learned some things on your own and you were\nsuccessful in \u2014 in your interrogations. And you mentioned one thing that they\ndidn\u2019t teach you was to have your prisoner \u2014\nJune 8, 1999",
        "A: Strip.",
        "Q: \u2014 get undressed, right. What other kind of things did you improvise?",
        "A: Well, there are \u2014 there were \u2014 for example, the \u2014 the \u2014 what they didn\u2019t teach us,\nthey taught us that e-every soldier has a soldbuch, but didn\u2019t tell us what to do with\nit. That is we picked up ourselves. I \u2014 I picked up the first one I looked at and I\nsaid, there it is. And I asked the man ha \u2014 you were up with \u2014 I told him, I didn\u2019t\nask him, I told him, you were up from this and this regiment, or this \u2014 and they said\nyes. And before that you were something else. One of the things that we did was\nwhen \u2014 when time allowed, was engage in some small talk. Small talk about, well,\nyou got your family back home, and that would open up suddenly, and then you\nlead into other things. I had some interesting interrogations. I had \u2014 and this is \u2014\nthis is one in a\u2014 in a\u20141na billion, probably. Had a prisoner, this \u2014 we were about \u2014\nwe were in Germany at the time. And he had very little information, but he was\nwilling to talk. He said tha \u2014 actually, he deserted he told me. I\u2019m not sure that that\nwas right, but it didn\u2019t matter. But I noticed in papers that he had on him that he\nwas a medical student at the University of Vienna. And so I asked him a \u2014 whether\nhe was \u2014 took anatomy from Professor Bernkopf(ph) Versowzer(ph) and his\nmouth opened and he se \u2014 di-di-ta-ba \u2014 how \u2014 but how did you know? I said, I\u2019m\nan intelligence officer, I know everything. And he just couldn\u2019t understand why,\nJune 8, 1999\nand then he started opening up and told me all kinds of things about what happened\nto his family and others. His mother-in-law was mentally incompetent and she was\nin \u2014 in Vienna in a place that was known to me, that was the insane asylum in\nVienna, there was one big one. And she had been killed, and he told me that they\nwere killing these \u2014 well, handicapped people, mentally handicapped. They didn\u2019t\nneed them, so they killed them. And you know, he was mad and so he said he\ndeserted. Well, took him a long time to desert. But th \u2014 it-1t\u2019s that kind of thing that\n\u2014 that those are interesting little things that happened. There were many of them, of\nthe different nature. For example, in the Battle of the Bulge, the unit I was with was\nholding one of the \u2014 you know, the corners of \u2014 of the thing. We were not\npenetrated, but we \u2014 we \u2014 we went in there to hold it, and that was in the famous\nBattle of the Hiirtgen Forest. And there was a German lieutenant colonel in there\nwith his troops, holding out. And we could \u2014 it\u2019s a dense forest and we just couldn't\nget him out. And one day one of \u2014 a couple of Germans came out with a white flag\nand said that they\u2019re currently \u2014 name I \u2014 I can\u2019t remember the name, but it was a\nrather, later on, well known in \u2014 in \u2014 in the history of the war. What was his name?\nWell, can\u2019t remember. Anyhow, so who was sent in to bring \u2014 yeah, he was sick.\nHe was very sick and he wanted to surrender. And so who was sent in to bring him\nout, of course? The only one who spoke German. And in I went and I got him out\nJune 8, 1999\nand we had \u2014 the man had pneumonia very badly. But \u2014 and, you know,\ninterrogating him at this point was really not necessary. There was nothing he could\ntell us in the \u2014 in the present situation. But he was on his own, just started talking as\nwe carried him out. His own men carried him on a stretcher. And we came out of\nthe forest and then we waited until he was evacuated. And he just told us all kinds\nof war stories, was just great. Good information. Not necessarily tactical\ninformation, but strategically important of how decisions were made and all that.\nWell, we took that down and got it back to higher headquarters and I don\u2019t know\nwhat they did with it, but at least the information was there. So these were the kind\nof things that you fell into occasionally.",
        "Q: Did any people that you interrogated know you were Jewish?",
        "A: Yes. Some of them, I told them. Particularly the Waffen SS. I wanted them to\nknow, because I \u2014 I knew that the \u2014 well, it put some fear into them. Although, I\u2019m\nnot sure that they were anywhere near any of the atrocities or anything like that.\nBut the Waffen SS was a tough outfit, in the beginning. Not in the \u2014 t-towards the\nend of the war, they filled in the blanks in \u2014 in the \u2014 the blank spaces in those\norganizations with just about anybody, including, I think, I\u2019m not sure whether I\ntold that \u2014 told you that story earlier about the boy, about a 17 year old kid who\ntold me that he was an American. I said, oh yes? He said yes. He said, take off my\nJune 8, 1999\nboot. Took off his boot, took out an innersole and came out with a green card with\na baby\u2019s picture on it. His family had gone \u2014 had come to America and his parents\nwere in \u2014 in Los Angeles. Yeah, came to America in the \u2014 sometime in the late\n20\u2019s, early 30\u2019s, I guess. He was a baby then, and was a small \u2014 small \u2014 small child.\nThey applied for a \u2014 they became permanent residents and probably, his parents\nlater, citizens. But he was sent to his grandmother in Germany to go to school,\nthey wanted him to go to school in Germany. Well, he did, he went back, and war\nbroke out and when he got to be about 16 or so they pulled him in, this was towards\nthe end of the war. And there he was in a Waffen SS uniform. That thing made the\nnewspapers, by the way. I had \u2014 happened to have somebody when I \u2014 I called the\nthing in. I said \u2014 I said, ve got \u2014 I\u2019ve got an \u2014 an American Waffen SS guy here.\nAnd I told my G2 about that, and apparently there were some \u2014 I think Associated\nPress newsmen there, they wanted to see us. They say, hold him there, we \u2014 we\u2019 ll\nbe right down. They took a picture. I still have a clipping at home of that and\ntalking about Captain Stein talking to \u2014 to this kid, whose showing his \u2014 that he\nwas an American. Well, he was still a prisoner of war in a \u2014 I guess we \u2014 we had to\nprocess him that way, cause he was a German soldier.",
        "Q: When did you realize the full extent of the genocide?\nJune 8, 1999",
        "A: Not really until the end of the war, until about V-E day. When we \u2014 when I\ntalked to some people in \u2014 well, some Germans at that point, we were at the Czech\nborder \u2014 no, that was afterward. We were still on the Elbe. And we had some\ncommunication with the Russians, who had come across many of the concentration\ncamps in the east. And they were telling us what they had found. Millions of people\nkilled and although we had interpreters, Russian interpreters, we had a meeting ta \u2014\neven before V-E day, it \u2014 it was in late April, we were on the Elbe and we stopped,\nand the Germans stopped on the other side, that was agreed that we would \u2014 that\nElbe was the \u2014 the \u2014 the border between the two zones. And we had arranged and I\nwas invol \u2014 I was included in that with our general \u2014 meetings with the Russian\ngeneral. We got together and we spent a couple of days of just talking through\ninterpreters. And that 1s the first time that I really found out what had happened.\nAnd of course, my parents were on my mind, and not only my parents, the rest of\nmy family, too. That\u2019s when the search began. Of course, after V-E day, I could not\n\u2014I wanted to go to Vienna. Figured that \u2014 I knew \u2014 I had known that my parents\nhad been deported to L\u00e9dz, because in \u2014 it was two weeks after I went into the\narmy in \u2014 in October \u00b041, I got a postcard that is \u2014 it came to New York and to my\n\u2014 the second cousin who lived in New York, or \u2014 was my \u2014 my address that I had.\nAnd he brought it to me and saying that a postcard had come saying that my\nJune 8, 1999\nparents were being deported in October of \u201941, to Litzmannstadt, Lodz, to the\nghetto. That\u2019s the last information I had. After that, nothing. And so I wanted to go\nto Vienna, but the army wouldn\u2019t let me. As an intelligence officer, the Russians\nwere in \u2014 had \u2014 had Vienna at the time and that part of Austria and they wouldn\u2019t\nlet us go into the Russian zone. So at that point I decided Pll go home, to New\nYork at that time. And by October \u2014 the war was over in March \u2014 1n \u2014 1n \u2014 excuse\nme, in May, May the ninth, excuse me. And we were \u2014 my team was pulled out in \u2014\nin July and sent back to Paris where our headquarter \u2014 military intelligence\nheadquarters was. First to \u2014 to another place in \u2014 in Germany and then to Paris.\nAnd we stayed there for shipment home. There were lots of things at that point, we\ncould have signed up as a civilian to civil government and all the things that were\ngoing on, but I decided my best bet was to go home and start looking from \u2014 from\nthat angle, and if necessary I\u2019d come back as a civilian and of course, I intended to\nget out of the army, which I did in 1945, and I was separated in \u2014 in the 14\" of\nDecember, 1945, and signed on as a reserve officer. I stayed on in the reserves.",
        "Q: What was your rank when you \u2014 1-in December \u201945.",
        "A: Captain. Yes, I started out, of course, in \u2019\u00b041 as a private. In \u201943 I went to\nO.C.S., became second lieutenant, was promoted in Normandy to first lieutenant\nJune 8, 1999\nand later that \u2014 a little later in the campaign to captain on two battlefield\npromotions.",
        "Q: In your previous interview you mentioned that your father had been in the\nmilitary. Did his military career have any impact on your career?",
        "A: No, none, none whatsoever. I have a few photos that were given to me by\nrelatives after the war, who had survived. Was my father in uniform, wa \u2014 one of\nthem with \u2014 with him in uniform and me in a \u2014 in a baby carriage, and my mother,\nof course there too. So those \u2014 those are \u2014 that\u2019s about the only thin \u2014 we talked\nabout it, but that had no influence on me.",
        "Q: After World War II, did you ever consider going to Palestine?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, there were a number of things that I was just thinking about in \u2014 in the\nend of 1945 and early \u201946. As a matter of fact, I was thinking about going to\nPalestine when I was still in Vienna. I was signed up for a transport, one of those\nyouth transports in \u2014 back in 1938, immediately after the anschluss. But when the\nopportunity came to get away to Luxembourg, I couldn\u2019t wait, that \u2014 that was a\nlong s\u2014 a long, drawn out process. They weren\u2019t going anywhere. We met\nperiodically, all the \u2014 well, some of us, but nothing happened. As a matter of fact,\nmy \u2014 one of my cousins, about four years younger than I, who stayed on then,\ndidn\u2019t get out until about a year later. It took that long before the transports went,\nJune 8, 1999\nthat\u2019s just about 1939, in the fall of 1939 they finally got them out, then through\nYugoslavia and then on a ship and in-into a \u2014 well, the \u2014 the Exodus story. But \u2014\ninto Palestine. I couldn\u2019t wait. I was \u2014 I was too old. I was 18 and I was in\nimmediate danger so I left. Yes, I wanted to go and I \u2014 and grew up in a Zionist\nidea. A-After the war I was \u2014 yes, I wanted to go, I \u2014 I thought of going. I also\nthought of going back to medical school, and I was accepted in 1940 \u2014 19 fift \u2014 \u00b046,\nit \u2014 in Switzerland, in \u2014 both in \u2014 in Zurich and Basel(ph).",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, I have to pause to change tape.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: \u2014 for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Charles Stein. This is tape number one, side B. And I had asked\nyou about if you had considered going to Palestine and you were telling me that\nyou did have some Zionist thoughts and you were considering going to Palestine\nand also you were considering medical school.",
        "A: Right. In early \u201946, I was considering both of these things. And in \u2014 I was\naccepted. I had written to and sent my \u2014 my papers to \u2014 o-of my previous studies to\nBasel(ph) and Zurich and I was accepted in both of them, provisionally, if space\nwas available in later years. I was accepted for the first year, but for one year only\nJune 8, 1999\nand depending on space available, whatever. And at the same time, I had \u2014 this was\nnow early 1946, and I had talked to a lot \u2014 lot of people, you know, after returning\nand I found out how all these people made all this money, in all kinds of things.\nAnd I said maybe I ought to do \u2014 make a little money, I had none. I had whatever I\nhad saved from my army pay, which wasn\u2019t very much. I wasn\u2019t working, I had not\nfound a way to \u2014 to do anything and so I said why, why don\u2019t I do something else\nfirst? So I\u2014 I dropped Palestine and I dropped medicine and I went into the export\nbusiness. Opened my own busin \u2014 I took \u2014 well, first of all I had to learn something\nabout the export, and that was the big thing then that I \u2014 I found out. And I had to\nlearn something about it. Fortunately 1-in the newspapers I found a two week\ncourse that would teach me all about it, and that\u2019s exactly what I did, I\u2014 I went \u2014 I\nmean, this is strictly an amateur performance at the time. I went and took a two\nweek course and I knew all about it, I knew how to \u2014 what kind of documents you\nneeded, and how \u2014 and all I needed now 1s to find out what I was going to sell and\nwhere. Well, I and a fr \u2014 a\u2014 a wartime buddy of mine, friend, we\u2019d been through\nthe war together, and I, decided we\u2019d go into the export business, and we did. And\nwe si \u2014 decided that the electrical appliances were a good thing, we \u2014 I guess we\nliked electrical appliances, so we went into that and we decided that we would do\nSouth America \u2014 Latin America as \u2014 as our target. That, we had read was good\nJune 8, 1999\nplace to do, and we did. Went into business, we \u2014 we got in contact with some\nmanufacturers of appliances, and we went to various embassies and asked for their\nimporter \u2014 lists of importers, which was available. And we started writing let \u2014 by\nthat time, by the way, I had taken, soon as it came back, I started taking a Spanish \u2014\nI don\u2019t know why, but the G.I. bill was there and I didn't know what else to do with\nit until I went to medical school, which would have been \u2014 so I took Spanish and I\nwas fairly fluent in Spanish by that time, it was now middle of 1946. By that time\nwe \u2014 we got to the point where I n \u2014 I needed. And so I wrote up a catalog in\nSpanish, we put that up and a \u2014 a letter to all the customers and began working.\nPretty soon we were making a little money, not very much. Not enough to live on,\nbut there was still a G.I. bill that helped us out with that. And it lasted for \u2014 until\nearly 1948. In early 1948 there was a sudden stop of dollars. The dollar was no\nlonger available for payment to foreign countries, there was a shortage of d \u2014 of\ndollars, there was \u2014 there were \u2014 there were exchange restrictions. And so the big\ncom-companies could give, you know, six months credit to \u2014 to compan \u2014 the little\ncompanies, like ours, we couldn\u2019t give any credit, we worked strictly as letter of\ncredit. They sent a letter of credit in dollars to our bank and as soon as the ship \u2014\nwe could turn over the shipping documents, that the merchandise had been shipped,\nthe bank would release the money. Well, that stopped, there were no more dollar\nJune 8, 1999\nletters of credit and so we went out of business. And then started an interesting\nperiod. I didn\u2019t know which way to turn, I \u2014 I\u2019d never even looked for a job, I\ndidn\u2019t know how to look for \u2014 well, I\u2014 I knew how, but th-th-th \u2014 I didn\u2019t know\nwhat. I \u2014 so I went around and went to an employment office, one of those\nemployment agencies and they said yeah, as a matter of fa \u2014 it was on 46\" Street\nand Fifth Avenue, I remember. And they said yeah, we have a job. There\u2019s \u2014\nthere\u2019s a job opened right across the street here at a place called Nancy Studios,\nhat makers. Feather hats. You know, pasted feather on \u2014 on the thing. And \u2014 I\nmean, I \u2014 I found that out when I went to \u2014 to Nancy\u2019s. And so I went ik \u2014 went\nover there and they needed someone to run their office. Apparently whoever had\nthe office had quit \u2014 was running the office had quit. So I went up there and\nthere\u2019re two ladies running the shop and I said, here I am. They said oh yes, you\u2019ll\ndo. We \u2014 you know, told them who I was and what I had done, I had my own\nbusiness and all that. And they \u2014 they \u2014 they thought that was \u2014 that was good, so\nmy major job was making up the payroll and invoices and making sure that money\ngot to the bank and so forth. But the environment wasn\u2019t for me. This was a \u2014 a\u2014\nthe two ladies was Nancy and her sister were the designers of these hats. Their\nclientele was \u2014 were all name designers. Hattie Carnegie, Lily Dach\u00e9, a-all kind \u2014\nyou know, th-the \u2014 well known names in the fashion business, and they would\nJune 8, 1999\ndesign special things for them, and others. Had about 20 or 30 women doing the\nwork, so it was not a small place. But I started dealing with the clients and that\u2019s \u2014\nit was something I couldn\u2019t take. I-It was a strange \u2014 you know, being called\ndarling by these floating characters who were dressed in diff \u2014 1-1t was not \u2014 not my\n\u2014my cup of tea. But I worked, I \u2014 I had to make a living and I was looking around.\nAnd \u2014 and I worked there during the summer. I came home one day in September,\nit was September of \u201948, and I looked at my mail and there was a letter there from\nthe Pentagon. I opened it up and it said, dear Captain Stein, we want you back. We\nhave a special project here which 1s right in line with your experience during the\nwar and please call this number. So I called the number in \u2014 in the \u2014 in\nWashington and talked to a major and he said \u2014 he told me what it was. It was in\nthe office of the chief of military history, translating the experiences of the German\ngeneral staff that apparently the United States had under contract of some sorts, in\nand out of jail in Germany, that were writing their heart out about their\nexperiences on the eastern front in Russia. And I said that sounds interesting, yes,\nI\u2019m available. And in Novem \u2014 early November, starting in nove \u2014 as a matter of\nfact, the third of November, I \u2014 I came into Washington. Harry Truman and I\ncame at th \u2014 came together. That was the day Harry Truman was elected. I came\ninto Washington, back in uniform, and I was in the Pentagon, became chief of the\nJune 8, 1999\ntranslation section of milt \u2014 o-office of chief of military history and I spent the next\nthree years there translating and \u2014 and writing. And by that time, of course, in\n1950, summer of 1950 the Korean war broke out, and \u2014 \u201950 or \u201951 \u2014 yeah, *50.\nWell, I still had some \u2014 a year to go and \u2014 on my \u2014 my three yea \u2014 it was a three\nyear appointment. And when the time was up, my time was up, I was told that\nnobody gets out, there\u2019s a war on. And I was told that I was \u2014 but I was told I was\ngoing to Germany, to the German side of our project. And two weeks later I got\nmy orders saying report to San Francisco for shipment to Korea. And there I was,\nnot exactly going to Germany. Well, I went to Korea, and went, checked in, was\nreceived by the officer in charge of \u2014 of that unit and \u2014 who said, do you speak \u2014 is\nit\u2014 you came here as a prisoner of war interrogator, which was one of my\nspecialties. Oh, let me back up for a moment. While I was still in Washington,\nwhen I got my orders and I read this thing, that I \u2014 I was going over with the MOS,\nthe specialty as a \u2014 as a prisoner of war interrogator, I went down to what we called\nKorean man \u2014 what was called Korean management, we called it Korean\nmanglement, and was talking to some old colonel who\u2019d been there since world \u2014\nsince the Civil War, I think. Looked like it. And I said look, I have \u2014 you\u2019re\nsending me to Korea with a 93-16. I don\u2019t speak any of those languages. And he\nsaid, well, we didn\u2019t asked for no languages, they just said they wanted 93-16s.\nJune 8, 1999\nAnd I said, yes, sir. I knew there was nothing \u2014 yeah \u2014 well, I talked to this major\nand he said, do you speak Korean? I said nope. He said, Japanese? The Koreans in\nthe \u2014 in the army at that time grew up under Japanese occupation, so most of them\nspoke \u2014 still spoke some Japanese, too. I said nope. He said, Chinese? I said, nope.\nHe says, you\u2019re another one. I said, you mean you have more? He said yes.\nThey\u2019ve been sending us 93-16s and we have \u2014 none of them speak Korean. Okay,\nthey said, but never mind, we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll have an assignment for you. And I was\nassigned to eighth \u2014 eighth army headquarters and research and \u2014 and \u2014 yeah, and\nresearch, intelligence research. And later on, couple of months later I was\nreassigned as chief of the order of battle, a division of \u2014 of eighth army\nheadquarters. But the experience there was again, this now is December, end of\nDecember 1951. Cold, ice cold, bad weather and all that, and the chief of\nintelligence, Colonel Bump(ph) when I reported in, I and two other reported in at\nthe same time, said well, ve got an assignment for you, I want you to go up to the\nsecond infantry division up in the hills and observe the air support for our infantry,\nand Ill call you back when the time comes. So we sat up there for about three\nweeks in the foxholes, on top of these ridges, watching air support, getting shot at.\nWe didn\u2019t do any shooting then, infantry did. Watching the patrols go out and all\nthat. Anyhow, we got back three weeks later and came in and I was this \u2014 the\nJune 8, 1999\nsenior of the three of us and so I\u2014 I reported. We came in and we saluted and said,\nColonel, we have a report for you on the \u2014 on the air support. We had put our notes\ntogether and whipped up a report. He said, oh, I don\u2019t want your report, I know all\nabout what\u2019s going on up there. I just sent you up there because nobody works for\nme who doesn\u2019t get his feet wet. You know what the war is like, now you can start\nworking on it. Was a good idea. Not for \u2014 for \u2014 not while we were up there. Okay,\nso we \u2014 | \u2014 then I \u2014I started working and th \u2014 stayed there for \u2014 until January of\n1953, by which time I have had enough of the war and of the army and well, there\n\u2014 there happened to be a \u2014 a \u2014 there happened to be something that no \u2014 none of us\nknew. In the fall of 1952, all the reserve officers got a letter saying that your \u2014 th-\nthe \u2014 you were extended, your \u2014 your fi \u2014 your army still had a five year dur \u2014 as \u2014\nof reserve officers, five years at a time, you had to renew every five years. The\nother services had already changed to permanent. And so we did th \u2014 by executive\norder, ba \u2014 ba \u2014 the president, and when the Korean war broke out all reserve\nofficers were frozen, they had to stay in the \u2014 a-all commissions were extended.\nBut the law expired on the first of April 1953. So all of us who were in Korea in\n1952 had to be home and out of the army by \u2014 by the first of April, and the army\ndecided that they were going to get us out by January to give us a chance \u2014 to give\nus time to get back to the United States and get processed out. And so we got this\nJune 8, 1999\nletter saying we\u2019d like you to sign up for the permanent and you\u2019ll go on and all\nthat. And statistics later on came out that said 66 percent of all the reserve officers\nsaid thank you but no thank you, including myself. And then in December of 1952,\nI happened to be \u2014 I still had an R and R leave, five days in \u2014 in Tokyo, I flew over\nto Tokyo, and I ran into some old friends of mine and one of them said, wa \u2014 when\nyou \u2014 where you going? I said well, I\u2019m going home in January. By the end of\nJanuary I should be on the way home. And he said, what are you going to do? And\nI said I have no idea. I have no place to go, I have no \u2014 no \u2014 no connections\nanywhere. So I'll just go home and I'll \u2014 Il find something. Well, in the \u2014 he said,\nthe \u2014 oh, this \u2014 this friend said, well hey, ve got a job for you, a civilian job here\nin Tokyo. I\u2019m heading up a new office in \u2014 on the first of January. There\u2019s a new\ncommand being formed, the United Nations and far e \u2014 and Far East command, a\ncombined command and I\u2019m head of the intelligence policy division and I have one\ncivilian slot, a senior civilian and you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re it, 1f you want it. So I went down\nto personnel and they explained what it was, and they explained to me what it \u2014\nwhat it pays and it paid more than a captain. And all the perks with it and I said\nyeah, why not. And I signed up right there and they say yeah, you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re qu \u2014\nI told them \u2014 I had to write up what I was doing and for \u2014 fill out a form. And they\nsaid yeah, you qualify. And so there I was, and I stayed on in Tokyo as a civilian\nJune 8, 1999\nintelligence officer until 1955, when I returned home. That was also the time a little\nlater that same year, \u00b053, when I met this air force lieutenant, female, who showed\nup there and about a year and a half later we were married. And Barbara\nKinney(ph) became Barbara Stein. We were married in Tokyo.",
        "Q: I have several questions, but first let me start with your getting married. What\ndid you tell your wife about yourself and about your past when you met her and\nyou courted her?",
        "A: Well, first thing I told her was that where \u2014 where I had come from, and I told\nher that I lost my family and I still didn\u2019t know where they were or what happened\nto them, which is something previously that I had tried all the time. I tried the Red\nCross and the HIAS and the jayce \u2014 the JDC, the Jewish community in Vienna\nwho in 1946 did send me a \u2014 a little form letter saying your parents were deported\nthrough Litzmannstadt and did not appear on any survivor lists. That\u2019s all I had.\nBut where and what, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t find until much later. Well, anyhow, I \u2014 I told her\njust the basic things. I\u2014 I wa\u2014I-\u2014I couldn\u2019t go into details. Those were the things\nthat I talked about, oh, later on, bits and pieces, not \u2014 not the whole thing. I \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know what it was, but I just couldn\u2019t. Of course, there was still, and I think\nnow thinking back of tha \u2014 to that period, and I\u2019ve done this for some time now,\nthere was always that, why did they have to die and I \u2014 I survived? And that was \u2014\nJune 8, 1999\nthat was certainly in \u2014 in \u2014 in my subconscious mind, sometimes very much on my\nconscious. And it \u2014 th \u2014 it was \u2014 it was just difficult and unless I was asked, I didn\u2019t\ntell. It was that way. There were many people that I worked with that didn\u2019t even\nknow, that they thought oh, this guy\u2019s from New York. Fortunately I had no\nparticular accent, and so they knew I\u2019d come \u2014 I'd started in New York, and I was\na New Yorker, that \u2014 that was \u2014 that was all they knew. And over the years bits and\npieces \u2014 I told a little story here, when \u2014 when something happened that had a\nconnection with some, but not until \u2014 well, the 80\u2019s, when I finally sat down and\nwrote my whole story.",
        "Q: I'd like to pause for just a second and ask about some of the events that were\ngoing around in the years before the 50\u2019s.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about first the Nuremberg trials. Ho-How closely did you\nfollow the Nuremberg trials?",
        "A: Oh, I followed them very closely. That was something that I \u2014 of course, there\nwere newspapers, the magazines. I had a couple of friends who were involved in\nthat, one was at the Nuremberg trials and we corresponded, and he would write to\nme. Another one, a lawyer in the Washington office of the \u2014 the judge advocates\noffice in the army, who was involved in the \u2014 in the trials o-o-on this side, getting\nJune 8, 1999\nthe reports in and all that in the \u2014 we talked about it all the time. I \u2014 I was looking\nfor \u2014 for the death penalty for anybody who just walked through Nuremberg. Not\nall of them got it, but then again, the \u2014 the trials went on for a number of years.\nWhen I was at military history in 1948, we had a British contingent, three British\nofficers. Two of them people like myself, Europeans. As a matter of fact, the \u2014 no,\none was German, one was Austrian. And one that their chief was a British colonel,\nbut they were all British army, and they were working with us, because they were\ngoing through the same documents and the same background. We \u2014 we also\nsearched documents that \u2014 captured documents that we had here \u2014 in connection\nwith that. And we were looking at the same documents and they were working on\nbackground for the trials that were still going on, and so we had close contact and\nwe followed that all \u2014 followed that all the way. There were not enough that were\npunished.",
        "Q: Did you follow the U.N. debate on the partition of Palestine?",
        "A: Every word of it, absolutely, yes. As a matter of fact, I was \u2014 I was watching the\n\u2014I was listening to the \u2014 that \u2014 the final votes, I was counting votes at the time, on\nradio. I didn\u2019t have a television. No, no, I guess not, didn\u2019t have a television then. I\n\u2014 I was \u2014 I was listening and on the radio and I was \u2014 kept keeping a \u2014 a pad. And\nwhen the final vote was tallied \u2014 again, this of course now is 1950 \u2014 1947. I was\nJune 8, 1999\nthinking of still again going to Palestine. But there were many things that \u2014 that\nheld me back, you know, personal things that were happening and I \u2014 it was\nalways, you know, next week, Ill think about it next week or I'll \u2014 Pll look into it\nnext week. By that time I had taken up \u2014 I had contact with my cousin ha \u2014 at \u2014 and\nmeanwhile his mother and father, who had gotten away out of Vienna to England,\nhis father was \u2014 came out of Dachau, they released him. Mother had gotten a\npermit to go to England, and so they went to England, some went to Palestine.\nAnd I had seen them in England when I was in England. They had gone to\nPalestine so a \u2014 a\u2014 we had correspondence then, and I thought that I might join\nthem, but I didn\u2019t until many years later when I did go over and I\u2019ve been there\nquite a few times now.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t reflect one way or the other on your personal feelings about the\nKorean war. Did you have any personal objections?",
        "A: The Korean war? I theti \u2014 I thought it was a waste and I think many of us\nthought that. It was \u2014 it was just everything went wrong. We \u2014 we were fighting \u2014\nwe \u2014 we were fighting a war, but we weren\u2019t. I see the same thing going on right\ntoday in \u2014 1n Kosovo, where we \u2014 we\u2019re talking about fighting a war, we\u2019re\nfighting something. We\u2019re not going in and cleaning it up, and that\u2019s what\nhappened. The troops were ready, we were ready, but the command, the \u2014 the\nJune 8, 1999\npolitics weren\u2019t \u2014 weren \u2014 the pol-politicians weren\u2019t. It was a politician fought\nwar. And that is probably why two-thirds of us, of the officers quit. That was not\nthe ti \u2014 particularly those of us, and probably most of us at that time still \u2014 that had\nfought the \u2014 the war in \u2014 in Europe or in \u2014 in the Pacific for that matter, where you\nfought a war to \u2014 to win. There we didn't fight to win, we fought to \u2014 to sit around\nand let somebody do the talking. And so now I \u2014 I-I did not think kindly of what\nwas happening there.",
        "Q: What did you think about the developing Cold War?",
        "A: The Cold War, of course that was somehow predictable, that having met the\nRussians, we knew we weren\u2019t going to be friends, although we were friendly and\nthe vodka flowed freely, but that was not it, and then of course when the Russians\ndug in and said \u2014 and dictated to us practically what \u2014 what we \u2014 what we could do\nand what we couldn\u2019t do, that was pretty much the beginning of the Cold War, and\nChurchill saw it and \u2014 and it happened. But there were \u2014 there were many things\nthat \u2014 well, it was a political war, it was \u2014 and political wars don\u2019t lead to anything,\nnever have. And there should have been some accommodation someplace, but\nnobody would give, we didn't give, they didn\u2019t give. And I think the only thing that\n\u2014 that \u2014 that could have ended \u2014 the way it ended was \u2014 it was completely\nunexpected, I think. The only other way would have been a \u2014 a hot war.\nJune 8, 1999\nFortunately, it didn\u2019t happen, but it was a bad time in history, I think, that whole\nperiod of the Cold War, because it had an influence on \u2014 on everything, on \u2014 on the\nlives of all the people in the world, on the economy and \u2014 so that it was \u2014 it was a\nbad thing.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to ask you clarify the t \u2014 the term hot war.",
        "A: The \u2014 the missiles. The missiles were ready on both sides, we could have fired,\nthey could have fired. Any mistake could have triggered an annihilation of \u2014 of half\nof the world, and that was a great fear, I think o-of myself and I\u2019m sure of most of\nthe people, that some nut would push the wrong button, even by accident, not \u2014 it\ncould have happened. That it didn\u2019t happen, was a miracle.",
        "Q: What comes to your mind about the time that you spent in \u2014 in Tokyo, other\nthan that you met your wife and got married?",
        "A: In Tokyo? Well, I had gotten out of the army, I was a civilian in a culture that\nwas strange to me, and so I \u2014 I soaked it all up. I took it in and it was an interesting\nexperience. And after about two and a half years there, I decided it was enough.\nWell, we both decided that was enough and let\u2019s get out of here. But it was \u2014 it was\ninteresting. There was nothing that stands out, just learning and looking at the ways\nof \u2014 of the mysterious east. Korea was a loss, there was no \u2014 no \u2014 nothing there to\nlook at, there was total devastation and \u2014 but Tokyo and traveling around Japan\nJune 8, 1999\nwas interesting, see how people lived, how \u2014 how they \u2014 how they managed, really,\nwith their \u2014 their culture, the way of \u2014 of life, the way of living in \u2014 in\n[indecipherable] paper houses, and it was interesting, but nothing outstanding.",
        "Q: Did anybody there know you were Jewish?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Yes, they knew I was Jewish. I had no problems with that. We had a \u2014\nactually the only Jewish services we had in \u2014 in \u2014 in Tokyo were the holidays. And\nin the chapel center, we\u2019d go there and they brought in a rabbi from someplace, not\nsure where he came from. And I went to services, and I took time off and my\noffice, all the people I worked with knew where I was. So, no, there was no\nproblems there.",
        "Q: You left Tokyo and then what?",
        "A: Left Tokyo and came to Washington after cruising around the United States\nfor about oh, a good two or three months. We landed in Seattle where Barbara has\nan aunt and cousins and we stopped there for a few days. Then went to San\nFrancisco where she has another aunt, we visited there and I got introduced to the\nfamily. And then we went to Iowa, to Webster City, Iowa, a great metropolis of\nabout 8,000 people and I met the parents. Parents knew who I was, I had written to\nthem. As a matter of fact, just very recently I went through some papers that when\n\u2014 her mother died some years ago, but we had never looked through that file of\nJune 8, 1999\npapers that \u2014 that we had taken from her, and I looked through some paper and\nthere was the letter I wrote to them when I first met Barbara \u2014 or wh-when we\ndecided to get married, and I wrote to them and told them who I was, and got to \u2014\nto Webster City and well, had parties and met \u2014 met the whole town. And stayed\nthere for awhile and then went to Washington. In Washington I was then for the\nfirst and only time \u2014 no, I ca \u2014 I \u2014 was not the first and only time, my first job in \u2014\nin New York was, course, I had to look for a job. But coming to Washington was\nthe first time that I really had to \u2014 really had to look for a job. There was no \u2014 no\nHIAS to \u2014 to help me out. And I had a \u2014 well, in \u2014 while I was in \u2014 in Tokyo, in \u2014\nin \u2014 in my capacity as \u2014 in my job, I had very close contacts with the CIA people\nout there. And so before I left the chief of the CIA group asked \u2014 said, why don\u2019t\nyou \u2014 when you get home, why don\u2019t you just stop in and talk to the people in\nLangley and come with us? And I said, well, that\u2019s nice and he gave me a letter of\nrecommendation. And so I did and they offered me something that was not for me,\nthey \u2014 they offered me a job in \u2014 in \u2014 a\u2014a temporary job in Germany and I wasn\u2019t\nready to go out \u2014 out again, I wanted to stay awhile. And so I didn\u2019t take that. And\nthen again, by continuous luck, ran into a friend who said, well oh, I know of a new\noutfit that they\u2019re forming at the \u2014 in the Pentagon and I\u2019ve applied for it. He was\nworking somewhere in the Pentagon. He said, to transfer into it and they\u2019ve got\nJune 8, 1999\nslots open, why don\u2019t you try that? And I tried it and I got the job, became his boss.\nJohn has never forgiven me that, but we\u2019re still friends. And there I\u2014I got the job\nwith Air Force Intelligence and worked with them for oh, several years. Got several\npromotions, I was doing well. Then our organization was taken over into the\nDefense Intelligence Agency when that was formed, and that took in units from all\nthe military agencies. Stayed with them from \u201962, I was involved in \u2014 in the\ncreation of the new organization, was on that committee, and stayed with them\nuntil \u00b065 when once again I was invited by the State Department to transfer to the\nState Department. It happened during a \u2014 a meeting. I was presenting a project that\nwe had \u2014 a worldwide project of intelligence handling that we had, I was involved\nwith through an inter \u2014 through an interagency committee. The State Department\nrepresentative said, would you be interested in coming to our \u2014 we have nothing\nlike that. And I said, well, make me an offer I can\u2019t resist. And he said the \u2014 about\ntwo weeks later, he made me that offer. And I transferred to the State Department\nin the foreign service and became a foreign service officer, coming in on top,\nwhich, much to the \u2014 1n the foreign service that \u2014 yo-you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re not liked if\nyou come in on top because everybody else came in on the bottom. So I had in-\ninteresting experience.",
        "Q: I have to pause to change tape.\n38June 8, 1999\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nJune 8, 1999\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Charles Stein. This is tape two, side A, and\nyou had been telling me about your changes in your professional life with the Air\nForce Intelligence and Defense Intelligence and then the State Department. Could\nyou walk me through some of those jobs and what your role was, your duties,\nresponsibilities?",
        "A: Yeah. In \u2014 I \u2014 I mentioned that this was a new project that my friend told me\nabout in the Air Force Intelligence. What happened was the air force was the, in\n1955 was getting into the \u2014 the technological age of information processing. They\nwere the leaders in the thing. They had come up with a project that was worked up\nwith IBM and Eastman-Kodak, a combined project of information processing\nwhere the information, that is documents, would be photographed on microfilm,\nand at the same time, there would be an encoding placed on the microfilm and the\ncoding was then read electronically from the film, and would \u2014 and when you \u2014\nwhen you got the right \u2014 right thing, looking for a specific document that contained\na subject matter, th-the subject matter was coded. And that was on there, and that\nwould \u2014 that then would print out the document that pertained to whatever you\nwere looking for. That was a \u2014 a new way of doing it, you didn\u2019t have to have any\nJune 8, 1999\n\u2014 any input, typewriter input that you had until that time. We had to type punch\ncards and whatever, or type it into the computer and then it would come \u2014 you \u2014 th\n\u2014 this way you could just photograph it. Well, it was a novel thing, and that is what\nthey \u2014 they were hiring people to do that. My job, I became a \u2014 I was hired as the\nchief of the coding section, and I worked with the tech \u2014 technical part, the \u2014 the\ncontractors on what they were doing and to make sure that we\u2019re do \u2014 and we\ndeveloped \u2014 and again, we did this with the CIA, a\u2014 a code \u2014 a code dictionary,\nsort of. An intelligence code, that for everything that was of interest to intelligence,\nwould have a code number. And then we would have \u2014 this was my section then,\nreaders read the documents that were coming in, intelligence documents, reports\nfrom all over the world, and numerically code what was in that document. That\ndocument would then be photographed with the code input also onto the film, and\nit was available for \u2014 for retrieval. We had gotten that thing, it took a number of\nyears to \u2014 to do this, we worked from \u201955 to about \u2014 by \u201958 or 59 we had the first\ninstallation, and it worked. We then expanded that to the rest of the air force, and I\nwent out to help the installation of the thing at \u2014- in Omaha at the Strategic Air\nCommand. And in Ohio at the Air Force Research and Development command and\nseveral other places, and we started sending out copies of what we had made the\nfilm into those. And those were little chips, photo chips that ran through just \u2014\nJune 8, 1999\nsimilar to \u2014 to punch cards running through when you\u2019re searching, but these were\nphoto chips and when you got a hit it would extract it and make a full copy of it. Or\nyou could view it on a\u2014 on a microfilm viewer. That was the main project. Now, it\n\u2014 we got into \u2014 more into different arrangements. That unit then was taken over\nwith a lot of the other air force intelligence into the Defense Intelligence Agency\nwhen that was established. And I was still in charge of that, but I was working on\nnew developments, now we were into computer information, handling a computer.\nIt was all intelligence handling. I was not, at that point any more directly involved\nwith the intelligence, but with the technical operation. And it was that, and DIA\njust a follow on to the same thing. And it was that thing that State Department got\ninterested in. And when I got into State Department, again, they formed a separate\nunit to start an information processing operation in the State Department, they\ndidn\u2019t have any. As I found out later, they didn\u2019t want any. The foreign service\noffices, they didn\u2019t want to have information. He wanted to have what he had, his\npieces of paper and he\u2019d make up his own mind, they didn\u2019t want anybody else to \u2014\nto shove stuff at him that he didn\u2019t see \u2014 had seen \u2014 hadn\u2019t seen before, to change\nhis mind possibly. Anyhow, that was an \u2014 that\u2019s an interpretation. But I got to the\nState Department and we started, there were about four or five of us that had been \u2014\nsome from the State Department and a couple of people from CIA, myself from the\nJune 8, 1999\nIAA, and one from USIA, and there was one other \u2014 a couple from the State\nDepartment, and we all sat and we started looking at what is it that the foreign\nservice \u2014 tha-that the State Department needs in the \u2014 getting information. Where\ndo they get their information from and how could we put this into a system? In\nother words, we were systems development. And we then got money through a \u2014\nprobably my most grueling and demeaning experience in my life. I had to testify\nbefore Congress, before a congressional committee. It \u2014 the man, my immediate\nsuperior in that particular thing, was lost. He and I were sitting there, I was in the\nleft hand seat. The left hand seat 1s the \u2014 when you\u2019re facing the committee is the \u2014\nthe secondary. I was the one with the information, he was the one that answered the\nquestions. And a certain congressman from Brooklyn destroyed my buddy. The\nman was so confused he didn\u2019t know what to say and the chairman of the\ncommittee excused him and said at this point you\u2019re not answering any more\nquestions, but your sidekick answers the questions, so let him answer it and you\u2019re\nexcused, and he wal \u2014 had to leave the \u2014 the committee room. I sat there for the rest\nof it and I got through it and I got the money. So \u2014 however, was an interesting\nthing. I was noticing that the chairman\u2019s assistants, the \u2014 not a congressman, one of\n\u2014 his \u2014 his office manager, wi \u2014 whoever he was, had an interesting head\nmovement. And being a good observer, I had noticed that when they asked first\nJune 8, 1999\nquestions and I was watching that, and I noticed that when he expected a positive\nanswer to something, his head would go this way. And when the congressman\nasked a trick question, the guy went this way. So my eye was on him, and I got\nthrough the thing, it worked. I was right, that that was the way, that he knew \u2014\nthese people know the answers. When they ask a question they know the answer.\nAnd so \u2014 they want confirmation of their knowledge, and well anyhow, it \u2014 that \u2014\nthat was \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was a sad thing. I came out and poor guy outside, I asked him\nto go home. He wanted to go back to the office, I said, you should go home. [Il call\nyou later, I'll tell you what happened. He said, but di-di \u2014 do you know what \u2014 I\nsaid, yeah, we got the money, we\u2019re all \u2014 you\u2019re all right, go home. He went home\nand I called him later on and he had calmed down, and he said, he-hell, I \u2014 I can\u2019t\neven remember what happened. And very shortly after that he left the State\nDepartment, you know, fortunately there was some higher up sitting in the back\nlistening to this thing and they weren\u2019t happy with him, so anyhow. Well, we got\nthe money and we had the department hire contractors, some of these big\ninformation processing firms. They came in and they started working on a program.\nThe program was, oh about half way through, and we got more money, because we\nshowed that it was good. This time we didn\u2019t have to testify any more, 1t was done\nin the higher-ups. And they \u2014 let\u2019s see, after about \u2014 it was about two and a half\nJune 8, 1999\nyears into the \u2014 into the program, that there was an internal thing. Again, there\u2019s a\npolitical thing. The assistant Secretary of State I worked for and another assistant\nSecretary of State, who wanted that unit, the other one, th-the \u2014 the enemy there,\nthe other one was the assistant secretary for administration, who had the computer\noperation of the State Department, the payroll, in other words. Payroll and\npersonnel and whatever, but never anything subst \u2014 substance \u2014 substantive 1n-\ninformation, they\u2019d never handle it. But they saw something that hadn\u2019t \u2014 that got\nmoney and all kinds of possible \u2014 and they wanted it. Well, it was a time when my\nassistant secretary wanted another job. He wanted to be a \u2014 what do they call that?\nA diplomat in residence at the university. We had \u2014 the university, they have a\ndiplomat in residence, that a \u2014 that\u2019s a cream puff, absolutely. And usually that led\nto an ambassadorship. People who were s \u2014 who were selected for that. Well, he\nwas pretty close to that, he wanted an ambassadorship eventually, and he want \u2014\nbut there was a job that he could have had, but they kept him because he had things\ngoing on in his o-operation that were not finished, they wouldn\u2019t let him go. So he\nchanged. He sold us a \u2014 he sold my \u2014 my organization to administration. And I\nsaid, I\u2019m not available for that. You can transfer it, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m out. I\u2014 I wouldn\u2019t\nwork for those people, I \u2014 well, I knew them, I had worked with them before. Well,\nhe was friendly enough to say \u2014 he was Jewish, by the way, the only other Jew in\nJune 8, 1999\nthe area. And he said, I didn\u2019t think you would, but I\u2019ve got another job for you, if\nyou want it. We have a new inspector general and I\u2019ve told him about how you go\nabout doing your investigations and how you can do these things and \u2014 and he\u2019s\ninterested in you, because you\u2019ve reviewed, you know what this whole department\nis doing, you\u2019ve done a survey to \u2014 to find out what they need, and he wants to talk\nto you. And he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s brand new, he just came an \u2014 an ambassador who just came\nback and got the job as Inspector General. So I made an appointment, went to see\nhim and he said, yeah, I want you. And I became a senior foreign service inspector.\nNow again, I shifted jobs without try \u2014 even trying, you know, I \u2014 I\u2014 I was asked\nto. And when I got into the Inspector General\u2019s office, that I hadn\u2019t used before,\ncause they were not in the substantive area, I found that I was in \u2014 in very good\ncompany, because most of the senior inspectors were former ambassadors for\nwhom there was no other assignment, there was a limited assignment. And so they\nbecame inspectors and they traveled around from one embassy to the other, to\nmake sure that everything was all right, and they were doing, you know, reviewing\nthe embassies, mainly. The idea I came up with, that sold m \u2014 sold me to \u2014 to the\ninspection corps was that there ma \u2014 are many things that are overlapping that are\nnot being looked at in Washington, th-the various bureaus, each one working as an\nindependent thing, each one working with all the embassies that their \u2014 you know,\nJune 8, 1999\nthe European bureaus, working with all the European embassies, but there\u2019s no \u2014\nno connection between them. They\u2019re doing all kind \u2014 I said, I would like to look\ninto that. He said that\u2019s a great idea, you got it. So I started out on that and I\nbecame \u2014 I was doing \u2014 what\u2019d we call that? Well, the organizational reviews. And\nI did some of those. As I went on, I did all the \u2014 the bureaus, and particularly those\nthat covered in substance more than an embassy. The scientific bureau \u2014 scientific\nand \u2014 and technical bureau, for example, had these technical attach\u00e9s out there that\nweren\u2019t talking to each other. So, there \u2014 it was a question of \u2014 of getting\ninformation to them and \u2014 I mean, getting information between them and not just\nreporting back to the bureau and the thing gets lost in the bureau. And the consular\noffices, for \u2014 of course, there are consulates in every country and more than there\nare embassies, and they\u2019re not talking to each other. They\u2019re reporting 1n, it\u2019s all a\none way flow, nothing goes out \u2014 oh, excuse me \u2014 to \u2014 to all the others. And so I\nstarted working on that and I usually got a couple of other officers assigned to me,\nsome of the junior officers that were also working with the inspectors and we sat\ndown and we ju \u2014 started interviewing and looking into the records and all that, we\nfind out how things were and sort of rewrote the \u2014 the \u2014 the job descriptions. The \u2014\nthe job [indecipherable]. I had one particular one that was of great interest to me,\nhaving been a refugee once, and that was, I came across, while I was looking at\nJune 8, 1999\nthese various organizations in the department of a special assistant to the Secretary\nof State for Refugee Affairs. When I looked into that I found that the man was a\npolitical appointee. He\u2019d made big contributions to somebody and he had a few\npeople in Washington, but his work was being done in Geneva at the U.S. mission\nto the United Nations. In the process I also found that there was a special assistant\nto the Secretary of State for international Red Cross affairs. Now here we have the\ninternational Red Cross, a British a \u2014 a Swiss organization, and they have a one\nman office with one secretary who\u2019s a special assistant and who handles contacts\nwith that. But the international Red Cross is in Geneva and who handles the \u2014 the\nbr \u2014 the work? The office in Geneva. And this 1s a large office in the united na \u2014 in\nthe mission to the United Nations. The U.S. mission. And I found a third one, a-a-\nanother special assistant for a humanitar \u2014 for \u2014 not for humanitarian, for disaster\nrelief affairs. Again, all of them political appointees. Well, I went \u2014 so I went to\nGeneva and talked to the people there and looked and see what they were doing\nand they were hardworking people. They were doing the budgeting for \u2014 for these\nvarious operations. They were representing the U.S. before the United Nations and\nbefore all the various organizations that physically handled refugees and disasters\nand so forth. And I came back and I wrote a \u2014 oh, about a 200 page report. This\nwas about a six months affair. I wrote a rit \u2014 I wrote a report and I said, reorganize\nJune 8, 1999\nthe whole thing and my s \u2014 my recommendation was that \u2014 to get another position\nas an assistant Secretary of Affairs for Humanitarian affairs, all this comes under\nthat subject heading and abolish these special assistants. Have Geneva do the work\nand have Washington have a \u2014 a regular office doing whatever is necessary in the\nUnited States, such as you know, budget \u2014 getting \u2014 getting money and so forth.\nAnd that was finished in 1990 \u2014 in January of 19 four \u2014 four \u2014 1974, I finished that\nparticular report. And then I went on and was doing \u2014 I think the next one was\nconsular affairs and I was just about finished with consular affairs when one day I\nget a phone call from the refugee office. The deputy to this political appointee was\na regular foreign service officer whom I knew, I had contact with. And he calls me\nand he said, I have a problem. We\u2019ve seen your report and I think it\u2019s great. They\nthought they were getting to be the assistant secretary job. They were \u2014 they were\nthe biggest one, of course. Anyhow, we tha \u2014 we thought we \u2014 we have a \u2014 we have\na problem, our man in Geneva, our \u2014 the head of the office just informed us that he\nis retiring in August. This is about the fifth \u2014 I think it was the day after the Fourth\nof July weekend, I\u2019d just come back. And he said, you\u2019re the only one who knows\nwhat\u2019s going on out there. How would you like to go to Geneva? And my answer\nto that, and I remember that to this day and will always remember it, was don\u2019t\nbother me with details, send five tickets. We had a meeting after that, he explained\nJune 8, 1999\nto me what this problem was and I said yes, Ill \u2014 PIl\u2014I\u2019ll accept and Ill go. And\nsix weeks later we were in Geneva and I was running that office. And I\u2019d gotten, of\ncourse, I was at the time \u2014 this \u2014 the main job of that particular office really, was\nhandling the Russian refugees that were coming out by about 20 or 30,000 a year.\nThat was the beginning of the \u2014 the major exodus from Russia. What they were\ndoing, and I was doing for the next four years was dealing with the voluntary\nagencies, HIAS, Tolstoy Foundation, the International Catholic Migration\nCommission, the World Council of Churches and many others. The \u2014 the Polish\nAmerican refugee, or Czech American. All of those, all over Europe. They \u2014 tho \u2014\nthey were physically receiving these refugees, most of them, of course, Jews. All of\nthem, probably. And were trying to resettle them in Israel, in the U.S., in\nAustralia, wherever. And my job was to make sure that the U.S. money that went\nto these agencies for handling that, was properly used, that they were doing their\njob, and make sure that they were doing what they were supposed to do in the\nresettlement process. And I learned a lot about Russians during that period, and\nothers, but mainly the Russians. Went to one of my jobs and the family was in\nGeneva, the kids were in international schools, which was a good experience for\nthem, and my job was making \u2014 reviewing the budgets, reviewing their budget\nrequests and changing them where it was necessary. They were all inflated, of\nJune 8, 1999\ncourse, the usual thing. I was the first \u2014 first stop. And \u2014 and actually, physically\nlooking at them, periodically. So every month I would be in one or \u2014 or two, I\u2019d be\nin \u2014 in \u2014in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and I\u2019d be in \u2014 in\u2014 in Munich, where many of\nthem were. In Rome, which were the main parts and occasionally in Moscow and\nthen Bucharest, behind the Iron Curtain then, talking to our people. And Turkey is\n\u2014 it was another place. Italy. Several places in Italy where they \u2014 these people\nwere, and working with them to expedite the process. I had one critical, really\ncritical thing. That was, the Kurds in Iran, Iran would not let them out and it was\na long process and finally they wouldn\u2019t let any \u2014 finally they decide that yes, they\ncould leave and so we would \u2014 wanted to send in a plane and they wouldn\u2019t allow\nus. And the international Red Cross, I involved them in it, and the international Red\nCross was going to send in a plane and they wouldn\u2019t let them. And finally there\nwas a\u2014acharter from \u2014 Lufthansa had a charter service and the international Red\nCross managed to get one of their planes, and they gave in. Now, these people were\nto be brought out, the \u2014 they \u2014 ere \u2014 ira \u2014 ara \u2014 Iranians gave in and let them go.\nThe people \u2014 the \u2014 the law, there was a special law that Congress enacted to let\nthese people into the United States but it expired on a certain date, which was\nabout \u2014 we were one day away from that date when the thing \u2014 when the Iranians\ngave in and the Red Cross took the plane over, got the people up and got them to\nJune 8, 1999\nFrankfurt. I went to Frankfurt to work with our consulate to make sure that these\npeople get their visas. It was just \u2014 they had to get their passports stamped. That\nwas it. What ha \u2014 when they got to the United States was unimportant, but before\nthat date \u2014 oh, this was the day. I get to \u2014 to Frankfurt and they\u2019re processing it,\ndoing a good job, and they still got about a \u2014 about a hundred people at five o\u2019clock\nin the afternoon, the consul \u2014 the U.S. consul says well, we\u2019re gonna have to\ncontinue that tomorrow, we\u2019re going home. I said no, you\u2019re not. He said well,\nyeah, but you know, the day is over. I said, the law expires at midnight and as far as\nI\u2019m concerned it\u2019s midnight in Washington, not in Frankfurt. And it is five\no\u2019clock and it\u2019s noon, we got 12 hours to go, you\u2019ve got to finish these people. He\nsays no, I can\u2019t do that. I said, I want a line to the assistant secretary for consular\naffairs, whom I knew well. I had done a job for her before I left and we had good \u2014\ngood relationship. And he got \u2014 he says okay, so he got the line through. He\ncouldn\u2019t refuse me, so he got the line. And I talked to the lady and I said, I\u2019ve got a\nreluctant [indecipherable] I\u2019m \u2014 we\u2019re doing the Kurds, and she said yeah, yeah,\nhow you doing? I said we \u2014 there\u2019s still about a hundred left that have not, and \u2014\nbeen visa\u2019d and your man here wants to go home, he wants to close up. She said,\nlet me have him. I said \u2014 handed him the telephone and I notice his face getting\nlonger and longer and he hung up and he said okay, we\u2019ll work until it\u2019s finished.\nJune 8, 1999\nWell, by about 10 o\u2019clock that night we were finished. Everybody had their visa,\nstamped with today\u2019s date \u2014 with that day\u2019s date and the next day we got them on a\nplane and sent them to the U.S. But those are the kind of things that you \u2014 the\ntroubleshooting type things that \u2014 that you had to do every once in awhile. Had to\nintervene in Rome with the Russians. The Russians in \u2014 in \u2014 in Rome were treated\nvery nice, they had them out on the \u2014 on the li \u2014 li \u2014 just like they have in New\nYork, in Brighton Beach, they all live out there. In Rome they had them out on\nthe \u2014 on \u2014 near the Lido someplace \u2014 not Lido, whatever the beach 1s. Nicely\nquartered. Then you came into town to \u2014 and HIAS was handling most of the\nRussians in th\u2014 Rome. And they walked in and he said \u2014 and their \u2014 their \u2014 their\nquestions were, where is my money, where is my house, where is my servants,\nwhere is my wi \u2014 the Russian way. The Russians were used to asking for some \u2014\nthe government. The government gave them. They were still in that mode. And we\nhad some serious problems there, the people were intimidated by them. And I told\nthem, don\u2019t be intimidated, you\u2019ve got \u2014 they had Russian speakers there, and they\nwere \u2014 I \u2014I \u2014I told them how \u2014 how to talk to these people. Just yell at them. Tell\nthem to go away, they get nothing. One more word out of you and you\u2019re out, you\nget nothing, you go wherever you want to go. And it \u2014 it worked. It worked, you\nknow. Again, something they were used to. The KGB wasn\u2019t going to be \u2014 talk to\nJune 8, 1999\nthem friendly like, so we weren\u2019t either. They had something coming to them. We\ntold them that no, you don\u2019t have anything coming to you, we\u2019re giving it to you\nbecause we\u2019re good people. And in that particular case, and there were a lot of\nthem there, the word got to all of them, I was the United States government. I\nrepresent \u2014 see, those were just an organization. When I came, I was the United\nStates government. Well that \u2014 that made \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 that did it. When the\ngovernment says you gotta be quiet, you\u2019re quiet. So we\u2019re \u2014 you know, it was\ngame playing, but \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was acting. I did not go to Hollywood after that.\nThat\u2019s \u2014 you know, experiences like that, that was \u2014 that was my job. And of\ncourse I saw a lot of misery too, people coming out and having to sit in those\ncamps in some areas, they were not too pleasant. Some intellectuals, people with \u2014\nwho had status and \u2014 and now were begging, in effect. I felt for them, but on the\nother hand, I was there too, once, and I knew how they felt. So, you know, you\ntreated them accordingly. You talked to them, and particularly in some cases when\nI talked to them, I told them who I was, and I said, I was in your position once, and\nlook at me now. It\u2019s gonna happen to you, just take it easy. It\u2019Il be done. We\u2019re\ndoing it, but it takes time. And it helped a little, some cases, I \u2014 I hope it did.",
        "Q: I want to go ask you a few questions about the 60\u2019s. I know you\u2019ve taken me\nprofessionally in your career through the 70\u2019s, or through the mid-70\u2019s at least. I\nJune 8, 1999\nwould like to go back to the 60\u2019s and ask just some other questions. First of all,\nwanted to ask you about the Eichmann trial. Did you follow the Eichmann trial?",
        "A: Oh yes. I followed that again, with a vengeance, and I read everything there\nwas, anything from the \u201cWashington Post\u201d to the \u201cJerusalem Post\u201d and anything\nI could lay my hands on, because it was of great interest. I had known of\nEichmann of course, like everybody else did. By that time I had read most of the\nthings that had been written about the Holocaust and about \u2014 about that. And I was\nhoping that it would lead to where it did. And when they executed him, I \u2014 I was\nhappy. It\u2019s the wrong way to be happy, but I was happy. Not, in that case, that was\nthe exception. Just like I did for the Nuremberg people.",
        "Q: The 1960\u2019s were very turbulent years in this country, a lot of changes. I\u2019d like\nyou to reflect back on some of the things from the 60\u2019s, like the \u2014 the Vietnam war\nan-and Civil Rights, and Women\u2019s Movement. Did you get involved with any of\nthose, or are any of those of particular interest to you?",
        "A: No, I was \u2014 well, put this way. In 1965 \u2014 no, \u201966, I\u2019d just gone to the State\nDepartment. No, no, no, fift \u2014 \u201965, I was still with the DIA. I received a letter from\nthe army, saying that the Secretary of Defense has declared your job an essential \u2014\na civilian essential position. Therefore, you can no longer remain in the active\nreserve. I was still a reserve officer. By that time I was a lieutenant colonel. And I \u2014\nJune 8, 1999\ni\u20141-\u2014 well, let me just quickly here, when I said I left Korea and we said no thank\nyou, we don\u2019t. When I got back to Washington I applied for commission again. I\ndecided I \u2014 I want to stay in, mainly because it \u2014 that pays, at the end. I had never\nknown until 1957, approximately \u201957 1s when I came back in, that reserve offices\nwho had active duty at age 60 would get money. And I said well, why not?\nSomebody talked me into it, really. Somebody told me about that, one of the people\nI wor \u2014 I worked with. They said, why don\u2019t you come back in, and I went down to\nFort Myer(ph) and said, can I come back in? And they said, of course. And I \u2014 I\ncame \u2014 I-I was reassigned on the non-pay unit. We met once every two weeks in\nthe Pentagon for a couple of hours, get a lecture from somebody or gave a lecture.\nAnd that was it, we got points, that\u2019s all. So anyhow, in 1965 I got this letter saying\nthat your \u2014 you\u2019re essential now and you can\u2019t be in the reserves any more, in the\nactive reserve, but you have over 20 years, and so you have a choice to go in the\ninactive reserve or into retired reserve. And Vietnam was just brewing and I said, I\ndon\u2019t want to get caught in another war. Even \u2014 even then I might \u2014 this \u2014 this thing\nad \u2014 ba \u2014 my civilian job might end, and I\u2019ve had two wars, two is enough. And\nVietnam didn\u2019t look like anything that I should get involved in. And I said \u2014 I\nwrote back and said no, put me in the \u2014 1n the retired reserve and I retired at that\npoint. And at age 60, the checks started coming, which are still accepted. But\nJune 8, 1999\nanyhow, now Vietnam I did not like what was going on. I couldn\u2019t see it. There\nwas \u2014 I didn\u2019t think we had any business there. And I had friends who were still in\nthe service who went over there and they came back and they told me what\nconditions they \u2014 that they had, under what conditions they were there, and it was\nnot what I \u2014 I felt that I was right, we shouldn\u2019t be there. And I had \u2014 I felt for all\nthe people that \u2014 that were against the war and all that, although you know, I was\nsort of a military something or other, nothing serious. But that wasn\u2019t it and many\nof the people I knew who were in the military and in the reserves and retired in the\nreserves all felt like I did, so I-I wasn\u2019t alone. And I \u2014 I \u2014 well, we were right, it\ncame out the wrong way at the end.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to pause now and change tape.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Charles Stein. This is tape number two, side B,\nand I wanted to ask you about the Civil Rights movement and if you had any\nthoughts about it, especially in light of your experience in your earlier years.",
        "A: You know, the Civil Rights moved me, I followed it very closely. I didn\u2019t do\nanything, I was not involved in anything, but it was on the right track, and I was\nJune 8, 1999\nvery much sympathetic to it, because I\u2019d been there and I thought that all the\nsegregation an-and thing were \u2014 was \u2014 it was awful. I had seen it, I\u2019d \u2014 in \u2014 in the\nmilitary, and I \u2014 I'd seen it in the south. Most of my early army posts were in the\nsouth and I saw how the blacks lived, or were forced to live, and they were forced\nto do whatever, were not allowed to \u2014 not really allowed to live. And so yes, I was,\nas I said, sympathetic and I watched it and was happy to see that it developed into\nfinally the \u2014 the schooling and the \u2014 the desegregation of the schools particularly to\nstart with and \u2014 and then the other things that followed.",
        "Q: By the 1970\u2019s, Israel had already been involved in several wars. I wanted to \u2014\nto have you reflect on \u2014 on that aspect of it \u2014 Israeli history. The \u201948 war, \u201956, 67,\n\u00b073, the \u2014 this \u2014 the wars.",
        "A: I was very much concerned and watching it very carefully, all the wars, the\nwhole history of Israel. It was \u2014 well, it \u2014 it was the homeland for all those who\ndidn\u2019t have a land and a place any more. And what was left of my family was there.\nMy cousin, his mother and father. And then a little later on, another cousin who had\nsurvived in Bucharest that I didn\u2019t know about then for \u2014 for some time, til after\nthe war, quite a bit after the war. She came to \u2014 to Israel. So I had direct\nconnection. I also had some friends who had gotten to Israel early in the \u2014 well,\nsome left actually with their families in the 30\u2019s, before the anschluss. And others\nJune 8, 1999\nhad gotten out in the tra \u2014 in the various transports or in the illegal migration. And\nso \u2014 and of course, they were my people. I watched those wars and I followed them\nvery carefully and was overjoyed with all the results, because each one of them was\na victory. I almost got involved directly in \u2014 well, I did get involved in a way, in\nthe Yom Kippur war in \u201973. I was at the synagogue in \u201973 on Yom Kippur, when\nthe thing \u2014 th-the news came. I remember it was in a Sunday, I believe. And I had\nairline tickets to Israel for Monday. On \u2014 as a job, I was supposed to \u2014 I was still\nan inspector then, and I was to inspect the immigration policies of Israel, again ka\n\u2014 that was still during the \u2014 the time when I was working on the \u2014 on the refugee\nand the humanitarian affairs study. And I was headed for Israel, I was headed for\nIsrael, Lebanon and Jordan. | had two passports in my pocket, one for Israel and\none for the other countries, because you couldn\u2019t have a stamp then, and th-that \u2014\nin the State Department we did all kinds of things, you know. Two diplomatic\npassports and I just hoped that I remembered which pocket I had which one in\nwhen I pulled it out. But I was to \u2014 to be 1n Israel on the \u2014 on the f \u2014 the following\n\u2014 well, I was leaving the following day, the day after Yom Kippur. And of course\nwhen I came home that night, I called the State Department. War had broken out\nand there was no way to go there. And I called the \u2014 the \u2014 the duty officers, and I\nasked them to get a telegram to our embassy in Tel Aviv that \u2014 and \u2014 and also to\nJune 8, 1999\nLebanon and Jordan that because the situation that I was not coming and I\u2019II let\nthem know when I\u2019m coming, it would be a little later. If I had left a couple days\nearlier, | would have been right in the middle of \u2014 of a six day war. But I \u2014 the Yom\nKippur war, I mean. But I \u2014 I was just saved by \u2014 by one day. I did get there again,\noh, about the following month. It was an interesting thing, I had to go to \u2014 to\nJordan and there was a \u2014 when I got to Israel I said, well, I\u2019m going to have to go\nback to Greece and then fly into Jordan. And they said no. Said the Allenby\nbridge, which is the famous bridge where the crossings occurred, the \u2014 the\nexchanges and all that. They said, we have a deal with \u2014 Israel really has a deal\nwith Jordan, war or no war. We can get you to the bridge, and on \u2014 it was a certain\nday, like Tuesday or Wednesday, but the \u2014 one of the officers from \u2014 from Amman\nis coming to Jerusalem across the bridge, and he \u2014 the embassy will take him in\ntheir car to the bridge. They will cross \u2014 he will have to walk across the bridge and\nwe have a car at the bridge to pick him up. So we\u2019ll just tell the embassy in \u2014 we\u2019ll\njust call Jordan, Amman, and we\u2019 ll tell them that you\u2019ll be crossing the bridge at\nthe same time, you\u2019ll be in the car that \u2014 pick him up and they co \u2014 they\u2019ll pick you\nup on the other side. You\u2019re just gonna have to carry a suitcase by yourself across. I\nsaid, well that\u2019s no problem. And so that\u2019s how we went a \u2014 went across that\nbridge. And it was interesting, I got a trip through all of the \u2014 the territories there,\nJune 8, 1999\nthe new territories. Well, they weren\u2019t new any more. But anyhow, got there, got to\nthe bridge, went across. Said hello to the guy who ca \u2014 came in from \u2014 from\nJordan. Went across and got in the car and got to the embassy in Jordan. And\nfrom there I could go to Lebanon and finished up my trip and then went home. So\nthat was an interesting experience. I didn't expected it to be that way, but I did get\nto use both of my passports.",
        "Q: I want to get back to your professional life now, you had taken me up to the year\n1974. What happened after 1974 in your professional life?",
        "A: Okay, 1974, I was \u2014 I had finished the report on the refugees and so forth, and I\ngot a phone call in my office asking \u2014 telling me \u2014 from \u2014 from the refugee office\nthat the \u2014 their man in \u2014 in Geneva, who was really running the whole operation\nfor all these different groups, was retiring. He had just informed them that he was\nretiring and the man called me, said you\u2019re the only wa \u2014 you\u2019ve \u2014 you wrote the \u2014\nthe book. We like your report and would you \u2014 how would you like to go and take\nover in Geneva? And my answer to him was, please don\u2019t bother me with details,\nsend five tickets. And fi \u2014 six weeks later we were in Geneva. I took over that\noffice and we had oh, about 20 or 30 people working in there. There\u2019s a lot of\nbookkeeping \u2014 well, a lot of 1t was ha-handling the \u2014 well, okay, th - my \u2014 my\nduties were representation to the United Nations, to the appropriate offices of the\nJune 8, 1999\nUnited Nations, the high commissioner for refugees, the U.N. high commissioner\nfor disaster relief, the international Red Cross and all the other international\norganizations that had any dealings with \u2014 with refugees or dis \u2014 or any of the\nhuman \u2014 humanitarian affairs, including the human rights. I had one officer\nassigned to me who was specially doing human rights work. I concentrated on\ndirecting the United States refugee program, as it was called, and my job was to\nsee that the U.S. funds that were going into the program were being properly used\nby the people who were actually operating the program. And now those people\nwere voluntary agencies, as we called them. HIAS, International Catholic\nMigration Commission, World Council of Churches, Polish American, Czech\nAmerican refugee organizations, Tolstoy Foundation, in \u2014 in \u2014 International\nRescue Committee and others. They had places in various parts of Europe, where\nthey would receive the refugees, they would come m \u2014 and those \u2014 this is the\nperiod when we had the Russian refugees coming out. They were coming out\nbetween 20 and 30,000 a year in those years. They would house them, feed them\nand process them and help them get to their final destination. We tried to get them\nto Israel but not all of them went. Some \u2014 some went to Israel, others made it to\nthe United States and Australia was another major point. Others stayed in Europe\nor some in Germany, and various other places. But with all these people there was\nJune 8, 1999\nthe need \u2014 the \u2014 needed money, and the United States supported that. We also\nsupported Israel in the settling of the Russian refugees. We supplied money for the\nbuilding of housing and teaching them language, teaching and whatever was\nnecessary to ink \u2014 to get them into \u2014 into the main stream. So my job took me to \u2014\nto these \u2014 to various places where the \u2014 where the people were being actually\nprocessed. And I saw to it that our money was used properly, that 1t wasn\u2019t wasted\non administration or whatever it was. We had all the \u2014 all these organizations also\nhad their own funds, but you had to watch them, of course, you know, money \u2014\nmoney is available so you use it any way you \u2014 you feel like it until somebody\nlooks over your shoulder. Also, I had to look at their \u2014 their annual budgets when\nthey \u2014 their budgets would come to me, I would check it to see if it was justified\nand then pass it on to Washington to present to Congress. I made the first\ncorrections and then Washington cut some more, and whatever. These \u2014 these\nthings happened, of course, it\u2019s the usual with the budget process. But the \u2014 the best\npart of that was I traveled and I \u2014 I saw a lot of these people and my points of travel\nwere what \u2014 Paris, Rome, Vienna, all hardship points \u2014 ports. Munich was a very\nheavy place, lots \u2014 many of them came through Munich because many of the\norganizations had their headquarters in Munich for some reason or other. Some\ncame through Frankfurt. And occasionally I would go \u2014 Istanbul was another\nJune 8, 1999\none, and occasionally I would go to \u2014 to Bucharest and to Moscow, because \u2014 to\ntalk \u2014 to work with our own people, the embassy people, to find out what the\ngovernments are up to and how they are handling \u2014 because they were handling\nsome of the guarantees to the local government that they would be going to the\nUnited States and once they got out we tried to get them to \u2014 to Israel. But\nanyhow, most of that, 1t was \u2014 was a very interesting job. And having been a\nrefugee once, I \u2014 I could \u2014 I knew what these people were going through, and\nwherever we could help, I \u2014 I helped.",
        "Q: How long did you continue in this position?",
        "A: Four years. I was there for exactly four years. My family was with me and the\nchildren went to an international school in \u2014 in Geneva. And it was \u2014 it \u2014 1t \u2014 it was\na dream assignment. I had planned on retiring, I wanted to stay another year, and so\nI asked \u2014 I put in a request for \u2014 to extend me for one more year. And they came \u2014\nWashington came back and said, as a matter of fact, we\u2019ve just cut this down to a\nthree year as \u2014 for your \u2014 your \u2014 the next. There are too many people who want to\ngo to Geneva, so from now on it\u2019s going to be a three year assignment, not a four\nyear assignment, and \u2014 and we can\u2019t extend you for the fifth year. I told them that I\nwould retire, one more year and I retire. So in 1974 in September s \u2014 in \u2014 well, we\ncame home in \u2014 around the first of August. 1974 I had some leave \u2014 \u201978, excuse\nJune 8, 1999\nme, \u201978. It\u2019s been a few years, but \u201974 is when I got there. Okay, we came home. I\nhad leave and when I got back to work, I was assigned a \u2014 well, I was told that I\nhad a choice of assignments, but my \u2014 my first as-assignment would have been\nwith the new office that I had originally pr \u2014 created in that \u2014 the inspection report\nthat I\u2019d written. The assistant secretary for humanitarian affairs, and I would have\nbeen a deputy in there. But I didn\u2019t \u2014 I rejected that because the other person who\nwas in the deputy \u2014 in the assistant secretary\u2019s job, we\u2019ve had some differences,\nmajor differences and I wouldn\u2019t work for that person. And so I said no. As it\nhappened, someone else had found out that I was on the way back and had said if\npossible, could I get assigned to that office, and that was the Office of Consular\nAffairs, which was the last report I did in \u2014 as a \u2014 an inspector, and \u2014 someone I\nhad dealt with also on refugee affairs and other things. And the \u2014 so I went to that\noffice, and they told me that they had \u2014 wha \u2014 wha -- what my plans were and I\nsaid, I plan to retire, I had decided I retire the end of the year. December, I\u2019m\nthrough. Got three months, that\u2019s it. And they say well, we just have a job for you,\nexactly for that. There is a presidential commission on the rewriting of the\nimmigration laws. And we have to send a State Department representative to that.\nIt is \u2014 it is a\u2014 in \u2014 physically located in the Justice Department. And how would\nyou like to represent us? And I said, do I know anything about the immigration\nJune 8, 1999\nlaws? They said, of course you do. I said, in that case PIl \u2014 I'll go. I took that\nassignment and I spent most of my next two and a half months over at the Justice\nDepartment with \u2014 oh, the Justice Department, the Immigration-Naturalization\nDepartment, we went over all the immigration rules and laws and all that to see\nwhat would happen, what should be done, and I put in the State Department and\nput \u2014 which I got from \u2014 from my people, I went back to state, but whenev \u2014\nwhatever questions came up, I checked with the department, see what their position\nwas and brought it up and we wrote that report, went in \u2014 it was supposed to be\nfinished and to Congress by the end of the year. We finished up and it was going\ninto the typewriter on about the middle of December, at which time I said goodbye\nand I left, I never read the report, I never saw it afterwards. I knew what was in\nthere, but it didn\u2019t go anywhere anyway. It was a \u2014 it was as a lot of these reports\ngo, Congress does whatever they want to do. I went back and went through the\nprocess, out-processing thing, and then the last day of December, the 30\" of\nDecember, last day was a Saturday, I think. So on that Friday I said goodbye to\neverybody and got a plaque for the wall and hung it on it \u2014 went home, hung it on\nthe wall and it\u2019s been catching dust ever since there. I retired. That was the end of\nmy \u2014 my government career.",
        "Q: Tell me about your children.\nJune 8, 1999",
        "A: My children. I have three sons. Jeff was born in 1978, and well, having once\nbeen a medical student, I had an opportunity to read the book again and brush up,\nbecause a week before he was born, and he was about due, we had a snowstorm in\n\u2014 in \u2014 we lived in \u2014 over in the Alexandria area then. And our street, there was a\nsix foot snow drift at the end of the street, we were completely snowed in, there\nwas nothing that could go in or out, and we were waiting. And so I was reading the\nbook and said well, if it happens, I think I know what to do. I remembered as a\nyoung medical student, as first year medical students will do, sneak into other\nclasses, I went into one class once where there was \u2014 this was an obstetrics class\nand they were observing a birth. And so I saw that everything that was going on\nand I figured I can do that. Of course, I was scared to death, but Jeff was kind\nenough to wait for another week and by that time this \u2014 the road was cleared. Then\nfour years later Jim came along and David a couple of years after that. I had \u2014\nwhen we went to Switzerland, Jeff was going into his third year of high school,\nJim had just finished elementary school and David was going into the fifth grade.\nNo. Yes, yeah, fifth grade. Anyhow, so they went to \u2014 no, he was going into the\nthird grade, excuse me, he was going into the third grade, Jim was going into the \u2014\ninto th \u2014 Jim was going into the fifth grade. I c \u2014 yeah, gotta figure this out, yeah. I\nsaid it went backwards. And they went to an international school, which was very\nJune 8, 1999\nuseful, learned French. Had an interesting one with our youngest one David, who\nwas 10 years old when we got there. And after the \u2014 oh, about two-thirds down the\nfirst year, the French teacher called me at the office one day and said, you know, I\ncan\u2019t get anything out of David, he doesn\u2019t do his homework, he doesn\u2019t do\nanything, he won\u2019t say anything. I don\u2019t know what he knows. I said, well, let me\ntalk to him. I came home that day and we lived in an apartment building, it was a \u2014\na block, four buildings around a big park. Was a \u2014 a beautiful thing and the kids\nwere playing soccer down there and all that. And I came home and David was\nplaying down there, they\u2019re playing \u2014 they were playing soccer and I went down\ninto the park and I listened to \u2014 I was looking for David and I hear him talk. And\nthis kid is talking French to his buddies like a native. And so aft \u2014 I let him finish\nthe game and then they \u2014 when he came upstairs, I said, hey, your French teacher\nsays you\u2019re not doing any work in French. And he said, yeah, well you \u2014 th-they\nhave all this \u2014 this grammar and I don\u2019t know anything about that. I said, well, you\nhave to study it. And he said well, but I don\u2019t need it. I can talk French. I said yeah,\nI \u2014 I just noticed that. I didn\u2019t know you could I had not noticed that at all. So next\nday I called the teacher and I told her what he had \u2014 what I-I observed. I said,\nplease engage him in \u2014 in a conversation outside of the classroom and see \u2014 see\nwhat he comes up with. She called me that afternoon and she said, forget\nJune 8, 1999\neverything I said. He\u2019s ok \u2014I don\u2019t care whether he knows grammar or not. So that\nwas an interesting experience. The other two of course, also learned French and\nenjoyed \u2014 and first they were a little apprehensive when they got there, because\nthey were in a strange country and it \u2014 this was something new. When it was time\nto come home, they didn\u2019t want to leave. They were at home there and they had a \u2014\nwhenever I could \u2014 I told you that I had to travel quite a bit. Whenever I could\narrange my travels when the kids were out of school, I would take the family along.\nAnd so they got into a lot of places. We got there and I let them go sightseeing or\ntake a tour or whatever and I would be doing my \u2014 my job. And then we\u2019d come\nback and they had seen another place. We d \u2014 we traveled a lot, they traveled a lot\nand of course, what they \u2014 what got them about skiing, maybe I \u2014 did I mention\nthat before when I \u2014 when I came home the day when I got the assignment in\nSwitzerland, I \u2014I called my wife and told her, Barbara this \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re going\nto Switzerland, she said, great. And I said, don\u2019t tell the kids, we\u2019ll tell them\ntonight. So at dinner we\u2019re sitting around the table and I casually sort of mentioned,\nlisten, how would you like \u2014 how would you guys like it if we got assigned to go to\nSwitzerland? And Jeff, of course who was a \u2014 all \u2014 all the kids were skiers. I was a\nskier so I \u2014 I taught them early. And I said \u2014 Jeff said oh yeah, yeah, skiing,\nSwitzerland, yeah, that\u2019s it, let\u2019s go. And the other two chimed in, yeah, let\u2019s go.\nJune 8, 1999\nSo, it was no problem. But then when they got there, of course, they were a little\napprehensive. We \u2014 when we got back they \u2014 they went back to school. Jeff \u2014 oh\nJeff, we bro \u2014 took Jeff back in \u201956. He graduated in 1956 \u2014 \u201976, yeah, 1976.",
        "Q: What year was he born in?",
        "A: \u201958. He graduated from high school in \u201976 and we \u2014 we had \u2014 we were on home\nleave, we had two months home leave, so we came back and we traveled all over\nthe United States for a couple of months, and then dropped him off at the\nUniversity of Virginia in Charlottesville, where he had been accepted earlier, and\nwe went back to Switzerland and he then sort of became a jetsetter. About every\nthree months he was in \u2014 in Switzerland. And the way UVA works, we dropped\nhim off en \u2014 end of August when school started. In early December school was out\nand until about the latter part of January, and he was back in Switzerland, he was\noff skiing someplace with his friends and girlfriends and whatever. And in January\nwent back. In early May school was out and he was back for the summer. So that\nwas for a couple of years and he \u2014 he was very unhappy that we came back. He\nliked that.",
        "Q: What are your children doing today?",
        "A: Jeff is in real estate, he has his own real estate firm. He is doing mostly\ncommercial real estate, shopping centers and big complexes all over the east coast.\nJune 8, 1999\nJim is an aeronautical engineer, works for Naval Air Systems Command. He is\nright now in the \u2014 has a special assignment in the office of the assistant Secretary of\nState \u2014 o-of the Navy. And David de-decided after high school he didn\u2019t want to be\nlike his brothers, to get \u2014 he\u2019s the youngest \u2014 go to college, so he went into the air\nforce. He spent about nine years in the air force, got out, and then he decided he\nwanted to be a police officer, and that\u2019s exactly what he is now. He\u2019s a police\nofficer in the town of Vienna, right in our neighborhood, and we see him almost\nevery day that he works, he \u2014 a cruiser comes around and he says Mom, what\u2019s to\neat? All of them are married. Jeff has two children. Aaron is now 11 years old and\nhas started working on his Bar Mitzvah. Michelle is nine \u2014 yeah, Michelle is nine.\nAnd Jim has two. Joshua is four and Kayla will be one year old on the first of\nJuly. And David has twins who were one year old on the 30\" of April. That\u2019s\nKatherine(ph) and Rachel. We just celebrated about four weeks ago, celebrated\ntheir first birthday. A delightful couple of twins chattering away, talking to each\nother in their own language. But all of them are doing well.",
        "Q: What did you tell your children about your childhood?",
        "A: For many years I wasn\u2019t talking about anything about me, except when they\nasked a question, I would answer it. Did you \u2014 did you go to school? Yes, I did.\nAnd that was about it, or a little more. But is not until about the middle 80\u2019s is\nJune 8, 1999\nwhen I \u2014 one day it sort of dawned on me \u2014 that wa \u2014 it came from some questions\nthat I \u2014 a discussion we had with \u2014 with the kids, that they really didn\u2019t know me.\nThey knew bits and pieces of \u2014 they knew who I was. They knew where I came\nfrom, they knew what I\u2019d gone through, a little bit. But just bits and pieces, and I\ndecided that I needed to write this thing down. I was not consciously ever holding it\nback, it was just not \u2014 I just \u2014 somehow I couldn\u2019t. It was \u2014 I don\u2019t know what \u2014\nwhat it was, but I won\u2019t speculate on that. So when the time \u2014 at that time there was\nan immediate action. I went out and I bought myself a word processor and I hooked\nit up and I sat down and I started writing. And I started writing every day from then\non until I had it all on paper. And so I\u2014 I wrote my \u2014 my whole history up to that\npoint. There isn\u2019t much after that anyway, they know me since then. And I made\ncopies and they all have a copy of it. And then when I did the Shoah tape with you,\ns-soon as I got that in the mail, I immediately went down to the copy place and had\nthem copy me \u2014 make me three copies and th-they all have copies of that. And\nsince then, they have \u2014 they have asked a lot of questions. More detailed. That has\ngotten them to \u2014 on the track to ask questions.",
        "Q: In what ways did the Shoah, the Holocaust influence your professional and\npersonal choices?\nJune 8, 1999",
        "A: Well, it interrupted my dream of becoming a doctor. That of course, was dead.\nAnd there\u2019s still a little nostalgia in my mind every time I think about it, I said, I\u2014I\nshouldn\u2019t have gone for the money, I should have gone back to Switzerland, I\nshould \u2014 well, should have, would have, could have, it didn\u2019t happen, of course.\nBut it is \u2014 other than that, of course there is \u2014 there was the \u2014 the pain. The\nknowledge that I survived and my family didn\u2019t, has always been with me, it\u2019s\nnever left me in \u2014 not in \u2014 in Korea and not in Tokyo and not of course in \u2014 in \u2014 in\nEurope. I\u2019ve been looking for the answer, and of course there is no answer. But\nalso I\u2019ve been \u2014 I\u2019ve spent an awful lot of my waking life looking for my parents.\nThere was a big gap there. My parents and \u2014 and the rest of the family, but my \u2014\nmy mother and my father, of course. And of course that\u2019s \u2014 didn\u2019t come until about\nthree years ago, when I was doing a \u2014 a study on \u2014 on \u2014 1n the museum \u2014 in the\nHolocaust museum, and I was talking to the then head of archives, in a casual\nconversation, and you know, mentioning that I had \u2014 who I was and that family\nwas \u2014 was taken to \u2014 deported to \u2014 from Vienna to \u2014 to L\u00e9dz and that\u2019s when I lost\nthe trail. And he s \u2014 he told \u2014 told me that, he said, we have just gotten these five\nvolumes of \u2014 a register of all the people that were in the ghetto, have you seen it? I\nsaid no, didn\u2019t know anything about it and we interrupted the \u2014 my interview with\nhim and I went to look at it and I opened it, I asked for the \u2014 there \u2014 1t was\nJune 8, 1999\nalphabetical thing. Apparently the Germans had registered all this. Had it in\nalphabetical order and it was found after the war, the Polish government had it, and\nfinally got to Yad Vashem and \u2014 and \u2014 and to the museum. And I opened it to the\nS\u2019s and went to Stein and there was my mother and my father and the rest of the\nfamily. And I found a \u2014 there was a date when they ar \u2014 who they were, their\nprofession, their date of birth, when they arrived in the \u2014 in the ghetto, and when\nthey left the ghetto. Now, the leaving of the ghetto for most of them was later dates,\nand to my knowledge that was before the \u2014 that was after the Chelmno death camp\nhad been closed, that was the ausch \u2014 they were mostly to Auschwitz then, or other\nconcentration camps. But my parents and some others, I noticed the \u2014 the final depr\n\u2014 disposition there is a \u2014 it said TR7. I remembered from my readings that there\nwere certain time periods when there were transports to \u2014 to Chelmno. And so\nright after that I went to looking into some of the other books that I had read that\nhad this thing and then I remembered the first one was Gilbert and I read in there,\nthere were seven transports from the 21\u2018 to the 28\" of February, 1942 to Chelmno,\ntransport seven was on the 20\" of February. That was closure to me. I knew on the\n27\" of \u2014 27 \u2014 28\", excuse me, 28\" of February, they had died at Chelmno.",

        "A: Well, I found \u2014 well, my parents, as I said, died at Chelmno. Uncles, aunts,\ncousins were there until about August and were shipped to Auschwitz. I think\npretty much all of the Austrian contingent was gone by that time. I \u2014 I \u2014 there\u2019s a\ncertain amount o-of peace that \u2014 peace that it gave me when I found out,\nparticularly about my parents, because I had been searching, what, for almost 60\nyears, and with no results for fift - 50 some odd years. And 1-1t \u2014 it was a relief. It\nwas \u2014 it was definitely a relief to me to \u2014 to find out finally. And I think it \u2014 the\nrelief really came when I sat down a-and wrote letters to all \u2014 what relatives I still\nhave, a couple of cousins and \u2014 and some other more distant relatives, ti\u2014 and told\nthem about it. I now had something to tell, and that ended it. So that was about the\nend of \u2014 of that. I don\u2019t think I \u2014 I can add anything to this.",
        "Q: With what Holocaust related groups or organizations are you affiliated?",
        "A: Well, with the \u2014 mainly with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. I\u2019ve been\nthere for over six years now, since before it opened. I started on \u2014 to work on\nJune 8, 1999\nopening day in a hospitality suite at the \u2014 at the [indecipherable] Plaza where\nsome of the VIPs were quartered and we had a suite there where we \u2014 a\u2014 a-\u2014a gor\n\u2014aroom there where we gave them tickets, gave them directions, told them where\nto go and so forth. Then I had to wait a little while until I got into the business\nservices training program. I\u2019d missed the first class, so I got into the second \u2014 the\nnext class and \u2014 later that year, \u201993. And I been there \u2014 I been there ever since. I\nworked at \u2014 two years on the volunteer advisory board, one year as its chairman.\nAnd have done a lot of, well additional things like studies in addition to \u2014 to my\nregular duties there. And it\u2019s been \u2014 it\u2019s been a useful thing. It gives me a chance to\ntalk to people and maybe add something to their knowledge. When people ask a\nquestion, I give them just a little more than they asked for, usually. Except, of\ncourse, the main question, where\u2019s the bathroom. I don\u2019t do any more of that, I just\npoint them in the right direction. But on the others, if they want to know about\nwhere an exhibit is, I know they also want to know what it is about, and I find that\nmost of them don\u2019t. So giving them that little extra information, satisfying to me,\nand from what I can see, to \u2014 with people, they like it. Th-They \u2014 I get a special\nthank you. So th-that has been a \u2014 the other organizations, oh, I \u2014 I\u2019m a member of\nthe Friends of the Yad Vashem, but that\u2019s strictly a \u2014 you know, a supporting\nthing. I send them my donation and I get their newspaper. And the same for the\nJune 8, 1999\nAmerican gathering of \u2014 of \u2014 what its \u2014 American Gathering of Holocaust\nSurvivors. I\u2019m not anywhere involved \u2014 not \u2014 not involved in any chapter of what \u2014\nif they have any. I contribute to them, and I think it\u2019s a worthwhile thing. I give\nthem some money and I read their publication, but that\u2019s about it. I am not a joiner.\nI\u2019m -\u2014I\u2019m very selective in what I join.",
        "Q: Have you had some special moments or special experiences at the museum that\nyou can share?",
        "A: At the museum? Oh, many, many. I had \u2014 one of them, I was doing groups,\nwhich I \u2014 I do mostly groups now, because nobody else wants to do them. Now, I\nhad a school group from France, a \u2014 French high school students, most \u2014 all girls,\nas a matter of fact. And one little girl said to me, with her teacher, they all spoke\nEnglish very nicely. And she said that her grandfather had \u2014 was in the resistance,\nhe was Jewish, her grandfather was in the resistance, he had survived. He had a\ngun, a rifle, something, that he gave to the Smithsonian and the Smithsonian had\ngiven it to the museum, and would I know where she could possibly find that? I\ntold her, I said, when you get down to the second floor, when you make \u2014 go\naround the first bend, there are the resistance movements, you find the French\nresistance there, take a look there. About two hours later, the girl came back with\ntears in her eyes, saying thank you, thank you so much. I found not only my\nJune 8, 1999\ngrandfather\u2019s gun, with his name on it and all that, with a label, but also some\npapers he had apparently given, some pa \u2014 passport \u2014 well, I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not sure\nwhat it \u2014 what it was, I can\u2019t remember. I looked at it afterwards, but I can\u2019t \u2014 but\nsome documents that are also sitting right there. So she found her grandfather there.\nIt was \u2014 it was a heartwarming thing. I had another one, I was loading the elevators,\nand it was a quiet period, and I had a family coming in around \u2014 what looked like a\nhusband and wife and two grown children, children in their 20\u2019s. And I directed\nthem to the \u2014 to the I.D. cards and said, pick up an I.D. card. The man picked up an\nI.D. card, and the next \u2014 I was looking at him, next he said, oh my God. I said,\nanything wrong? He said no. We are from Holland and I picked a card, this is a\nperson from my town in Holland. I didn't know anybody was in the Holocaust in\nHolland, in \u2014 from my town. Some small town he lives in. They looked like\nprofessional people. But, and I-I-I said, well, th-that\u2019s very unusual. And he said,\noh, when I get back I will \u2014 I will give this to the mayor. We will \u2014 I will \u2014 will tell\nthem that we \u2014 we have to do something, you know, a plaque or something for a\nperson ah \u2014 we didn \u2014 I don\u2019t think anybody even knows or remembers that. I said,\nthat\u2019s wonderful, please do that. And there were several other things like that that\nhappened that are very nice to know. I read \u2014 oh, well, an amazing thing. One day I\n\u2014 Iwas \u2014I was the information desk, and a man walked up to me. And he looks at\nJune 8, 1999\nme and I looked at him and he \u2014 some [indecipherable] looked familiar, wasn\u2019t\nsure what it was. He said, you\u2019re Stein. I looked at him. I said, ve seen you\nsomewhere, way back. He says, yeah, in [indecipherable] he started speaking\nGerman. Somebody I knew in Vienna, and as a matter of fact I also knew him in\nNew York, but we \u2014 he had \u2014 he changed comple \u2014 I-I don\u2019t know, he \u2014 I guess I\ndidn\u2019t change much, but he recognized me. I didn\u2019t recognize him, but I had known\nhim in \u2014 in New York and \u2014 about 1939 \u2014 1940, I guess, and then sort of lost track,\nI hadn\u2019t seen him since about then \u2014 since then. So we \u2014 we had a long talk. Those\nare some of the things. Vis-Visitors, I have a \u2014 I have my own personal policy in \u2014\nin \u2014 in \u2014 in visitor services. There\u2019s no German or Austrian that comes to the\nmuseum that does not go and see it, I don\u2019t care whether there are tickets or not. I\nalways have some \u2014 my own tickets in my pocket. I always save some for just\nthose. And I\u2019ve had many cases where I \u2014 I think they need to go see, see their own\nhistory. Not mine, their history, now. And I\u2019ve had some of them come back, f-find\nme again, look me up and \u2014 and thank me for \u2014 for letting them see. They says, you\nknow, we read a lot about it, we heard a lot about it, but not like this. I said, that\u2019s\nright. It\u2019s all there. I enjoy working with groups, school groups mostly, where we\ngo a little deeper into the \u2014 the subject matter, and I\u2019m particularly 1-interested in\nthe questions the kids ask. And some of them are good. And then I have right now\nJune 8, 1999\nstill \u2014 still there from last year, so I guess two years now, the artwork down at the\nelevator, the basement \u2014 the concourse elevator. The first thing as you walk in on\nthe left hand side is that large picture of the police station in Vienna, the one I lived\nnext door to. The one I\u2019ve been in. And so, after we \u2014 I tell them all about the\nmuseum, I say, well while you\u2019re waiting for the elevator, take a look at this one. It\nmight give you something a little personal. I was in that police station, I lived right\nnext door to it. I been in there many times before the Germans moved in and after\nthe Germans moved in, I was in there asking for permission to leave the country.\nAnd then I get all kinds of questions. Oh, were you there, oh. And, you know. The\nelevators, fortunately take a long time to come down to \u2014 to the concourse and so\nwe got \u2014 have time to answer those questions. Makes an impression, and it gives\nthem one more dimension to [indecipherable]. I also \u2014 1 s \u2014 I \u2014 excuse me, I\nstarted this program, which they are n\u2014 are now continuing, o-of the \u2014 when I was\non the \u2014 on the [indecipherable] of taking people through and having survivors\ntelling their stories at certain places that they\u2019re particularly \u2014 that they\u2019re \u2014 were\ninvolved in. And I just saw in those latest \u2014 you may have seen that \u2014 that they \u2014\nPete Philips is now going to do it this fall again for th-the paid staff of visitor\nservices. And they need it. Paid staff 1s, you know, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re the most\ntemporary employees \u2014 o-of visitor services, are the most temporaries 1-in the\nJune 8, 1999\nmuseum. They come in, it\u2019s their first job after college and they can\u2019t wait to get\ntheir one year in to get status to apply for another job somewhere, because they\u2019re\nnot paying them. The pay is \u2014 is ridiculous. And so they\u2019re not putting heart and\nsoul into it like we do.",
        "Q: Tell me about the exhibit of the 1936 Olympics.",
        "A: The what?",
        "Q: The exhibit from the 1936 Olympics in Berlin and what significance that had\nfor you.",
        "A: The 1936 Olympics, that was in \u2014 oh, that was interesting because I found a\npicture in there of two \u2014 there was a picture of two Jewish swim \u2014 swim champions\n\u2014 Austrian swim champions that refused to go to the Olympics and they happened\nto be teammates of mine, I was a member of the same club and the same swim\nteam. And that was a real surprise when I walked by there and took a look at that,\nand here they are. Interestingly, I had seen one of them on an Austrian video of\nformer Austrians\u2019 interviews, during an interview in Israel. And I saw one of them\non that one. Of course, now I wouldn\u2019t have recognized her cause she\u2019s, you know,\n50 years 0 \u2014 60 years older than when I last saw her. And then about a few weeks\nlater I go down there and I see the way I did recognize her.",
        "Q: What do you make of the resurgence of interest in the Holocaust?\nJune 8, 1999",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: The resurgence of interest in the Holocaust.",
        "A: Well, all I can say 1s it\u2019s about time. But it\u2019s understandable that it wasn\u2019t until\nsome of the major institutions like re\u2014 Yad Vashem, and the U.S. museum came\ninto being. That\u2019s brought it \u2014 and of course that \u2014 that led to all the things that are\nnow going on, the \u2014 o-of payments and \u2014 and restitution and all that. It was\ndormant too long, and of course in my own case, in Austria, the Austrians never\nconsidered themselves as the first victims until what, 1992 or \u201993 when Chancellor\nVranitzky said hey, let\u2019s forget about that, we\u2019re just as guilty as the rest of them.\nAnd then all of a sudden they said oh yeah, yes we are. I-I mean, it \u2014 it took a long\ntime and it is good because those of us who were there or were directly involved,\nwe\u2019re not going to be around for too long. And now there\u2019s a whole new generation\ncoming up who will know about it. And I think that is important.",
        "Q: What do you say to Holocaust deniers? How do you answer them?",
        "A: I haven\u2019t had a chance to talk to one. And I been thinking about that, what\nwould I say to them? And my first impulse is violence, do some violence. But I\nthink the best thing I can think of is to ridicule them, say oh, you know all about\nthat? Well, I was there, so don\u2019t you tell me it didn\u2019t happen, because I was there it\ndid happen, I saw it happen. And walk away. But th-th \u2014 yo-you can\u2019t engage them\nJune 8, 1999\nin \u2014 in conversation really, because I think that is what they want. Don\u2019t give them\na platform.",
        "Q: Recently there have been some events that have echoes of the Holocaust and I\nwas wondering if you would comment, or if you want to comment on the \u2014 the\nColumbine shooting, which was scheduled to take place on Hitler\u2019s birthday.",
        "A: I-I don\u2019t see a connection.",
        "Q: What about Kosovo and what\u2019s happening with the ethnic cleansing?",
        "A: Well, there you have another Holocaust going, and I think it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s awful. I\ndon\u2019t, now that it\u2019s almost over, I don\u2019t see how these people are going to go back\ninto what used to be their homes. And from what I understand, many of them don\u2019t\nwant to, and I don\u2019t blame them, just like we didn\u2019t want to go back. We could\nhave gone back, I guess, and some few did, but not \u2014 not \u2014 not many. The same\nwith them. Those who go back, it\u2019s gonna be hard to \u2014 to live with \u2014 with the\npeople that \u2014 that kicked them out. I don\u2019t see it. You see, it\u2019s a very, very difficult\nsituation that they will \u2014 they are facing now. Then again, knowing how it feels to\ntake off and run and leave and \u2014 and get helped in a camp or \u2014 or \u2014 or another \u2014 or\nget a bed someplace, or \u2014 or \u2014 it\u2019s difficult.",

You mentioned the violin and \u2014 and how the\nviolin was significant. Do you still play the violin?",
        "A: Well, let\u2019s put it that way, I still have one. I dust it off every once in awhile and\nI play, only it\u2019s \u2014 the fingers aren\u2019t working right any more.

No, I still have the\nviolin, and I \u2014 I \u2014 well, the mandolin, which is the same fingering, but it\u2019s a little\neasier to play, cause I don\u2019t have to play all \u2014 what I used to play. I \u2014I still play\nthat. I have one. I picked one up in Moscow one day, when I was in Moscow. Got\nit for about six rubles, or something like that.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about that?",
        "A: Well, there was something \u2014 I was what, about 16 or so. He was giving a lecture\nat one of the people\u2019s university, there was a \u2014 one of those things like \u2014 like the\nextension course type operations [indecipherable] and I just had to go and s \u2014\nlisten to him. I was at the time in school, taking psychology, that was one of the\nJune 8, 1999\ncourses we were taking one year, and oh, the \u2014 had to see that. And so I went and I\nsaw th \u2014 I was \u2014 I was \u2014 I was awed. Probably didn\u2019t understand a word he said,\nbut I\u2014 I\u2014I was awed by be in the \u2014 being in the presence of the man. And it was \u2014\nit was a-an experience, but it was a youthful experience.

And I pretended to understand everything, of course, like a 16 year old\ndoes, and told everybody that I went to see a lecture of Freud\u2019s. I saw \u2014 I saw the\nman, I listened to him, and oh yes, he was great. And I don\u2019t think I even admitted\nto myself that I didn\u2019t understand what he was saying.

He \u2014\nhe died before \u2014 long before I was born, about 1912, I think it was. And it \u2014 it was\na sort of a nostalgic thing. Think \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2014I thought of my grandfa \u2014 I wan \u2014 I\nwanted to know him. I never knew any of my grandfathers. My other grandfather\nJune 8, 1999\nhad gone to America, and he died before I got here, so I never saw him. And it was\nsomething missing in my life. I \u2014 it was a sentimental thing. But in a \u2014 the history\nof my \u2014 my mother\u2019s family, it had a lo \u2014 a lot of impact, of course, on \u2014 on my\nmother, and her sisters, and her brother, too.

My\nmother was, at the time, she was about 20 years old when he \u2014 he was thrown into\nthe \u2014 into the well.

        "A: On V-E day I was somewhere on the Elbe river, facing the Russians on the\nother side, that\u2019s where we had to stop. I was with the ninth infantry division, 60\"\ninfantry regiment and I was at the time a captain in the U.S. Army and commander\nof a military intelligence unit, a prisoner of war interrogation team.\nJune 8, 1999",
        "A: By V-E day, I\u2019ve been in the service for just about four years. I was \u2014 originally\nI was drafted on October 7\u201c, 1941, two months before Pearl Harbor.",
        "A: Yes, I saw combat. I got into \u2014 I was in the Normandy landings on the day after\nD-Day \u2014 I \u2014 after D-Day on \u2014 on June seventh. I was up on the beach, and my\nduties then were, again, I \u2014 I had a \u2014 an interrogation team and we were\ninterrogating prisoners of war. But under the \u2014 at that point, of course, it was\ncombat. It was combat and interrogating and shooting some more and so forth.\nEverybody was in combat then.",
        "A: Through Europe? Yes, the only one that I encountered on the way through the \u2014\nin the campaign was Nordhausen, concentration camp Nordhausen, which we\ncame upon not knowing where we \u2014 that there was a concentration until we \u2014 til we\nran into it. It was a \u2014 1t was a horrible experience. Knowing that my parents must\nbe in one of those, I \u2014 I sort of instinctively started looking around to see if I could\nsee my parents. It wa \u2014 it was a \u2014 an impression that stayed with me for a long\ntime. It was the \u2014 bodies lying around, people wandering around in a daze. We tried\nJune 8, 1999\nto, the little time that we had, we were moving pretty fast at the time, chasing the\nrest of the Germans in the direction of the \u2014 of the Russians. And we were there for\nabout a day or two, I did interrogate some of the guards. They \u2014 some of them, as I\nrecall, were Ukrainian guards that the survivors of \u2014 of the camp \u2014 many of them\nby the way in Nordhausen w-was one of the camps that had a lot of slave labors\nfrom eastern Europe, a lot of Yugoslavs that I encountered there. They wanted\nthose guards. And if I lost any of them on the way, I \u2014 I-I can\u2019t remember. But they\n\u2014 the guards were scared. I recall one guard, who absolutely refused to talk. And\nwe had ways of, you know, interrogate \u2014 ways of interrogate \u2014 this \u2014 this was not a\nfriendly interrogation, so we made them talk. Not by physical force in any way, but\nby \u2014 oh, various things. Like we have him take off his clothes. And when a man\nstands there in front of you without his clothes on, he\u2019ll start talking pretty soon,\nwe found out. That\u2019s an interesting thing we learned over \u2014 over the \u2014 we sort of\npicked up as we went through the war and \u2014 interrogation techniques that they\ndidn\u2019t teach us in school. But he f \u2014 he talked and I got \u2014 I got his story, of course, I\ncan\u2019t remember the details now. But I did get a \u2014 the story of some of the atrocities\nthat the \u2014 they were \u2014 they committed. I turned the people over \u2014 the \u2014 the guards\nover to the military police that picked them up and took them back to prison camps.\nJune 8, 1999",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t. I have no idea.",
        "A: Yes, well, in the military I was \u2014 I was \u2014 I went to \u2014I was originally in field\nartillery. I went to officer candidate school and became \u2014 I was an artillery officer.\nAnd then I was, shortly after graduation at Fort Sill, Oklahoma where the artillery\nschool was, I was tapped for intelligence because of my background in languages\nand so forth. I was called one night \u2014 one evening I was called in and was told that\nWashington, in quotes, at that time wanted me to go to \u2014 wanted me to go to the\nintelligence school, which was at Fort Ritchie, right in \u2014 1n Maryland here, then\ncalled Camp Ritchie. That was the military intelligence school and we went\nthrough interrogation training and all kinds of intelligence training. Oh, we learned\nall kinds of things like Morse code, which I have never used in my life. Don\u2019t\nknow anybody who ever did, and folder interpretation, map reading of foreign\nmaps, which was important because some of the captured maps we had to \u2014 to\nknow what we saw, and we had all kinds of field training with those. These were\nJune 8, 1999\nMaryland \u2014 Maryland maps, maps of the \u2014 of the Ritchie area, but printed in\nvarious languages including Japanese. I remember one night that they dropped me\noff someplace at a place and gave me this \u2014 this map. And from landmarks and all\nthat, you identified where you were and which way you were going. Well, that was\nimportant but in \u2014 basically for me that was not a problem because I was fluent in\nGerman, of course, my native language, I also knew French. And that\u2019s the\ndirection we went in, so once we got there, I could easily read those maps if \u2014 if\nnecessary. We were trained in order of battle, identifying \u2014 we learned everything\nabout the German \u2014 we knew more about the German army, their uniforms, their \u2014\ntheir insignia. That was all part of \u2014 of the training and the units, the organization\nof the German army, what units looked like, what they were, how ba \u2014 how strong\nthey were, etcetera. That was all part of it because that was all part of \u2014 of the\ninterrogation process. And so when we \u2014 when I got into \u2014 to the combat are \u2014\nzone, interrogating the people was simple. One thing, for example, was that every\nGerman had what was called a soldbuch, a paybook. Now that soldbuch \u2014\nsoldbuch had all his military a-assignments listed in there. And it was easy to\nfigure out who he was and what he was. So the first thing we\u2019d ask them is, give\nme your soldbuch. And they would hand it over and you had them right there, that\nwas \u2014 now you knew. And so then you would say, oh you were from the 338\"\nJune 8, 1999\nFisilier-Batallion(ph), yeah? And he\u2019d say yeah, and take it from there. Most of\nthe interrogations were actually not difficult. Most of them talked. Now you ran\ninto some, officers mainly, who said name, rank and serial number, that\u2019s all they\nwould give you. But again, you \u2014 we \u2014 all of us, I think, found ways to \u2014 to break\nthem. For example is one thing, a German, regardless of whether you were friend\nor enemy, respected rank. So you made sure that the insignia you were \u2014 you were\nwearing at the time, and we had a complete collection of it, were at least one rank\nhigher than the man we had, and we could read that. So we \u2014 we played that game,\nit was \u2014 if you had time for it. Now a lot of \u2014 most of it was right up in the front\nlines, so you didn\u2019t have time to \u2014 to play games. And at those times we would just\nplay tough, yeah. Threaten, all kinds of things, you know, we would \u2014 we \u2014 we\u2019d\nsay \u2014 we\u2019d tell them, okay, we\u2019ll let you walk back home, right through the front\nlines. Of course they wouldn\u2019t do that cause they\u2019d get shot. And things like that,\nand they would \u2014 I don\u2019t really recall anyone I could not break in an \u2014 in an\ninterrogation, and I\u2019ve interrogated thousands of them. Now, what we did with the\ninformation, and we \u2014 we \u2014 in my case, being in the front lines, I would \u2014 my\ntargets were who was opposing us, how strong are they, where are they located,\nwhat kind of weapons do they have, where\u2019s their artillery. And I would\nimmediately call in to artillery to give them the coordinate of locations so that they\nJune 8, 1999\ncould fire on it, and my infantry units that I supported would get all the information\n\u2014 the \u2014 the intelligence officer of the unit would get all the information that was\nrelevant to who \u2014 who was on the other side of the line, what was their morale, how\n\u2014 how strong were they, what kind of weapons did they have. And that went \u2014 well,\nwe had a lot of good results. One of the things that I and my team always did was\nwhen we had specific targets that we could identify, after we had pushed through\nthe area we checked those targets to make su \u2014 to see if they had been hit like we \u2014\nand I think most of them were. So, it was \u2014 in Normandy it was \u2014 is rough, cause\nwe were going from hedgerow to hedgerow, you know, one hedgerow at a time,\nand you know, a hundred \u2014 a hundred yards a day, things like that. But after that, of\ncourse, on the run, that was a little different. Once we broke through, it was \u2014 it\nwas a different story, it was easier then.",
        "A: Yes, I\u2014I went to \u2014I was shipped to England in December of 1943. I was in\nEngland until \u2014 until D-Day, so that was six months from \u2014 in England. And at\nthe time I was sent to \u2014 from where we were out in the near \u2014 in the country\nsomewhere, I was sent to London to study with \u2014 with British intelligence. They\nJune 8, 1999\nhad some schools and they \u2014 they took us into \u2014 and gave us some \u2014 some\ninformation. The British had a lot more experience. We had absolutely no\nexperience, we were new. We were \u2014 all of \u2014 not \u2014 I\u2019m not just talking about the \u2014\nthe front line type intelligence, but the OSS didn\u2019t exist until just about that time.\nAnd they had never, the people in the OSS were not what the British had trained\nfor years and years as intelligence officers. We all learned fr \u2014 by \u2014 by doing. The \u2014\nI had some contact with OSS people afte \u2014 on \u2014 well, on \u2014 actually still in Europe,\nbut on the way home. They were going home at the same time, and I listened to\nsome of their stories. They were dropped \u2014 one particular I remember, who was an\nartist, or at least that is what he \u2014 he faked. He was of Italian descent, a New\nYorker who spoke Italian. He was dropped into Normandy and he sat around\npainting. He was \u2014 to the Germans he was an Italian painter visiting here, and was\nfriendly right, to \u2014 Italy was a friendly country. And that\u2019s the way he collected\nintelligence. But he said he had absolutely no idea what he was doing when he first\ngot in there. He got in by parachute, got \u2014 the French helped him \u2014 French\nunderground helped him. And then he \u2014 he sat aro \u2014 he tha \u2014 he started painting and\nreporting and they had equipment to \u2014 to report. And he was around Normandy\nand the Sherbrooke(ph) peninsula doing this artwork. Course na \u2014 he brought\nnothing home. He all gave that to \u2014 to his French comrades there. But again, no\nJune 8, 1999\nexperience. Everything was \u2014 whatever we did was done for the first time, on the\nU.S. side. And now, as I said, the British, of course, had been doing their in-\nintelligence work, collection of intelligence all over the world with the \u2014 with the\ncolonies and all that. So \u2014 a-and in World War II, of course, they\u2019d been in the war\nfor three years before we came in, or almost three years. That was wa-why I said\nthat their \u2014 their intelligence was better, they were better organized. We were just\nlearning, but we got there. We \u2014 just like everything else, I think, in the \u2014 1n the\nU.S. Army. That army had absolutely no experience, we came from all over the\nplace. Nobody \u2014 there were no real soldiers at th \u2014 in 1941. By 1944 we did the \u2014\nthe biggest \u2014 biggest job ever done in any \u2014 any invasion. And it was successful. So\nI guess as Americans, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re quick learners. We picked up an awful lot\nfrom the British. They were very helpful. They taught us then. The schools that I\nwent to in \u2014 in London during that period were very informative, because we\ntalked to people who had been there, who had been there, done that and told us how\n\u2014 how they did whatever we were doing later on. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s about \u2014 that\u2019s\nabout it for \u2014 on that.",
        "A: Strip.",
        "A: Well, there are \u2014 there were \u2014 for example, the \u2014 the \u2014 what they didn\u2019t teach us,\nthey taught us that e-every soldier has a soldbuch, but didn\u2019t tell us what to do with\nit. That is we picked up ourselves. I \u2014 I picked up the first one I looked at and I\nsaid, there it is. And I asked the man ha \u2014 you were up with \u2014 I told him, I didn\u2019t\nask him, I told him, you were up from this and this regiment, or this \u2014 and they said\nyes. And before that you were something else. One of the things that we did was\nwhen \u2014 when time allowed, was engage in some small talk. Small talk about, well,\nyou got your family back home, and that would open up suddenly, and then you\nlead into other things. I had some interesting interrogations. I had \u2014 and this is \u2014\nthis is one in a\u2014 in a\u20141na billion, probably. Had a prisoner, this \u2014 we were about \u2014\nwe were in Germany at the time. And he had very little information, but he was\nwilling to talk. He said tha \u2014 actually, he deserted he told me. I\u2019m not sure that that\nwas right, but it didn\u2019t matter. But I noticed in papers that he had on him that he\nwas a medical student at the University of Vienna. And so I asked him a \u2014 whether\nhe was \u2014 took anatomy from Professor Bernkopf(ph) Versowzer(ph) and his\nmouth opened and he se \u2014 di-di-ta-ba \u2014 how \u2014 but how did you know? I said, I\u2019m\nan intelligence officer, I know everything. And he just couldn\u2019t understand why,\nJune 8, 1999\nand then he started opening up and told me all kinds of things about what happened\nto his family and others. His mother-in-law was mentally incompetent and she was\nin \u2014 in Vienna in a place that was known to me, that was the insane asylum in\nVienna, there was one big one. And she had been killed, and he told me that they\nwere killing these \u2014 well, handicapped people, mentally handicapped. They didn\u2019t\nneed them, so they killed them. And you know, he was mad and so he said he\ndeserted. Well, took him a long time to desert. But th \u2014 it-1t\u2019s that kind of thing that\n\u2014 that those are interesting little things that happened. There were many of them, of\nthe different nature. For example, in the Battle of the Bulge, the unit I was with was\nholding one of the \u2014 you know, the corners of \u2014 of the thing. We were not\npenetrated, but we \u2014 we \u2014 we went in there to hold it, and that was in the famous\nBattle of the Hiirtgen Forest. And there was a German lieutenant colonel in there\nwith his troops, holding out. And we could \u2014 it\u2019s a dense forest and we just couldn't\nget him out. And one day one of \u2014 a couple of Germans came out with a white flag\nand said that they\u2019re currently \u2014 name I \u2014 I can\u2019t remember the name, but it was a\nrather, later on, well known in \u2014 in \u2014 in the history of the war. What was his name?\nWell, can\u2019t remember. Anyhow, so who was sent in to bring \u2014 yeah, he was sick.\nHe was very sick and he wanted to surrender. And so who was sent in to bring him\nout, of course? The only one who spoke German. And in I went and I got him out\nJune 8, 1999\nand we had \u2014 the man had pneumonia very badly. But \u2014 and, you know,\ninterrogating him at this point was really not necessary. There was nothing he could\ntell us in the \u2014 in the present situation. But he was on his own, just started talking as\nwe carried him out. His own men carried him on a stretcher. And we came out of\nthe forest and then we waited until he was evacuated. And he just told us all kinds\nof war stories, was just great. Good information. Not necessarily tactical\ninformation, but strategically important of how decisions were made and all that.\nWell, we took that down and got it back to higher headquarters and I don\u2019t know\nwhat they did with it, but at least the information was there. So these were the kind\nof things that you fell into occasionally.",
        "A: Yes. Some of them, I told them. Particularly the Waffen SS. I wanted them to\nknow, because I \u2014 I knew that the \u2014 well, it put some fear into them. Although, I\u2019m\nnot sure that they were anywhere near any of the atrocities or anything like that.\nBut the Waffen SS was a tough outfit, in the beginning. Not in the \u2014 t-towards the\nend of the war, they filled in the blanks in \u2014 in the \u2014 the blank spaces in those\norganizations with just about anybody, including, I think, I\u2019m not sure whether I\ntold that \u2014 told you that story earlier about the boy, about a 17 year old kid who\ntold me that he was an American. I said, oh yes? He said yes. He said, take off my\nJune 8, 1999\nboot. Took off his boot, took out an innersole and came out with a green card with\na baby\u2019s picture on it. His family had gone \u2014 had come to America and his parents\nwere in \u2014 in Los Angeles. Yeah, came to America in the \u2014 sometime in the late\n20\u2019s, early 30\u2019s, I guess. He was a baby then, and was a small \u2014 small \u2014 small child.\nThey applied for a \u2014 they became permanent residents and probably, his parents\nlater, citizens. But he was sent to his grandmother in Germany to go to school,\nthey wanted him to go to school in Germany. Well, he did, he went back, and war\nbroke out and when he got to be about 16 or so they pulled him in, this was towards\nthe end of the war. And there he was in a Waffen SS uniform. That thing made the\nnewspapers, by the way. I had \u2014 happened to have somebody when I \u2014 I called the\nthing in. I said \u2014 I said, ve got \u2014 I\u2019ve got an \u2014 an American Waffen SS guy here.\nAnd I told my G2 about that, and apparently there were some \u2014 I think Associated\nPress newsmen there, they wanted to see us. They say, hold him there, we \u2014 we\u2019 ll\nbe right down. They took a picture. I still have a clipping at home of that and\ntalking about Captain Stein talking to \u2014 to this kid, whose showing his \u2014 that he\nwas an American. Well, he was still a prisoner of war in a \u2014 I guess we \u2014 we had to\nprocess him that way, cause he was a German soldier.\nJune 8, 1999",
        "A: Not really until the end of the war, until about V-E day. When we \u2014 when I\ntalked to some people in \u2014 well, some Germans at that point, we were at the Czech\nborder \u2014 no, that was afterward. We were still on the Elbe. And we had some\ncommunication with the Russians, who had come across many of the concentration\ncamps in the east. And they were telling us what they had found. Millions of people\nkilled and although we had interpreters, Russian interpreters, we had a meeting ta \u2014\neven before V-E day, it \u2014 it was in late April, we were on the Elbe and we stopped,\nand the Germans stopped on the other side, that was agreed that we would \u2014 that\nElbe was the \u2014 the \u2014 the border between the two zones. And we had arranged and I\nwas invol \u2014 I was included in that with our general \u2014 meetings with the Russian\ngeneral. We got together and we spent a couple of days of just talking through\ninterpreters. And that 1s the first time that I really found out what had happened.\nAnd of course, my parents were on my mind, and not only my parents, the rest of\nmy family, too. That\u2019s when the search began. Of course, after V-E day, I could not\n\u2014I wanted to go to Vienna. Figured that \u2014 I knew \u2014 I had known that my parents\nhad been deported to L\u00e9dz, because in \u2014 it was two weeks after I went into the\narmy in \u2014 in October \u00b041, I got a postcard that is \u2014 it came to New York and to my\n\u2014 the second cousin who lived in New York, or \u2014 was my \u2014 my address that I had.\nAnd he brought it to me and saying that a postcard had come saying that my\nJune 8, 1999\nparents were being deported in October of \u201941, to Litzmannstadt, Lodz, to the\nghetto. That\u2019s the last information I had. After that, nothing. And so I wanted to go\nto Vienna, but the army wouldn\u2019t let me. As an intelligence officer, the Russians\nwere in \u2014 had \u2014 had Vienna at the time and that part of Austria and they wouldn\u2019t\nlet us go into the Russian zone. So at that point I decided Pll go home, to New\nYork at that time. And by October \u2014 the war was over in March \u2014 1n \u2014 1n \u2014 excuse\nme, in May, May the ninth, excuse me. And we were \u2014 my team was pulled out in \u2014\nin July and sent back to Paris where our headquarter \u2014 military intelligence\nheadquarters was. First to \u2014 to another place in \u2014 in Germany and then to Paris.\nAnd we stayed there for shipment home. There were lots of things at that point, we\ncould have signed up as a civilian to civil government and all the things that were\ngoing on, but I decided my best bet was to go home and start looking from \u2014 from\nthat angle, and if necessary I\u2019d come back as a civilian and of course, I intended to\nget out of the army, which I did in 1945, and I was separated in \u2014 in the 14\" of\nDecember, 1945, and signed on as a reserve officer. I stayed on in the reserves.",
        "A: Captain. Yes, I started out, of course, in \u2019\u00b041 as a private. In \u201943 I went to\nO.C.S., became second lieutenant, was promoted in Normandy to first lieutenant\nJune 8, 1999\nand later that \u2014 a little later in the campaign to captain on two battlefield\npromotions.",
        "A: No, none, none whatsoever. I have a few photos that were given to me by\nrelatives after the war, who had survived. Was my father in uniform, wa \u2014 one of\nthem with \u2014 with him in uniform and me in a \u2014 in a baby carriage, and my mother,\nof course there too. So those \u2014 those are \u2014 that\u2019s about the only thin \u2014 we talked\nabout it, but that had no influence on me.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, there were a number of things that I was just thinking about in \u2014 in the\nend of 1945 and early \u201946. As a matter of fact, I was thinking about going to\nPalestine when I was still in Vienna. I was signed up for a transport, one of those\nyouth transports in \u2014 back in 1938, immediately after the anschluss. But when the\nopportunity came to get away to Luxembourg, I couldn\u2019t wait, that \u2014 that was a\nlong s\u2014 a long, drawn out process. They weren\u2019t going anywhere. We met\nperiodically, all the \u2014 well, some of us, but nothing happened. As a matter of fact,\nmy \u2014 one of my cousins, about four years younger than I, who stayed on then,\ndidn\u2019t get out until about a year later. It took that long before the transports went,\nJune 8, 1999\nthat\u2019s just about 1939, in the fall of 1939 they finally got them out, then through\nYugoslavia and then on a ship and in-into a \u2014 well, the \u2014 the Exodus story. But \u2014\ninto Palestine. I couldn\u2019t wait. I was \u2014 I was too old. I was 18 and I was in\nimmediate danger so I left. Yes, I wanted to go and I \u2014 and grew up in a Zionist\nidea. A-After the war I was \u2014 yes, I wanted to go, I \u2014 I thought of going. I also\nthought of going back to medical school, and I was accepted in 1940 \u2014 19 fift \u2014 \u00b046,\nit \u2014 in Switzerland, in \u2014 both in \u2014 in Zurich and Basel(ph).",
        "A: Right. In early \u201946, I was considering both of these things. And in \u2014 I was\naccepted. I had written to and sent my \u2014 my papers to \u2014 o-of my previous studies to\nBasel(ph) and Zurich and I was accepted in both of them, provisionally, if space\nwas available in later years. I was accepted for the first year, but for one year only\nJune 8, 1999\nand depending on space available, whatever. And at the same time, I had \u2014 this was\nnow early 1946, and I had talked to a lot \u2014 lot of people, you know, after returning\nand I found out how all these people made all this money, in all kinds of things.\nAnd I said maybe I ought to do \u2014 make a little money, I had none. I had whatever I\nhad saved from my army pay, which wasn\u2019t very much. I wasn\u2019t working, I had not\nfound a way to \u2014 to do anything and so I said why, why don\u2019t I do something else\nfirst? So I\u2014 I dropped Palestine and I dropped medicine and I went into the export\nbusiness. Opened my own busin \u2014 I took \u2014 well, first of all I had to learn something\nabout the export, and that was the big thing then that I \u2014 I found out. And I had to\nlearn something about it. Fortunately 1-in the newspapers I found a two week\ncourse that would teach me all about it, and that\u2019s exactly what I did, I\u2014 I went \u2014 I\nmean, this is strictly an amateur performance at the time. I went and took a two\nweek course and I knew all about it, I knew how to \u2014 what kind of documents you\nneeded, and how \u2014 and all I needed now 1s to find out what I was going to sell and\nwhere. Well, I and a fr \u2014 a\u2014 a wartime buddy of mine, friend, we\u2019d been through\nthe war together, and I, decided we\u2019d go into the export business, and we did. And\nwe si \u2014 decided that the electrical appliances were a good thing, we \u2014 I guess we\nliked electrical appliances, so we went into that and we decided that we would do\nSouth America \u2014 Latin America as \u2014 as our target. That, we had read was good\nJune 8, 1999\nplace to do, and we did. Went into business, we \u2014 we got in contact with some\nmanufacturers of appliances, and we went to various embassies and asked for their\nimporter \u2014 lists of importers, which was available. And we started writing let \u2014 by\nthat time, by the way, I had taken, soon as it came back, I started taking a Spanish \u2014\nI don\u2019t know why, but the G.I. bill was there and I didn't know what else to do with\nit until I went to medical school, which would have been \u2014 so I took Spanish and I\nwas fairly fluent in Spanish by that time, it was now middle of 1946. By that time\nwe \u2014 we got to the point where I n \u2014 I needed. And so I wrote up a catalog in\nSpanish, we put that up and a \u2014 a letter to all the customers and began working.\nPretty soon we were making a little money, not very much. Not enough to live on,\nbut there was still a G.I. bill that helped us out with that. And it lasted for \u2014 until\nearly 1948. In early 1948 there was a sudden stop of dollars. The dollar was no\nlonger available for payment to foreign countries, there was a shortage of d \u2014 of\ndollars, there was \u2014 there were \u2014 there were exchange restrictions. And so the big\ncom-companies could give, you know, six months credit to \u2014 to compan \u2014 the little\ncompanies, like ours, we couldn\u2019t give any credit, we worked strictly as letter of\ncredit. They sent a letter of credit in dollars to our bank and as soon as the ship \u2014\nwe could turn over the shipping documents, that the merchandise had been shipped,\nthe bank would release the money. Well, that stopped, there were no more dollar\nJune 8, 1999\nletters of credit and so we went out of business. And then started an interesting\nperiod. I didn\u2019t know which way to turn, I \u2014 I\u2019d never even looked for a job, I\ndidn\u2019t know how to look for \u2014 well, I\u2014 I knew how, but th-th-th \u2014 I didn\u2019t know\nwhat. I \u2014 so I went around and went to an employment office, one of those\nemployment agencies and they said yeah, as a matter of fa \u2014 it was on 46\" Street\nand Fifth Avenue, I remember. And they said yeah, we have a job. There\u2019s \u2014\nthere\u2019s a job opened right across the street here at a place called Nancy Studios,\nhat makers. Feather hats. You know, pasted feather on \u2014 on the thing. And \u2014 I\nmean, I \u2014 I found that out when I went to \u2014 to Nancy\u2019s. And so I went ik \u2014 went\nover there and they needed someone to run their office. Apparently whoever had\nthe office had quit \u2014 was running the office had quit. So I went up there and\nthere\u2019re two ladies running the shop and I said, here I am. They said oh yes, you\u2019ll\ndo. We \u2014 you know, told them who I was and what I had done, I had my own\nbusiness and all that. And they \u2014 they \u2014 they thought that was \u2014 that was good, so\nmy major job was making up the payroll and invoices and making sure that money\ngot to the bank and so forth. But the environment wasn\u2019t for me. This was a \u2014 a\u2014\nthe two ladies was Nancy and her sister were the designers of these hats. Their\nclientele was \u2014 were all name designers. Hattie Carnegie, Lily Dach\u00e9, a-all kind \u2014\nyou know, th-the \u2014 well known names in the fashion business, and they would\nJune 8, 1999\ndesign special things for them, and others. Had about 20 or 30 women doing the\nwork, so it was not a small place. But I started dealing with the clients and that\u2019s \u2014\nit was something I couldn\u2019t take. I-It was a strange \u2014 you know, being called\ndarling by these floating characters who were dressed in diff \u2014 1-1t was not \u2014 not my\n\u2014my cup of tea. But I worked, I \u2014 I had to make a living and I was looking around.\nAnd \u2014 and I worked there during the summer. I came home one day in September,\nit was September of \u201948, and I looked at my mail and there was a letter there from\nthe Pentagon. I opened it up and it said, dear Captain Stein, we want you back. We\nhave a special project here which 1s right in line with your experience during the\nwar and please call this number. So I called the number in \u2014 in the \u2014 in\nWashington and talked to a major and he said \u2014 he told me what it was. It was in\nthe office of the chief of military history, translating the experiences of the German\ngeneral staff that apparently the United States had under contract of some sorts, in\nand out of jail in Germany, that were writing their heart out about their\nexperiences on the eastern front in Russia. And I said that sounds interesting, yes,\nI\u2019m available. And in Novem \u2014 early November, starting in nove \u2014 as a matter of\nfact, the third of November, I \u2014 I came into Washington. Harry Truman and I\ncame at th \u2014 came together. That was the day Harry Truman was elected. I came\ninto Washington, back in uniform, and I was in the Pentagon, became chief of the\nJune 8, 1999\ntranslation section of milt \u2014 o-office of chief of military history and I spent the next\nthree years there translating and \u2014 and writing. And by that time, of course, in\n1950, summer of 1950 the Korean war broke out, and \u2014 \u201950 or \u201951 \u2014 yeah, *50.\nWell, I still had some \u2014 a year to go and \u2014 on my \u2014 my three yea \u2014 it was a three\nyear appointment. And when the time was up, my time was up, I was told that\nnobody gets out, there\u2019s a war on. And I was told that I was \u2014 but I was told I was\ngoing to Germany, to the German side of our project. And two weeks later I got\nmy orders saying report to San Francisco for shipment to Korea. And there I was,\nnot exactly going to Germany. Well, I went to Korea, and went, checked in, was\nreceived by the officer in charge of \u2014 of that unit and \u2014 who said, do you speak \u2014 is\nit\u2014 you came here as a prisoner of war interrogator, which was one of my\nspecialties. Oh, let me back up for a moment. While I was still in Washington,\nwhen I got my orders and I read this thing, that I \u2014 I was going over with the MOS,\nthe specialty as a \u2014 as a prisoner of war interrogator, I went down to what we called\nKorean man \u2014 what was called Korean management, we called it Korean\nmanglement, and was talking to some old colonel who\u2019d been there since world \u2014\nsince the Civil War, I think. Looked like it. And I said look, I have \u2014 you\u2019re\nsending me to Korea with a 93-16. I don\u2019t speak any of those languages. And he\nsaid, well, we didn\u2019t asked for no languages, they just said they wanted 93-16s.\nJune 8, 1999\nAnd I said, yes, sir. I knew there was nothing \u2014 yeah \u2014 well, I talked to this major\nand he said, do you speak Korean? I said nope. He said, Japanese? The Koreans in\nthe \u2014 in the army at that time grew up under Japanese occupation, so most of them\nspoke \u2014 still spoke some Japanese, too. I said nope. He said, Chinese? I said, nope.\nHe says, you\u2019re another one. I said, you mean you have more? He said yes.\nThey\u2019ve been sending us 93-16s and we have \u2014 none of them speak Korean. Okay,\nthey said, but never mind, we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll have an assignment for you. And I was\nassigned to eighth \u2014 eighth army headquarters and research and \u2014 and \u2014 yeah, and\nresearch, intelligence research. And later on, couple of months later I was\nreassigned as chief of the order of battle, a division of \u2014 of eighth army\nheadquarters. But the experience there was again, this now is December, end of\nDecember 1951. Cold, ice cold, bad weather and all that, and the chief of\nintelligence, Colonel Bump(ph) when I reported in, I and two other reported in at\nthe same time, said well, ve got an assignment for you, I want you to go up to the\nsecond infantry division up in the hills and observe the air support for our infantry,\nand Ill call you back when the time comes. So we sat up there for about three\nweeks in the foxholes, on top of these ridges, watching air support, getting shot at.\nWe didn\u2019t do any shooting then, infantry did. Watching the patrols go out and all\nthat. Anyhow, we got back three weeks later and came in and I was this \u2014 the\nJune 8, 1999\nsenior of the three of us and so I\u2014 I reported. We came in and we saluted and said,\nColonel, we have a report for you on the \u2014 on the air support. We had put our notes\ntogether and whipped up a report. He said, oh, I don\u2019t want your report, I know all\nabout what\u2019s going on up there. I just sent you up there because nobody works for\nme who doesn\u2019t get his feet wet. You know what the war is like, now you can start\nworking on it. Was a good idea. Not for \u2014 for \u2014 not while we were up there. Okay,\nso we \u2014 | \u2014 then I \u2014I started working and th \u2014 stayed there for \u2014 until January of\n1953, by which time I have had enough of the war and of the army and well, there\n\u2014 there happened to be a \u2014 a \u2014 there happened to be something that no \u2014 none of us\nknew. In the fall of 1952, all the reserve officers got a letter saying that your \u2014 th-\nthe \u2014 you were extended, your \u2014 your fi \u2014 your army still had a five year dur \u2014 as \u2014\nof reserve officers, five years at a time, you had to renew every five years. The\nother services had already changed to permanent. And so we did th \u2014 by executive\norder, ba \u2014 ba \u2014 the president, and when the Korean war broke out all reserve\nofficers were frozen, they had to stay in the \u2014 a-all commissions were extended.\nBut the law expired on the first of April 1953. So all of us who were in Korea in\n1952 had to be home and out of the army by \u2014 by the first of April, and the army\ndecided that they were going to get us out by January to give us a chance \u2014 to give\nus time to get back to the United States and get processed out. And so we got this\nJune 8, 1999\nletter saying we\u2019d like you to sign up for the permanent and you\u2019ll go on and all\nthat. And statistics later on came out that said 66 percent of all the reserve officers\nsaid thank you but no thank you, including myself. And then in December of 1952,\nI happened to be \u2014 I still had an R and R leave, five days in \u2014 in Tokyo, I flew over\nto Tokyo, and I ran into some old friends of mine and one of them said, wa \u2014 when\nyou \u2014 where you going? I said well, I\u2019m going home in January. By the end of\nJanuary I should be on the way home. And he said, what are you going to do? And\nI said I have no idea. I have no place to go, I have no \u2014 no \u2014 no connections\nanywhere. So I'll just go home and I'll \u2014 Il find something. Well, in the \u2014 he said,\nthe \u2014 oh, this \u2014 this friend said, well hey, ve got a job for you, a civilian job here\nin Tokyo. I\u2019m heading up a new office in \u2014 on the first of January. There\u2019s a new\ncommand being formed, the United Nations and far e \u2014 and Far East command, a\ncombined command and I\u2019m head of the intelligence policy division and I have one\ncivilian slot, a senior civilian and you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re it, 1f you want it. So I went down\nto personnel and they explained what it was, and they explained to me what it \u2014\nwhat it pays and it paid more than a captain. And all the perks with it and I said\nyeah, why not. And I signed up right there and they say yeah, you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re qu \u2014\nI told them \u2014 I had to write up what I was doing and for \u2014 fill out a form. And they\nsaid yeah, you qualify. And so there I was, and I stayed on in Tokyo as a civilian\nJune 8, 1999\nintelligence officer until 1955, when I returned home. That was also the time a little\nlater that same year, \u00b053, when I met this air force lieutenant, female, who showed\nup there and about a year and a half later we were married. And Barbara\nKinney(ph) became Barbara Stein. We were married in Tokyo.",
        "A: Well, first thing I told her was that where \u2014 where I had come from, and I told\nher that I lost my family and I still didn\u2019t know where they were or what happened\nto them, which is something previously that I had tried all the time. I tried the Red\nCross and the HIAS and the jayce \u2014 the JDC, the Jewish community in Vienna\nwho in 1946 did send me a \u2014 a little form letter saying your parents were deported\nthrough Litzmannstadt and did not appear on any survivor lists. That\u2019s all I had.\nBut where and what, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t find until much later. Well, anyhow, I \u2014 I told her\njust the basic things. I\u2014 I wa\u2014I-\u2014I couldn\u2019t go into details. Those were the things\nthat I talked about, oh, later on, bits and pieces, not \u2014 not the whole thing. I \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know what it was, but I just couldn\u2019t. Of course, there was still, and I think\nnow thinking back of tha \u2014 to that period, and I\u2019ve done this for some time now,\nthere was always that, why did they have to die and I \u2014 I survived? And that was \u2014\nJune 8, 1999\nthat was certainly in \u2014 in \u2014 in my subconscious mind, sometimes very much on my\nconscious. And it \u2014 th \u2014 it was \u2014 it was just difficult and unless I was asked, I didn\u2019t\ntell. It was that way. There were many people that I worked with that didn\u2019t even\nknow, that they thought oh, this guy\u2019s from New York. Fortunately I had no\nparticular accent, and so they knew I\u2019d come \u2014 I'd started in New York, and I was\na New Yorker, that \u2014 that was \u2014 that was all they knew. And over the years bits and\npieces \u2014 I told a little story here, when \u2014 when something happened that had a\nconnection with some, but not until \u2014 well, the 80\u2019s, when I finally sat down and\nwrote my whole story.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Oh, I followed them very closely. That was something that I \u2014 of course, there\nwere newspapers, the magazines. I had a couple of friends who were involved in\nthat, one was at the Nuremberg trials and we corresponded, and he would write to\nme. Another one, a lawyer in the Washington office of the \u2014 the judge advocates\noffice in the army, who was involved in the \u2014 in the trials o-o-on this side, getting\nJune 8, 1999\nthe reports in and all that in the \u2014 we talked about it all the time. I \u2014 I was looking\nfor \u2014 for the death penalty for anybody who just walked through Nuremberg. Not\nall of them got it, but then again, the \u2014 the trials went on for a number of years.\nWhen I was at military history in 1948, we had a British contingent, three British\nofficers. Two of them people like myself, Europeans. As a matter of fact, the \u2014 no,\none was German, one was Austrian. And one that their chief was a British colonel,\nbut they were all British army, and they were working with us, because they were\ngoing through the same documents and the same background. We \u2014 we also\nsearched documents that \u2014 captured documents that we had here \u2014 in connection\nwith that. And we were looking at the same documents and they were working on\nbackground for the trials that were still going on, and so we had close contact and\nwe followed that all \u2014 followed that all the way. There were not enough that were\npunished.",
        "A: Every word of it, absolutely, yes. As a matter of fact, I was \u2014 I was watching the\n\u2014I was listening to the \u2014 that \u2014 the final votes, I was counting votes at the time, on\nradio. I didn\u2019t have a television. No, no, I guess not, didn\u2019t have a television then. I\n\u2014 I was \u2014 I was listening and on the radio and I was \u2014 kept keeping a \u2014 a pad. And\nwhen the final vote was tallied \u2014 again, this of course now is 1950 \u2014 1947. I was\nJune 8, 1999\nthinking of still again going to Palestine. But there were many things that \u2014 that\nheld me back, you know, personal things that were happening and I \u2014 it was\nalways, you know, next week, Ill think about it next week or I'll \u2014 Pll look into it\nnext week. By that time I had taken up \u2014 I had contact with my cousin ha \u2014 at \u2014 and\nmeanwhile his mother and father, who had gotten away out of Vienna to England,\nhis father was \u2014 came out of Dachau, they released him. Mother had gotten a\npermit to go to England, and so they went to England, some went to Palestine.\nAnd I had seen them in England when I was in England. They had gone to\nPalestine so a \u2014 a\u2014 we had correspondence then, and I thought that I might join\nthem, but I didn\u2019t until many years later when I did go over and I\u2019ve been there\nquite a few times now.",
        "A: The Korean war? I theti \u2014 I thought it was a waste and I think many of us\nthought that. It was \u2014 it was just everything went wrong. We \u2014 we were fighting \u2014\nwe \u2014 we were fighting a war, but we weren\u2019t. I see the same thing going on right\ntoday in \u2014 1n Kosovo, where we \u2014 we\u2019re talking about fighting a war, we\u2019re\nfighting something. We\u2019re not going in and cleaning it up, and that\u2019s what\nhappened. The troops were ready, we were ready, but the command, the \u2014 the\nJune 8, 1999\npolitics weren\u2019t \u2014 weren \u2014 the pol-politicians weren\u2019t. It was a politician fought\nwar. And that is probably why two-thirds of us, of the officers quit. That was not\nthe ti \u2014 particularly those of us, and probably most of us at that time still \u2014 that had\nfought the \u2014 the war in \u2014 in Europe or in \u2014 in the Pacific for that matter, where you\nfought a war to \u2014 to win. There we didn't fight to win, we fought to \u2014 to sit around\nand let somebody do the talking. And so now I \u2014 I-I did not think kindly of what\nwas happening there.",
        "A: The Cold War, of course that was somehow predictable, that having met the\nRussians, we knew we weren\u2019t going to be friends, although we were friendly and\nthe vodka flowed freely, but that was not it, and then of course when the Russians\ndug in and said \u2014 and dictated to us practically what \u2014 what we \u2014 what we could do\nand what we couldn\u2019t do, that was pretty much the beginning of the Cold War, and\nChurchill saw it and \u2014 and it happened. But there were \u2014 there were many things\nthat \u2014 well, it was a political war, it was \u2014 and political wars don\u2019t lead to anything,\nnever have. And there should have been some accommodation someplace, but\nnobody would give, we didn't give, they didn\u2019t give. And I think the only thing that\n\u2014 that \u2014 that could have ended \u2014 the way it ended was \u2014 it was completely\nunexpected, I think. The only other way would have been a \u2014 a hot war.\nJune 8, 1999\nFortunately, it didn\u2019t happen, but it was a bad time in history, I think, that whole\nperiod of the Cold War, because it had an influence on \u2014 on everything, on \u2014 on the\nlives of all the people in the world, on the economy and \u2014 so that it was \u2014 it was a\nbad thing.",
        "A: The \u2014 the missiles. The missiles were ready on both sides, we could have fired,\nthey could have fired. Any mistake could have triggered an annihilation of \u2014 of half\nof the world, and that was a great fear, I think o-of myself and I\u2019m sure of most of\nthe people, that some nut would push the wrong button, even by accident, not \u2014 it\ncould have happened. That it didn\u2019t happen, was a miracle.\nthan that you met your wife and got married?",
        "A: In Tokyo? Well, I had gotten out of the army, I was a civilian in a culture that\nwas strange to me, and so I \u2014 I soaked it all up. I took it in and it was an interesting\nexperience. And after about two and a half years there, I decided it was enough.\nWell, we both decided that was enough and let\u2019s get out of here. But it was \u2014 it was\ninteresting. There was nothing that stands out, just learning and looking at the ways\nof \u2014 of the mysterious east. Korea was a loss, there was no \u2014 no \u2014 nothing there to\nlook at, there was total devastation and \u2014 but Tokyo and traveling around Japan\nJune 8, 1999\nwas interesting, see how people lived, how \u2014 how they \u2014 how they managed, really,\nwith their \u2014 their culture, the way of \u2014 of life, the way of living in \u2014 in\n[indecipherable] paper houses, and it was interesting, but nothing outstanding.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Yes, they knew I was Jewish. I had no problems with that. We had a \u2014\nactually the only Jewish services we had in \u2014 in \u2014 in Tokyo were the holidays. And\nin the chapel center, we\u2019d go there and they brought in a rabbi from someplace, not\nsure where he came from. And I went to services, and I took time off and my\noffice, all the people I worked with knew where I was. So, no, there was no\nproblems there.",
        "A: Left Tokyo and came to Washington after cruising around the United States\nfor about oh, a good two or three months. We landed in Seattle where Barbara has\nan aunt and cousins and we stopped there for a few days. Then went to San\nFrancisco where she has another aunt, we visited there and I got introduced to the\nfamily. And then we went to Iowa, to Webster City, Iowa, a great metropolis of\nabout 8,000 people and I met the parents. Parents knew who I was, I had written to\nthem. As a matter of fact, just very recently I went through some papers that when\n\u2014 her mother died some years ago, but we had never looked through that file of\nJune 8, 1999\npapers that \u2014 that we had taken from her, and I looked through some paper and\nthere was the letter I wrote to them when I first met Barbara \u2014 or wh-when we\ndecided to get married, and I wrote to them and told them who I was, and got to \u2014\nto Webster City and well, had parties and met \u2014 met the whole town. And stayed\nthere for awhile and then went to Washington. In Washington I was then for the\nfirst and only time \u2014 no, I ca \u2014 I \u2014 was not the first and only time, my first job in \u2014\nin New York was, course, I had to look for a job. But coming to Washington was\nthe first time that I really had to \u2014 really had to look for a job. There was no \u2014 no\nHIAS to \u2014 to help me out. And I had a \u2014 well, in \u2014 while I was in \u2014 in Tokyo, in \u2014\nin \u2014 in my capacity as \u2014 in my job, I had very close contacts with the CIA people\nout there. And so before I left the chief of the CIA group asked \u2014 said, why don\u2019t\nyou \u2014 when you get home, why don\u2019t you just stop in and talk to the people in\nLangley and come with us? And I said, well, that\u2019s nice and he gave me a letter of\nrecommendation. And so I did and they offered me something that was not for me,\nthey \u2014 they offered me a job in \u2014 in \u2014 a\u2014a temporary job in Germany and I wasn\u2019t\nready to go out \u2014 out again, I wanted to stay awhile. And so I didn\u2019t take that. And\nthen again, by continuous luck, ran into a friend who said, well oh, I know of a new\noutfit that they\u2019re forming at the \u2014 in the Pentagon and I\u2019ve applied for it. He was\nworking somewhere in the Pentagon. He said, to transfer into it and they\u2019ve got\nJune 8, 1999\nslots open, why don\u2019t you try that? And I tried it and I got the job, became his boss.\nJohn has never forgiven me that, but we\u2019re still friends. And there I\u2014I got the job\nwith Air Force Intelligence and worked with them for oh, several years. Got several\npromotions, I was doing well. Then our organization was taken over into the\nDefense Intelligence Agency when that was formed, and that took in units from all\nthe military agencies. Stayed with them from \u201962, I was involved in \u2014 in the\ncreation of the new organization, was on that committee, and stayed with them\nuntil \u00b065 when once again I was invited by the State Department to transfer to the\nState Department. It happened during a \u2014 a meeting. I was presenting a project that\nwe had \u2014 a worldwide project of intelligence handling that we had, I was involved\nwith through an inter \u2014 through an interagency committee. The State Department\nrepresentative said, would you be interested in coming to our \u2014 we have nothing\nlike that. And I said, well, make me an offer I can\u2019t resist. And he said the \u2014 about\ntwo weeks later, he made me that offer. And I transferred to the State Department\nin the foreign service and became a foreign service officer, coming in on top,\nwhich, much to the \u2014 1n the foreign service that \u2014 yo-you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re not liked if\nyou come in on top because everybody else came in on the bottom. So I had in-\ninteresting experience.\n38June 8, 1999\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nJune 8, 1999\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yeah. In \u2014 I \u2014 I mentioned that this was a new project that my friend told me\nabout in the Air Force Intelligence. What happened was the air force was the, in\n1955 was getting into the \u2014 the technological age of information processing. They\nwere the leaders in the thing. They had come up with a project that was worked up\nwith IBM and Eastman-Kodak, a combined project of information processing\nwhere the information, that is documents, would be photographed on microfilm,\nand at the same time, there would be an encoding placed on the microfilm and the\ncoding was then read electronically from the film, and would \u2014 and when you \u2014\nwhen you got the right \u2014 right thing, looking for a specific document that contained\na subject matter, th-the subject matter was coded. And that was on there, and that\nwould \u2014 that then would print out the document that pertained to whatever you\nwere looking for. That was a \u2014 a new way of doing it, you didn\u2019t have to have any\nJune 8, 1999\n\u2014 any input, typewriter input that you had until that time. We had to type punch\ncards and whatever, or type it into the computer and then it would come \u2014 you \u2014 th\n\u2014 this way you could just photograph it. Well, it was a novel thing, and that is what\nthey \u2014 they were hiring people to do that. My job, I became a \u2014 I was hired as the\nchief of the coding section, and I worked with the tech \u2014 technical part, the \u2014 the\ncontractors on what they were doing and to make sure that we\u2019re do \u2014 and we\ndeveloped \u2014 and again, we did this with the CIA, a\u2014 a code \u2014 a code dictionary,\nsort of. An intelligence code, that for everything that was of interest to intelligence,\nwould have a code number. And then we would have \u2014 this was my section then,\nreaders read the documents that were coming in, intelligence documents, reports\nfrom all over the world, and numerically code what was in that document. That\ndocument would then be photographed with the code input also onto the film, and\nit was available for \u2014 for retrieval. We had gotten that thing, it took a number of\nyears to \u2014 to do this, we worked from \u201955 to about \u2014 by \u201958 or 59 we had the first\ninstallation, and it worked. We then expanded that to the rest of the air force, and I\nwent out to help the installation of the thing at \u2014- in Omaha at the Strategic Air\nCommand. And in Ohio at the Air Force Research and Development command and\nseveral other places, and we started sending out copies of what we had made the\nfilm into those. And those were little chips, photo chips that ran through just \u2014\nJune 8, 1999\nsimilar to \u2014 to punch cards running through when you\u2019re searching, but these were\nphoto chips and when you got a hit it would extract it and make a full copy of it. Or\nyou could view it on a\u2014 on a microfilm viewer. That was the main project. Now, it\n\u2014 we got into \u2014 more into different arrangements. That unit then was taken over\nwith a lot of the other air force intelligence into the Defense Intelligence Agency\nwhen that was established. And I was still in charge of that, but I was working on\nnew developments, now we were into computer information, handling a computer.\nIt was all intelligence handling. I was not, at that point any more directly involved\nwith the intelligence, but with the technical operation. And it was that, and DIA\njust a follow on to the same thing. And it was that thing that State Department got\ninterested in. And when I got into State Department, again, they formed a separate\nunit to start an information processing operation in the State Department, they\ndidn\u2019t have any. As I found out later, they didn\u2019t want any. The foreign service\noffices, they didn\u2019t want to have information. He wanted to have what he had, his\npieces of paper and he\u2019d make up his own mind, they didn\u2019t want anybody else to \u2014\nto shove stuff at him that he didn\u2019t see \u2014 had seen \u2014 hadn\u2019t seen before, to change\nhis mind possibly. Anyhow, that was an \u2014 that\u2019s an interpretation. But I got to the\nState Department and we started, there were about four or five of us that had been \u2014\nsome from the State Department and a couple of people from CIA, myself from the\nJune 8, 1999\nIAA, and one from USIA, and there was one other \u2014 a couple from the State\nDepartment, and we all sat and we started looking at what is it that the foreign\nservice \u2014 tha-that the State Department needs in the \u2014 getting information. Where\ndo they get their information from and how could we put this into a system? In\nother words, we were systems development. And we then got money through a \u2014\nprobably my most grueling and demeaning experience in my life. I had to testify\nbefore Congress, before a congressional committee. It \u2014 the man, my immediate\nsuperior in that particular thing, was lost. He and I were sitting there, I was in the\nleft hand seat. The left hand seat 1s the \u2014 when you\u2019re facing the committee is the \u2014\nthe secondary. I was the one with the information, he was the one that answered the\nquestions. And a certain congressman from Brooklyn destroyed my buddy. The\nman was so confused he didn\u2019t know what to say and the chairman of the\ncommittee excused him and said at this point you\u2019re not answering any more\nquestions, but your sidekick answers the questions, so let him answer it and you\u2019re\nexcused, and he wal \u2014 had to leave the \u2014 the committee room. I sat there for the rest\nof it and I got through it and I got the money. So \u2014 however, was an interesting\nthing. I was noticing that the chairman\u2019s assistants, the \u2014 not a congressman, one of\n\u2014 his \u2014 his office manager, wi \u2014 whoever he was, had an interesting head\nmovement. And being a good observer, I had noticed that when they asked first\nJune 8, 1999\nquestions and I was watching that, and I noticed that when he expected a positive\nanswer to something, his head would go this way. And when the congressman\nasked a trick question, the guy went this way. So my eye was on him, and I got\nthrough the thing, it worked. I was right, that that was the way, that he knew \u2014\nthese people know the answers. When they ask a question they know the answer.\nAnd so \u2014 they want confirmation of their knowledge, and well anyhow, it \u2014 that \u2014\nthat was \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was a sad thing. I came out and poor guy outside, I asked him\nto go home. He wanted to go back to the office, I said, you should go home. [Il call\nyou later, I'll tell you what happened. He said, but di-di \u2014 do you know what \u2014 I\nsaid, yeah, we got the money, we\u2019re all \u2014 you\u2019re all right, go home. He went home\nand I called him later on and he had calmed down, and he said, he-hell, I \u2014 I can\u2019t\neven remember what happened. And very shortly after that he left the State\nDepartment, you know, fortunately there was some higher up sitting in the back\nlistening to this thing and they weren\u2019t happy with him, so anyhow. Well, we got\nthe money and we had the department hire contractors, some of these big\ninformation processing firms. They came in and they started working on a program.\nThe program was, oh about half way through, and we got more money, because we\nshowed that it was good. This time we didn\u2019t have to testify any more, 1t was done\nin the higher-ups. And they \u2014 let\u2019s see, after about \u2014 it was about two and a half\nJune 8, 1999\nyears into the \u2014 into the program, that there was an internal thing. Again, there\u2019s a\npolitical thing. The assistant Secretary of State I worked for and another assistant\nSecretary of State, who wanted that unit, the other one, th-the \u2014 the enemy there,\nthe other one was the assistant secretary for administration, who had the computer\noperation of the State Department, the payroll, in other words. Payroll and\npersonnel and whatever, but never anything subst \u2014 substance \u2014 substantive 1n-\ninformation, they\u2019d never handle it. But they saw something that hadn\u2019t \u2014 that got\nmoney and all kinds of possible \u2014 and they wanted it. Well, it was a time when my\nassistant secretary wanted another job. He wanted to be a \u2014 what do they call that?\nA diplomat in residence at the university. We had \u2014 the university, they have a\ndiplomat in residence, that a \u2014 that\u2019s a cream puff, absolutely. And usually that led\nto an ambassadorship. People who were s \u2014 who were selected for that. Well, he\nwas pretty close to that, he wanted an ambassadorship eventually, and he want \u2014\nbut there was a job that he could have had, but they kept him because he had things\ngoing on in his o-operation that were not finished, they wouldn\u2019t let him go. So he\nchanged. He sold us a \u2014 he sold my \u2014 my organization to administration. And I\nsaid, I\u2019m not available for that. You can transfer it, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m out. I\u2014 I wouldn\u2019t\nwork for those people, I \u2014 well, I knew them, I had worked with them before. Well,\nhe was friendly enough to say \u2014 he was Jewish, by the way, the only other Jew in\nJune 8, 1999\nthe area. And he said, I didn\u2019t think you would, but I\u2019ve got another job for you, if\nyou want it. We have a new inspector general and I\u2019ve told him about how you go\nabout doing your investigations and how you can do these things and \u2014 and he\u2019s\ninterested in you, because you\u2019ve reviewed, you know what this whole department\nis doing, you\u2019ve done a survey to \u2014 to find out what they need, and he wants to talk\nto you. And he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s brand new, he just came an \u2014 an ambassador who just came\nback and got the job as Inspector General. So I made an appointment, went to see\nhim and he said, yeah, I want you. And I became a senior foreign service inspector.\nNow again, I shifted jobs without try \u2014 even trying, you know, I \u2014 I\u2014 I was asked\nto. And when I got into the Inspector General\u2019s office, that I hadn\u2019t used before,\ncause they were not in the substantive area, I found that I was in \u2014 in very good\ncompany, because most of the senior inspectors were former ambassadors for\nwhom there was no other assignment, there was a limited assignment. And so they\nbecame inspectors and they traveled around from one embassy to the other, to\nmake sure that everything was all right, and they were doing, you know, reviewing\nthe embassies, mainly. The idea I came up with, that sold m \u2014 sold me to \u2014 to the\ninspection corps was that there ma \u2014 are many things that are overlapping that are\nnot being looked at in Washington, th-the various bureaus, each one working as an\nindependent thing, each one working with all the embassies that their \u2014 you know,\nJune 8, 1999\nthe European bureaus, working with all the European embassies, but there\u2019s no \u2014\nno connection between them. They\u2019re doing all kind \u2014 I said, I would like to look\ninto that. He said that\u2019s a great idea, you got it. So I started out on that and I\nbecame \u2014 I was doing \u2014 what\u2019d we call that? Well, the organizational reviews. And\nI did some of those. As I went on, I did all the \u2014 the bureaus, and particularly those\nthat covered in substance more than an embassy. The scientific bureau \u2014 scientific\nand \u2014 and technical bureau, for example, had these technical attach\u00e9s out there that\nweren\u2019t talking to each other. So, there \u2014 it was a question of \u2014 of getting\ninformation to them and \u2014 I mean, getting information between them and not just\nreporting back to the bureau and the thing gets lost in the bureau. And the consular\noffices, for \u2014 of course, there are consulates in every country and more than there\nare embassies, and they\u2019re not talking to each other. They\u2019re reporting 1n, it\u2019s all a\none way flow, nothing goes out \u2014 oh, excuse me \u2014 to \u2014 to all the others. And so I\nstarted working on that and I usually got a couple of other officers assigned to me,\nsome of the junior officers that were also working with the inspectors and we sat\ndown and we ju \u2014 started interviewing and looking into the records and all that, we\nfind out how things were and sort of rewrote the \u2014 the \u2014 the job descriptions. The \u2014\nthe job [indecipherable]. I had one particular one that was of great interest to me,\nhaving been a refugee once, and that was, I came across, while I was looking at\nJune 8, 1999\nthese various organizations in the department of a special assistant to the Secretary\nof State for Refugee Affairs. When I looked into that I found that the man was a\npolitical appointee. He\u2019d made big contributions to somebody and he had a few\npeople in Washington, but his work was being done in Geneva at the U.S. mission\nto the United Nations. In the process I also found that there was a special assistant\nto the Secretary of State for international Red Cross affairs. Now here we have the\ninternational Red Cross, a British a \u2014 a Swiss organization, and they have a one\nman office with one secretary who\u2019s a special assistant and who handles contacts\nwith that. But the international Red Cross is in Geneva and who handles the \u2014 the\nbr \u2014 the work? The office in Geneva. And this 1s a large office in the united na \u2014 in\nthe mission to the United Nations. The U.S. mission. And I found a third one, a-a-\nanother special assistant for a humanitar \u2014 for \u2014 not for humanitarian, for disaster\nrelief affairs. Again, all of them political appointees. Well, I went \u2014 so I went to\nGeneva and talked to the people there and looked and see what they were doing\nand they were hardworking people. They were doing the budgeting for \u2014 for these\nvarious operations. They were representing the U.S. before the United Nations and\nbefore all the various organizations that physically handled refugees and disasters\nand so forth. And I came back and I wrote a \u2014 oh, about a 200 page report. This\nwas about a six months affair. I wrote a rit \u2014 I wrote a report and I said, reorganize\nJune 8, 1999\nthe whole thing and my s \u2014 my recommendation was that \u2014 to get another position\nas an assistant Secretary of Affairs for Humanitarian affairs, all this comes under\nthat subject heading and abolish these special assistants. Have Geneva do the work\nand have Washington have a \u2014 a regular office doing whatever is necessary in the\nUnited States, such as you know, budget \u2014 getting \u2014 getting money and so forth.\nAnd that was finished in 1990 \u2014 in January of 19 four \u2014 four \u2014 1974, I finished that\nparticular report. And then I went on and was doing \u2014 I think the next one was\nconsular affairs and I was just about finished with consular affairs when one day I\nget a phone call from the refugee office. The deputy to this political appointee was\na regular foreign service officer whom I knew, I had contact with. And he calls me\nand he said, I have a problem. We\u2019ve seen your report and I think it\u2019s great. They\nthought they were getting to be the assistant secretary job. They were \u2014 they were\nthe biggest one, of course. Anyhow, we tha \u2014 we thought we \u2014 we have a \u2014 we have\na problem, our man in Geneva, our \u2014 the head of the office just informed us that he\nis retiring in August. This is about the fifth \u2014 I think it was the day after the Fourth\nof July weekend, I\u2019d just come back. And he said, you\u2019re the only one who knows\nwhat\u2019s going on out there. How would you like to go to Geneva? And my answer\nto that, and I remember that to this day and will always remember it, was don\u2019t\nbother me with details, send five tickets. We had a meeting after that, he explained\nJune 8, 1999\nto me what this problem was and I said yes, Ill \u2014 PIl\u2014I\u2019ll accept and Ill go. And\nsix weeks later we were in Geneva and I was running that office. And I\u2019d gotten, of\ncourse, I was at the time \u2014 this \u2014 the main job of that particular office really, was\nhandling the Russian refugees that were coming out by about 20 or 30,000 a year.\nThat was the beginning of the \u2014 the major exodus from Russia. What they were\ndoing, and I was doing for the next four years was dealing with the voluntary\nagencies, HIAS, Tolstoy Foundation, the International Catholic Migration\nCommission, the World Council of Churches and many others. The \u2014 the Polish\nAmerican refugee, or Czech American. All of those, all over Europe. They \u2014 tho \u2014\nthey were physically receiving these refugees, most of them, of course, Jews. All of\nthem, probably. And were trying to resettle them in Israel, in the U.S., in\nAustralia, wherever. And my job was to make sure that the U.S. money that went\nto these agencies for handling that, was properly used, that they were doing their\njob, and make sure that they were doing what they were supposed to do in the\nresettlement process. And I learned a lot about Russians during that period, and\nothers, but mainly the Russians. Went to one of my jobs and the family was in\nGeneva, the kids were in international schools, which was a good experience for\nthem, and my job was making \u2014 reviewing the budgets, reviewing their budget\nrequests and changing them where it was necessary. They were all inflated, of\nJune 8, 1999\ncourse, the usual thing. I was the first \u2014 first stop. And \u2014 and actually, physically\nlooking at them, periodically. So every month I would be in one or \u2014 or two, I\u2019d be\nin \u2014 in \u2014in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and I\u2019d be in \u2014 in\u2014 in Munich, where many of\nthem were. In Rome, which were the main parts and occasionally in Moscow and\nthen Bucharest, behind the Iron Curtain then, talking to our people. And Turkey is\n\u2014 it was another place. Italy. Several places in Italy where they \u2014 these people\nwere, and working with them to expedite the process. I had one critical, really\ncritical thing. That was, the Kurds in Iran, Iran would not let them out and it was\na long process and finally they wouldn\u2019t let any \u2014 finally they decide that yes, they\ncould leave and so we would \u2014 wanted to send in a plane and they wouldn\u2019t allow\nus. And the international Red Cross, I involved them in it, and the international Red\nCross was going to send in a plane and they wouldn\u2019t let them. And finally there\nwas a\u2014acharter from \u2014 Lufthansa had a charter service and the international Red\nCross managed to get one of their planes, and they gave in. Now, these people were\nto be brought out, the \u2014 they \u2014 ere \u2014 ira \u2014 ara \u2014 Iranians gave in and let them go.\nThe people \u2014 the \u2014 the law, there was a special law that Congress enacted to let\nthese people into the United States but it expired on a certain date, which was\nabout \u2014 we were one day away from that date when the thing \u2014 when the Iranians\ngave in and the Red Cross took the plane over, got the people up and got them to\nJune 8, 1999\nFrankfurt. I went to Frankfurt to work with our consulate to make sure that these\npeople get their visas. It was just \u2014 they had to get their passports stamped. That\nwas it. What ha \u2014 when they got to the United States was unimportant, but before\nthat date \u2014 oh, this was the day. I get to \u2014 to Frankfurt and they\u2019re processing it,\ndoing a good job, and they still got about a \u2014 about a hundred people at five o\u2019clock\nin the afternoon, the consul \u2014 the U.S. consul says well, we\u2019re gonna have to\ncontinue that tomorrow, we\u2019re going home. I said no, you\u2019re not. He said well,\nyeah, but you know, the day is over. I said, the law expires at midnight and as far as\nI\u2019m concerned it\u2019s midnight in Washington, not in Frankfurt. And it is five\no\u2019clock and it\u2019s noon, we got 12 hours to go, you\u2019ve got to finish these people. He\nsays no, I can\u2019t do that. I said, I want a line to the assistant secretary for consular\naffairs, whom I knew well. I had done a job for her before I left and we had good \u2014\ngood relationship. And he got \u2014 he says okay, so he got the line through. He\ncouldn\u2019t refuse me, so he got the line. And I talked to the lady and I said, I\u2019ve got a\nreluctant [indecipherable] I\u2019m \u2014 we\u2019re doing the Kurds, and she said yeah, yeah,\nhow you doing? I said we \u2014 there\u2019s still about a hundred left that have not, and \u2014\nbeen visa\u2019d and your man here wants to go home, he wants to close up. She said,\nlet me have him. I said \u2014 handed him the telephone and I notice his face getting\nlonger and longer and he hung up and he said okay, we\u2019ll work until it\u2019s finished.\nJune 8, 1999\nWell, by about 10 o\u2019clock that night we were finished. Everybody had their visa,\nstamped with today\u2019s date \u2014 with that day\u2019s date and the next day we got them on a\nplane and sent them to the U.S. But those are the kind of things that you \u2014 the\ntroubleshooting type things that \u2014 that you had to do every once in awhile. Had to\nintervene in Rome with the Russians. The Russians in \u2014 in \u2014 in Rome were treated\nvery nice, they had them out on the \u2014 on the li \u2014 li \u2014 just like they have in New\nYork, in Brighton Beach, they all live out there. In Rome they had them out on\nthe \u2014 on \u2014 near the Lido someplace \u2014 not Lido, whatever the beach 1s. Nicely\nquartered. Then you came into town to \u2014 and HIAS was handling most of the\nRussians in th\u2014 Rome. And they walked in and he said \u2014 and their \u2014 their \u2014 their\nquestions were, where is my money, where is my house, where is my servants,\nwhere is my wi \u2014 the Russian way. The Russians were used to asking for some \u2014\nthe government. The government gave them. They were still in that mode. And we\nhad some serious problems there, the people were intimidated by them. And I told\nthem, don\u2019t be intimidated, you\u2019ve got \u2014 they had Russian speakers there, and they\nwere \u2014 I \u2014I \u2014I told them how \u2014 how to talk to these people. Just yell at them. Tell\nthem to go away, they get nothing. One more word out of you and you\u2019re out, you\nget nothing, you go wherever you want to go. And it \u2014 it worked. It worked, you\nknow. Again, something they were used to. The KGB wasn\u2019t going to be \u2014 talk to\nJune 8, 1999\nthem friendly like, so we weren\u2019t either. They had something coming to them. We\ntold them that no, you don\u2019t have anything coming to you, we\u2019re giving it to you\nbecause we\u2019re good people. And in that particular case, and there were a lot of\nthem there, the word got to all of them, I was the United States government. I\nrepresent \u2014 see, those were just an organization. When I came, I was the United\nStates government. Well that \u2014 that made \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 that did it. When the\ngovernment says you gotta be quiet, you\u2019re quiet. So we\u2019re \u2014 you know, it was\ngame playing, but \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was acting. I did not go to Hollywood after that.\nThat\u2019s \u2014 you know, experiences like that, that was \u2014 that was my job. And of\ncourse I saw a lot of misery too, people coming out and having to sit in those\ncamps in some areas, they were not too pleasant. Some intellectuals, people with \u2014\nwho had status and \u2014 and now were begging, in effect. I felt for them, but on the\nother hand, I was there too, once, and I knew how they felt. So, you know, you\ntreated them accordingly. You talked to them, and particularly in some cases when\nI talked to them, I told them who I was, and I said, I was in your position once, and\nlook at me now. It\u2019s gonna happen to you, just take it easy. It\u2019Il be done. We\u2019re\ndoing it, but it takes time. And it helped a little, some cases, I \u2014 I hope it did.",
        "A: Oh yes. I followed that again, with a vengeance, and I read everything there\nwas, anything from the \u201cWashington Post\u201d to the \u201cJerusalem Post\u201d and anything\nI could lay my hands on, because it was of great interest. I had known of\nEichmann of course, like everybody else did. By that time I had read most of the\nthings that had been written about the Holocaust and about \u2014 about that. And I was\nhoping that it would lead to where it did. And when they executed him, I \u2014 I was\nhappy. It\u2019s the wrong way to be happy, but I was happy. Not, in that case, that was\nthe exception. Just like I did for the Nuremberg people.",
        "A: No, I was \u2014 well, put this way. In 1965 \u2014 no, \u201966, I\u2019d just gone to the State\nDepartment. No, no, no, fift \u2014 \u201965, I was still with the DIA. I received a letter from\nthe army, saying that the Secretary of Defense has declared your job an essential \u2014\na civilian essential position. Therefore, you can no longer remain in the active\nreserve. I was still a reserve officer. By that time I was a lieutenant colonel. And I \u2014\nJune 8, 1999\ni\u20141-\u2014 well, let me just quickly here, when I said I left Korea and we said no thank\nyou, we don\u2019t. When I got back to Washington I applied for commission again. I\ndecided I \u2014 I want to stay in, mainly because it \u2014 that pays, at the end. I had never\nknown until 1957, approximately \u201957 1s when I came back in, that reserve offices\nwho had active duty at age 60 would get money. And I said well, why not?\nSomebody talked me into it, really. Somebody told me about that, one of the people\nI wor \u2014 I worked with. They said, why don\u2019t you come back in, and I went down to\nFort Myer(ph) and said, can I come back in? And they said, of course. And I \u2014 I\ncame \u2014 I-I was reassigned on the non-pay unit. We met once every two weeks in\nthe Pentagon for a couple of hours, get a lecture from somebody or gave a lecture.\nAnd that was it, we got points, that\u2019s all. So anyhow, in 1965 I got this letter saying\nthat your \u2014 you\u2019re essential now and you can\u2019t be in the reserves any more, in the\nactive reserve, but you have over 20 years, and so you have a choice to go in the\ninactive reserve or into retired reserve. And Vietnam was just brewing and I said, I\ndon\u2019t want to get caught in another war. Even \u2014 even then I might \u2014 this \u2014 this thing\nad \u2014 ba \u2014 my civilian job might end, and I\u2019ve had two wars, two is enough. And\nVietnam didn\u2019t look like anything that I should get involved in. And I said \u2014 I\nwrote back and said no, put me in the \u2014 1n the retired reserve and I retired at that\npoint. And at age 60, the checks started coming, which are still accepted. But\nJune 8, 1999\nanyhow, now Vietnam I did not like what was going on. I couldn\u2019t see it. There\nwas \u2014 I didn\u2019t think we had any business there. And I had friends who were still in\nthe service who went over there and they came back and they told me what\nconditions they \u2014 that they had, under what conditions they were there, and it was\nnot what I \u2014 I felt that I was right, we shouldn\u2019t be there. And I had \u2014 I felt for all\nthe people that \u2014 that were against the war and all that, although you know, I was\nsort of a military something or other, nothing serious. But that wasn\u2019t it and many\nof the people I knew who were in the military and in the reserves and retired in the\nreserves all felt like I did, so I-I wasn\u2019t alone. And I \u2014 I \u2014 well, we were right, it\ncame out the wrong way at the end.",
        "A: You know, the Civil Rights moved me, I followed it very closely. I didn\u2019t do\nanything, I was not involved in anything, but it was on the right track, and I was\nJune 8, 1999\nvery much sympathetic to it, because I\u2019d been there and I thought that all the\nsegregation an-and thing were \u2014 was \u2014 it was awful. I had seen it, I\u2019d \u2014 in \u2014 in the\nmilitary, and I \u2014 I'd seen it in the south. Most of my early army posts were in the\nsouth and I saw how the blacks lived, or were forced to live, and they were forced\nto do whatever, were not allowed to \u2014 not really allowed to live. And so yes, I was,\nas I said, sympathetic and I watched it and was happy to see that it developed into\nfinally the \u2014 the schooling and the \u2014 the desegregation of the schools particularly to\nstart with and \u2014 and then the other things that followed.",
        "A: I was very much concerned and watching it very carefully, all the wars, the\nwhole history of Israel. It was \u2014 well, it \u2014 it was the homeland for all those who\ndidn\u2019t have a land and a place any more. And what was left of my family was there.\nMy cousin, his mother and father. And then a little later on, another cousin who had\nsurvived in Bucharest that I didn\u2019t know about then for \u2014 for some time, til after\nthe war, quite a bit after the war. She came to \u2014 to Israel. So I had direct\nconnection. I also had some friends who had gotten to Israel early in the \u2014 well,\nsome left actually with their families in the 30\u2019s, before the anschluss. And others\nJune 8, 1999\nhad gotten out in the tra \u2014 in the various transports or in the illegal migration. And\nso \u2014 and of course, they were my people. I watched those wars and I followed them\nvery carefully and was overjoyed with all the results, because each one of them was\na victory. I almost got involved directly in \u2014 well, I did get involved in a way, in\nthe Yom Kippur war in \u201973. I was at the synagogue in \u201973 on Yom Kippur, when\nthe thing \u2014 th-the news came. I remember it was in a Sunday, I believe. And I had\nairline tickets to Israel for Monday. On \u2014 as a job, I was supposed to \u2014 I was still\nan inspector then, and I was to inspect the immigration policies of Israel, again ka\n\u2014 that was still during the \u2014 the time when I was working on the \u2014 on the refugee\nand the humanitarian affairs study. And I was headed for Israel, I was headed for\nIsrael, Lebanon and Jordan. | had two passports in my pocket, one for Israel and\none for the other countries, because you couldn\u2019t have a stamp then, and th-that \u2014\nin the State Department we did all kinds of things, you know. Two diplomatic\npassports and I just hoped that I remembered which pocket I had which one in\nwhen I pulled it out. But I was to \u2014 to be 1n Israel on the \u2014 on the f \u2014 the following\n\u2014 well, I was leaving the following day, the day after Yom Kippur. And of course\nwhen I came home that night, I called the State Department. War had broken out\nand there was no way to go there. And I called the \u2014 the \u2014 the duty officers, and I\nasked them to get a telegram to our embassy in Tel Aviv that \u2014 and \u2014 and also to\nJune 8, 1999\nLebanon and Jordan that because the situation that I was not coming and I\u2019II let\nthem know when I\u2019m coming, it would be a little later. If I had left a couple days\nearlier, | would have been right in the middle of \u2014 of a six day war. But I \u2014 the Yom\nKippur war, I mean. But I \u2014 I was just saved by \u2014 by one day. I did get there again,\noh, about the following month. It was an interesting thing, I had to go to \u2014 to\nJordan and there was a \u2014 when I got to Israel I said, well, I\u2019m going to have to go\nback to Greece and then fly into Jordan. And they said no. Said the Allenby\nbridge, which is the famous bridge where the crossings occurred, the \u2014 the\nexchanges and all that. They said, we have a deal with \u2014 Israel really has a deal\nwith Jordan, war or no war. We can get you to the bridge, and on \u2014 it was a certain\nday, like Tuesday or Wednesday, but the \u2014 one of the officers from \u2014 from Amman\nis coming to Jerusalem across the bridge, and he \u2014 the embassy will take him in\ntheir car to the bridge. They will cross \u2014 he will have to walk across the bridge and\nwe have a car at the bridge to pick him up. So we\u2019ll just tell the embassy in \u2014 we\u2019ll\njust call Jordan, Amman, and we\u2019 ll tell them that you\u2019ll be crossing the bridge at\nthe same time, you\u2019ll be in the car that \u2014 pick him up and they co \u2014 they\u2019ll pick you\nup on the other side. You\u2019re just gonna have to carry a suitcase by yourself across. I\nsaid, well that\u2019s no problem. And so that\u2019s how we went a \u2014 went across that\nbridge. And it was interesting, I got a trip through all of the \u2014 the territories there,\nJune 8, 1999\nthe new territories. Well, they weren\u2019t new any more. But anyhow, got there, got to\nthe bridge, went across. Said hello to the guy who ca \u2014 came in from \u2014 from\nJordan. Went across and got in the car and got to the embassy in Jordan. And\nfrom there I could go to Lebanon and finished up my trip and then went home. So\nthat was an interesting experience. I didn't expected it to be that way, but I did get\nto use both of my passports.",
        "A: Okay, 1974, I was \u2014 I had finished the report on the refugees and so forth, and I\ngot a phone call in my office asking \u2014 telling me \u2014 from \u2014 from the refugee office\nthat the \u2014 their man in \u2014 in Geneva, who was really running the whole operation\nfor all these different groups, was retiring. He had just informed them that he was\nretiring and the man called me, said you\u2019re the only wa \u2014 you\u2019ve \u2014 you wrote the \u2014\nthe book. We like your report and would you \u2014 how would you like to go and take\nover in Geneva? And my answer to him was, please don\u2019t bother me with details,\nsend five tickets. And fi \u2014 six weeks later we were in Geneva. I took over that\noffice and we had oh, about 20 or 30 people working in there. There\u2019s a lot of\nbookkeeping \u2014 well, a lot of 1t was ha-handling the \u2014 well, okay, th - my \u2014 my\nduties were representation to the United Nations, to the appropriate offices of the\nJune 8, 1999\nUnited Nations, the high commissioner for refugees, the U.N. high commissioner\nfor disaster relief, the international Red Cross and all the other international\norganizations that had any dealings with \u2014 with refugees or dis \u2014 or any of the\nhuman \u2014 humanitarian affairs, including the human rights. I had one officer\nassigned to me who was specially doing human rights work. I concentrated on\ndirecting the United States refugee program, as it was called, and my job was to\nsee that the U.S. funds that were going into the program were being properly used\nby the people who were actually operating the program. And now those people\nwere voluntary agencies, as we called them. HIAS, International Catholic\nMigration Commission, World Council of Churches, Polish American, Czech\nAmerican refugee organizations, Tolstoy Foundation, in \u2014 in \u2014 International\nRescue Committee and others. They had places in various parts of Europe, where\nthey would receive the refugees, they would come m \u2014 and those \u2014 this is the\nperiod when we had the Russian refugees coming out. They were coming out\nbetween 20 and 30,000 a year in those years. They would house them, feed them\nand process them and help them get to their final destination. We tried to get them\nto Israel but not all of them went. Some \u2014 some went to Israel, others made it to\nthe United States and Australia was another major point. Others stayed in Europe\nor some in Germany, and various other places. But with all these people there was\nJune 8, 1999\nthe need \u2014 the \u2014 needed money, and the United States supported that. We also\nsupported Israel in the settling of the Russian refugees. We supplied money for the\nbuilding of housing and teaching them language, teaching and whatever was\nnecessary to ink \u2014 to get them into \u2014 into the main stream. So my job took me to \u2014\nto these \u2014 to various places where the \u2014 where the people were being actually\nprocessed. And I saw to it that our money was used properly, that 1t wasn\u2019t wasted\non administration or whatever it was. We had all the \u2014 all these organizations also\nhad their own funds, but you had to watch them, of course, you know, money \u2014\nmoney is available so you use it any way you \u2014 you feel like it until somebody\nlooks over your shoulder. Also, I had to look at their \u2014 their annual budgets when\nthey \u2014 their budgets would come to me, I would check it to see if it was justified\nand then pass it on to Washington to present to Congress. I made the first\ncorrections and then Washington cut some more, and whatever. These \u2014 these\nthings happened, of course, it\u2019s the usual with the budget process. But the \u2014 the best\npart of that was I traveled and I \u2014 I saw a lot of these people and my points of travel\nwere what \u2014 Paris, Rome, Vienna, all hardship points \u2014 ports. Munich was a very\nheavy place, lots \u2014 many of them came through Munich because many of the\norganizations had their headquarters in Munich for some reason or other. Some\ncame through Frankfurt. And occasionally I would go \u2014 Istanbul was another\nJune 8, 1999\none, and occasionally I would go to \u2014 to Bucharest and to Moscow, because \u2014 to\ntalk \u2014 to work with our own people, the embassy people, to find out what the\ngovernments are up to and how they are handling \u2014 because they were handling\nsome of the guarantees to the local government that they would be going to the\nUnited States and once they got out we tried to get them to \u2014 to Israel. But\nanyhow, most of that, 1t was \u2014 was a very interesting job. And having been a\nrefugee once, I \u2014 I could \u2014 I knew what these people were going through, and\nwherever we could help, I \u2014 I helped.",
        "A: Four years. I was there for exactly four years. My family was with me and the\nchildren went to an international school in \u2014 in Geneva. And it was \u2014 it \u2014 1t \u2014 it was\na dream assignment. I had planned on retiring, I wanted to stay another year, and so\nI asked \u2014 I put in a request for \u2014 to extend me for one more year. And they came \u2014\nWashington came back and said, as a matter of fact, we\u2019ve just cut this down to a\nthree year as \u2014 for your \u2014 your \u2014 the next. There are too many people who want to\ngo to Geneva, so from now on it\u2019s going to be a three year assignment, not a four\nyear assignment, and \u2014 and we can\u2019t extend you for the fifth year. I told them that I\nwould retire, one more year and I retire. So in 1974 in September s \u2014 in \u2014 well, we\ncame home in \u2014 around the first of August. 1974 I had some leave \u2014 \u201978, excuse\nJune 8, 1999\nme, \u201978. It\u2019s been a few years, but \u201974 is when I got there. Okay, we came home. I\nhad leave and when I got back to work, I was assigned a \u2014 well, I was told that I\nhad a choice of assignments, but my \u2014 my first as-assignment would have been\nwith the new office that I had originally pr \u2014 created in that \u2014 the inspection report\nthat I\u2019d written. The assistant secretary for humanitarian affairs, and I would have\nbeen a deputy in there. But I didn\u2019t \u2014 I rejected that because the other person who\nwas in the deputy \u2014 in the assistant secretary\u2019s job, we\u2019ve had some differences,\nmajor differences and I wouldn\u2019t work for that person. And so I said no. As it\nhappened, someone else had found out that I was on the way back and had said if\npossible, could I get assigned to that office, and that was the Office of Consular\nAffairs, which was the last report I did in \u2014 as a \u2014 an inspector, and \u2014 someone I\nhad dealt with also on refugee affairs and other things. And the \u2014 so I went to that\noffice, and they told me that they had \u2014 wha \u2014 wha -- what my plans were and I\nsaid, I plan to retire, I had decided I retire the end of the year. December, I\u2019m\nthrough. Got three months, that\u2019s it. And they say well, we just have a job for you,\nexactly for that. There is a presidential commission on the rewriting of the\nimmigration laws. And we have to send a State Department representative to that.\nIt is \u2014 it is a\u2014 in \u2014 physically located in the Justice Department. And how would\nyou like to represent us? And I said, do I know anything about the immigration\nJune 8, 1999\nlaws? They said, of course you do. I said, in that case PIl \u2014 I'll go. I took that\nassignment and I spent most of my next two and a half months over at the Justice\nDepartment with \u2014 oh, the Justice Department, the Immigration-Naturalization\nDepartment, we went over all the immigration rules and laws and all that to see\nwhat would happen, what should be done, and I put in the State Department and\nput \u2014 which I got from \u2014 from my people, I went back to state, but whenev \u2014\nwhatever questions came up, I checked with the department, see what their position\nwas and brought it up and we wrote that report, went in \u2014 it was supposed to be\nfinished and to Congress by the end of the year. We finished up and it was going\ninto the typewriter on about the middle of December, at which time I said goodbye\nand I left, I never read the report, I never saw it afterwards. I knew what was in\nthere, but it didn\u2019t go anywhere anyway. It was a \u2014 it was as a lot of these reports\ngo, Congress does whatever they want to do. I went back and went through the\nprocess, out-processing thing, and then the last day of December, the 30\" of\nDecember, last day was a Saturday, I think. So on that Friday I said goodbye to\neverybody and got a plaque for the wall and hung it on it \u2014 went home, hung it on\nthe wall and it\u2019s been catching dust ever since there. I retired. That was the end of\nmy \u2014 my government career.\nJune 8, 1999",
        "A: My children. I have three sons. Jeff was born in 1978, and well, having once\nbeen a medical student, I had an opportunity to read the book again and brush up,\nbecause a week before he was born, and he was about due, we had a snowstorm in\n\u2014 in \u2014 we lived in \u2014 over in the Alexandria area then. And our street, there was a\nsix foot snow drift at the end of the street, we were completely snowed in, there\nwas nothing that could go in or out, and we were waiting. And so I was reading the\nbook and said well, if it happens, I think I know what to do. I remembered as a\nyoung medical student, as first year medical students will do, sneak into other\nclasses, I went into one class once where there was \u2014 this was an obstetrics class\nand they were observing a birth. And so I saw that everything that was going on\nand I figured I can do that. Of course, I was scared to death, but Jeff was kind\nenough to wait for another week and by that time this \u2014 the road was cleared. Then\nfour years later Jim came along and David a couple of years after that. I had \u2014\nwhen we went to Switzerland, Jeff was going into his third year of high school,\nJim had just finished elementary school and David was going into the fifth grade.\nNo. Yes, yeah, fifth grade. Anyhow, so they went to \u2014 no, he was going into the\nthird grade, excuse me, he was going into the third grade, Jim was going into the \u2014\ninto th \u2014 Jim was going into the fifth grade. I c \u2014 yeah, gotta figure this out, yeah. I\nsaid it went backwards. And they went to an international school, which was very\nJune 8, 1999\nuseful, learned French. Had an interesting one with our youngest one David, who\nwas 10 years old when we got there. And after the \u2014 oh, about two-thirds down the\nfirst year, the French teacher called me at the office one day and said, you know, I\ncan\u2019t get anything out of David, he doesn\u2019t do his homework, he doesn\u2019t do\nanything, he won\u2019t say anything. I don\u2019t know what he knows. I said, well, let me\ntalk to him. I came home that day and we lived in an apartment building, it was a \u2014\na block, four buildings around a big park. Was a \u2014 a beautiful thing and the kids\nwere playing soccer down there and all that. And I came home and David was\nplaying down there, they\u2019re playing \u2014 they were playing soccer and I went down\ninto the park and I listened to \u2014 I was looking for David and I hear him talk. And\nthis kid is talking French to his buddies like a native. And so aft \u2014 I let him finish\nthe game and then they \u2014 when he came upstairs, I said, hey, your French teacher\nsays you\u2019re not doing any work in French. And he said, yeah, well you \u2014 th-they\nhave all this \u2014 this grammar and I don\u2019t know anything about that. I said, well, you\nhave to study it. And he said well, but I don\u2019t need it. I can talk French. I said yeah,\nI \u2014 I just noticed that. I didn\u2019t know you could I had not noticed that at all. So next\nday I called the teacher and I told her what he had \u2014 what I-I observed. I said,\nplease engage him in \u2014 in a conversation outside of the classroom and see \u2014 see\nwhat he comes up with. She called me that afternoon and she said, forget\nJune 8, 1999\neverything I said. He\u2019s ok \u2014I don\u2019t care whether he knows grammar or not. So that\nwas an interesting experience. The other two of course, also learned French and\nenjoyed \u2014 and first they were a little apprehensive when they got there, because\nthey were in a strange country and it \u2014 this was something new. When it was time\nto come home, they didn\u2019t want to leave. They were at home there and they had a \u2014\nwhenever I could \u2014 I told you that I had to travel quite a bit. Whenever I could\narrange my travels when the kids were out of school, I would take the family along.\nAnd so they got into a lot of places. We got there and I let them go sightseeing or\ntake a tour or whatever and I would be doing my \u2014 my job. And then we\u2019d come\nback and they had seen another place. We d \u2014 we traveled a lot, they traveled a lot\nand of course, what they \u2014 what got them about skiing, maybe I \u2014 did I mention\nthat before when I \u2014 when I came home the day when I got the assignment in\nSwitzerland, I \u2014I called my wife and told her, Barbara this \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re going\nto Switzerland, she said, great. And I said, don\u2019t tell the kids, we\u2019ll tell them\ntonight. So at dinner we\u2019re sitting around the table and I casually sort of mentioned,\nlisten, how would you like \u2014 how would you guys like it if we got assigned to go to\nSwitzerland? And Jeff, of course who was a \u2014 all \u2014 all the kids were skiers. I was a\nskier so I \u2014 I taught them early. And I said \u2014 Jeff said oh yeah, yeah, skiing,\nSwitzerland, yeah, that\u2019s it, let\u2019s go. And the other two chimed in, yeah, let\u2019s go.\nJune 8, 1999\nSo, it was no problem. But then when they got there, of course, they were a little\napprehensive. We \u2014 when we got back they \u2014 they went back to school. Jeff \u2014 oh\nJeff, we bro \u2014 took Jeff back in \u201956. He graduated in 1956 \u2014 \u201976, yeah, 1976.",
        "A: \u201958. He graduated from high school in \u201976 and we \u2014 we had \u2014 we were on home\nleave, we had two months home leave, so we came back and we traveled all over\nthe United States for a couple of months, and then dropped him off at the\nUniversity of Virginia in Charlottesville, where he had been accepted earlier, and\nwe went back to Switzerland and he then sort of became a jetsetter. About every\nthree months he was in \u2014 in Switzerland. And the way UVA works, we dropped\nhim off en \u2014 end of August when school started. In early December school was out\nand until about the latter part of January, and he was back in Switzerland, he was\noff skiing someplace with his friends and girlfriends and whatever. And in January\nwent back. In early May school was out and he was back for the summer. So that\nwas for a couple of years and he \u2014 he was very unhappy that we came back. He\nliked that.",

        "A: For many years I wasn\u2019t talking about anything about me, except when they\nasked a question, I would answer it. Did you \u2014 did you go to school? Yes, I did.\nAnd that was about it, or a little more. But is not until about the middle 80\u2019s is\nJune 8, 1999\nwhen I \u2014 one day it sort of dawned on me \u2014 that wa \u2014 it came from some questions\nthat I \u2014 a discussion we had with \u2014 with the kids, that they really didn\u2019t know me.\nThey knew bits and pieces of \u2014 they knew who I was. They knew where I came\nfrom, they knew what I\u2019d gone through, a little bit. But just bits and pieces, and I\ndecided that I needed to write this thing down. I was not consciously ever holding it\nback, it was just not \u2014 I just \u2014 somehow I couldn\u2019t. It was \u2014 I don\u2019t know what \u2014\nwhat it was, but I won\u2019t speculate on that. So when the time \u2014 at that time there was\nan immediate action. I went out and I bought myself a word processor and I hooked\nit up and I sat down and I started writing. And I started writing every day from then\non until I had it all on paper. And so I\u2014 I wrote my \u2014 my whole history up to that\npoint. There isn\u2019t much after that anyway, they know me since then. And I made\ncopies and they all have a copy of it. And then when I did the Shoah tape with you,\ns-soon as I got that in the mail, I immediately went down to the copy place and had\nthem copy me \u2014 make me three copies and th-they all have copies of that. And\nsince then, they have \u2014 they have asked a lot of questions. More detailed. That has\ngotten them to \u2014 on the track to ask questions.\nJune 8, 1999",
        "A: Well, it interrupted my dream of becoming a doctor. That of course, was dead.\nAnd there\u2019s still a little nostalgia in my mind every time I think about it, I said, I\u2014I\nshouldn\u2019t have gone for the money, I should have gone back to Switzerland, I\nshould \u2014 well, should have, would have, could have, it didn\u2019t happen, of course.\nBut it is \u2014 other than that, of course there is \u2014 there was the \u2014 the pain. The\nknowledge that I survived and my family didn\u2019t, has always been with me, it\u2019s\nnever left me in \u2014 not in \u2014 in Korea and not in Tokyo and not of course in \u2014 in \u2014 in\nEurope. I\u2019ve been looking for the answer, and of course there is no answer. But\nalso I\u2019ve been \u2014 I\u2019ve spent an awful lot of my waking life looking for my parents.\nThere was a big gap there. My parents and \u2014 and the rest of the family, but my \u2014\nmy mother and my father, of course. And of course that\u2019s \u2014 didn\u2019t come until about\nthree years ago, when I was doing a \u2014 a study on \u2014 on \u2014 1n the museum \u2014 in the\nHolocaust museum, and I was talking to the then head of archives, in a casual\nconversation, and you know, mentioning that I had \u2014 who I was and that family\nwas \u2014 was taken to \u2014 deported to \u2014 from Vienna to \u2014 to L\u00e9dz and that\u2019s when I lost\nthe trail. And he s \u2014 he told \u2014 told me that, he said, we have just gotten these five\nvolumes of \u2014 a register of all the people that were in the ghetto, have you seen it? I\nsaid no, didn\u2019t know anything about it and we interrupted the \u2014 my interview with\nhim and I went to look at it and I opened it, I asked for the \u2014 there \u2014 1t was\nJune 8, 1999\nalphabetical thing. Apparently the Germans had registered all this. Had it in\nalphabetical order and it was found after the war, the Polish government had it, and\nfinally got to Yad Vashem and \u2014 and \u2014 and to the museum. And I opened it to the\nS\u2019s and went to Stein and there was my mother and my father and the rest of the\nfamily. And I found a \u2014 there was a date when they ar \u2014 who they were, their\nprofession, their date of birth, when they arrived in the \u2014 in the ghetto, and when\nthey left the ghetto. Now, the leaving of the ghetto for most of them was later dates,\nand to my knowledge that was before the \u2014 that was after the Chelmno death camp\nhad been closed, that was the ausch \u2014 they were mostly to Auschwitz then, or other\nconcentration camps. But my parents and some others, I noticed the \u2014 the final depr\n\u2014 disposition there is a \u2014 it said TR7. I remembered from my readings that there\nwere certain time periods when there were transports to \u2014 to Chelmno. And so\nright after that I went to looking into some of the other books that I had read that\nhad this thing and then I remembered the first one was Gilbert and I read in there,\nthere were seven transports from the 21\u2018 to the 28\" of February, 1942 to Chelmno,\ntransport seven was on the 20\" of February. That was closure to me. I knew on the\n27\" of \u2014 27 \u2014 28\", excuse me, 28\" of February, they had died at Chelmno.\nJune 8, 1999\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Well, I found \u2014 well, my parents, as I said, died at Chelmno. Uncles, aunts,\ncousins were there until about August and were shipped to Auschwitz. I think\npretty much all of the Austrian contingent was gone by that time. I \u2014 I \u2014 there\u2019s a\ncertain amount o-of peace that \u2014 peace that it gave me when I found out,\nparticularly about my parents, because I had been searching, what, for almost 60\nyears, and with no results for fift - 50 some odd years. And 1-1t \u2014 it was a relief. It\nwas \u2014 it was definitely a relief to me to \u2014 to find out finally. And I think it \u2014 the\nrelief really came when I sat down a-and wrote letters to all \u2014 what relatives I still\nhave, a couple of cousins and \u2014 and some other more distant relatives, ti\u2014 and told\nthem about it. I now had something to tell, and that ended it. So that was about the\nend of \u2014 of that. I don\u2019t think I \u2014 I can add anything to this.",
        "A: Well, with the \u2014 mainly with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. I\u2019ve been\nthere for over six years now, since before it opened. I started on \u2014 to work on\nJune 8, 1999\nopening day in a hospitality suite at the \u2014 at the [indecipherable] Plaza where\nsome of the VIPs were quartered and we had a suite there where we \u2014 a\u2014 a-\u2014a gor\n\u2014aroom there where we gave them tickets, gave them directions, told them where\nto go and so forth. Then I had to wait a little while until I got into the business\nservices training program. I\u2019d missed the first class, so I got into the second \u2014 the\nnext class and \u2014 later that year, \u201993. And I been there \u2014 I been there ever since. I\nworked at \u2014 two years on the volunteer advisory board, one year as its chairman.\nAnd have done a lot of, well additional things like studies in addition to \u2014 to my\nregular duties there. And it\u2019s been \u2014 it\u2019s been a useful thing. It gives me a chance to\ntalk to people and maybe add something to their knowledge. When people ask a\nquestion, I give them just a little more than they asked for, usually. Except, of\ncourse, the main question, where\u2019s the bathroom. I don\u2019t do any more of that, I just\npoint them in the right direction. But on the others, if they want to know about\nwhere an exhibit is, I know they also want to know what it is about, and I find that\nmost of them don\u2019t. So giving them that little extra information, satisfying to me,\nand from what I can see, to \u2014 with people, they like it. Th-They \u2014 I get a special\nthank you. So th-that has been a \u2014 the other organizations, oh, I \u2014 I\u2019m a member of\nthe Friends of the Yad Vashem, but that\u2019s strictly a \u2014 you know, a supporting\nthing. I send them my donation and I get their newspaper. And the same for the\nJune 8, 1999\nAmerican gathering of \u2014 of \u2014 what its \u2014 American Gathering of Holocaust\nSurvivors. I\u2019m not anywhere involved \u2014 not \u2014 not involved in any chapter of what \u2014\nif they have any. I contribute to them, and I think it\u2019s a worthwhile thing. I give\nthem some money and I read their publication, but that\u2019s about it. I am not a joiner.\nI\u2019m -\u2014I\u2019m very selective in what I join.",
        "A: At the museum? Oh, many, many. I had \u2014 one of them, I was doing groups,\nwhich I \u2014 I do mostly groups now, because nobody else wants to do them. Now, I\nhad a school group from France, a \u2014 French high school students, most \u2014 all girls,\nas a matter of fact. And one little girl said to me, with her teacher, they all spoke\nEnglish very nicely. And she said that her grandfather had \u2014 was in the resistance,\nhe was Jewish, her grandfather was in the resistance, he had survived. He had a\ngun, a rifle, something, that he gave to the Smithsonian and the Smithsonian had\ngiven it to the museum, and would I know where she could possibly find that? I\ntold her, I said, when you get down to the second floor, when you make \u2014 go\naround the first bend, there are the resistance movements, you find the French\nresistance there, take a look there. About two hours later, the girl came back with\ntears in her eyes, saying thank you, thank you so much. I found not only my\nJune 8, 1999\ngrandfather\u2019s gun, with his name on it and all that, with a label, but also some\npapers he had apparently given, some pa \u2014 passport \u2014 well, I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not sure\nwhat it \u2014 what it was, I can\u2019t remember. I looked at it afterwards, but I can\u2019t \u2014 but\nsome documents that are also sitting right there. So she found her grandfather there.\nIt was \u2014 it was a heartwarming thing. I had another one, I was loading the elevators,\nand it was a quiet period, and I had a family coming in around \u2014 what looked like a\nhusband and wife and two grown children, children in their 20\u2019s. And I directed\nthem to the \u2014 to the I.D. cards and said, pick up an I.D. card. The man picked up an\nI.D. card, and the next \u2014 I was looking at him, next he said, oh my God. I said,\nanything wrong? He said no. We are from Holland and I picked a card, this is a\nperson from my town in Holland. I didn't know anybody was in the Holocaust in\nHolland, in \u2014 from my town. Some small town he lives in. They looked like\nprofessional people. But, and I-I-I said, well, th-that\u2019s very unusual. And he said,\noh, when I get back I will \u2014 I will give this to the mayor. We will \u2014 I will \u2014 will tell\nthem that we \u2014 we have to do something, you know, a plaque or something for a\nperson ah \u2014 we didn \u2014 I don\u2019t think anybody even knows or remembers that. I said,\nthat\u2019s wonderful, please do that. And there were several other things like that that\nhappened that are very nice to know. I read \u2014 oh, well, an amazing thing. One day I\n\u2014 Iwas \u2014I was the information desk, and a man walked up to me. And he looks at\nJune 8, 1999\nme and I looked at him and he \u2014 some [indecipherable] looked familiar, wasn\u2019t\nsure what it was. He said, you\u2019re Stein. I looked at him. I said, ve seen you\nsomewhere, way back. He says, yeah, in [indecipherable] he started speaking\nGerman. Somebody I knew in Vienna, and as a matter of fact I also knew him in\nNew York, but we \u2014 he had \u2014 he changed comple \u2014 I-I don\u2019t know, he \u2014 I guess I\ndidn\u2019t change much, but he recognized me. I didn\u2019t recognize him, but I had known\nhim in \u2014 in New York and \u2014 about 1939 \u2014 1940, I guess, and then sort of lost track,\nI hadn\u2019t seen him since about then \u2014 since then. So we \u2014 we had a long talk. Those\nare some of the things. Vis-Visitors, I have a \u2014 I have my own personal policy in \u2014\nin \u2014 in \u2014 in visitor services. There\u2019s no German or Austrian that comes to the\nmuseum that does not go and see it, I don\u2019t care whether there are tickets or not. I\nalways have some \u2014 my own tickets in my pocket. I always save some for just\nthose. And I\u2019ve had many cases where I \u2014 I think they need to go see, see their own\nhistory. Not mine, their history, now. And I\u2019ve had some of them come back, f-find\nme again, look me up and \u2014 and thank me for \u2014 for letting them see. They says, you\nknow, we read a lot about it, we heard a lot about it, but not like this. I said, that\u2019s\nright. It\u2019s all there. I enjoy working with groups, school groups mostly, where we\ngo a little deeper into the \u2014 the subject matter, and I\u2019m particularly 1-interested in\nthe questions the kids ask. And some of them are good. And then I have right now\nJune 8, 1999\nstill \u2014 still there from last year, so I guess two years now, the artwork down at the\nelevator, the basement \u2014 the concourse elevator. The first thing as you walk in on\nthe left hand side is that large picture of the police station in Vienna, the one I lived\nnext door to. The one I\u2019ve been in. And so, after we \u2014 I tell them all about the\nmuseum, I say, well while you\u2019re waiting for the elevator, take a look at this one. It\nmight give you something a little personal. I was in that police station, I lived right\nnext door to it. I been in there many times before the Germans moved in and after\nthe Germans moved in, I was in there asking for permission to leave the country.\nAnd then I get all kinds of questions. Oh, were you there, oh. And, you know. The\nelevators, fortunately take a long time to come down to \u2014 to the concourse and so\nwe got \u2014 have time to answer those questions. Makes an impression, and it gives\nthem one more dimension to [indecipherable]. I also \u2014 1 s \u2014 I \u2014 excuse me, I\nstarted this program, which they are n\u2014 are now continuing, o-of the \u2014 when I was\non the \u2014 on the [indecipherable] of taking people through and having survivors\ntelling their stories at certain places that they\u2019re particularly \u2014 that they\u2019re \u2014 were\ninvolved in. And I just saw in those latest \u2014 you may have seen that \u2014 that they \u2014\nPete Philips is now going to do it this fall again for th-the paid staff of visitor\nservices. And they need it. Paid staff 1s, you know, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re the most\ntemporary employees \u2014 o-of visitor services, are the most temporaries 1-in the\nJune 8, 1999\nmuseum. They come in, it\u2019s their first job after college and they can\u2019t wait to get\ntheir one year in to get status to apply for another job somewhere, because they\u2019re\nnot paying them. The pay is \u2014 is ridiculous. And so they\u2019re not putting heart and\nsoul into it like we do.",
        "A: The what?",
        "A: The 1936 Olympics, that was in \u2014 oh, that was interesting because I found a\npicture in there of two \u2014 there was a picture of two Jewish swim \u2014 swim champions\n\u2014 Austrian swim champions that refused to go to the Olympics and they happened\nto be teammates of mine, I was a member of the same club and the same swim\nteam. And that was a real surprise when I walked by there and took a look at that,\nand here they are. Interestingly, I had seen one of them on an Austrian video of\nformer Austrians\u2019 interviews, during an interview in Israel. And I saw one of them\non that one. Of course, now I wouldn\u2019t have recognized her cause she\u2019s, you know,\n50 years 0 \u2014 60 years older than when I last saw her. And then about a few weeks\nlater I go down there and I see the way I did recognize her.\nJune 8, 1999",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Well, all I can say 1s it\u2019s about time. But it\u2019s understandable that it wasn\u2019t until\nsome of the major institutions like re\u2014 Yad Vashem, and the U.S. museum came\ninto being. That\u2019s brought it \u2014 and of course that \u2014 that led to all the things that are\nnow going on, the \u2014 o-of payments and \u2014 and restitution and all that. It was\ndormant too long, and of course in my own case, in Austria, the Austrians never\nconsidered themselves as the first victims until what, 1992 or \u201993 when Chancellor\nVranitzky said hey, let\u2019s forget about that, we\u2019re just as guilty as the rest of them.\nAnd then all of a sudden they said oh yeah, yes we are. I-I mean, it \u2014 it took a long\ntime and it is good because those of us who were there or were directly involved,\nwe\u2019re not going to be around for too long. And now there\u2019s a whole new generation\ncoming up who will know about it. And I think that is important.",
        "A: I haven\u2019t had a chance to talk to one. And I been thinking about that, what\nwould I say to them? And my first impulse is violence, do some violence. But I\nthink the best thing I can think of is to ridicule them, say oh, you know all about\nthat? Well, I was there, so don\u2019t you tell me it didn\u2019t happen, because I was there it\ndid happen, I saw it happen. And walk away. But th-th \u2014 yo-you can\u2019t engage them\nJune 8, 1999\nin \u2014 in conversation really, because I think that is what they want. Don\u2019t give them\na platform.",

I\ndon\u2019t, now that it\u2019s almost over, I don\u2019t see how these people are going to go back\ninto what used to be their homes. And from what I understand, many of them don\u2019t\nwant to, and I don\u2019t blame them, just like we didn\u2019t want to go back. We could\nhave gone back, I guess, and some few did, but not \u2014 not \u2014 not many. The same\nwith them.

He was giving a lecture\nat one of the people\u2019s university, there was a \u2014 one of those things like \u2014 like the\nextension course type operations [indecipherable] and I just had to go and s \u2014\nlisten to him. I was at the time in school, taking psychology, that was one of the\nJune 8, 1999\ncourses we were taking one year, and oh, the \u2014 had to see that. And so I went and I\nsaw th \u2014 I was \u2014 I was \u2014 I was awed. Probably didn\u2019t understand a word he said,\nbut I\u2014 I\u2014I was awed by be in the \u2014 being in the presence of the man. And it was \u2014\nit was a-an experience, but it was a youthful experience. I \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I am \u2014 I have\nno idea what he \u2014 I can\u2019t remember what he \u2014 what he was talking about, what the\ntopic was. And I pretended to understand everything, of course, like a 16 year old\ndoes, and told everybody that I went to see a lecture of Freud\u2019s. I saw \u2014 I saw the\nman, I listened to him, and oh yes, he was great. And I don\u2019t think I even admitted\nto myself that I didn\u2019t understand what he was saying. But that\u2019s about the extent of\n\u2014 of that particular experience. It was a one time, about one hour thing.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know exactly what impact it had, but I ha \u2014 I had found out about that,\noh I was \u2014 oh, probably about six or seven years old when I was told about it. He \u2014\nhe died before \u2014 long before I was born, about 1912, I think it was. And it \u2014 it was\na sort of a nostalgic thing. Think \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2014I thought of my grandfa \u2014 I wan \u2014 I\nwanted to know him. I never knew any of my grandfathers. My other grandfather\nJune 8, 1999\nhad gone to America, and he died before I got here, so I never saw him. And it was\nsomething missing in my life. I \u2014 it was a sentimental thing. But in a \u2014 the history\nof my \u2014 my mother\u2019s family, it had a lo \u2014 a lot of impact, of course, on \u2014 on my\nmother, and her sisters, and her brother, too. They never talked about it, except, a-at\nleast one time or a few times when \u2014 first when \u2014 when I heard about it and then\nwhen \u2014 when I asked a question, my mother would say something about it. My\nmother was, at the time, she was about 20 years old when he \u2014 he was thrown into\nthe \u2014 into the well. So I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not sure that there was any real impact on \u2014 on my\nlife that I\u2014 I know.",
        "A: Tomatoes. For some reason or other I would never eat tomatoes when I was a\nchild, until I was in Luxembourg, and one day when I was hungry and this friend\nof mine and I had about a franc between us and we passed by one of those grocery\nstands and there were tomatoes. And he said, let\u2019s get a couple of tomatoes, we\u2019ve\ngot enough money for a couple of tomatoes. And I \u2014 I looked at it, and I was\nhungry, and I agreed. And we took the tomatoes and \u2014 and I\u2019m \u2014 he ate it like an\napple, you know, he bit into it and it tasted good. And I\u2019ve been eating tom-\ntomatoes ever since. I love them. It was \u2014 I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t eat them when\nI was a child. We had them at home, and \u2014 but for some reason or other, I\u2014I-\u2014I-\u2014I\nJune 8, 1999\ndidn\u2019t like them. And I guess it took a\u2014 a hungry day to \u2014 an-and nothing else to\neat in \u2014 in sight and that tomato looked good and it tasted good, and as I said, I love\nthem. Even grow them.",
        "A: I can\u2019t think of anything offhand. I think you\u2019ve done a great job again, as you\nalways do. Have to get that on my tape. No, you \u2014 I think you \u2014 you\u2019ve guided me\nthrough my life very nicely. Couldn\u2019t think of it any better. I appreciate it, because\nthis tape, I assume I get a copy of that, I think my children will \u2014 will appreciate it.\nThank you.\n"
