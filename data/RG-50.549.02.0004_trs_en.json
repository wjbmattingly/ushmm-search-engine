        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Drexel Sprecher, conducted by Margaret West, on September\nvideotaped interview, conducted with Drexel Sprecher on June the 18th, 1990. The\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby\nHerr for making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. If you\u2019d --\nwould identify yourself.",
        "Answer: I\u2019m Drexel A. Sprecher. I was a prosecutor at Nuremberg, and I\u2019ve been\nwriting a book on Nuremberg called, \u201cInside the Nuremberg Trial, A Prosecutor\u2019s\nComprehensive Account.\u201d I\u2019ve been working on it for nearly 10 years. It'll be\npublished in late November or December of this year, by the University Press of\nAmerica.",
        "Q: I wonder if you\u2019d talk next about your motivations in becoming a Nuremberg\nprosecutor?",
        "A: Yes. I'd been with -- I\u2019d written a senior paper during my last year in college,\nconcerning the structure of national socialism, as we knew it at that time. And I read a\nfew books, particularly by professors from the University of Chicago. And the book\ngot a triple A, or the article got a tripi A -- triple A rating, and so I had an early interest\nin the Nazi regime, way back in 1933 and \u201834. Then I went off to the London School\nof Economics for a year and there were a number of refugees there, refugees from\nHitler, who -- with whom I became friends and went out to dinner with and parties and\nso on. So I got to form some friendships that way. Then, of course, came the war and I\nwas overseas for nearly [phone ringing]. Well, what was I saying?",
        "Q: Oh you\u2019d -- were at the London School of Economics.",
        "A: Oh, and I -- as I di -- was about to say, I traveled around Europe a bit and twice into\nNazi Germany. I saw the wedding of Herman Goering and Emma Sonamen on April\n10, 1935. I traveled into the -- the ruhr, because I\u2019d met a German young man in\nLondon, who offered to show me the good hoffnoseeter and to stay overnight in their\nhouse and so on. He did this knowing that I was anti-Nazi, but his family was rather\nre-reserved, because I don\u2019t think they wanted to -- they didn\u2019t want to take a chance\nof exposing themselves too much. Anyway, I also went out one evening with --\nsomewhere near Frankfurt, with the Reverend Stuart Herman, H-e-r-m-a-n, who later\nbecame the American pastor in Berlin. He ra -- He later wrote the book, \u201cIt\u2019s Your\nSouls We Want.\u201d And Stu Herman and I became lifelong friends, we\u2019re still\ncorresponding. After I came back from London, I went to school with -- I went to\nHarvard Law School for three years and my club won the moot court arguments, and\nthe case was based on a -- a -- a labor case. So when I went down to Washington, I\nwent to the Labor Board and they hired me in a half an hour, based on the fact that I\u2019d\ncontributed to this brief, which was on a point that was being argued before the\nSupreme Court. So that started four years of trial work. They used me as a trial lawyer.\nThen came the war and in 1942, I enlisted and within a month was again back in\nEngland, as a sergeant and later a warrant officer. I was in England for six months\nuntil the -- after the invasion of Africa by the allies. I then went to Iran, Algeria, as\nadministrative officer to the Inspector General. In that capacity we traveled all over\nNorth Africa, inspecting American army installations. I then -- An old friend of mine,\nGerhard VanArkel, who was the deputy head of the German labor branch of the Office\nof Strategic Services, OSS, came to Iran and asked me to come up and become the\ntraining officer for the labor desk in Algiers. I had a hard time getting away from my\nboss, but I finally managed and for some six months I trained Germans who had\nfought on the -- for the Loyalists in Spain. And th-these anti-Nazi Germans were being\ntrained to do parachute jumping, to do signals -- signal work so they could send out\nmessages after they\u2019d jumped into Germany, and so forth. Then I got a call from\nWashington to come and become the training officer at the central desk of OSS -- a\ncentral desk for labor and German operatives. And while I was there, Jack Ohly, O-h-\nl-y, whom I\u2019d known in Harvard Law School, saw me with my parachute wings and\nsaid, \u201cYou ha -- should come to work for the labor branch, helping us settle strikes and\ngathering labor for the short supply labor industries in the midwest.\u201d And I said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t think the OSS will release me.\u201d His boss was Colonel Brennan, who later\nbecame a Supreme Court Justice. Colonel Brennan called Arthur Goldberg, who was\nmy top boss and later a member of the Supreme Court and convinced him that I should\nperform this service. So, while that went on, the war finally came to an end and I came\nback to Washington with the idea of getting out of the army and returning to trial law\nfor the labor board. At that time, s -- r -- Justice Robert H. Jackson had been appointed\nto be the US Chief of Council for war crimes. He made a statement which was\nreleased to the press on June second, 1945. I was so struck by it\u2019s -- not only it\u2019s\nunderstanding of the w -- the way Hitler had come to power, but of it\u2019s determination\nto see that the Nazi regime was exposed from beginning to end that it\u2019s top leaders\nwere brought to justice and to an explanation of why they had committed the evils\nthey had committed. I didn\u2019t know how to get with Justice Jackson\u2019s group, because I\ndidn\u2019t know him at the time. So I went back to OSS and my old fraternity brother,\nRobert Thrun, T-h-r-u-n, was one of the three assistants to Wild Bill Donovan, the\nhead of OSS. General Wild Bill Donovan. And I had told him my dilemma, and he\nsays, \u201cWell, we can take care of that.\u201d So we went down to see the general council of\nOSS, who is another Donovan, a James Donovan. And Jim Donovan hired me within a\nhalf hour and for the next month or so, I busily engaged in studying in detail, the OSS\nreports on Nazi Germany, and they were terrific and very well done. And a professor\nby the name of Noiman had written a book on Nazi Germany -- just a second --\nNoiman had written a book called, \u201cBehemoth\u201d and I studied that in some detail and\nthen went in to see him. And I told him of my background and he said, \u201cWell, I -- Of\ncourse you\u2019re interested in the destruction of the trade unions by the Nazis.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cYes.\u201d He reached back and pulled out a German book that had been obtained by\nOSS through Switzerland. And, an appendix in that German book contained the order\nof Robert Ley, L-e-y, the later defendant at Nuremberg who committed suicide. And\nRobert Ley had written this order on how the SA -- the Storm Troopers and the SS\nwere to take over the trade unions. Well, this gave me the basis for not only a brief and\nfor a -- an eventual presentation to the tribunal, it also gave me leads to labor leader\nwith whom OSS was in touch, both in London and some of them in Germany. So I\nflew to London, Paris and then went into Germany to visit some of these trade union\nleaders. And I got affidavits from all of them and those affidavits were all introduced\nin the Nuremberg -- first Nuremberg trial. Neither one of the affiants was cross-\nexamined by the defense, they didn\u2019t question at all the -- the horrors that surrounded\nthat particular aspect of the Nazi regime. The result was that that made some\nimpression on Justice Jackson and later on others and the main deputy to Jackson,\nColonel Robert G. Storey, who later became head of the American Bar Association, he\nwas quite impressed by this work and said, \u201cYou must make some -- a presentation to\nthe tribunal,\u201d which of course delighted me. And he assigned me the case of a Baldur\nvon Schirach, the Hitler youth leader, who later became the Gauleiter of Vienna.",
        "Q: Let me interrupt to ask a question. Do you think that had you not sort of pushed\nyourself forward, you would ever have been approached to play a role? You s -- You\nwere peculiarly fitted, I think, but I wondered if it\u2019s because you were aware of that fit\nand felt at once, very strongly, that this was something you wanted to be involved in?",
        "A: Yes, as soon as I heard Justice Jack -- read Justice Jackson\u2019s report, I knew there\nwas where Sprecher should next go. And so I\u2019d determined to get there one way or the\nother, and it turned out to be a relatively easy path.",
        "Q: I also want to go back to what we talked about before, really, your motivations, but\nin becoming involved, did you feel that you had something personal you wanted to\nachieve? I don\u2019t mean for the sake of your personal ego or career, but did you feel\npassionately about what this prosecution was going to achieve?",
        "A: I felt passionately about what the prosecution could achieve.",
        "Q: And then, what did -- what do you feel the Nuremberg trial -- what do you feel the\neffect was on you later? The -- Y-Your own writings bear testimony to what happened,\nbut if we move forward, how do you look back on it and do you feel that it\u2019s been\nevolving over many years, the impact?",
        "A: The impact of the Nuremberg trial on American public opinion was considerable\nfor approximately one year. And then, with the coming of the -- after the war, with the\ncoming of the Cold War, American opinion and the journalists and so on, turned very\nrapidly toward discussions of the Cold War and the Nazis and the Nuremberg trials\nwere very much played down and not talked up for some time. I turned away to other\nthings here in America, and then got involved in some business affairs and then got\ninto Behavioral Science and teaching at George Washington University in Behavioral\nScience, which is a new field for me, but I really worked hard to get there and a couple\nof professors were kind of pushing me to do that. And then I began to get interested in\nNuremberg again, particularly after I th -- more or less retired, although I -- I didn\u2019t\ncompletely retire from training and consulting. But I slowed down a lot and I started to\nfirst work on Baldur von Schirach, the usel -- the youth leader, who -- wh-whom I had\nparticularly prosecuted, I\u2019d made the principal presentation against him. Then I\ndecided I\u2019d switch to something which was talked more about and that was Julius\nStreicher, the top Jew baiter of all time. But then, a lot was written about him, and so I\nstarted to move toward the idea of seeing if I couldn\u2019t contribute something different\nby writing the most elaborate book, the most comprehensive book on the Nuremberg\ntrials, one which would agree with most of the conclusions that many other writers\nhave made, but which would go beyond that, into the depth of the evidence, and\nparticularly quotations from the contemporaneous documents and from the testimony\nof the 20 -- of the 22 defendants who were at Nuremberg -- 21 defendants. The\nconsequence was that I finally developed a huge book, far too long for publication. It\nwas rejected by a number of commercial presses as being financially unbearable with\nit\u2019s length, and I think it was, especially for a commercial press. I then started\napproaching university presses and they all insisted that the book should be reduced\nsomewhat in size, so it\u2019d fit into two volumes, rather than three. And so I spent a\ncouple of years doing the difficult task of condensing. And finally, the university press\nof America, based on all the commendations that I had and their own scholarly\nresearch, decided that the book did have a special role to play and so I\u2019m -- was very\nglad to sign a contract with them and my book will be published in late December -- or\nlate No-November or early December.",
        "Q: And of course the length publishers want has nothing to do with the value of\nsomething to posterity. You know, your material and work is there to be handed on, in\nfull length.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s what distinguishes the book mainly. I don\u2019t attempt to be the final\npreacher about the Nazi regime, but I mean to make the account of the trial available,\nso that many scholars and a lot of others that are r-really interested and willing to\nspend some time, can really delve into the contemporaneous documents and\nparticularly into the motivations of the defendants. It\u2019s so false for people to think of\nthe Nuremberg in terms of defendants saying, \u201cI was following superior orders.\u201d\nThese defendants worked for years for the Nazis and superior orders defense applies\nmainly to lower people in the -- at the bottom of the hierarchy, who are told to go and\nshoot somebody or to commit some atrocious crime. The people at the top give their\nloyalties to a regime over a period of time, and they do it for many different reasons. It\nhas little to do with, I was ordered to do this by somebody. Most of the enthusiastically\nworked for the Nazi regime. Some of them, of course, had great reservations and some\nof them wept as they gave their testimony, being very sorry indeed, for having\nassociated themselves with such an evil course of conduct.",
        "Q: When you talked of Nuremberg and the fact that it was only for a year that 1t was\nextensively covered in the American press, I -- I\u2019d like you to say more about that,\nbecause I\u2019m sure you feel that the very holding of the tribunal was immensely\nimportant in documenting what had gone on. I -- I was just reading about Benjamin\nFirense a-as just one small example of somebody gathering evidence. But I\u2019m sure we\ngained immensely through -- in many ways, through holding the tribunal.",
        "A: Yes, Professor Firense came to Nuremberg and when he find -- found out about the\nEinsatzgruppen, he immediately started to make some proposals to General Telford\nTaylor about his leading that -- the case against the main leaders of the\nEinsatzgruppen, the special task forces which killed millions -- a couple million Jews.\nAnd he did this with great ability and aplomb and he presented the case almost entirely\nwith documents in an -- less than a day and one half. The case went on for months\nafter that, by the defense, but the prosecutions case, in the shortest Nuremberg case of\nall -- the short -- the shortest case of the prosecution, was the one conducted by\nFirense. I became the head of several divisions, the subsequent proceedings division,\neconomics division, chief of the I. G. Farben trial team, and later, deputy chief council\nin charge of the official publications. At -- Firense had been offered the job, by Telford\nTaylor, of being director of publications. He turned it down in order to become head of\nthe Jewish successor restitution organization and he recovered from German firms tha\n-- who had employed slave labor and who\u2019d taken property from Jews, he recovered\nvast quantities of money for the people involved at -- the survivors of the -- of the\npeople that were involved or the -- some of the people who still survived. And to this\nday, he\u2019s one of my best friends.",
        "Q: What -- You\u2019re in touch with a number of people whose experience was somewhat\nsimu -- similar. You mentioned for instance, a -- as a good friend. Have you talked\nwith these colleagues about the impact or the effect of Nuremberg on your lives, and is\nthere any similarity, sort of commonality of experience?",
        "A: I\u2019ve talked to almost all the survivors, in fact, I was the chairman of the executive\ncommittee that put on three Nuremberg reunions, beginning in 1979, nine -- then\nanother 1991 and one in 1996 at the -- more or less at the 50th anniversary of the end\nof the first Nuremberg trial. And I\u2019m in touch with almost all these prosecutors. I\u2019ve\nsent them chapters from my forthcoming book. I\u2019ve asked for their criticisms and their\ncomments. I don\u2019t think anybody surviving knows as much about the people who were\nin Nuremberg than -- than I do. I don\u2019t think so, because of my continued work on this\nsubject. I have constantly wanted to be in touch with them.",
        "Q: And what do you think the impact has been? Has it colored everything that you\u2019 ve\ndone subsequently?",
        "A: Oh yes, I -- You don\u2019t do anything as significant as the Nuremberg trial was, in\nreviewing a modern dictatorship, without that having a tremendous effect emotionally,\non you. I think the importance of the trial is much more on what it revealed than in the\nfact that it punished 19 defendants, and acquitted three. The effect of the trial later on,\nwas very mixed. For some years, it had very little effect, and then as war crimes were\ncommitted in ce-central Europe, particularly in Yugoslavia, and then later in Rwanda,\nworld attention turned much more to what international law was, that international law\nwas being violated, and that there was no established structure to deal with these\ncrimes, and that no court was available which was -- had jurisdiction to handle these\nmatters. So then you started to get the foundation laid and an international treaty\nsigned to create the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, and later on the United Nations also\ncreated the Rwanda tribunal. The Rwanda tribunal has had a great number of\ndifficulties. It was poorly staffed, poorly financed and was not well taken -- it was not\nwell administrated. On the contrary, I think the -- the beginnings of the Yugoslav war\ncrimes tribunal are very promising. They do not have the number of contemporaneous\ndocuments or the great amount of contemporaneous documents which we had in the\nNuremberg trial. This means they have to rely much more on investigations and\ninterrogating witnesses and that\u2019s a much more difficult job to do when you don\u2019t have\nall the knowledge that we had about the detailed operation of the Nazi regime.",
        "Q: What are the main shortcomings of these later tribunals?",
        "A: International opinion does not regard them as essential to scoring the up events and\nil-illuminating the background and the nature what went on in the Balkans that led to\nsome of these things. They aren\u2019t international opinion on the whole, is not in the same\nposition of knowledge with respect to what\u2019s going on. And you don\u2019t have the same\npush, the same public demand. And the tremendous number of countries are so\ntroubled by their own internal problems that they have not pushed the United Nations\nor the established tribunal to do more, more quickly, and they haven\u2019t given it as much\nfunding and -- as they should. There are some very able people that have gone into the\nleadership of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal and I wish them well. I think that they\nare going to make a -- a big contribution in the long run.",
        "Q: I wonder if you\u2019d talk about areas of involvement in your life later, that you see as\nhaving a direct involvement with your Nuremberg experience.",
        "A: I was asked to make a number of speeches at conferences of one kind and another\nand of course I was instrumental with health and my wife and others in putting on\nthese three Nuremberg reunions. And this took up a lot of time and -- it meant that,\nhowever, that we were able to call back my former associates in Nuremberg and keep\nin touch with them. Nuremberg is not something that wears out of your life with time.\nIt -- It becomes a -- an area where you think about it at night and you think about it in\nthe morning and you wonder what can the world do, what can -- how can public\nopinion be advanced so that they\u2019re willing to reduce the rights of national sovereignty\nto a greater extent and to make the international law really international and\nenforceable by international agency. There are a tremendous number of isolationists\nand people who raise their hands and say, \u201cWe don\u2019t want any foreigners in a position\nwhere they can possibly judge Americans.\u201d There\u2019s a certain appeal in that for citizens\nwho are not too well informed, and it\u2019s regrettable.",
        "Q: Do you think there are grounds for optimism though? Do you feel things are getting\nbetter or getting worse?",
        "A: No, I think things are getting somewhat better. I don\u2019t think the pace 1s nearly as\ngreat as it should be and certainly not as great as I would like to have it.",
        "Q: And how can we change people\u2019s attitudes?",
        "A: By more education in international affairs at a younger age, for younger people. By\nhaving more of the -- the books that have been written on Nuremberg circulated more\nwidely, building up interest in -- in a broader public education, so that people are more\naware of --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Drexel Sprecher. This is tape number one, side B. Do you think your trips that\nyou made as a young man to Germany, | think it was 1929 - 1934, was that a part of\nthe forming of your own internationalism, if you like?",
        "A: Oh yes indeed. The fact that I studied in London and I met many refugees from\nHitler, that I traveled into Germany while Hitler was in -- in power, in 1934 and 1935,\nthe fact that I worked with anti-Nazi Germans in the Office of Strategic Service, just\nleft an -- an indelible imprint on my -- my whole life.",
        "Q: What about the imprint left by your parent\u2019s values? What you had absorbed from\nthem or been taught by them?",
        "A: It had very little influence. I came from a middle class, lower upper class, small\ntown family. My father was a banker. He\u2019d been president of the Wisconsin Bar\nAssociation and I don\u2019t think he paid very much attention to the Nazi regime until I\nbegan to become active in my thinking about the Nazi regime and told him something\nabout it. He was certainly never sympathetic to the Nazi regime that I know of, but he\nwas not active with respect to international affairs.",
        "Q: Now, he did have -- your parents did have religious views, so would you not have\nperhaps had a strong moral sense that you would have absorbed from them?",
        "A: Well, you touch on a very important point, not so much because of the moral values\nthat my parents had, but they sent me to a small college my first year, North Central\nCollege, and there I met a minister by the name of Ralph Marion Holdiman, who was\na very active Christian Socialist and his ethical values were very stretched into the\npolitical area and by the time I was done with that first year away at college, I was -- I\nwas beginning to see the roots of Fascism in Germany and of course then, when I went\nto the University of Wisconsin, Hitler came to power during my junior year, and a\nnumber of professors played this up as one might expect, because it was certainly a\ntremendously forbidding development in international affairs. One of my professors\nwas Selac Perlman, who was the chief historian of labor developments in this country.\nAnd I can remember one day in a seminar that he burst into tears as someone\nmentioned what was happening in Nazi Germany. And it was a very moving moment\nand I can still remember it very well. Max Carl Otto was a -- an American of German\ndescent who was very anti-Nazi and he was also one of my heroes at the University of\nWisconsin. I was asked to run the conference on war at the University of Wisconsin,\nshortly after Hitler came to power, and we gathered leaders, including people from\nmilitary academies and professors from both Wisconsin and other universities, some\nministers, like Re-Reverend Alf da -- Alfred W. Swan and others and they made talks\nand there was questions by the students and there were some demonstrations about\nhow important the whole thing was, by some of the students. And that put me on the\nbandwagon.",
        "Q: And it does seem as if the early years have those strands, if you like, that become a\ntheme throughout your life. I\u2019m thinking of the group you were involved in as a\nstudent, Coinose?",
        "A: Coinose.",
        "Q: Oh then, I wonder if you\u2019d tell the story too, of Beverly, that you mentioned once.",
        "A: Oh it -- I -- I made a number of f-friends at the University of Wisconsin, who had\nstrong ethical feelings. Catholics, Protestants and Jews. And a number of us got\ntogether and got the idea that if we held a number of meetings, it might help make a\ncontribution to fighting this -- this racism and contribute to the broader education of\nstudents. One of them was Beverly Rabinoff, who was a Badger Beauty. She was one\nof the five women elected to that noble category because of her good looks. There\nwere an -- a number of other people, George Dugger, Bill Blaiser, who were Aryans\nwho were very active in this movement and we called it, \u201cIn Common,\u201d which was\nfrom the Greek word meaning in common -- coinose. We held meetings. We didn\u2019t\nallow people to join Coinose unless they had at least a B average and unless they\u2019d\ndone something on the campus. Well that made it kind of a distinct group and people\nkind of looked at us in a different way than if we\u2019d just said, \u201cHey, everybody can\njoin Coinose.\u201d And it turned out to be a very useful thing, they got a ver -- very great\namount attention, including by the president of the university.",
        "Q: But you -- What it was -- after, I remember you talking about including Beverly in\na -- I think it was a fraternity dance.",
        "A: Oh yes. There was quite a bit of segregation at the universities back in the 1930\u2019s\nand there were Jewish fraternities and non-Jewish fraternities and non-Jewish\nsororities and so on. And the -- there was very little mixing of -- inside the frater -- the\nsorority or fraternity houses of Jews and Gentiles. So Beverly Rabinoff, being a good\nfriend of mine, I said to her one day, \u201cBeverly, ve been asked to go to the Tri-Delt\nHouse,\u201d -- the -- one of the sororities, \u201cfor a party. And I\u2019m wondering if you would\nlike to be my guest?\u201d And she said, \u201cOh, that\u2019ll upset things a great deal.\u201d And I said,\n\u201cWell, why not? After all, you\u2019re a Badger Beauty, and if you go in there, we\u2019ll cause\n-- with me -- we\u2019ll cause quite a sensation.\u201d So we ap -- walked into the sorority house\nat the time of that party and people\u2019s jaws dropped. However, within minutes,\neverybody wanted to dance with Beverly Rabinoff. All the men wanted to dance with\nher and I was left alone throughout most of the evening while other people danced\nwith Beverly Rabinoff. So that was a small contribution to integration.",
        "Q: Do you have a lot of other examples like that?",
        "A: Well, in my fraternity, which had no Jews, Phi Gamma Delta, I got el -- Edward\nEllsworth Ross, who was a former Phi Gam to come and talk and I urged him to talk\nabout the segregation problem and things like that, which he did. And so there was\nsome things like that. The dean of students, a fellow by the name of Holt, H-o-I-t, his\nson was in our fraternity. We went to his house and -- and the overall dean was Scott\nGoodenite. Bill Blaiser, who was the head of the student union, and I, went up to see\nhim and told him that we were about to try something, that we wanted him to know\nwhat it was. Some Jews had gone onto the pier that stuck out into Lake Mindoda, of\none of the fraternity houses -- I forget the name of it right now. And a fellow by the\nname of Max Knecht, K-n-e-c-h-t, who was the boxing champion of the big 10, went\nout with a couple of his fraternity brothers and threw these Jews in the lake. And this,\nof course, made a lot of newspaper publicity. Blaiser -- Bill Blaiser and I didn\u2019t want it\nto die at that point, so we went to Goodenite and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going down to see --\u201d\nBlaiser was over six feet tall and so was I, and together we weren\u2019t too afraid of Max\nKnecht. So we went down to the fraternity and asked to see him and he blustered out\nand said, \u201cWhat are you liberals doing here?\u201d We said, \u201cWe\u2019ve come to tell you that if\nyou were to repeat what you did before, we can give you the straight word that you\u2019d\nbe ostracized from the university and that we would gather a group of people and\nthrow you in the lake just to show that we wouldn\u2019t take this kind of thing any more.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cRrrr,\u201d and turned around, banged the door and left. But Max Knecht\nnever threw any more Jews in the lake.",
        "Q: Now, you said that he was calling you a liberal, but what was your family\nbackground, liberal or very conservative?",
        "A: Very conservative. And -- But they didn\u2019t have any strong pred -- prejudices about\nrace, as far as I know. We only had two Jewish families in the little town I lived in and\nboth of them patronized my father\u2019s bank. And I bought my shoes there and things like\nthat.",
        "Q: What about your own politics and the way in which your Nuremberg experience\nmight have colored that?",
        "A: Well, I became very active in politics after I returned from Nuremberg. Up to that\ntime, I had been an active Democrat in the sense of making a few contributions to the\nDemocratic party and congressional campaign committees and so on, but I hadn\u2019t been\nvery active. But when I came back from Nuremberg, my wife was also an active\nDemocrat and I settled out in Potomac, Maryland area, which 1s largely an area of\nrelatively wealthy people. And a lot of brainy people, a lot of intellectuals who had\ndone well. So we formed -- I became precinct chairman and we also formed a -- a\ngroup out there, which was calculated to give talks about -- in the churches and\notherwise, about anti-Semitism and -- and so forth and the local pastors were all for\nthis. Reverend Gloid Alice in the Methodist church was one of our great supporters\nand so forth. So, yes, this did have an e-effect and I went down to the hill with the idea\nof becoming an assistant to somebody that was helping on small business affairs, since\nI was running a couple of small businesses. A land development company and a\nconstruction company out in Potomac. And I met Senator Sparkman, head of the\nSenate small business committee, and Rite Patman, the head of the House small\nbusiness committee. I went in to s -- They said I should go see Paul Butler, the\nnational chairman of the Democratic party and I did and he established the small\nbusiness division of the Democrat national committee, which was composed of me and\nmy secretary, no more. And we developed a lot of literature, which was broadly\ncirculated to the state parties, county and local people, concerning small business\nissues. So that was my first move, actively into politics. About a year later, after the\n1956 election, I was back to doing what I had been doing before, someone said -- Paul\nButler, the national chairman, was forming a new s-structures to the Democratic\nnational committee, which was going to pull together the political organization and\nbuild up more precincts and ex-extend the amount of public relations that the national\ncommittee was going to have with the local organizations between elections. So I went\nin to see Paul Butler and he immediately said, \u201cWell, I\u2019d like to hire you, but I have to\nconsult with the advisory committee on political organization.\u201d So I flew out to\nMichigan to see former congressman, Neal Staebler, S-t-a-e-b-l-e-r, who was the state\nchairman of the Democratic party in Michigan. And he introduced me to the Michigan\nleaders, and we sat down and had a dinner together and they queried me and they came\nback with the recommendation that I be made deputy chairman of the national\ncommittee -- deputy chairman for political organization. And we then hired a total of\nsix regional representatives, each one of whom had six to eight states, and he -- they\ntraveled around, building up ideas of better Democratic organization, and not trying to\nbe pushy, but ta -- get more people involved, hold more meetings and they would be\navailable to see what was happening in another state, to help -- still a different state, ye\n-- other notions and ideas and try new things out and things like that.",
        "Q: Now what would the group have grilled you about, when they met with you over\ndinner, do you remember?",
        "A: Not particularly. It was a very friendly discussion between active Democrats. And\nof course, they were interested in the fact that I\u2019d been a prosecutor at Nuremberg and\nthat I had edited the official volumes on the later 12 trials, the so-called Green series\nand I think they were kind of glad to have me come aboard.",
        "Q: No, I just wondered what role Nuremberg might have had in -- in that, and you\nanswered.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it -- I don\u2019t think it had much direct role, it -- Nuremberg exposures of\nthings that were against democracy and the dictatorship, of course, contributed to\ndemocracy and I often mentioned the Fascist dictatorship in my discussions, naturally,\nbecause they\u2019d been such a big part of my life, earlier.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Your years as deputy chair, wh-what do you look back on as your\naccomplishments in that role?",
        "A: Well, we were asked to come to the Democratic National Convention and to make\na presentation to the whole convention. So Paul Butler introduced me and I said, fac --\nmany of you people here, that are active at the state level, know what has been done by\nthe political organization wing of the Democratic National Committee. Well, I want to\njust -- just tell you a few things that we have done and will be doing and to ha -- allow\nyou to ask questions, encourage your questions and then I want to have each of the\nregional representatives talk to you and so on. So, up here, in a little book that contains\nthe proceedings of the Democratic National Committee convention in 1959, you'll\nfind about 10 pages where we spoke for perhaps altogether, up to nearly an hour.",
        "Q: What were the most important issues then? You were 1n that role from -- Was that\n1957 to 1960?",
        "A: Yes. Do you know, I -- I have a hard time now, figuring out what the roles were\nthat we most talked about. I think they generally involved the idea of more social\nreform that would benefeet-fit people. We had a -- a senior citizens group as well and\nwe had an agriculture group, a farmer\u2019s group. We had a labor group, and they were\navailable to help push democratic ideas through the democratic digest and through\nspecial releases and through the many speeches that we helped influence.",
        "Q: What about Nuremberg and your -- your post-Nuremberg sort of sensitivity in the\ndecades after that? I\u2019m thinking of major events, the Civil Rights Movement or the\nMcCarthy era or the Feminist movement. I think you would have been a person with\nsort of strong views on -- at all these times, a clear sense of what was right and wrong.",
        "A: Well, yes, but I -- I think it\u2019s rather difficult for me to go into all the ethical and\npolitical implications of that time back there, three years before 1960. We helped elect\nPresident Kennedy and we were delighted with that. I can still remember when he was\nleaving the platform in -- at the 1960 convention and some poor photographer had\ngotten off to the side and -- and had missed him, so I flagged him down as he was\nwalking across the exit ramp, and he stopped and waved and this fellow took a picture.\nWell, little things like that are those that stick out in your mind as you look back. The\nfact that you -- we had a big conference in Colorado and -- and there was a head table\nof about 17. The head of the party in Colorado had the central seat and Kennedy sat\nnext to him, in the middle. I sat in seat 17, on the very end and I said nothing, because\nI wasn\u2019t called on to say anything. We\u2019d -- We weren\u2019t -- We didn\u2019t -- The\n[indecipherable] organization side of the Democratic National Committee encouraged\nother people to be active and talking and doing things. We were not the public\nrelations side of the committee, which created speeches and things like that.",
        "Q: But it would be hugely important.",
        "A: Yes, it -- some people have said that\u2019s -- without our work, that Kennedy wouldn\u2019t\nhave been elected. Well, I think that\u2019s problematical, but in all events, we were\ncertainly a large contribution.",
        "Q: Did you talk, you know, in these -- a-at these times? Would your experiences at\nNuremberg had been something that you\u2019d -- would often -- would it often come up in\nconversation?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: You have a chapter in your book on the legacy of Nuremberg, but I'd wonder if\nyou'd talk about that in general terms?",
        "A: Well, aft -- right after the first trial, the general assembly of the United Nations,\nenacted a declaration on international law and affirming the principles of Nuremberg.\nI\u2019m not sure that that made a tremendous efe -- had a tremendous effect on the -- large\nnumbers of people, but it did contribute to those who were concerned with\ninternational law and with strengthening the United Nations and international law. The\nNuremberg trial set a precedent for trials held immediately after the first trial. In\nNuremberg there were 12 other trials, a total of about 190 other people were tried.\nThen there were trials in the British war zone. There were trials in the French war\nzone. We didn\u2019t hear about any trials in the Soviet zone. The Soviet representative at\nthe first Nuremberg trial, left Nuremberg the -- just after th-the tribunal made it\u2019s\ndecision in the first trial and they never associated with the later trials, at their election.\nHowever, they did allow our representatives to carry on investigations in the Soviet\nzone and they were cooperative in that respect. About two years later, during the later\ntrials, a press contingent of Soviet journalists, did come to Nuremberg for one or two\ndays and I recall sitting in with General Taylor as he was asked questions by them.\nAnd of course, we tried to turn it around and ask them a few questions as to why there\nwere -- had been some trials that we knew about in the eastern zone of Germany, and\nthey were rather embarrassed by that. Toward the end of the trials, the Genocide\nConvention was enacted as a treaty and it is of course, since been ratified by almost all\nnations. it took the United States quite some time to recognize it, because again some\npeople, raising the banner of sovereignty were worried that the Genocide Convention\nwould give other people the right to look into what was happening in the United\nStates. The declaration of -- of human rights by the General Assembly was\n[indecipherable] related to the rights we ex -- expounded at Nuremberg. And Eleanor\nRoosevelt at that time, said, \u201cThis is a fine declaration on human rights, but without\nsome legal obligations, will governments be inspired to see that these rights are\nenforced?\u201d And of course, that was a very incisive comment. The -- As I\u2019ve\nmentioned, the international law committee of the United Nations did reaffirm the\nNuremberg principles and this led -- after we left Germany, this helped lead to a\ntremendous number of trials of Germans, by the German courts. This is something\nmost people don\u2019t know anything about. There\u2019s a whole book on it by a gentleman by\nthe name of Rukerle, who was -- who was in charge of keeping track of these war\ncrimes trials. And there\u2019s been a tremendous number of books published in Germany,\nwhich deal with the Nazi regime and an American photographer by the name of Ray\nDaddario, has cooperated with the German authorities in publishing a number of\nphotographs concerning the Nazi regime and the Nuremberg trial, and these have sold\nvery well. In Berlin there are at least two striking exhibitions that refer back to the\nNazi period. One is in the old Reichstag building, and there they have a photographic\nexhibit that must be a half block long, where you walk along and you get pictures of\nthe development of the Nazi regime, including it\u2019s horrors. A little ways away from\nthat, there is a -- what\u2019s called a Platzenzae memo-memorial. And that\u2019s a very\nstriking memorial. It has a -- a marble wall which says, in German, \u201cTo the victims of\nFascism.\u201d A little ways away, there\u2019s a circular statue -- there\u2019s a statue with a -- a\nbase which is circular and it has arrows which point in the direction of various\nconcentration camps, Auschwitz, Flossenburg, Buchenwald. And it\u2019s very striking,\nyou can\u2019t think as you walk by that, without realizing that in each of these\nconcentration camps, hundreds of thousands and in the case of Auschwitz, millions of\npeople were killed. The German Minister of Justice has spoken out about the\nsignificance of the Nuremberg trials. There\u2019s been a tremendous turnaround in\nGerman thinking, partly as a result of the Nuremberg trials. Course, one of the striking\nthings about the Vietnam war is that a couple of our officers also went on a binge of\nkilling Vietnamese citizens, the kind of thing that can happen when an ideologically\nmotivated person is not constrained and 1s willing to kill people, certainly outside the\nlaw. This led to the conviction of Lieutenant William Calley, C-a-l-l-e-y, a junior\nofficer in the US army. So this is one case where we\u2019ve applied international law to\none of our own officers, which is a good thing. The greatest thing that\u2019s happened by\nway of specific action, took place under the administration of President George Bush,\nafter Saddam Hussein and forces of Iraq had invaded Kuwait --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Drexel Sprecher. This is tape number two, side A. You were just talking about\nthe Gulf War.",
        "A: Yes, in 1990, after Saddam Hussein invaded Iraq, George Bush -- President George\nBush, after consultation with a number of people that were leaders in the United\nNations and the Secretary General of NATO, he ordered military forces of the United\nStates to take measures to push back the for -- forces of Irag. This was done in a\nmagnificent fashion, by a -- special troops. The trouble is that an agreement was made\nwith Saddam Hussein, which didn\u2019t provide for any permanent occu -- occupation and\nwhich didn\u2019t provide for any war crimes trials, and which allowed him, over time, to\nre-institute a dictatorship of the first water. Now, that is utterly different than\nNuremberg, where we -- the allies that occupied the country, they not only conducted\nwar crimes trials, but they assisted the democratic elements, which were latent in\nGermany, to slowly develop and to come out. We did not have the wisdom to do that,\nas a country, and -- in connection with the United Nations at the time, which 1s a most\nregrettable thing, and yet it does deal with the thing that started out very well. An\ninconclusive truce. I suppose the next thing would be what happened in Yugoslavia,\nand -- beginning in 1991, when military forces of Serbia invaded Bosnia and Croatia,\nthere were atrocities committed on a huge scale and the fact that there had been a\nNuremberg trial certainly did help, with respect to the creation of the international\ncriminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The war crimes are being studied on a\ngreat -- a greatly improved scale, by a number of universities. The -- At American\nCollege of Law, here in Washington, it\u2019s a part of the American University, a\nprofessor by the name of Diane F. Orentlicher, O-r-e-n-t-l-1-c-h-e-r, is the director of\nthe war crimes research office, and she has led a group which has helped investigate\nthe details of what happened in Yugoslavia and passed them on to the tribunal,\nbecause the tribunal didn\u2019t have an adequate staff to do as good a job as it might. And\nthat very creditable work has been appreciated by several of the top prosecutors,\nincluding Louise Arbour, A-r-b-o-u-r, and a conference was held at the Washington\nCollege of Law School -- the Wa-Washington College of Law, and several of these\nrepresentatives, the very top ones, from the International War Crimes Tribunal in The\nHague, came and participated in that trial, which got fairly good publicity.",
        "Q: And you were involved in that?",
        "A: Yes, in a minor way. I -- I made one little talk and so forth, but thank goodness she\nhad trained and gotten a lot of people who are presently active. And so my\ncontribution was very limited, and should have been very limited, because they were\nall sa -- the top people there were all familiar with what had happened at Nuremberg\nand what I might say would be redundant and not too useful.",
        "Q: Are we moving quickly enough, do you think? I mean, we\u2019re -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m thinking\nof the year 2000 and really this is a new area of -- of law that\u2019s evolving.",
        "A: Well, what\u2019s evolving is not so much the law itself, because I think that\u2019s relatively\nclear. It\u2019s acceptance by many of the sovereign nations that\u2019s still not appropriate,\nnumber one, and number two, we don\u2019t have an international structure that\u2019s\nsufficiently powerful. The enactment of the International War Crimes Tribunal Treaty\nearlier this year at Rome, the Rome treaty, is a big step in the right direction, but look\nwhat year it 1s. It\u2019s the year 1998 and that\u2019s still -- that treaty still has to be ratified by\na number of leading nations, including the United States. So th-the -- these is -- this is\na very unpleasant area for someone like me, who would like to see that moving much\nmore rapidly.",
        "Q: How do you think we can change, most quickly, mankind\u2019s viewpoint on this? I\nmean, you went through a particular experience in your life, but how can that\neducation you had, that sensitivity be spread to more people?",
        "A: Well, it isn\u2019t just a question of spreading sensitivity to more people. If people are\npoor, if people are struggling to stay alive, they tend to be willing to follow a person\nwho has simple answers and who claims to have an enemy, particularly a neighbor or\na group or arace. And he drums up agitation about that and these poor, relatively\nuneducated people throng to his support. So the question of war crimes really gets\ndown partly to the world\u2019s ability to feed more people, on the one hand, and to curb\npopulation growth on the other, so we don\u2019t have these tremendous cases of people\nstruggling to stay alive, in terms of limited resources. And the question of educating\npeople who are struggling and fighting among themselves and having great\ndifficulties, to sit back and think and learn, is certainly a central difficulty.",
        "Q: Do you have great concern over the increasing discrepancy 1 -- within the United\nStates, of wealth?",
        "A: Yes, indeed, yes indeed. How many people are living just above the standard of\nliving or just below it? And here we are, supposedly in a very prosperous ca -- time,\nand yet there are just tremendous numbers of people who are ill-educated and don\u2019t\nhave the opportunity to forge ahead. The -- The remaining unequal treatment -- the\ncontinuing unequal treatment of women, is certainly a significant area where more\npeople have got to become concerned and to do something. What -- I\u2019m -- I -- My\nmain worry 1s -- is places like Africa, where you have civil wars on every other\ncountry going on, and undoubtedly war crimes or civilian crimes that are at such a\nbroad rate that they have to be classified as something of -- as violations of\ninternational law as well. These things have got to be addressed and more people have\ngot to get to work educating more people, who will do something about it.",
        "Q: When you refer to women, were you thinking of women within the United States,\nor really women worldwide in the -- the haves and have-nots of -- you know, the lot of\nwomen in the developing world?",
        "A: Well, I think Marian Wright Edelman, who\u2019s -- heads the Children\u2019s Defense Fund,\nand Hillary Rodham Clinton and a number of other people are trying to do something\nto a-advance the treatment and education of children, as well as to involve more\nwomen in the economic affairs and the political affairs of this nation. And, you know,\nmore power to them, but it\u2019s a long way to go. So many people are struggling from\nday to day that they don\u2019t have time to really sit down and think things through.",
        "Q: I wonder if I could ask, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m thinking of today as just one example of a day\nand with each day\u2019s news, I would suppose that you have an interesting viewpoint on\nit. And a -- I was thinking today of the election of a new political leader in Germany,\nand w-within the United States, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m thinking of the Lewinsky case. There may\nbe other things you want to comment on, but a -- I just think that your own life\nexperiences give you sort of informed views on things.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t care to become a great commentator at the age of 85 years, concerning\nall kinds of domestic affairs. I think o-others can do a lot better job of that than I can. I\nthink that the election in Germany, of the new Prime Minister is a -- an indication that\nthere is still more attention being paid in Europe to international affairs. His election I\nthink, like the election of Tony Blair in Great Britain, is la -- is more encouraging,\nbecause I think it will strengthen NATO and strengthen adherence to international law\nand treaties. I think it will lead to more crossing the boundaries with respect to\nreaching people who violate international law and commit atrocities. As I think I\npointed out before, the -- under Cole, as -- as well as I think under the new Premier,\nGermany will not be in the background, with respect to taking the lead on\nstrengthening international law and NATO.",
        "Q: How do you think your own views have changed with time?",
        "A: Nuremberg was an extension in international affairs of some of the ethical\nprinciples that had been ground into me for many years before that. So I didn\u2019t feel I\nwas moving into new territory with respect to decency and ethics, etcetera. I knew I\nwas moving in -- into new territory with respect to getting international structures\nmade, which could begin to deal with some of the things which were -- which need to\nbe handled on an international basis.",
        "Q: What are you proudest of?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m of course proudest of having served in Nuremberg for four years, and for\nhaving been editor in chief of the 15 Green volumes, called, \u201cTrials of War\nCriminals,\u201d before the Nuremberg military tribunals. I suppose that\u2019s what I\u2019m most\nproud of. I hope Pll similarly be proud of this book, but we have to see about that.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s part -- that\u2019s in a sense a natural progression. But did you have a sense\nthat -- that your parents were immensely proud of you and what you\u2019d accomplished?\nDid they understand the -- the significance, do you feel, at the time of their deaths?",
        "A: I think my parents were very proud of the fact that I recetved some recognition for\nmy work at Nuremberg, and that I had become a supergrade and a Deputy Chief\nCouncil, but we didn\u2019t talk too much about those kinds of things. We talked about m-\nmany more local things that were of importance in Wisconsin and my father and I took\nfishing trips in Canada, and we played golf together and enjoyed each other, but we\ndidn\u2019t engage in a tremendous na -- amount of discussion about my past. They\nobviously were proud of some of the things I\u2019d done, but we didn\u2019t talk much about it.",

        "Answer: I\u2019m Drexel A. Sprecher. I was a prosecutor at Nuremberg, and I\u2019ve been\nwriting a book on Nuremberg called, \u201cInside the Nuremberg Trial, A Prosecutor\u2019s\nComprehensive Account.\u201d I\u2019ve been working on it for nearly 10 years. It'll be\npublished in late November or December of this year, by the University Press of\nAmerica.",
        "A: Yes. I'd been with -- I\u2019d written a senior paper during my last year in college,\nconcerning the structure of national socialism, as we knew it at that time. And I read a\nfew books, particularly by professors from the University of Chicago. And the book\ngot a triple A, or the article got a tripi A -- triple A rating, and so I had an early interest\nin the Nazi regime, way back in 1933 and \u201834. Then I went off to the London School\nof Economics for a year and there were a number of refugees there, refugees from\nHitler, who -- with whom I became friends and went out to dinner with and parties and\nso on. So I got to form some friendships that way. Then, of course, came the war and I\nwas overseas for nearly [phone ringing]. Well, what was I saying?",
        "A: Oh, and I -- as I di -- was about to say, I traveled around Europe a bit and twice into\nNazi Germany. I saw the wedding of Herman Goering and Emma Sonamen on April\n10, 1935. I traveled into the -- the ruhr, because I\u2019d met a German young man in\nLondon, who offered to show me the good hoffnoseeter and to stay overnight in their\nhouse and so on. He did this knowing that I was anti-Nazi, but his family was rather\nre-reserved, because I don\u2019t think they wanted to -- they didn\u2019t want to take a chance\nof exposing themselves too much. Anyway, I also went out one evening with --\nsomewhere near Frankfurt, with the Reverend Stuart Herman, H-e-r-m-a-n, who later\nbecame the American pastor in Berlin. He ra -- He later wrote the book, \u201cIt\u2019s Your\nSouls We Want.\u201d And Stu Herman and I became lifelong friends, we\u2019re still\ncorresponding. After I came back from London, I went to school with -- I went to\nHarvard Law School for three years and my club won the moot court arguments, and\nthe case was based on a -- a -- a labor case. So when I went down to Washington, I\nwent to the Labor Board and they hired me in a half an hour, based on the fact that I\u2019d\ncontributed to this brief, which was on a point that was being argued before the\nSupreme Court. So that started four years of trial work. They used me as a trial lawyer.\nThen came the war and in 1942, I enlisted and within a month was again back in\nEngland, as a sergeant and later a warrant officer. I was in England for six months\nuntil the -- after the invasion of Africa by the allies. I then went to Iran, Algeria, as\nadministrative officer to the Inspector General. In that capacity we traveled all over\nNorth Africa, inspecting American army installations. I then -- An old friend of mine,\nGerhard VanArkel, who was the deputy head of the German labor branch of the Office\nof Strategic Services, OSS, came to Iran and asked me to come up and become the\ntraining officer for the labor desk in Algiers. I had a hard time getting away from my\nboss, but I finally managed and for some six months I trained Germans who had\nfought on the -- for the Loyalists in Spain. And th-these anti-Nazi Germans were being\ntrained to do parachute jumping, to do signals -- signal work so they could send out\nmessages after they\u2019d jumped into Germany, and so forth. Then I got a call from\nWashington to come and become the training officer at the central desk of OSS -- a\ncentral desk for labor and German operatives. And while I was there, Jack Ohly, O-h-\nl-y, whom I\u2019d known in Harvard Law School, saw me with my parachute wings and\nsaid, \u201cYou ha -- should come to work for the labor branch, helping us settle strikes and\ngathering labor for the short supply labor industries in the midwest.\u201d And I said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t think the OSS will release me.\u201d His boss was Colonel Brennan, who later\nbecame a Supreme Court Justice. Colonel Brennan called Arthur Goldberg, who was\nmy top boss and later a member of the Supreme Court and convinced him that I should\nperform this service. So, while that went on, the war finally came to an end and I came\nback to Washington with the idea of getting out of the army and returning to trial law\nfor the labor board. At that time, s -- r -- Justice Robert H. Jackson had been appointed\nto be the US Chief of Council for war crimes. He made a statement which was\nreleased to the press on June second, 1945. I was so struck by it\u2019s -- not only it\u2019s\nunderstanding of the w -- the way Hitler had come to power, but of it\u2019s determination\nto see that the Nazi regime was exposed from beginning to end that it\u2019s top leaders\nwere brought to justice and to an explanation of why they had committed the evils\nthey had committed. I didn\u2019t know how to get with Justice Jackson\u2019s group, because I\ndidn\u2019t know him at the time. So I went back to OSS and my old fraternity brother,\nRobert Thrun, T-h-r-u-n, was one of the three assistants to Wild Bill Donovan, the\nhead of OSS. General Wild Bill Donovan. And I had told him my dilemma, and he\nsays, \u201cWell, we can take care of that.\u201d So we went down to see the general council of\nOSS, who is another Donovan, a James Donovan. And Jim Donovan hired me within a\nhalf hour and for the next month or so, I busily engaged in studying in detail, the OSS\nreports on Nazi Germany, and they were terrific and very well done. And a professor\nby the name of Noiman had written a book on Nazi Germany -- just a second --\nNoiman had written a book called, \u201cBehemoth\u201d and I studied that in some detail and\nthen went in to see him. And I told him of my background and he said, \u201cWell, I -- Of\ncourse you\u2019re interested in the destruction of the trade unions by the Nazis.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cYes.\u201d He reached back and pulled out a German book that had been obtained by\nOSS through Switzerland. And, an appendix in that German book contained the order\nof Robert Ley, L-e-y, the later defendant at Nuremberg who committed suicide. And\nRobert Ley had written this order on how the SA -- the Storm Troopers and the SS\nwere to take over the trade unions. Well, this gave me the basis for not only a brief and\nfor a -- an eventual presentation to the tribunal, it also gave me leads to labor leader\nwith whom OSS was in touch, both in London and some of them in Germany. So I\nflew to London, Paris and then went into Germany to visit some of these trade union\nleaders. And I got affidavits from all of them and those affidavits were all introduced\nin the Nuremberg -- first Nuremberg trial. Neither one of the affiants was cross-\nexamined by the defense, they didn\u2019t question at all the -- the horrors that surrounded\nthat particular aspect of the Nazi regime. The result was that that made some\nimpression on Justice Jackson and later on others and the main deputy to Jackson,\nColonel Robert G. Storey, who later became head of the American Bar Association, he\nwas quite impressed by this work and said, \u201cYou must make some -- a presentation to\nthe tribunal,\u201d which of course delighted me. And he assigned me the case of a Baldur\nvon Schirach, the Hitler youth leader, who later became the Gauleiter of Vienna.",
        "A: Yes, as soon as I heard Justice Jack -- read Justice Jackson\u2019s report, I knew there\nwas where Sprecher should next go. And so I\u2019d determined to get there one way or the\nother, and it turned out to be a relatively easy path.",
        "A: I felt passionately about what the prosecution could achieve.",
        "A: The impact of the Nuremberg trial on American public opinion was considerable\nfor approximately one year. And then, with the coming of the -- after the war, with the\ncoming of the Cold War, American opinion and the journalists and so on, turned very\nrapidly toward discussions of the Cold War and the Nazis and the Nuremberg trials\nwere very much played down and not talked up for some time. I turned away to other\nthings here in America, and then got involved in some business affairs and then got\ninto Behavioral Science and teaching at George Washington University in Behavioral\nScience, which is a new field for me, but I really worked hard to get there and a couple\nof professors were kind of pushing me to do that. And then I began to get interested in\nNuremberg again, particularly after I th -- more or less retired, although I -- I didn\u2019t\ncompletely retire from training and consulting. But I slowed down a lot and I started to\nfirst work on Baldur von Schirach, the usel -- the youth leader, who -- wh-whom I had\nparticularly prosecuted, I\u2019d made the principal presentation against him. Then I\ndecided I\u2019d switch to something which was talked more about and that was Julius\nStreicher, the top Jew baiter of all time. But then, a lot was written about him, and so I\nstarted to move toward the idea of seeing if I couldn\u2019t contribute something different\nby writing the most elaborate book, the most comprehensive book on the Nuremberg\ntrials, one which would agree with most of the conclusions that many other writers\nhave made, but which would go beyond that, into the depth of the evidence, and\nparticularly quotations from the contemporaneous documents and from the testimony\nof the 20 -- of the 22 defendants who were at Nuremberg -- 21 defendants. The\nconsequence was that I finally developed a huge book, far too long for publication. It\nwas rejected by a number of commercial presses as being financially unbearable with\nit\u2019s length, and I think it was, especially for a commercial press. I then started\napproaching university presses and they all insisted that the book should be reduced\nsomewhat in size, so it\u2019d fit into two volumes, rather than three. And so I spent a\ncouple of years doing the difficult task of condensing. And finally, the university press\nof America, based on all the commendations that I had and their own scholarly\nresearch, decided that the book did have a special role to play and so I\u2019m -- was very\nglad to sign a contract with them and my book will be published in late December -- or\nlate No-November or early December.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s what distinguishes the book mainly. I don\u2019t attempt to be the final\npreacher about the Nazi regime, but I mean to make the account of the trial available,\nso that many scholars and a lot of others that are r-really interested and willing to\nspend some time, can really delve into the contemporaneous documents and\nparticularly into the motivations of the defendants. It\u2019s so false for people to think of\nthe Nuremberg in terms of defendants saying, \u201cI was following superior orders.\u201d\nThese defendants worked for years for the Nazis and superior orders defense applies\nmainly to lower people in the -- at the bottom of the hierarchy, who are told to go and\nshoot somebody or to commit some atrocious crime. The people at the top give their\nloyalties to a regime over a period of time, and they do it for many different reasons. It\nhas little to do with, I was ordered to do this by somebody. Most of the enthusiastically\nworked for the Nazi regime. Some of them, of course, had great reservations and some\nof them wept as they gave their testimony, being very sorry indeed, for having\nassociated themselves with such an evil course of conduct.\nbecause I\u2019m sure you feel that the very holding of the tribunal was immensely\nimportant in documenting what had gone on. I -- I was just reading about Benjamin\nFirense a-as just one small example of somebody gathering evidence. But I\u2019m sure we\ngained immensely through -- in many ways, through holding the tribunal.",
        "A: Yes, Professor Firense came to Nuremberg and when he find -- found out about the\nEinsatzgruppen, he immediately started to make some proposals to General Telford\nTaylor about his leading that -- the case against the main leaders of the\nEinsatzgruppen, the special task forces which killed millions -- a couple million Jews.\nAnd he did this with great ability and aplomb and he presented the case almost entirely\nwith documents in an -- less than a day and one half. The case went on for months\nafter that, by the defense, but the prosecutions case, in the shortest Nuremberg case of\nall -- the short -- the shortest case of the prosecution, was the one conducted by\nFirense. I became the head of several divisions, the subsequent proceedings division,\neconomics division, chief of the I. G. Farben trial team, and later, deputy chief council\nin charge of the official publications. At -- Firense had been offered the job, by Telford\nTaylor, of being director of publications. He turned it down in order to become head of\nthe Jewish successor restitution organization and he recovered from German firms tha\n-- who had employed slave labor and who\u2019d taken property from Jews, he recovered\nvast quantities of money for the people involved at -- the survivors of the -- of the\npeople that were involved or the -- some of the people who still survived. And to this\nday, he\u2019s one of my best friends.",
        "A: I\u2019ve talked to almost all the survivors, in fact, I was the chairman of the executive\ncommittee that put on three Nuremberg reunions, beginning in 1979, nine -- then\nanother 1991 and one in 1996 at the -- more or less at the 50th anniversary of the end\nof the first Nuremberg trial. And I\u2019m in touch with almost all these prosecutors. I\u2019ve\nsent them chapters from my forthcoming book. I\u2019ve asked for their criticisms and their\ncomments. I don\u2019t think anybody surviving knows as much about the people who were\nin Nuremberg than -- than I do. I don\u2019t think so, because of my continued work on this\nsubject. I have constantly wanted to be in touch with them.",
        "A: Oh yes, I -- You don\u2019t do anything as significant as the Nuremberg trial was, in\nreviewing a modern dictatorship, without that having a tremendous effect emotionally,\non you. I think the importance of the trial is much more on what it revealed than in the\nfact that it punished 19 defendants, and acquitted three. The effect of the trial later on,\nwas very mixed. For some years, it had very little effect, and then as war crimes were\ncommitted in ce-central Europe, particularly in Yugoslavia, and then later in Rwanda,\nworld attention turned much more to what international law was, that international law\nwas being violated, and that there was no established structure to deal with these\ncrimes, and that no court was available which was -- had jurisdiction to handle these\nmatters. So then you started to get the foundation laid and an international treaty\nsigned to create the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, and later on the United Nations also\ncreated the Rwanda tribunal. The Rwanda tribunal has had a great number of\ndifficulties. It was poorly staffed, poorly financed and was not well taken -- it was not\nwell administrated. On the contrary, I think the -- the beginnings of the Yugoslav war\ncrimes tribunal are very promising. They do not have the number of contemporaneous\ndocuments or the great amount of contemporaneous documents which we had in the\nNuremberg trial. This means they have to rely much more on investigations and\ninterrogating witnesses and that\u2019s a much more difficult job to do when you don\u2019t have\nall the knowledge that we had about the detailed operation of the Nazi regime.",
        "A: International opinion does not regard them as essential to scoring the up events and\nil-illuminating the background and the nature what went on in the Balkans that led to\nsome of these things. They aren\u2019t international opinion on the whole, is not in the same\nposition of knowledge with respect to what\u2019s going on. And you don\u2019t have the same\npush, the same public demand. And the tremendous number of countries are so\ntroubled by their own internal problems that they have not pushed the United Nations\nor the established tribunal to do more, more quickly, and they haven\u2019t given it as much\nfunding and -- as they should. There are some very able people that have gone into the\nleadership of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal and I wish them well. I think that they\nare going to make a -- a big contribution in the long run.",
        "A: I was asked to make a number of speeches at conferences of one kind and another\nand of course I was instrumental with health and my wife and others in putting on\nthese three Nuremberg reunions. And this took up a lot of time and -- it meant that,\nhowever, that we were able to call back my former associates in Nuremberg and keep\nin touch with them. Nuremberg is not something that wears out of your life with time.\nIt -- It becomes a -- an area where you think about it at night and you think about it in\nthe morning and you wonder what can the world do, what can -- how can public\nopinion be advanced so that they\u2019re willing to reduce the rights of national sovereignty\nto a greater extent and to make the international law really international and\nenforceable by international agency. There are a tremendous number of isolationists\nand people who raise their hands and say, \u201cWe don\u2019t want any foreigners in a position\nwhere they can possibly judge Americans.\u201d There\u2019s a certain appeal in that for citizens\nwho are not too well informed, and it\u2019s regrettable.",
        "A: No, I think things are getting somewhat better. I don\u2019t think the pace 1s nearly as\ngreat as it should be and certainly not as great as I would like to have it.",
        "A: By more education in international affairs at a younger age, for younger people. By\nhaving more of the -- the books that have been written on Nuremberg circulated more\nwidely, building up interest in -- in a broader public education, so that people are more\naware of --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Oh yes indeed. The fact that I studied in London and I met many refugees from\nHitler, that I traveled into Germany while Hitler was in -- in power, in 1934 and 1935,\nthe fact that I worked with anti-Nazi Germans in the Office of Strategic Service, just\nleft an -- an indelible imprint on my -- my whole life.",
        "A: It had very little influence. I came from a middle class, lower upper class, small\ntown family. My father was a banker. He\u2019d been president of the Wisconsin Bar\nAssociation and I don\u2019t think he paid very much attention to the Nazi regime until I\nbegan to become active in my thinking about the Nazi regime and told him something\nabout it. He was certainly never sympathetic to the Nazi regime that I know of, but he\nwas not active with respect to international affairs.",
        "A: Well, you touch on a very important point, not so much because of the moral values\nthat my parents had, but they sent me to a small college my first year, North Central\nCollege, and there I met a minister by the name of Ralph Marion Holdiman, who was\na very active Christian Socialist and his ethical values were very stretched into the\npolitical area and by the time I was done with that first year away at college, I was -- I\nwas beginning to see the roots of Fascism in Germany and of course then, when I went\nto the University of Wisconsin, Hitler came to power during my junior year, and a\nnumber of professors played this up as one might expect, because it was certainly a\ntremendously forbidding development in international affairs. One of my professors\nwas Selac Perlman, who was the chief historian of labor developments in this country.\nAnd I can remember one day in a seminar that he burst into tears as someone\nmentioned what was happening in Nazi Germany. And it was a very moving moment\nand I can still remember it very well. Max Carl Otto was a -- an American of German\ndescent who was very anti-Nazi and he was also one of my heroes at the University of\nWisconsin. I was asked to run the conference on war at the University of Wisconsin,\nshortly after Hitler came to power, and we gathered leaders, including people from\nmilitary academies and professors from both Wisconsin and other universities, some\nministers, like Re-Reverend Alf da -- Alfred W. Swan and others and they made talks\nand there was questions by the students and there were some demonstrations about\nhow important the whole thing was, by some of the students. And that put me on the\nbandwagon.",
        "A: Coinose.",
        "A: Oh it -- I -- I made a number of f-friends at the University of Wisconsin, who had\nstrong ethical feelings. Catholics, Protestants and Jews. And a number of us got\ntogether and got the idea that if we held a number of meetings, it might help make a\ncontribution to fighting this -- this racism and contribute to the broader education of\nstudents. One of them was Beverly Rabinoff, who was a Badger Beauty. She was one\nof the five women elected to that noble category because of her good looks. There\nwere an -- a number of other people, George Dugger, Bill Blaiser, who were Aryans\nwho were very active in this movement and we called it, \u201cIn Common,\u201d which was\nfrom the Greek word meaning in common -- coinose. We held meetings. We didn\u2019t\nallow people to join Coinose unless they had at least a B average and unless they\u2019d\ndone something on the campus. Well that made it kind of a distinct group and people\nkind of looked at us in a different way than if we\u2019d just said, \u201cHey, everybody can\njoin Coinose.\u201d And it turned out to be a very useful thing, they got a ver -- very great\namount attention, including by the president of the university.",
        "A: Oh yes. There was quite a bit of segregation at the universities back in the 1930\u2019s\nand there were Jewish fraternities and non-Jewish fraternities and non-Jewish\nsororities and so on. And the -- there was very little mixing of -- inside the frater -- the\nsorority or fraternity houses of Jews and Gentiles. So Beverly Rabinoff, being a good\nfriend of mine, I said to her one day, \u201cBeverly, ve been asked to go to the Tri-Delt\nHouse,\u201d -- the -- one of the sororities, \u201cfor a party. And I\u2019m wondering if you would\nlike to be my guest?\u201d And she said, \u201cOh, that\u2019ll upset things a great deal.\u201d And I said,\n\u201cWell, why not? After all, you\u2019re a Badger Beauty, and if you go in there, we\u2019ll cause\n-- with me -- we\u2019ll cause quite a sensation.\u201d So we ap -- walked into the sorority house\nat the time of that party and people\u2019s jaws dropped. However, within minutes,\neverybody wanted to dance with Beverly Rabinoff. All the men wanted to dance with\nher and I was left alone throughout most of the evening while other people danced\nwith Beverly Rabinoff. So that was a small contribution to integration.",
        "A: Well, in my fraternity, which had no Jews, Phi Gamma Delta, I got el -- Edward\nEllsworth Ross, who was a former Phi Gam to come and talk and I urged him to talk\nabout the segregation problem and things like that, which he did. And so there was\nsome things like that. The dean of students, a fellow by the name of Holt, H-o-I-t, his\nson was in our fraternity. We went to his house and -- and the overall dean was Scott\nGoodenite. Bill Blaiser, who was the head of the student union, and I, went up to see\nhim and told him that we were about to try something, that we wanted him to know\nwhat it was. Some Jews had gone onto the pier that stuck out into Lake Mindoda, of\none of the fraternity houses -- I forget the name of it right now. And a fellow by the\nname of Max Knecht, K-n-e-c-h-t, who was the boxing champion of the big 10, went\nout with a couple of his fraternity brothers and threw these Jews in the lake. And this,\nof course, made a lot of newspaper publicity. Blaiser -- Bill Blaiser and I didn\u2019t want it\nto die at that point, so we went to Goodenite and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going down to see --\u201d\nBlaiser was over six feet tall and so was I, and together we weren\u2019t too afraid of Max\nKnecht. So we went down to the fraternity and asked to see him and he blustered out\nand said, \u201cWhat are you liberals doing here?\u201d We said, \u201cWe\u2019ve come to tell you that if\nyou were to repeat what you did before, we can give you the straight word that you\u2019d\nbe ostracized from the university and that we would gather a group of people and\nthrow you in the lake just to show that we wouldn\u2019t take this kind of thing any more.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cRrrr,\u201d and turned around, banged the door and left. But Max Knecht\nnever threw any more Jews in the lake.",
        "A: Very conservative. And -- But they didn\u2019t have any strong pred -- prejudices about\nrace, as far as I know. We only had two Jewish families in the little town I lived in and\nboth of them patronized my father\u2019s bank. And I bought my shoes there and things like\nthat.",
        "A: Well, I became very active in politics after I returned from Nuremberg. Up to that\ntime, I had been an active Democrat in the sense of making a few contributions to the\nDemocratic party and congressional campaign committees and so on, but I hadn\u2019t been\nvery active. But when I came back from Nuremberg, my wife was also an active\nDemocrat and I settled out in Potomac, Maryland area, which 1s largely an area of\nrelatively wealthy people. And a lot of brainy people, a lot of intellectuals who had\ndone well. So we formed -- I became precinct chairman and we also formed a -- a\ngroup out there, which was calculated to give talks about -- in the churches and\notherwise, about anti-Semitism and -- and so forth and the local pastors were all for\nthis. Reverend Gloid Alice in the Methodist church was one of our great supporters\nand so forth. So, yes, this did have an e-effect and I went down to the hill with the idea\nof becoming an assistant to somebody that was helping on small business affairs, since\nI was running a couple of small businesses. A land development company and a\nconstruction company out in Potomac. And I met Senator Sparkman, head of the\nSenate small business committee, and Rite Patman, the head of the House small\nbusiness committee. I went in to s -- They said I should go see Paul Butler, the\nnational chairman of the Democratic party and I did and he established the small\nbusiness division of the Democrat national committee, which was composed of me and\nmy secretary, no more. And we developed a lot of literature, which was broadly\ncirculated to the state parties, county and local people, concerning small business\nissues. So that was my first move, actively into politics. About a year later, after the\n1956 election, I was back to doing what I had been doing before, someone said -- Paul\nButler, the national chairman, was forming a new s-structures to the Democratic\nnational committee, which was going to pull together the political organization and\nbuild up more precincts and ex-extend the amount of public relations that the national\ncommittee was going to have with the local organizations between elections. So I went\nin to see Paul Butler and he immediately said, \u201cWell, I\u2019d like to hire you, but I have to\nconsult with the advisory committee on political organization.\u201d So I flew out to\nMichigan to see former congressman, Neal Staebler, S-t-a-e-b-l-e-r, who was the state\nchairman of the Democratic party in Michigan. And he introduced me to the Michigan\nleaders, and we sat down and had a dinner together and they queried me and they came\nback with the recommendation that I be made deputy chairman of the national\ncommittee -- deputy chairman for political organization. And we then hired a total of\nsix regional representatives, each one of whom had six to eight states, and he -- they\ntraveled around, building up ideas of better Democratic organization, and not trying to\nbe pushy, but ta -- get more people involved, hold more meetings and they would be\navailable to see what was happening in another state, to help -- still a different state, ye\n-- other notions and ideas and try new things out and things like that.",
        "A: Not particularly. It was a very friendly discussion between active Democrats. And\nof course, they were interested in the fact that I\u2019d been a prosecutor at Nuremberg and\nthat I had edited the official volumes on the later 12 trials, the so-called Green series\nand I think they were kind of glad to have me come aboard.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it -- I don\u2019t think it had much direct role, it -- Nuremberg exposures of\nthings that were against democracy and the dictatorship, of course, contributed to\ndemocracy and I often mentioned the Fascist dictatorship in my discussions, naturally,\nbecause they\u2019d been such a big part of my life, earlier.",
        "A: Well, we were asked to come to the Democratic National Convention and to make\na presentation to the whole convention. So Paul Butler introduced me and I said, fac --\nmany of you people here, that are active at the state level, know what has been done by\nthe political organization wing of the Democratic National Committee. Well, I want to\njust -- just tell you a few things that we have done and will be doing and to ha -- allow\nyou to ask questions, encourage your questions and then I want to have each of the\nregional representatives talk to you and so on. So, up here, in a little book that contains\nthe proceedings of the Democratic National Committee convention in 1959, you'll\nfind about 10 pages where we spoke for perhaps altogether, up to nearly an hour.",
        "A: Yes. Do you know, I -- I have a hard time now, figuring out what the roles were\nthat we most talked about. I think they generally involved the idea of more social\nreform that would benefeet-fit people. We had a -- a senior citizens group as well and\nwe had an agriculture group, a farmer\u2019s group. We had a labor group, and they were\navailable to help push democratic ideas through the democratic digest and through\nspecial releases and through the many speeches that we helped influence.",
        "A: Well, yes, but I -- I think it\u2019s rather difficult for me to go into all the ethical and\npolitical implications of that time back there, three years before 1960. We helped elect\nPresident Kennedy and we were delighted with that. I can still remember when he was\nleaving the platform in -- at the 1960 convention and some poor photographer had\ngotten off to the side and -- and had missed him, so I flagged him down as he was\nwalking across the exit ramp, and he stopped and waved and this fellow took a picture.\nWell, little things like that are those that stick out in your mind as you look back. The\nfact that you -- we had a big conference in Colorado and -- and there was a head table\nof about 17. The head of the party in Colorado had the central seat and Kennedy sat\nnext to him, in the middle. I sat in seat 17, on the very end and I said nothing, because\nI wasn\u2019t called on to say anything. We\u2019d -- We weren\u2019t -- We didn\u2019t -- The\n[indecipherable] organization side of the Democratic National Committee encouraged\nother people to be active and talking and doing things. We were not the public\nrelations side of the committee, which created speeches and things like that.",
        "A: Yes, it -- some people have said that\u2019s -- without our work, that Kennedy wouldn\u2019t\nhave been elected. Well, I think that\u2019s problematical, but in all events, we were\ncertainly a large contribution.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Well, aft -- right after the first trial, the general assembly of the United Nations,\nenacted a declaration on international law and affirming the principles of Nuremberg.\nI\u2019m not sure that that made a tremendous efe -- had a tremendous effect on the -- large\nnumbers of people, but it did contribute to those who were concerned with\ninternational law and with strengthening the United Nations and international law. The\nNuremberg trial set a precedent for trials held immediately after the first trial. In\nNuremberg there were 12 other trials, a total of about 190 other people were tried.\nThen there were trials in the British war zone. There were trials in the French war\nzone. We didn\u2019t hear about any trials in the Soviet zone. The Soviet representative at\nthe first Nuremberg trial, left Nuremberg the -- just after th-the tribunal made it\u2019s\ndecision in the first trial and they never associated with the later trials, at their election.\nHowever, they did allow our representatives to carry on investigations in the Soviet\nzone and they were cooperative in that respect. About two years later, during the later\ntrials, a press contingent of Soviet journalists, did come to Nuremberg for one or two\ndays and I recall sitting in with General Taylor as he was asked questions by them.\nAnd of course, we tried to turn it around and ask them a few questions as to why there\nwere -- had been some trials that we knew about in the eastern zone of Germany, and\nthey were rather embarrassed by that. Toward the end of the trials, the Genocide\nConvention was enacted as a treaty and it is of course, since been ratified by almost all\nnations. it took the United States quite some time to recognize it, because again some\npeople, raising the banner of sovereignty were worried that the Genocide Convention\nwould give other people the right to look into what was happening in the United\nStates. The declaration of -- of human rights by the General Assembly was\n[indecipherable] related to the rights we ex -- expounded at Nuremberg. And Eleanor\nRoosevelt at that time, said, \u201cThis is a fine declaration on human rights, but without\nsome legal obligations, will governments be inspired to see that these rights are\nenforced?\u201d And of course, that was a very incisive comment. The -- As I\u2019ve\nmentioned, the international law committee of the United Nations did reaffirm the\nNuremberg principles and this led -- after we left Germany, this helped lead to a\ntremendous number of trials of Germans, by the German courts. This is something\nmost people don\u2019t know anything about. There\u2019s a whole book on it by a gentleman by\nthe name of Rukerle, who was -- who was in charge of keeping track of these war\ncrimes trials. And there\u2019s been a tremendous number of books published in Germany,\nwhich deal with the Nazi regime and an American photographer by the name of Ray\nDaddario, has cooperated with the German authorities in publishing a number of\nphotographs concerning the Nazi regime and the Nuremberg trial, and these have sold\nvery well. In Berlin there are at least two striking exhibitions that refer back to the\nNazi period. One is in the old Reichstag building, and there they have a photographic\nexhibit that must be a half block long, where you walk along and you get pictures of\nthe development of the Nazi regime, including it\u2019s horrors. A little ways away from\nthat, there is a -- what\u2019s called a Platzenzae memo-memorial. And that\u2019s a very\nstriking memorial. It has a -- a marble wall which says, in German, \u201cTo the victims of\nFascism.\u201d A little ways away, there\u2019s a circular statue -- there\u2019s a statue with a -- a\nbase which is circular and it has arrows which point in the direction of various\nconcentration camps, Auschwitz, Flossenburg, Buchenwald. And it\u2019s very striking,\nyou can\u2019t think as you walk by that, without realizing that in each of these\nconcentration camps, hundreds of thousands and in the case of Auschwitz, millions of\npeople were killed. The German Minister of Justice has spoken out about the\nsignificance of the Nuremberg trials. There\u2019s been a tremendous turnaround in\nGerman thinking, partly as a result of the Nuremberg trials. Course, one of the striking\nthings about the Vietnam war is that a couple of our officers also went on a binge of\nkilling Vietnamese citizens, the kind of thing that can happen when an ideologically\nmotivated person is not constrained and 1s willing to kill people, certainly outside the\nlaw. This led to the conviction of Lieutenant William Calley, C-a-l-l-e-y, a junior\nofficer in the US army. So this is one case where we\u2019ve applied international law to\none of our own officers, which is a good thing. The greatest thing that\u2019s happened by\nway of specific action, took place under the administration of President George Bush,\nafter Saddam Hussein and forces of Iraq had invaded Kuwait --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yes, in 1990, after Saddam Hussein invaded Iraq, George Bush -- President George\nBush, after consultation with a number of people that were leaders in the United\nNations and the Secretary General of NATO, he ordered military forces of the United\nStates to take measures to push back the for -- forces of Irag. This was done in a\nmagnificent fashion, by a -- special troops. The trouble is that an agreement was made\nwith Saddam Hussein, which didn\u2019t provide for any permanent occu -- occupation and\nwhich didn\u2019t provide for any war crimes trials, and which allowed him, over time, to\nre-institute a dictatorship of the first water. Now, that is utterly different than\nNuremberg, where we -- the allies that occupied the country, they not only conducted\nwar crimes trials, but they assisted the democratic elements, which were latent in\nGermany, to slowly develop and to come out. We did not have the wisdom to do that,\nas a country, and -- in connection with the United Nations at the time, which 1s a most\nregrettable thing, and yet it does deal with the thing that started out very well. An\ninconclusive truce. I suppose the next thing would be what happened in Yugoslavia,\nand -- beginning in 1991, when military forces of Serbia invaded Bosnia and Croatia,\nthere were atrocities committed on a huge scale and the fact that there had been a\nNuremberg trial certainly did help, with respect to the creation of the international\ncriminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The war crimes are being studied on a\ngreat -- a greatly improved scale, by a number of universities. The -- At American\nCollege of Law, here in Washington, it\u2019s a part of the American University, a\nprofessor by the name of Diane F. Orentlicher, O-r-e-n-t-l-1-c-h-e-r, is the director of\nthe war crimes research office, and she has led a group which has helped investigate\nthe details of what happened in Yugoslavia and passed them on to the tribunal,\nbecause the tribunal didn\u2019t have an adequate staff to do as good a job as it might. And\nthat very creditable work has been appreciated by several of the top prosecutors,\nincluding Louise Arbour, A-r-b-o-u-r, and a conference was held at the Washington\nCollege of Law School -- the Wa-Washington College of Law, and several of these\nrepresentatives, the very top ones, from the International War Crimes Tribunal in The\nHague, came and participated in that trial, which got fairly good publicity.",
        "A: Yes, in a minor way. I -- I made one little talk and so forth, but thank goodness she\nhad trained and gotten a lot of people who are presently active. And so my\ncontribution was very limited, and should have been very limited, because they were\nall sa -- the top people there were all familiar with what had happened at Nuremberg\nand what I might say would be redundant and not too useful.",
        "A: Well, what\u2019s evolving is not so much the law itself, because I think that\u2019s relatively\nclear. It\u2019s acceptance by many of the sovereign nations that\u2019s still not appropriate,\nnumber one, and number two, we don\u2019t have an international structure that\u2019s\nsufficiently powerful. The enactment of the International War Crimes Tribunal Treaty\nearlier this year at Rome, the Rome treaty, is a big step in the right direction, but look\nwhat year it 1s. It\u2019s the year 1998 and that\u2019s still -- that treaty still has to be ratified by\na number of leading nations, including the United States. So th-the -- these is -- this is\na very unpleasant area for someone like me, who would like to see that moving much\nmore rapidly.",
        "A: Well, it isn\u2019t just a question of spreading sensitivity to more people. If people are\npoor, if people are struggling to stay alive, they tend to be willing to follow a person\nwho has simple answers and who claims to have an enemy, particularly a neighbor or\na group or arace. And he drums up agitation about that and these poor, relatively\nuneducated people throng to his support. So the question of war crimes really gets\ndown partly to the world\u2019s ability to feed more people, on the one hand, and to curb\npopulation growth on the other, so we don\u2019t have these tremendous cases of people\nstruggling to stay alive, in terms of limited resources. And the question of educating\npeople who are struggling and fighting among themselves and having great\ndifficulties, to sit back and think and learn, is certainly a central difficulty.",
        "A: Yes, indeed, yes indeed. How many people are living just above the standard of\nliving or just below it? And here we are, supposedly in a very prosperous ca -- time,\nand yet there are just tremendous numbers of people who are ill-educated and don\u2019t\nhave the opportunity to forge ahead. The -- The remaining unequal treatment -- the\ncontinuing unequal treatment of women, is certainly a significant area where more\npeople have got to become concerned and to do something. What -- I\u2019m -- I -- My\nmain worry 1s -- is places like Africa, where you have civil wars on every other\ncountry going on, and undoubtedly war crimes or civilian crimes that are at such a\nbroad rate that they have to be classified as something of -- as violations of\ninternational law as well. These things have got to be addressed and more people have\ngot to get to work educating more people, who will do something about it.",
        "A: Well, I think Marian Wright Edelman, who\u2019s -- heads the Children\u2019s Defense Fund,\nand Hillary Rodham Clinton and a number of other people are trying to do something\nto a-advance the treatment and education of children, as well as to involve more\nwomen in the economic affairs and the political affairs of this nation. And, you know,\nmore power to them, but it\u2019s a long way to go. So many people are struggling from\nday to day that they don\u2019t have time to really sit down and think things through.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t care to become a great commentator at the age of 85 years, concerning\nall kinds of domestic affairs. I think o-others can do a lot better job of that than I can. I\nthink that the election in Germany, of the new Prime Minister is a -- an indication that\nthere is still more attention being paid in Europe to international affairs. His election I\nthink, like the election of Tony Blair in Great Britain, is la -- is more encouraging,\nbecause I think it will strengthen NATO and strengthen adherence to international law\nand treaties. I think it will lead to more crossing the boundaries with respect to\nreaching people who violate international law and commit atrocities. As I think I\npointed out before, the -- under Cole, as -- as well as I think under the new Premier,\nGermany will not be in the background, with respect to taking the lead on\nstrengthening international law and NATO.",
        "A: Nuremberg was an extension in international affairs of some of the ethical\nprinciples that had been ground into me for many years before that. So I didn\u2019t feel I\nwas moving into new territory with respect to decency and ethics, etcetera. I knew I\nwas moving in -- into new territory with respect to getting international structures\nmade, which could begin to deal with some of the things which were -- which need to\nbe handled on an international basis.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m of course proudest of having served in Nuremberg for four years, and for\nhaving been editor in chief of the 15 Green volumes, called, \u201cTrials of War\nCriminals,\u201d before the Nuremberg military tribunals. I suppose that\u2019s what I\u2019m most\nproud of. I hope Pll similarly be proud of this book, but we have to see about that.",
        "A: I think my parents were very proud of the fact that I recetved some recognition for\nmy work at Nuremberg, and that I had become a supergrade and a Deputy Chief\nCouncil, but we didn\u2019t talk too much about those kinds of things. We talked about m-\nmany more local things that were of importance in Wisconsin and my father and I took\nfishing trips in Canada, and we played golf together and enjoyed each other, but we\ndidn\u2019t engage in a tremendous na -- amount of discussion about my past. They\nobviously were proud of some of the things I\u2019d done, but we didn\u2019t talk much about it.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nConclusion of Interview\n"
