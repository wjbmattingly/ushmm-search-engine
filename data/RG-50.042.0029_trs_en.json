        "HELEN WATERFORD\nMarch 12, 1992\nBeep.\nMrs. Waterford, can you describe for me how rescue efforts worked in Holland, and in general how\nthat differed from other countries in Europe if you can address that.\nI know only after the war what had been. During the war, you practically knew nothing because if\nyou went to the places who were supposed to know, you heard only you shou--you should do what\nyou are told. We don't know what happened. We do not know what you should do. We cannot\ngive you any answer because we do not know. This was the official. Uh, but private was, I don't\nknow when that, when that start, but I do know that very close friends of, of ours came to us in um\n1942 in July, that they had a, a um, a few people who offered to help. And this was a small church\nof blue collar workers who needed their goal to help Jewish people who needed it, to take in, in\ntheir homes as far as possible, and we naturally said we do because by that time we were already\nordered to come to the uh train on the 15th of July, 1942 at night, and we would report would be\nbrought East, that was on this letter, to work. So, this didn't, we didn't like that sort expression\nwhat was supplied in the uh, the Jewish the Jewish people who were in charge of that didn't help us\nat all, so we were very happy to accept the help of this group, and they did help. We have the first\nthankful to those people.\nWhat did you and your husband decide to do? Explain to me about how big your family was, and\nhow you, how much you knew of what was going on, what fear you had, and then what you\ndecided to do with your child.\nNow we uh we had no idea. Like everybody else. We only knew since we came originally from\nGermany that practically all the people who had lived in Germany, Jewish people, were not there\nanymore. They were taken, they were taken by train or, or whatever, and nobody had ever heard\nanything from them when they were gone, and nobody knew where they were. So this was already\nenough for us to decide that we would do anything, and take any help. The first thing we did was\nthat my husband uh discussed with a doctor if he could get his um his um now I, I don't know the\nword anymore, uh removed appendix...yes, his appendix removed even that appendix was fine,\nand when he woke up in the hospital, there were more lost appendixes, so this would since we had\nto be at, at the 15th at the station, that was a few days before war?? so we had time with the doctor",
        "thing uh, uh that this telling what he had done, uh, took two weeks time and then we should come\nagain. So, in this two weeks we, we were using because um, I had heard that the Jewish Council\nwas hi-hiring people for all kinds of work, and all those people were um on a piece of paper at that\nmoment free of deportation. Our family was my husband, our little girl which was at that time for\nyears old, and at me, so we decided to do all that and I, I went around and I got a job which made\nus all uh available not to go, and we could stay, the, the time, there was no limit. So, uh, he, my\nhusband came home, and we thought maybe with the job I have, it would be, we would be helped\nat the time. I worked at the, at uh, at uh old people's home in the kitchen, and um, I worked every\nday, and I cooked for 40 people. I liked it, I liked the work, and it seemed to be safe. And one\nmorning after about 6 weeks working, I came at 7 0 clock, and the doors were open, and all the\npeople in there were gone. Was a terrible, terrible frightening room, every room was looked for\nprobably for valuable things, I don't know. I saw what had happened, that most of the people wh,\nwho couldn't walk and were taken in, must have been taken in -------, I didn't be-believe what, any\nword anymore, I run out and run home, and I knew what I, what we had was not safe, the piece of\npaper.\nDescribe to me what you and your husband decided to do with your daughter.\nThis same man who came just, I talked about before, which came just after that has happened to us,\nhe um, he told us that our friends, and our friends told us --------also, they had a daughter, she was\nabout 5, 6 months older than ours, and we were, the mother of the child, we were friends from\nschool in Germany, so we all knew each other very well, and they had, they, they told us that they\nhad made the decision, and the child is already gone, and he and she and his mother who lived with\nthem was um gone. They would be going that ---------------lead into wherever they were safe,\nwhere they were supposed to be. We never, we didn't hear anything, and that was all right. We,\nthis meant that we will try that for you too if you want to give up your child because three of you\ncannot be in one part. You have to give your child to somebody, and uh, a day later you said he\nhad somebody, as we found out much, much later, that was his sister, this man's sister, that was Joe\nFishman, he's still altve, and uh, that's where they, where they took our child, and they were very,\nvery helpful that they got the bed and the toys and the clothes and everything there already, that\nwhen she would come -------------- foreigners, strangers. And then he was trying to look for us for\na place, and that took a little longer, maybe a month, until we found the first place to go, so called\nunderground. It was never underground, it was always in an attic.\nDescribe what your daughter knew about hiding, and how difficult it was for you to part with her.",
        "My daughter didn't know she was hiding. As I said, she was not five yet, and um, we, my husband\nand I had more than a year ago decided, since we knew of children transports from Germany to\nEngland, maybe that would be one day possible, so we would give away our child anyplace we\nknew where she would be welcome, and why should she maybe not have to die when she could can\nlive a good life, we have a family in the United States who were only too happy to take her, so we\ndecided that we that to make it to her for her hard not to kiss her anymore, not to have her too close\nphysically, both of us did that, and uh and it has helped her because when, when we had the, the\ntime that she had to leave, and we told her she was a outgoing child, she would uh go and visit a, a\ncouple, and they have no children, and they would so much like to see her, and she, she was and\nshe always liked to visit people, so when those other people came, they talked to her, they too, and\nthey came on a Sunday afternoon, and uh we didn't know their name, we didn't know where they\nlived, and she saw them, and we told her \"These, those are the friends who would like you to see\nwhere they're living. They, they have no children. And she went with we too, we went with her to\nthe, to the streetcar, and we said goodbye, like that, no kissing, nothing. Then comes afterwards,\nand this is very personal, and uh, it's ridiculous to say that it's difficult because it never changes. It\nnever changes for all those years because it was '45 before we saw her, before I saw her.\nBut you rescued her.\nIn that way, I rescued her, yes. We rescued her, my husband and I we did that. There was no\narguing about it, this was just one way to do. If we want her to live.\nWe have to reload.\nBeep.\nI'd like you to describe for me what it was like to live in hiding. How restricted you were, how you\nfelt, were you afraid?\nTo be in hiding, I don't think that anybody can be trained for that because every, every situation,\nsince you are in people's homes, is different. So the first place where we were was uh a bungalow\nwhere downstairs a young couple with two small children was living, and on the 2nd floor, the\nmother of one of them, and she was alone, and she cooked for us, and we had to bring beds, metal\nbeds, they had to bring them there because they didn't have beds for us and we were in the attic.\nThis was the situation, we came and they were a kind of primitive people, but, they, they meant\nwell, and, and they got some money that was helping them too, but uh, we would, we would have",
        "stayed the, the uh, there was really no connection to talk about with, with this old, now I say old\nlady, she wasn't as old as I am now, and uh she wasn't uh, she wasn't interested that we were there,\nbut uh, it came the -------------------when there was a holiday, and there was a little special meat or\nso available that we didn't even get it. But that was not important. Important was that all of the\nsudden, they said to Joe Fishch, that they cannot stand it anymore to have those two people around,\nand he has to get them, us out the same day, and not the next. So, Joe, that was, Joe was a hard-\nworking man, he did this, he found places, sometimes, not, not the right ones, and we only could\nstay there a day or two because the people who were hiding us got scared because they were so o-\no-openly in the newspapers, \"He who hides Jews will be treated like the Jews.\" It didn't say a word\nabout killing or anything because at that time we did not know what was happening. We did not\nknow. It was known to uh the British and the Americans. Governments. But we, the people, did\nnot know. And um, so we, we, we came to places where we were very short, some of them maybe\nwith 4 weeks and then they got scared, and some of them was very, very lovely people, but they\ncouldn't work anymore, they were so, so much afraid. Until we got to Holland??? and uh, we were\nthere in a bungalow where there was a mother with three teenage daughters. Was nice and roomy\nbldg, and we had in the attic a small room. We were there for a long time, till the end until we were\nfound, and we were very uh we could be alone in in our room, and my husband, for the time we\nlived there, more than a year, he was writing, writing books, always a pencil, and in school, with\nthose blue school, blue school papers. I have all those things but uh there is not too much interest\nin there because he wrote only about what he would wish for the country, Holland, he felt very\nclose to Holland, and um, the whole world and the hu, hu, hu the human, the humans, what they\nwould do when the war was, the war when the war would be over, and he was sure already for\nyears that uh Germany would lose, and even when it looked on certain times that it was impo--\nimpossible because uh they were um practically in all of Germany, in all of Europe, every country\nbes, besides two or three, were not under the Germans, but he said the Germans will lose, and from\nthis view out, he had articles about uh economics, about religions, about anything you can think of,\nphilosophy, former philosophy, and help was that the people who were helping us to get to the\nplace, that every two weeks, one came, and here the whole list of books he wanted for his writing,\nand they all came, every two weeks when we also got our food um slips, how much the food was\nfor any person in Holland, how much they could have, and all the people who were underground\nwere supported and were helped with those coupons, because every month the uh, the places where\nthey were uh, where the people could pick it up themselves, they go in and they took out what they\nneeded, and it was every month another place, and they never found who did this for more than two\nyears--was really remarkable, and the woman who had us there, she, she needed, otherwise she\ncouldn't have fed us at all because everything which was edible, everything needed a piece of paper\nand a coupon. At that time I was still smoking, and I was making from one cigarette, I think three",
        "new ones, and uh so uh, and I we got, we got a package, I think, well my husband didn't smoke, so\nit wasn't very nice of me that I was smoking in that little room but I thought at that time one\ncouldn't live without smoking. And uh he was writing and, and on the second floor was a woman\nwho lived there with her mother, she was a seamstress, a very nice, very nice person, and I sat very\noften downstairs with her because she very seldom had clients, and when she knew then there will\nbe coming, and uh, I learned how to make, I think, seams, was, but that was about all. She didn't\nlet me do so much.\nWhat were the rescuers like, and why do you think they did it?\nWhat do you mean?\nThe people who hid you, what were they like? Were they all different types of people? And why\ndo you think they did it?\nNow the others who were before we were in Holland did not know where we were, naturally, they\nwere glad they were rid of us. The people in uh Holland, this was a woman, who uh told anybody\nand I, I heard from the top floor always when people came with anything to do in the house that she\ntold and that her husband had left her when her youngest child was a baby, the baby was mean--in\nthe meantime 15 years, but she told various, she had a hard life. I'm sure she did. She did it\nprobably to get some money, but we didn't have to pay I mean a outlandish amount, but we paid\nabout what, what she what she spent and a little bit more. She was a, was a very decent, but she,\nbut she needed it.\nWas she afraid? What was she risking by doing this and was she---------------?\nEverybody thought, everybody, and you can read about it, that the people who were hiding the\nJews would be treated like the Jews, so they were scared, and the more things got bad for the\nGermans, though, the more they got against to------, to take people in. Um...Political we didn't talk\nmuch with, with this woman. There was not much interest in that, it was that she was a poor\nwoman, and uh she had that house, and she was, didn't belong to her, was rented, but she made\nsomething on the rent from the people upstairs, and she got our money, and so she could get her\nchildren to at least to a high school.\nDid you know about persecutions in this period of time while you were hiding?",
        "No, um, we, we heard one story and that was the saddest of all. This Joe Fisch, who had uh at that\ntime, I think, three children and his wife was pregnant. He took people into his house when he had\nno other place anymore, and they wouldn't have, there was nowhere to go. And uh, he had a man at\nthat time, I think it must have been in ------------oh, 1943, late 43, that he had a man in his house\nwith all the other people and the children that um, he was from the Spanish war on the black list of\nthe Germans, and he had for a few days no place to go, and he was from Holland originally, and so\nhe took him in, and that night, they came and emptied the whole house. The chi--the neighbors\ntook the children, but um, everybody else who was in there was two, two people I knew very well,\nI had sent to Joe, to Joe Fisch, if he would help them. They were there because they had not, they\nhad no other places, and that man, and he and his wife. And they were brought to um, I don't\nknow, they were brought to prison, I know, but when they found out that his wife was, was\npregnant, they sent her home, and the others, Joe came to Dachau, and that, from then on he lived\nthrough the whole war in Dachau. He was a cook there, and he weighed maybe 250 pounds when\nhe came out, so um, he had other problems.\nWe have to reload.\nTell me when it's getting too...\nOkay.\nSound Roll 2; Wentworth Films; Holocaust; 7-1/2 IPS; 60 cycle sync; March 12, 1992; Chula\nVista, CA; Camera roll 3 is up; Sync take 3 is up; We're continuing interview with Helen\nWaterford.\nBeep.\nOkay, paint me a portrait of man named Joe.\nJoe Fisch was uh like many, many people are in, in Holland, white blond hair, but tall, husky guy,\nand uh this part of Holland where we found the friends, and we found most of the places where we\ncould hide, and where he brought some of his people, and that was the churches. Um, he was uh,\nhe was um, a carpenter of starting out, but when I met him, he was already um in connection with\nchildren\u2019s' uh all kinds of difficulties with children, and the children, and he was uh, he had a some,\na completely different job above his, where he, what he arranged originally, with uh schooling.\nAnd uh, so he, he, he was uh, this church was a quite liberal, and uh, but they were not very rich,",
        "and he was not very rich, but he was uh, a friend. He and his wife came very many times at night\nwhen you are not allowed to be on the street, and took things which were needed for our daughter,\nor which we would need when we could go to the first place, and uh, you know, beds and linens\nand all those things. We couldn't carry anything when we were going. When we were going we\nhad to take off the sta--the star, and go by train, and there were very obvious, very difficult because\nthere were others looking for younger men, and my husband was never asked for any identification\nbecause we had none. And everybody had to have identification. Joe was, for the people he\nhelped, more than a father, more than a father, because really, he had their best things in t--on his\nmind, what, what should be done, and when he was arrested, his best friend took over like nothing,\nand this best friend was the gardener of the city of Zan--Zandarn, and uh, he had a library, and he\nbrought, what we found out a-afterwards. The books my husband wanted, he all had them at home.\nHe had a tremendous library, and a very, very highly intelligent man. As I said, he came every\ntwo weeks, and we were looking forward when he came because he brought with him his uh, what\nhe thought about what was going on, and he was also listening to the um British BBC, which was\nforbid, forbid, forbidden, because they would kill you when they knew, know that you have left the\nradio on that station, and he told us everything, anything, what he heard, and he was the first one\nwho told us in July, 1944, that by that time, one and a half or two million Jews had been killed in\nAuschwitz. We had no idea. We had never heard the name of Auschwitz, and I think practically\nall the people who had nothing to do with uh the Nazis or whatever, didn't know. So, but he told us\nthat. That helped us later on to get a, a better picture, when we were arrested, where we would be\ngoing.\nHow many people did Joe rescue, do you think?\nI don't, you see, only the ones I know, I'm sure he had many, many more. Um...but how many\u2019?\nIt's, it's, it's Doris, and it's me and it is the friends in IJ, I, I introduced him to who had three\ndaughters. All three daughter, no, yeah, the third, the third, uh the oldest daughter was in his house\nwhen the um, when, when the, when they were all arrested there, so the oldest daughter up to that\npoint, she was, she was with him, and she was taken to Bergen-Belsen, where she found her\nmother, and the mother and this daughter came out, at least six months before the war was over, on\na changing of prisoners of Germany and Jews.\nWhy do you think Joe was arrested?\nNow he, at first he made us open the place to do the, to, to go and hide. We wouldn't have known\nanybody.",
        "Why do you think he did it?\nBec--Oh I know why. Because he, he loved people. He was a, a, a basically very, very good man.\nThere, uh there was nothing wrong in any way to complain ever. He was a fantastic hardworking\nman, and loving man.\nWas he risking not only his own life--\nOh sure.\nbut his family's.\nHis family too, but, but he's not the only one who did that for us. The family would have suffered\nalready the first days when they were arrested, but uh, nothing would have happened to his wife,\nand nothing did, but he would, you don't know, when you do that, but he, I think he didn't even\nthink about it. We have other friends who risked, risked everything. We did not come from this\nplace, from him, they didn't know each other. We brought them together, and the two of them\nreally did got more groups, and different kind of people. The other men had all our belongings, but\nmost important thing were our books, and he had uh, uh clothes, the, the first thing you would need\nif you have nothing. That's what my husband said. If he takes it, it will be right, and uh, so he had,\nhe went then and what went when Joe was, Joe was arrested, or was gone, he came in by himself to\ngo every two weeks to my daughter too, and in summary, he made our daughter, his. A wonderful\nman.\nDid you get news about your daughter while you were in hiding?\nUh, not pers-personally, but everybody, would say at least every two weeks sometimes, yeah. Yes.\nNo, we got those pictures they had made, but we did not want any other contact. We had no\ncontact or any really before she was gone, and we did not want her ever to feel that she is homesick\nfor her parents. She should forget it, and she did. That this is a, a um, maybe one, some of the\nreasons that she maybe forgot it for a long time, our relationship, and this is, this is what we did\nbecause she would not call it, uh, that we saved her life at that time, and, and much later, but what\nshe called it abandonment. And she's not the only one. There is a very big literature about children\nwho were brought by their parents to other people, they always said that they were abandoned.",
        "Tell me about getting arrested.\nOh it came very suddenly and unexpected because the, the more than a year we were in that house,\nI was only one time out to get a tooth pulled at night, and the dentist was more excited than I was,\nhe was shaking until he got the--I don't know what he thought, what he had to do with--But\nanyway, we, we didn't get out and we, we could hardly look out of the window. It was on a Friday\nmorning, and it was the twenty-fifth of August, the same day that Paris was liberated by the Allies.\nWe didn't know. That was the day we were arrested, and uh, we li--as I say--we lived on the top\nfloor, and we heard a knock on the door, not a kick, a knock, and here were two men, not in\nuniform. Found out later on that there were two men downstairs on each side of the house. Those\ntwo men uh that that we were under arrest, they knew our names, nobody in that house knew our\nnames, and um, they would come in and they looked around, and then they saw a picture of, the\nlast picture we got from our daughter on the wall, and one of them said um, \"If this is your child, if\nyou have other children in hiding, we, we suggest you take them with you because you are brought,\nyou will be brought to work, and we'll take care of the children while the parents are working. And\nuh, then we were both found out 1f we had any money on it, and we had, we had money on us, but\nthey didn't even find it. And uh, they also said, they looked in the drawers, we had very little\nclothes. Just absolutely necessary, and they said, \"Take a coat, take winter clothes with you. Where\nyou are going, it's very cold.\" Now that was true. The other thing of the children were big lie???\nWait, we have to reload.\nBeep.\nExplain to me what happened to the people who were hiding ---- when you were arrested. Now the\nwoman who, who whose house this was um was not seen when the, after the man must have been\ndownstairs. I did not see her, she not show up, they were not there. She never said goodbye or\nanything. The only one who came was the seamstress, and I had a pin, a coral pin I was very much\nattached to and I put it in her hand, and we said goodbye. So um, she was gone, but I went to her\nwith my daughter after the war, was one of my first visits to, to go there with the train and visit, and\num, the first thing she said, \"I'm sorry, but the Germans told me I could use all your things,\" that\nmeans um, bedding and uh, uh blankets and uh everything we left there, because we went without\nanything. We knew we would be killed, so why should we take something with us we would not\nneed, and maybe one day we could get some way escape, and this would be just not necessary, so\nwe went without anything. So, she, that's what she said to me. And at that moment I was so, it was\nso upsetting to see the house and all again, I forgot, said, she said, I said, \"Forget about it.\" I had",
        "no bed. We had, my daughter and I, we had nothing. But I said, \"It's okay.\" Afterwards I thought,\n\"Why would the Germans say that she could take all that?\" The only reason could be that she told\nthem. And that she uh got money for it because, because that's why they ----------------all your\nchildren because they got the money for each head. But uh, I don't have any clue. I only didn't go\nanymore there. Not ever. But that uh, I think, that they would give it to her, sometimes I think\nmaybe it wasn't it even true. Maybe she used it and it was gone in the meantime, or she stole it, I\ndon't know. But I didn't go there anymore.\nOkay. Now describe for me the transport to Auschwitz, and also the things that you and your\nhusband did, the cutting up of the money, the little bits of resistance that you did.\nI like to talk about this experience um with the students because I most, I al-always go to\nuniversities and sometimes to um, to um schools who are just next, next year going to the\nuniversity, I don't know, and I, I, I tell them that I say that very, very uh clear and maybe it seems\nnot absolutely necessary but you should know because hardly ever anybody has talked about it or\nhas written about it, we were a-arrested, and we were brought to Amsterdam, that's where we\noriginally lived, and we were brought to the Gestapo, which is the, where the police or the SS and\nwe were separate taken into another room, and we were asked. We found both after, we found both\nof us did uh what they wanted to know the most: Who brought those coupons because I just had\ngotten new coupons for the food, and uh it was must have been lying there. They didn't never find\nthe people who did every month enough for the nearly 20,000 Jewish people who were in Holland\nunderground, who had to be, had to have it, otherwise they couldn't have lived. So, that, they asked\nboth of us, and we didn't even answer. And who brought us um, who brought us the coupons, and\nuh, who looked after us and who brought us to where we are. Those were the questions first, and uh\nwe didn't answer. So, this, this took a few hours, and when we were brought to the regular jail in\nAmsterdam, which doesn't exist anymore, we found it after, I found it looking afterwards that it\nwas a very nice place, I could have stayed there during the whole war. Was clean and nice. But we\nwere only there about two nights and then we went to the camp which did all the train, the trains all\ngoing to the East went to, how could I ever forget that name?\nWesterberg.\nWesterberg, thank you. Westerberg, the train went took us to Westerberg. Westerberg when I saw\nit, now that was, as I said, in August of 44, was not what I had expected. It was huge. It was huge,\nand I saw the Jewish, the Jewish police for the first time. I didn't know that something like this\nexisted. And the women in, in greenish uniforms, Jewish women, and uh, we were there only 3",
        "nights when, when at the same time in Holland the um they know that the allies were trying to\ncome into the Southern part uh of Holland to get the Germans out, that was known. We didn't\nknow, sure. Took a long time until I understood where that all was. And uh, the uh, the uh man\nworking on the trains had arranged with uh whoever, that they would they would start uh start to\nput the work down the moment they were knowing that the Allies were coming. So the Germans\nknew that there would be no trains going, and so they did in three days empty practically all of, say\nthat again, Westerberg, gee, I have a block. The um, in three days, there were only about 400\npeople left from the thousands and thousands, so we were in the first train, which went as we found\nout, not when we came there, but maybe a day or two later that we were in Auschwitz. So the\ntrains where the regular, as I understand, the regular camp cars, there was no seating in there,\nnothing, 1t was naked. And the only thing was the little um, a little thing like this for maybe 175\npeople to use. And uh, otherwise people, a tremendous amount of, of, of luggage. They took\nanything with them that they thought because there had been quite some time, in, in this camp, and\nuh they, they took sewing machines with them, everything. And there was, were really, you\ncouldn't, you could not sit on the floor. You had to stand, and we had to stand three days and four\nnights in that little basket where we, for the, whatever had to be used couldn't be used anymore.\nYou couldn't even get to it. So after a few hours, was very, very bad, and I, but it didn't change,\nand we were going and going, and some two or three times, they opened the doors, and the people\nall yelled for water, and uh, they didn't, they didn't understand the situation. They thought they\nwould be brought water. As soldiers came in and took our, whatever, if we had rings on or\nsomething, and the, and then they wanted money, it's the second time I know they wanted money,\nand we didn't give them money. We gave them just some change or whatever. We didn't, and uh,\nwe atri--we arrived all the, after all that time, probably in physical and and other kind of ways\nchanged. We had changed into another person. And uh, when we arrived the there was a little\nsomething which looked like a station, and there was a name of uh, not Auschwitz, starts with a B.\nBirkenau.\nThat's right, Birkenau, B-I-R--Birkenau, never heard anything. At Birkenau is uh is German, and\nit's a name of a tree. Not that A-U, but Birken, and uh, when we got out, jumping down, and the\npeople all wanted to keep their luggage, and then there started the first fighting between uh Jewish\nprisoners who had blue and white striped uniforms, who took all that what they brought, very fast,\nhad to go very fast, because it was a very long train, impossible to, to think how many people were\nthere. We asked one time, one of those prisoners that didn't even answer when we asked, \"Where\nare we?\" Because we had never heard Birkenau.",
        "All right, we're about to run out.\nBeep.\nJust tell me the incident on the train and why you did it.\nWe had money in, in a money belt, both of us, we always carried it, since we were underground we\nhad both have, you never know. So uh, we took that out and at night, and we cut bill after bill, I\ndon't know anymore how much it was, but it was all the money we had, and uh, I don't know. So\nwe, we tried to put it into very small pieces, I don't know why we bothered because the floor was\nnot good, so we did that all. It was the hardest job, but I guess it was harder to make the money\nwith working than to get rid of it that way. Because it hurt, and uh, but we, we thought that they\nshouldn't get it because the soldiers, they kept the money. This was the thing they could, were\nallowed to keep because afterwards the uh, the uh luggage, that was a big -----, that was the biggest.\nThe whole camp waited for that, for each train, that they got food, and they got clothes and they\ngot jewelry, and anything. And uh the people who worked in the, in that dept, they were after a\nfew months they were changed and killed, and when they, when they were found selling those\nthings, and they did, I don't know how they did it, but they could change it with anything, which\nwas someplace available. I never knew how much was available in Auschwitz, if you had\nsomething. I found it only out by the, by the reading, by all the books I have in German and in\nEnglish.\nTell me how you asked them where you were.\nYeah, I asked one of those blue and white striped, \"Where are we?\" He didn't answer. Didn't\nanswer. They were glad that the food came, but uh they didn't, they were Jewish, just like us. And\nthey came one day like that too. But in the meantime they had a, a very good job, everybody\nwould have given his right hand to have such a job.\nTell me about the selection. Why did you, are the shoes making too much noise Brett, her shoes?\nMine?\nYeah.\nOh.",
        "Yeah, that's fine. Tell me about the selection.",
        "Uh, it was, when we come, came out, we were separated, men and women. And uh, so I was, I uh\nin the, in the pl-uh train, there was a woman standing next to me the whole time, and she had a\nchild, like our child. And uh, she said, \"When we were arrested, somebody said we should take our\nchildren. And we took our children out of the places where they were hiding,\" and uh, gee, I\nthought that could have happened maybe to us. But we, we didn't even consider that. So this\nwoman and her little girl and I, we were in one row walking up when we saw the end which was\nvery, very long because that that whole train along we had to go and uh, we saw at the end, a man,\na extremely well-looking man, this I have never forgotten, in his uniform, very elegant and and uh,\nwhen we came, the three of us, and he asked me, \"Is this your child?\" And I said, \"No,\" he made a\nmove to the mother and the child to go this way, and to me, this way. That was all. And I was with\nother people finding out after a while that they were the ones who were supposed to go to work\neventually, and uh, that was the reason they looked comparatively young, I wasn't young at all. I\nwas in my middle thirties. I was one of the oldest, and they were very young, and uh, we came to a\nan place where there had been some trees, there were no trees in Auschwitz anymore, there were\njust some leftover I don't know. So, there where we were told to wait. And then there I saw my\nhusband, and my husband was also on this good side, and we talked for a long time. We always\nthinking that we would be together. Then they called the women in to a large bldg. We were very\nclose to this bldg and we, that was the last time I saw my husband, ever, and I do not know when or\nwhere he died. There is a chance now to find out, that's new because the government camp kept all\nthose things, I don't know for whom, where it is known, I don't know, thousands and thousands of\nnames or millions of names, I don't know. And the Red Cross ----------- will take care of it. It will\ntake maybe ten years. So I told my daughter she should do that. I would not be living anymore\nuntil this answer would come. So um, we were in there, and we, the first thing was that we were\nlined up on the lo--on long tables, and behind there, there were girls, young girls, all had black hair,\nlooked very, very nice, their hair was, was just perfect, and all of them were wearing black silk\ndresses, but not the same. They were obviously hand-made the way they liked it. And uh, I\nthought those were Germans. They were not...they were criminals. And uh, they put the name in\nthe book, and maybe those books are now open to us, and uh, they gave you the tattoo, and uh then\nyou went to another part in this huge bldg, and uh, there were more of those women. The same\ntype, and uh they said very fast, very fast, was always fast, fast, fast, fast. We had to undress\ncompletely. And with that undressing, I had a wedding band somebody overlooked it there and she\njust put it with her hand out, and it was gone. I still thought they were German. They were not.\nThey were prisoners like we. They were only younger, and probably and longer there, long",
        "experience, they know. So um, I had very good shoes on. Walking shoes, and I must have kept\nthem for that day, and with us, and with us in the train were the, were Anne Frank, her mother, her\nfather and her sister. And when I saw them again in this, in this hall, there was a mother and the\ntwo girls. Now I knew the Franks very well. I didn't, I did not know that they were still alive.\nWhen they were disappearing at the time when we all were invited to come to the train, they had\nprepared, and they had this well-known uh house ready for them to go in. We didn't know where\nthat was. They were all of the sudden uh not there anymore, and we only knew two things--maybe\nthey had gone to Switzerland, some people had a chance or they were underground, and here I saw\nthem again for the first time. Um, Mrs. Frank had very uh shoes like mine too, and one of the girls\nsaid to her, \"I would like to have your shoes.\" I heard it, and she said, \"No, no, I need my shoes.\"\nAnd she said uh, \"I give you mine.\" Oh, but a funny way. And she said, no, no, she said, \"I bring\nyou every day soup for your two girls.\" That's she, that's changed shoes, and she did. She never\ngot any soup. So, another girl came to me and wanted my shoes, and I didn't want any soup. I said,\nI, \"No, no, I don't give up the shoes.\" I should have thought by that time that there must have been\nprisoners. Otherwise I would have just taken them away from the ---------, but uh, they leave me\nalone, and I had those shoes oh at least half the winter, they were still, I mean I could wear them,\nbut they were not so good any, anymore. But um, yeah, the next half of the winter, I had no shoes.\nBut um, we, we were then, then uh when uh we were naked, and we got shaved, our hair and body,\nand the head, and then we were brought into the shower, which was a regular shower. We didn't\nknow about other showers, and then we were outside. It was September. It was about the 8th of\nSeptember, something like that, and uh, we were wet. We had nothing, a towel or anything. And\nthen they threw each of us a dress. They didn't look for the size and they didn't look for if it was\nwool or if it was a thin summer material, you got one dress, and then you had to try to find\nsomebody who wanted to change with you, and uh, the size and with material maybe, and by that\ntime, we had never been allowed to go to the toilet, latrine it was called. We were not allowed to\ngo to the bathroom or anything. So, um, we were brought into a...\nWe have to reload.\nBeep.\nI want to ask you some general questions about your sense while you were in various camps, if this\nis, you don't have to be camp-specific. Did you ever catch a glimpse of your reflection?\nOf my what?\nReflection. Did you ever see what you looked like?",
        "No. There were no, was no mirror. No. We looked at each other and the ones without hair, they\nusually, you know you look like that. And that was all.",
        "Can you tell me what sensory things you remember, like sounds, or smells, or the things that made\nthe biggest impression you.",
        "The biggest that was the uh chimney, which was very close to the barrack where we were, and that\nwas spewing fire, fire. Twenty-four hours. In the, the, in the daytime, you only saw the smoke. At\nnight it was fire. And uh, about the third or fourth day, I started to walk around. We didn't work.\nWe couldn't stay in our barrack. We had to be out, so I just started to walk around, and while I\napproached a man, the only man I saw, uh to tell me where we are, I don't know, he was well-\ndressed comparatively, he was a prisoner, and he spoke Polish, and I couldn't speak Polish, and uh,\nI asked him where we were. And he said um, \"Auschwitz,\" he knew that. And uh, I say \"What is\nthis?\" And he said, \"You see, you cannot get out of Auschwitz any other way but through this\nchimney. This is our trip to heaven.\" And I thought, \"Don't know what kind of a man this is.\" I\nthought about it later much more because there was no man walking around. It must have been a\nprisoner who was uh quite a high rank. Prisoners had very high ranks. Uh, this you don't know\nwhen you are there because they don't come to you. But uh, the uh, he must have been there to\nlook for a girl. This is the only way that, the only interest they had to walk through a woman's\ncamp, and there was a new group just had come, and they were, you know, certain ages anyway,\nbut uh, this was very clear when he told me what, I understood it, but I didn't tell my f--the people\nI was with. That wasn't necessary. It was enough I knew what and, were not even sure, and uh,\nwhat this was not changing. The, the roughest time was uh the two uh daily uh that we had to be\ncounted at about 5 o clock or so in the morning. We don't know, our watches were already long\ngone. Uh, and uh when we were awakened, we had, the way we are, we didn't have to wash, or we\ndidn't have to change clothes or shoes, or whatever. We had to uh come to a, a roll call, in the\nmorning and in the evening. And that roll call never ever and I guess if you have talked to other\npeople, never ever functioned. If they had uh 976 on their book, there were maybe 850 or the other\nway around, and then the girl who had to do that, she was the, the uh, older, the elder, of the of the\nuh she was a prisoner, of this barrack, she got more and more nervous, because very short, short of\nthat, one of the uh, of the officers, is who, I don't know what they were, I don't know anything\ndifferent in uniform. I, I never learned it before or after the war. I was never interested, but he was\nsomething higher, and he got very angry that it never, that it never was came out right, so sent, they\nhad to search the whole barrack, and as I said, in every barrack was, were about a thousand people.\nSo, he, some people were hiding at that time we had straw mattresses, which was luxury. So we",
        "were hiding under that in the corner, and if you are, it's understood, ------------ it's very difficult to\nclimb up there and to find the people. Some people had died. But I know that one time, I knew I\nhad the Scarlet Fever because it was in 1n the camp in Holland, so I knew looking at my stomach it\nwas Scarlet Fever, and I was afraid that somebody would see me, that they would uh do something\nwith me which I wouldn't probably like. Still have not exactly taken it that that everybody who\nwas sick would be killed. I, and I think it took a little longer that it goes into one's brain. But I\nstayed always in the corner in the third bunk under the mattress. And I saw them searching, but\nthey never came up there . That was the first illness I had there. There is no, there was no so-\ncalled clinic or whatever.\nWhat acts of resistance did you see in the camp of any sort?\nNothing. Nothing.\nWhat about mental resistance?\nHow do you resist mentally in such a case. The only way to live, to be, not even if the, the, the\nonly way to be is to do what is asked from you, and it is stupid as a one person to do something.\nThat is because the, the woman who is in charge of the barrack is the first one who will punish, be\npunished, so she will do something that you don't do, because she is afraid also. No, I thought it\nwould be--I don't know and I've never read that anything like this happened in the barracks or\nanything like that. Never. I haven't read any, and I have all those besides the ones I have read and\nI don't know.\nWhat about religious or spiritual resistance?\nUh, there's no resistance. This is not a resistance, but I saw in on Jewish holidays some women\nwho knew, who kept ------- to pray. That's not a resistance. This is for people who are very\nreligious, nat-natural. I did not see any resistance...in that camp. And later on where we were in\nthe factory. One time in the factory, but that was, that was not person to person.\nWhat was that?\nWas a woman walked out at night on New Year's night and the guards, we had 4 soldiers, for the\nwhole camp and 4 women soldiers. That was all. And, uh there but, I guess they were drunk or\nsome--and she thought it was snowing so much, she could go out, and she went out, and she",
        "thought if she knocks on a house and says where she comes from, she was uh, they would take her\nin ba-ba-back home. But she was ------------. That was all. That was all I saw.\nSo she escaped and then got recaptured? Was she punished?\nUh, they, she was sent, officially 1t was said she was going to a larger camp than that at the factory,\nbut I know she was alive afterwards. So they didn't do anything anymore. They couldn't send them\nanymore to Auschwitz. There was no uh, uh burning or anything anymore after November the\nfirst, 1944.\nWhat do you think keeps you alive? What choices do you make while you're in the camp.\nNow at first, the, I think the, the greatest and the most important choice if you wanted to live, that\nyou do want to live, that you do anything, which makes it possible to live. And I, I was not in\ndoubt, I was, that I wouldn't live. I thought I will, which is uh, you know, stupid. But I, have, I\nwas convinced. So at first, if you are in the, in a, in a large group of people, I, I, I was always short,\nI made myself shorter, to be in the middle, not in the front, not in the back. I stand uh, that the\nothers are taller. I haven't had experience with that, but I thought there is something, because\npeople in some way, who stand in the first row or in the last row, they, they were picked for things,\nwhich maybe were not very pleasant. You don't know it. It, this is that uh instinctive uh that's all I\ncan say. Not smart or...instinctively you say, I don't want to be seen, they don't and should send\nme, see me.\nWhat other choices do you think helped you?\nI think uh, that the most important thing was my child. That I wanted to come back to my child.\nSo, but I did fought, I do not, I cannot take any credit. I did as little as possible to that somebody\nwould say, \"Oh that woman...,\" you know and everybody knows. That was not, I didn't, but uh,\nthis was important, I was always thinking of my child, of my husband where he would be,\nand...May I tell a little story? Uh Sunday afternoon was--\nWe have to reload.\nYeah.\nBeep.",
        "Okay, you were about to tell me a story.\nYeah, uh we were working in the factory uh twelve hours, night or day, and then they promised us\nthey would give us one extra portion for night or uh, I had nothing better to do at night, so I I was\nworking nights. But, the Sunday afternoon was free for everybody. As far as you can, uh, you sit\non your mattress if there, as long as there was a mattress, by the end, then there were none\nanymore. So um, and the group of Dutch women, because that's how I came, with and that's who\nwere my friends. We sat together and talked about lots of things. So, one uh, one day I have never\nforgotten. We were thinking, when we come home, we didn't say if anymore because we knew in\nthe factory there was no gas, and uh, we would not be gassed. If we would get sick that's another\nstory. So if we, we thought we would, we would come home. What would be more difficult? To\nfind your children or your husband? Now, everybody was very frank. You uh, you didn't talk,\ntake, tell stories in those situations. And we were maybe 12 or 13 women. Most of them had\nchildren in hiding. Not all, but most of them. And uh, of the, I think it was 13, that the uh, when\nwe were finished telling what would be harder, I think the, I think you know the answer because uh\nonly one woman said, \"I love my little boy, and if I don't see him again, it's very difficult, but if my\nhusband is not there, I will lose my mind.\" She was the only one. She did, after the war. She did.\nBut uh, all the others said they had more, more than one child very often, it it it's a piece of uh you\nlose your husband it's, it's terrible, it's your best friend, and it's the closest person you have. But\nlosing a child is physically in every way very, very painful.\nNow let's go back to the selection when you, what did you notice about selection, the age groups,\nand tell me a little about that.\nNow that, uh, at first the age groups, the older, you see, you don't have a long chance to look what's\ngoing on there. It's not right in front of you. You have to walk a little. Be, be, be, you are stopping\nbefore, you're stopped before you come closer. You don't know what's going on. But it is, old,\nlittle older peo-, older people I would think, we had one old per, old, old lady, she was ten years\nolder than I was, so she was in her middle forties, but extremely good-looking woman. And there\nwas no question, she ca, came with us, and she came out at the end. But um, the women with\nchildren, that, when they had children, there was no help. They had to go both. And uh, but you\nare so short in contact what's happening, you go to the other side, and you only think. All there\nwith the children, there are in, they will be taken care of. That's what we thought, all of us. So,\nwhen we, when we got away from this place where we lost practically everything, practically, and\num, when we came to at night into a barrack, we uh, there was hard-hardly any room, so we were",
        "ten people in one, six people bed...bunk, whatever you call it. And we all had to lo-li-lie one side,\nand we all were deadly tired, and from the trip??? and all that, so we all did sleep, but it wasn't\nlong. Uh, maybe 3 or 4 hours when the light went on, and we had to go to the famous roll call.\nAnd there were every day, and there were every day, there were pain, it's painful. That didn't\nchange, but after a few weeks, we got some work to do, but it was not the work that they kept us\nfor, we found that out later, we had stupid things to do. We had to go to the so-called woods and\ncut out some grass, and put the grass in front of the soldiers' houses, that they could have flowers in\nfront of their houses. Things like that. It was, it was, had nothing top do with what we thought,\nand uh then after uh\nWhat did they have in mind for you?\nWhat, that one day we uh, we uh, while we were in this first um\nBirkenau.\nNo, no, no, no, in the first um\nWork camp.\nNot the camp but the uh, the, the\nRegistration area\nNo, not where, where the barracks were, in a barrack, uh, two times afterwards, where what we\nknew by then were uh, who shall live and who shall die, and to, to two of those, there were just, the\nwhole the whole uh barrack, every barrack, was for day, for a lot of times, you couldn't get out\nbecause something was happening in the other barrack. We didn't know what. So we were all\nlocked in. So when we were asked to get out, and all the others were inside, then we knew what\nwas happening. So, uh Mengele was always there. I don't know why he came always to us\nbecause there were at least 24 doctors who did the same thing. So um, we had to take our dress off,\nput it over our arm, outstretched arm, and the in the nude we had to walk in front of Mengele, and\nMengele said, this or this also, the one place you had to go back into the, the uh barrack, into a\ncertain pla-room, and the other, you go to another place. The other place was always, I, we, they\nwent in the barrack, they were picked up very soon, and they were killed that same day. So this\nwas how they cleaned it out. People who, who after a week or two weeks or three weeks started to",
        "get very thin and very down, very down, they took. So the third time when they did it, he counted\nout 300 people, and those 300, and Mrs. Frank was with me at that time, she, she was in the same\nbarrack, but I mean that she, she was in the 300 with Arn, with Ann, but the other daughter, I didn't\nsee. So, we came into another place, barrack, and we spent the night there, and the next morning\nMrs. Frank and her younger daughter were gone, and somebody told me that she did not go without\nMargot, her older daughter, so she, well, thought the same way we, we thought, we are going to\nwork. Around amount of 300. So she disappeared, and she must have gone into any other big\nbarrack, and nobody knew who she was and nobody cared. And uh, by that time, we all, already\nhad all kinds of lice and things. So it was no, well, it made no difference. So we were going, this\nsame day then, by train to Czechoslovakia. That was the factory who had asked for 300 people.\nThis is the way it was, I mean we didn't know, but there are many books about this system that the\nGerman uh took into their fac-their factory, people because they had no men anymore. So they\ntook women. And uh, they had to be a place ready where those people could stay, and a lot of\nfactories were given, uh taken away from their owners in Czechoslovakia and around, and some\nGerman trust, trustees come, and they take over the factory, and they get all those people to work,\nand they pay so much, they have to pay for the food of those people, was about 50 cents a day. So,\nthey had uh workers, but certainly, I don't think that the workers were worth | cent. But that's\nbesides the point. And uh so we worked and I got my night shift, and uh, we were working twelve\nhours without, without food in between.\n-------------have a tiny bit. Tell, define for me Kapo.\nUh, the Kapo is a prisoner, and he's in charge of a group of people. Uh, I knew what the first -------\n-------, that the, the Polish ----------police, I know what the ----------- was but I have forgotten it. Uh,\nbut they had to keep the, the men, they were with men, really under because the men had uh\nsometimes hard work, impossible work for them because they were so weak.\nWe have to reload.\nChange film, camera roll 8 is up; Sync take 8 is up.\nBeep.\nMrs. Waterford, when you were in the work camp, in the factory, there was an incident where an\nSS came up and asked you about your crimes.",
        "Not an SS.\nNo?\nNo. Just tell me that story as though I don't know it.\nYeah, the uh, we would, we had all kinds of different work that was still in Auschwitz, but, yeah, I\nthink so. No, I don't know.\nIt doesn't matter-------------.\nYeah, so, yeah, yes, uh, I, we had to do, we had a something with two wheels, how do you call\nthose?\nCarts.\nCart? Okay. And we had to coll, uh, collect in there stones or something, and all, we walked by\none of the, the uh German woman, whatever they were, in uniform, and um, anytime you had to\nbring this in and come back, and you walked by, so I thought she looked very nice and young, and I\nsaid to her, uh, \"This is good work we are learning here, we can use it when the war is over.\" She\nlooked, and because I spoke German, and uh, she, she said, \"Yeah, that's right, that's right.\" So, uh,\nI came back the next time and um, she said uh, I said, \"How do you like your work?\" \"Oh, it's\nokay, okay.\" They hated it in the village. (laughs) There was nothing going on for the young girl,\nand uh, then she came back, and she said, \"Don't you like it?\" I said, \"I wasn't asked.\" She said,\n\"What do you mean, you were not asked. You were a criminal. Look at your clothes.\" I never\nthought of that. I said, \"Those are not my clothes. And I was not a criminal, I'm a Jew.\" She, she\nwent, she took about 2 steps back, and uh this was all. She didn't know. That's, that's what they\nknew, that we were criminals, and we looked it, we smelled it. I don't uh, but uh, I, uh, I said one\nmore thing the next time I came by. A friend of mine, she came with her little cart, and I said,\n\"Look at this lady. Her father is one of the richest men in Amsterdam. And she has an M.D.\"\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"don't tell me such stories.\" So, they didn't want to know. It was true.\nTell me, there was a time after liberation when you were hungry and walked up to a Russian\nsoldier. Tell me that story.\nUh, the war was over at the place where I was on the 9th of May. That was the last day could be\nbecause the Germans were still doing something. So, uh the ga--the gate was open and the Ger-the",
        "8 Germans who were in there for 1200 women, at that time we had maybe lost 150 who died, and\nwe, we buried them with our hands. There was nothing. And uh, I open, I walked out. The, the\nplace itself was terribly, terribly dirty, and there was nothing functioning anymore, there was no\nfood for days, and I mean full days no food, and uh, everybody had diarrhea, and never made it, so\nit was very, very dirty, and uh, so what, I walked out and the first thing I saw were the uh, the fl,\nthe flowers, the little white flower, oh, in May. Under a tree, there are little white flowers, they are\nhere in the United States too.",
        "Mayflowers.",
        "Not mayflower, but the, may, may mayflowers? Yeah? And uh, and I hadn't seen that, so I threw\nmyself in there and I smelled them, and they were wonderful fresh, it was wonderful. So, I went,\nwent into town because we were always, every day going through town and the people there knew\nus, and uh, I went into a, a sausage ------- a store I had seen every day, and I always wanted some\nof his sausage, so I walked in, dirty, and all I was, and smell it, and he, I said I would like, I said in\nGerman too, \"I would like to have some sausage. I wonder if you could give me one.\" He said,\n\"No.\" So I walked back into town, nearly into town, and here was a Russian, and he had a piece of\nblack bread in his one hand, and he had a chicken leg in his other. And he was a very tall guy, and\nI said something like that, and he looked at me, and I said, \"----------.\". He gave it to me,\nunderstood me perfect. Oh, it made me so sick. The next night I was terribly sick. Shouldn't have\ndone that naturally, but who can, who can say wouldn't do it, would think of that what could come\nlater, but um, I didn't stay long. The, the, the um, director of the factory came without his pin, was\nan, that he belonged to the Nazis in a blue suit, blue, elegant suit, and he thanked us for our work,\nand uh, he told us we had to wait until the International Red Cross would come, and pick us up and\nbring us to our countries. Now, the uh International Red Cross had been there just before\nChristmas, and they were, they, they the rumors what they had 1n their, in their trains when they,\nwhere they came with was tremendous. Everybody knew all the things who were for eating in the\ntrain, and we got the first day, we got some sugar, loose sugar, but we had nothing to put it in, so\nwe had it in our filthy smelling hands, and we ate it, and the, the, the thing that came right after that\nwas a, acan of, of sardines, and it was one can, and it was opened, it was for two people. This was\nit. The next Sunday, we got peas in some kind of a so-called soup. I don't know. But, uh, well\nthere were four women who came with that, and uh, in green uniforms, and they marched with the\nwoman who was in charge. By, we had to stand in fives as always, and uh, I wa--I was in front, I\nwanted to be in the front, and uh, there were tel--they were tel-telling, uh the woman who was in\ncharge was telling her, \"Here, look at those people. They are so filthy, and they don't want to take\nshowers. We showed you the beautiful new showers we have, you saw them, you saw how clean it",
        "was, they don't go in.\" She forgot to say that they don't -------------was no open. We couldn't go in.\nAnd that's what you have when you are, have Jews. They don't want to wash themselves. They\nare filthy dirty. And that woman did not come, the women who walked by did not come up and ask\n\"Why don't you wash yourself?\" They believed everything. So this is the International Red Cross,\nwho has now all that what my, where my husband died and all that. I don't know, and I will never\nget it.\nHow does your experience make you feel about humankind?\nOh, I believe like Anne Frank says, if you, I don't know if you remember when you read it, I\nbelieve that people are basically good. I do. Honest. Honestly. People are basically good. If they\ndo something, they are stronger, stronger things come up in their life which makes it more\nimportant to be a good Nazi because they have a good time, and as a man, you can have any\nwoman you want, and uh, you get beautiful uniforms, and everything. So, a lot of people fall\nunder that and fall with it. Now, I think basically we are good. I believe in it.\nDo you see survival as an achievement?\nNo, I don't know. I don't think that I did anything more than any uh, uh awake and sincere person\nwould do. I try not to fall into the eye of the enemy, and uh, I don't do dumb things, who, who\nmaybe, I think I have to do because it's so bad here, but that wouldn't make any sense. What is one\nlife when they kill them twenty four thousand in 24 hours, every day? What is one life? Nothing.\nSo, no, I thought afterwards when I have my child, I am needed.\nBeep.\nMrs. Waterford, what were your losses and what were the things you gained from this?\nNaturally the losses are, that I lost my husband, and it took me 13 years to get married again. And\neven after that time, every night I had nightmares that he maybe would come back, and what I\nwould do in this case. I never told him. But it was terrible, the thought. I hadn't thought so much\nabout that before I was really married, but uh, this is a great loss, and uh, I have learned what\npeople like me, like you, like anybody can do to each other, and there is nothing they cannot do.\nCan do anything. This is what I have learned. But it isn't, basically, there are not, they don't come\ninto the world covered with sin. I hope that no-nobody's religion is in any way uh against what I\nsay, but I believe that we are good and only want to be good. A lot of things prevented that we are",
        "not good. And if there are things involved to other people, this is the greatest, the greatest terror I\ncan think of. Because we were really degraded in every way. Even a, even lying that we could, we\ndon't want to wash ourselves, we love to go around stink, stinking like that. All those things,\nnobody would, with a normal way of thinking would do that, but all the people who worked for the\nfascism, they did it wonderfully. Just, they don't have to be belonging to them, but it was\nwonderful to know that there is a group, or a large element of people who are lower than I am, than\nwe are. That's wonderful. Don't help them to get up. No, this is I have learned, and I uh, 1t makes\nme very unhappy. But, one person alone cannot do that, and uh people who have gone through\nexactly the same thing I have, uh, and they talk about, I guess you know better than I do because I\nI'm never together with any people who have the same experience. The thing is that they are\ncrying, crying, \"What, look what's done to me! Look what 1s done to us!\" That's terrible, I know it.\nI know everything. I know it, and when I speak to the students, I never talk about violence. They\ncan see enough violence on TV. They don't need me. I do not say that. I say what Anne Frank\nsaid. That I believe that. And I think it has helped me through my whole long life afterwards. And\nI, I find it absolutely wrong only to talk what happened to me and I lost my father, my mother, my\n16 cousins or whatever, it is terrible. But it's terrible to listen to 1t also. Can't we make peace with\nourselves? Can't we? Let me, let me, let me accept that it has existed, and it has, but you cannot\ncarry it with you all your life. You have to say, yes that has existed, and I will every time when\nnecessary, when I see it's necessary, talk about it, but now I have a new life, and I want to make the\nbest in my new life. This is what I tell the students, the women.\nNow just tell me, seeing the patch of Lilies of the Valley. As though you didn't tell me before.\nOkay. When uh, when I walked out of the gate, gate was open, and our people have, Ger-German\npeople have left, and left the uniforms out there, and uh, I was not interested in taking a uniform\nout, but, but the people really wanted it, and uh, very close to the entrance was a big tree which I\nnever had seen, and un-under this tree were the Lilies of the Wally, Valley, so beautiful, so white, I\nhad forgotten that something like this existed. There was no way of bending down and, and rip\nthem off, I wouldn't do that, so I put myself into them, and I still feel this feeling. Wonderful.\nAnd one other thing. Describe for me Dr. Mengele.\nNow I talked about Mengele and uh, I didn't know that he was the head of the people. The uh, head\nof the doctors, and that he had uh fantastic ideas, what he thought he could sell uh medically, and\nuh he would be a big man. The greatest man ever because he had so much material. He said it\nhimself, how much material he had to find out what's wrong with twins, and how can you maybe",
        "change the color of the eye from one color to another over tw-over over twins. I mean those were\nvery important. But, he uh, he really thought this would be, what he was doing was really uh\nsearching for help, but there's nothing, not one thing, and was uh, many people he killed because\nabsolutely unrealy uh the, cutting this out, and cutting that out. There's nothing in that he thought\nanything new.\nWhat did he look like?\nI said before, and I will always say, excellent-looking man. Very, very, very uh friendly uh\nlooking. And I mean he, he didn't talk or loudly, he used just the only question asking me if that\nwas my child, and that was all, but (laugh), you know, if you don't know what he is, and it takes\nyou about 20 years until you really know who he was, and who all the others were, there are a lot\nof books and they're about the doctors, and they all go to, to the same, and uh, then I learned. I\nlearned a lot of things afterwards. So much.\nWe have to do on other thing. We have to record just the sound of this room, so you just have to sit\nvery quietly, and not ------------------.\n30 seconds of room tone for Helen Waterford.\nTell me when you start.\nNow.\nThank you.\nYour welcome.",
