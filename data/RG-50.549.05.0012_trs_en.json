        "Q: Okay, so we\u2019re just going to start with a test of your voice. How many days were you in Ireland?",
        "A: 15, plus a traveling day at each end. We were gone for 17 days.",
        "Q: And what kind of... what was the most memorable sights, some of the most memorable sights\nthat you saw?",
        "A: Well, the Cliffs of Moher, and believe it or not my brother.",
        "Q: Oh, your brother?",
        "A: Yeah, my brother happened to be in Ireland at the same time and we managed to meet.",
        "Q: Was that pure coincidence?",
        "A: Pure coincidence, right. I got an e-mail from him two days before we left about my cousin\u2019s cell\nphone number. And I said what is this all about? And called him to find out. I didn\u2019t know he\nwas going to be there and he didn\u2019t know I was going to be there.",
        "Q: That\u2019s something.",
        "A: And we met. That was fun.",
        "Q: Okay, it\u2019s June the 13\" of the year 2000 and we are in the home of Alexander Rosenberg for an\noral history interview that\u2019s mainly going to focus on his experiences after the Holocaust because\nhe has been interviewed by the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation once before. And we\u2019re\nmainly going to be following up on that interview and asking some pre-war and wartime\nquestions to clarify and expand and then moving on into the post-war era. And my name 1s\nArwen Donahue and we are in Louisville, Kentucky, this is tape number one, side A. I guess\nwhat I\u2019 Il do is just briefly summarize for the tape some of what was discussed in your first\ninterview and then you can correct me if I get anything wrong. So, Mr. Rosenberg was born in\n1927 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and moved with his family in 1937 to... well, moved to\nBerlin and between then and 1937 and then moved to Holland in 1937, where he lived until he\nand his family were deported to the Westerbork camp in Holland. And were there, and that was,\nyou said you weren\u2019t certain whether it was 1942 or \u201943, when you were...?",
        "A: That is correct. I keep thinking it was September of *42 and we were there until the beginning of\n\u201843. My brother thinks I\u2019m off by a year, but I think he\u2019s off by a year. I clearly remember\n1\nEaster of \u201844 and we had to have been there about a year by that time, so I think my dates are\ncorrect.",
        "Q: And Easter of \u201844 what you remembered was being in Bergen-Belsen.",
        "A: That is correct. Yeah, it was an air attack... well, a group of B-17\u2019s was returning from a bomb\nrun, possibly Hanover, and the escorting fighter planes came down to have a look. And our\nsuper-smart guards decided to let go with machine guns from the guard towers and they fired\nback. And nobody got hurt, but I clearly remember that incident.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you a little bit more about Bergen-Belsen, but I guess first what we\u2019ll do 1s...\nokay, so you were deported from Westerbork to Bergen-Belsen some undetermined date. And\nthen were in Bergen-Belsen until 1944.",
        "A: \u201c45.",
        "Q: Oh, yeah, around April 10\", 1945 you were away, and it was close to the time... of course. And\nliberated somewhere outside of, somewhere in Germany.",
        "A: Yeah, east, Tribitz (ph) was the name of the little village, which is about ten, 15 miles east of\nTorgau. Torgau is on the river Elbe, where the German and Russian troops met on that same\nday, April the twenty-third, that we were liberated early in the morning by the Russian army.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back then, one question that I had was about your earlier childhood before the war\nstarted. And you had mentioned in your first interview something about your family. Your\nfather was an investment banker. You had a brother who was ten months... was he ten months\nolder or younger?",
        "A: Younger, younger.",
        "Q: Ten months younger. And did you, and you said that your family was not very religious. You\nbasically went to synagogue for high holidays. Was your family really very assimilated?",
        "A: Yes, I would say so, with hindsight in particular I would say so. Yes. My dad certainly\nconsidered himself German first and never expected the violence to get to the level that it did.\nAnd certainly would not affect him since he was a veteran of World War One that was wounded.\nHad volunteered for the army in the first place and was wounded, I believe two or three times\nand had the Iron Cross, which I\u2019ve been trying to locate and can\u2019t find. So that I would say they\nconsidered themselves primarily German and assimilated is the right word.",
        "Q: Did you speak Yiddish or Hebrew?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Were any of your friends, were most of your family friends Jewish and your own personal\nfriends?\n2",
        "A: I think so, but I wouldn\u2019t know for sure. In Amsterdam I would say that was not necessarily the\ncase. But I really don\u2019t remember, I remember only really family from Germany. I don\u2019t\nremember any children from school or acquaintances of my parents. For that matter I wouldn\u2019t\nknow what their religion was. So, I really can\u2019t answer.",
        "Q: And then another question from a different time. When you were living in Amsterdam, I believe\nyou mentioned in the first interview that before your family was actually caught in a round-up\nand deported to Westerbork, you had been caught in another round-up and somehow managed to\nget out. Now that wasn\u2019t clear to me from the first interview what had happened during that\ntime.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember whether I was picked up at home or off the street and taken to a collection\npoint where we were supposed to have been deported somewhere. And I walked away from it,\nand wasn\u2019t challenged in the process and got back home.",
        "Q: So it was just you? It wasn\u2019t members of your family?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think it was just me, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And what happened the second time when your whole family was deported?",
        "A: The second time they, as they always did, they came in the middle of the night and you had five\nminutes to get dressed and get your, your bags were always packed because you knew it could\nhappen. And you were hauled off in a truck along with other people, taken to the railroad\nstation. Put on a train not knowing where to. And then I went to Westerbork, which was the\ntransit camp that the Germans had established; it\u2019s in the eastern part of Holland near Zwolle.\nAnd we were held there for about six months. I don\u2019t think there were any other deportations.\nThere may have been one or two trains before we were hauled out. And I think the general\nimpression was that they were going to go to Theresienstadt. Why I don\u2019t know. But... never\nheard of Belsen before. As a matter of fact, we were one of the earliest ones in there. Belsen\nwas... I\u2019m not sure if it was on a previous tape or not. When we got there, of course it was a\nvery large facility. Part of it was a Russian POW camp. But obviously designed for officers,\nbecause they had little cabins and gravel walks between them and that sort of thing. And then\nthere were two sections to the non-POW prisoners. One was for, called criminals and the second\nsection was for the Jews. And as they started to fill up the Jewish section there were a number of\ntrainfuls of Jews from Holland, a lot of Hungarians, French women. They were the wives of\nofficers who were POW\u2019s from the French Army. And then after the, in \u201844, after the invasion\nof Italy, a lot of Libyan Jews that Rommel had shipped off to Italy and they had been held in\ncamps in Italy and apparently under Red Cross supervision. They all had British uniforms and\nheavy British, woolen coats and the like, and lots of good food.",
        "Q: Yeah, you did talk some about that in the first interview. When you were heading towards\nWesterbork, did you know anything about Westerbork before you arrived?\n3",
        "A: No, never heard of Westerbork. And of course, you know, it\u2019s maybe a two hour train ride at\nmost. No, never heard of it before, at least I hadn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know whether my parents ever had.\nNo idea.",
        "Q: Did you have any idea at the time of what had started to happen to Jews?",
        "A: No, no. They always said we\u2019d be relocating in a work camp or whatever. Or vague promises of\nexchanging for money, that relatives, particularly in America could buy you and so forth. But\nno, nobody had any inkling of what lay ahead in terms of the violence.",
        "Q: And you talked in some detail about what you remembered of your time in Westerbork and that\nyou had been, you had contracted polio. Had you really recovered from the symptoms of that by\nthe time that you were deported to Bergen-Belsen?",
        "A: I would say so. The problem that I had were primarily with the right knee and I still have some\nproblems with that knee. But I was spared the recurrence that apparently happened to older\npeople when it was discovered in the last ten or 15 years or so. It must have been a fairly mild\ncase even though polio, of course back then was rampant.",
        "Q: Tell me if, I have an impression, and tell me if it\u2019s correct. I have the impression that your\nfamily was fairly close-knit and that you\u2019re weren\u2019t necessarily forming strong bonds with other\npeople outside of your family. Is that correct?",
        "A: Yeah, I think so. I don\u2019t think anybody formed any bonds at all. It was a matter of survival and\nI don\u2019t mean to imply that you tried it at the expense of somebody else. But once we realized,\nI\u2019m not sure we really realized, but when it became a matter of trying to survive, you didn\u2019t and\na fellow that was in the bunk either with you or next to you may not wake up in the morning.\nNobody really tried to get attached to anybody else. You didn\u2019t form any bonds other than to,\nyou didn\u2019t try to antagonize anybody, but there wasn\u2019t any real friendships or relationships of\nany kind. Well, there really wasn\u2019t much time either.",
        "Q: Do you remember, was there kind of a gradual sense of deepening horror and insecurity or was\nthere a moment when you really, that you remember having been really, realized what was\nhappening?",
        "A: No, it was, that was, 1n a way the tragedy was that it was a gradual tightening of the noose, so to\nspeak, in that... I remember the first two days in Belsen, there was so much food we couldn\u2019t eat\nit. There was no nutrition, but a liter of soup, even if 1t was only a liter of warm water with\nnothing in it. You\u2019re not used to drinking a liter of volume, a quart. It took two days and you ate\nit all and were hungry. And then the amount of food that you got kept getting less and less. And\ninitially there were, the guards kept changing constantly and surprisingly they kept getting more\nand more vicious rather than less so. The last group which maybe was there for a year, year and\na half, I don\u2019t recall for sure for how long, were World War One veterans who were too old or\ntoo feeble or had been wounded. But they were not suitable for frontline service in the German\nArmy. And you would think that they would be not so hateful. And they weren\u2019t maybe the first\n4\nweek, but they got there very quickly, got to be pretty vicious. And I\u2019m not sure whether they\nwere told to or it was a natural progression as the sensitivities wore off.",
        "Q: So even as a young child you grew somehow hardened to this experience would you say?",
        "A: Well you had to if you wanted to survive. You couldn\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t that you wouldn\u2019t help\nsomebody up if they had fallen, but you had to be very careful. Yes, you probably were...\nmaybe more encapsulated than hardened.",
        "Q: Do you remember private conversations that you were able to have with your family?",
        "A: None, absolutely none. I don\u2019t really remember very much. You remember the weird things but\nnot the everyday. And I\u2019m sure that others would have remembered something totally different\nthat I don\u2019t even remember happening. Like that Easter Sunday, the fighter attack. Well,\nbecause of it, one of the barracks that got shot up was the warehouse. And one thing the\nGermans had were cans of beef in its own juice. And apparently some of those got bullet-riddled\nso they had to use them right away. For a couple of days we actually got food, but then they\nmade up for it for a long time with nothing, because the food was gone again.",
        "Q: Do you remember the day that you were deported from Westerbork to Bergen-Belsen? Anything\nabout that?",
        "A: No, nothing 1n particular. They, I guess in the afternoon the train was pushed into, the empty\ntrain was pushed into the compound. It was passenger cars. Then they posted names, they called\nthem out and you had to be there whenever, an hour or so later. Got on the train, nobody knew\nwhere it was going to go. Supposedly it was just a relocation and they always promised you\nsomething better. Of course it never was. But particularly initially you didn\u2019t know. And I\nguess they had to, that I\u2019m sure explains why there was no really massive resistance. If you\nknew you were going to go to the gas chamber you may as well try and fight it. So you get shot\non the spot. I think that\u2019s why there\u2019s, the general docility of the deportees.",
        "Q: Had transports been leaving from Westerbork for some time before yours left? In other words,\nwere you...",
        "A: We were not the first ones, but yes, but I don\u2019t know whether we were the third or fifth or tenth.\nBut yes, there had been others. And of course you never got any feedback in terms of where\nthey went or how they were treated.",
        "Q: So, you may have had the sense then that at any point your name could be called and you\u2019d be\ngetting on the...",
        "A: Yes, yes, I think so. Yeah, I think it was generally recognized that Westerbork was a transit\ncamp and not a permanent installation. So, I think so.",
        "Q: And about your time in Westerbork, I\u2019m sorry, in Bergen-Belsen. You were there relatively\nearly as you just mentioned. And I wondered if in the long term you feel that having been there\n5\nearly on enabled you to, or was an advantage as far as... you did mention that it was an\nadvantage as far as food. But I wondered if your resistance was stronger and if you knew the\nsystem better?",
        "A: Well system, there was really no system. But yeah, I think so, because the people who came\nvery late, particularly if they did not come from another camp but straight from home so to\nspeak. They were plunged from a normal diet to 200, 300, whatever it was, calories a day. And\nI think they died faster than those of us who, even though they may have had physical, physically\nmore reserves than we did, who our reserves were spent. But we may have been a little bit more\ncautious. And also we were so disease-ridden and I don\u2019t know whether our immune systems\nhad strengthened. Those are medical issues that I don\u2019t know about. People who were plunged\ninto this diarrhea, flea, lice, you know all the vermin. They could not tolerate it as much as those\nof us who were exposed to it more slowly.",
        "Q: To what extent did you have contact with the other members of your family while you were in\nBelsen?",
        "A: We saw them almost every day. My dad and my brother and I, we were in the same barrack. At\nnight the men and the women were separated, but during the day they could mingle freely if you\nwere there. We all were in work details. My mother worked in the, what do you call it?\nHospital, there was no hospital, so the infirmary. So, she physically stayed inside the camp. My\ndad worked, I think he worked the whole time on the shoe disassembly detail. I was on it for a\nlittle while before they shipped me outside to work details outside. My brother was working\noutside the camp too, I think. But I don\u2019t remember where, what details he was assigned to.",
        "Q: And what about, you mentioned having to steal food 1n order to survive. Was that something\nthat the newer prisoners maybe wouldn\u2019t have known how to do or that you kind of eventually\nlearned?",
        "A: Well (laughs)... no, I think everybody... you didn\u2019t steal from each other, generally. Even\nthough it was a matter of survival. I mentioned the Libyans who came from Italy. They came\nwith humongous quantities of food. And we had the opportunity to steal some of it. And we\nactually buried it between the tracks so we could bring it back slowly. The other thing is being\non the outside you were, not always, but sometimes you were patted down, and so you couldn\u2019t\nhave anything on your body that didn\u2019t belong to you. They must have had a bad storm some\nyears prior to establishing the camp. Bergen-Belsen was inside a military training camp, similar\nto Fort Knox. A lot of trees had been, had fallen over in this storm or storms. And they had cut\nthe trees and hauled them off, but there were the roots, you know, standing up. And for a\nnumber of months I worked in the woods digging up those tree stumps, which were then, were\nhauled into... once a week they came out with the horse-drawn wagons and we had to load those\ntree stumps that we had dug up on it and they were hauled in. There was another detail inside\nthe camp that was chopping them up into firewood. That\u2019s the one I was assigned to the day of\nthat air attack. There were blueberries growing in the woods and one, of course we ate as much\nas we could, but also we all had, like a bag that was tied to your belt inside your pants. So you\ncould pick berries and bring them in for the family to eat. So there was that and then, of course,\nif we could we stole the food from the guards. [Laughing.] Boy, they\u2019d take a whipping. They\n6\nwould get their food and most of the time if they didn\u2019t finish it, it just sat there. And if\nsomebody, we got a chance, we would try and get those cans and eat it. But apparently one day\nwe ate them before they had eaten and so we got a pretty good whipping for that. It was\nprobably worth it. It was good food. They didn\u2019t eat too bad. They got pretty decent food.",
        "Q: Was there a real uniformity of cruelty among the guards or were any of them kind at all to you?",
        "A: There was one sergeant, who the rumor had it later on that he was a spy for the British, he\nseemed to be more of a... I wouldn\u2019t want to call him humane, but had a better sense of humor.\nAnd some individual guards were exceedingly cruel and would use any excuse to either kick you\nor club you with a rifle or shoot you, shoot at you. There was one incident that I recall where\none of the guards was giving one of the men, this was in the woods, gave him hell. And he\nresponded in Dutch, \u201cMan, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d And it turned out to be a Dutchman, the SS guy was a\nDutchman, and boy did he beat the living daylights out of him, out of the prisoner. And then\nwhen we came back that evening, the sergeant was there and he, we all had to stand at attention.\nAnd he demanded to know if anything had happened and this turkey said, \u201cYes sergeant, this\nman said I\u2019m crazy.\u201d The sergeant said, \u201cThat man was right, detail dismissed.\u201d We got sent on.\nBut it varied. Some of them would turn their back and just did their job. But they constantly\nchanged. You never knew. You never spoke to any of them. Some of them would drop a\ncigarette butt and walk away. Others would drop the cigarette butt and wait for you to, try to\npick it up and then step on your fingers. You never knew.",
        "Q: What about friendships in Belsen? Did you, was it still pretty much each one for his own?",
        "A: Yeah, you didn\u2019t have time for friendships. You tried to sleep as long as you could in the\nmornings. You had a few minutes to wash your face and get dressed and stand at reveille, that\u2019s\nnot the right word.",
        "Q: Roll call?",
        "A: Roll call, thank you. Until they got done, depends on how they felt whether they got done or not.\nAnd then you went to wherever your work assignment was and then when you came back at\nnight, there could have been another roll call before or after and you may have got something to\neat and you went straight to bed. There was never any time to talk to anybody, unless somebody\nyou worked with, the guard had a back turned you could talk to each other. But most of the time\nyou couldn\u2019t. They wouldn\u2019t let you.",
        "Q: So was it seven days a week, every day the same?",
        "A: Oh yes, pretty much so. Except they got better food on Sundays. They got three cans instead of\ntwo.",
        "Q: Did you have any sense of time or way to keep track of time?",
        "A: Yeah, you knew pretty much what day of the week it was, what time of day it was, I\u2019m not sure.\nI don\u2019t think anybody had watches. Because at noon time they would bring the food out to\n7\nwhere you were working. We may get five or ten minutes to eat and that was it. And sunrise\nand sunset, but other than that whether it was ten of eleven or ten of twelve, nobody cared\nwhether you knew it or not.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you were transferred after you were chopping the stumps into the detail that\nwas meeting the rail cars as they were coming in, and you said something about the Libyan Jews.\nI was wondering if you, were you there when the French women prisoners were coming 1n?",
        "A: No, I think they were already in the camp. Trains came and went all the time, not only with\nprisoners, but also soldiers. They used the same railroad station. Occasionally we would meet\nPOW\u2019s. The Americans always were good. They would throw us packs of Camels where we\ncould get them. But I don\u2019t remember when the French women came. There were only two\nhundred of them, so they may have come in a group with others. Probably since very few of\nthem died, I would think they probably came fairly late. But I just don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: I read something about it, that was partially why I asked. It mentioned they came in the first half\nof \u201844 from Drancy in France. And I just was curious if you remembered anything else.",
        "A: Oh, I would think they would have been longer than that. I\u2019m sure they were there longer than\nthat, because first half of \u00b044... Oh, I\u2019m sorry, forty, yeah it would have been about a year and a\nhalf, a little over. Yeah, that\u2019s about right, I would think. No, I don\u2019t remember, other than I\nknew they were there, and...\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\n8\nTape 1, Side B",
        "Q: Tape one, side B of an interview with Alexander Rosenberg. So you want to just repeat what\nyou had just said?",
        "A: Yeah, later on they brought in women from Auschwitz. And I have to back up here a minute.\nThere was an area where they had a huge circus tent, was set up. That\u2019s where they had the\nshoes. Apparently, I don\u2019t know over how long or what, the Germans had collected shoes for\nrecycling or for donations or whatever the reason they gave to collect them. And then also there\nwere a lot of military boots in there since many of them had bullet holes in them or shrapnel\nholes apparently from either wounded or dead soldiers. And what one of the big, quote,\n\u201cindustries\u201d was, was separating the upper leather from the soles and heels and then separate the\nleather from the rubber heels and/or soles. And that was done in that big tent. And then there\nwas a... the leather soles, I guess, was what they couldn\u2019t reuse. And so they were stacked up in\na humongous pile that was on the main drag and kept getting higher and higher. People, that was\nmy first assignment was working on that. You had a wheelbarrow hauling those, and then you\nhad to stack them so the whole thing wouldn\u2019t just fall over. And they emptied that, emptied that\ntent of all the shoes, and they started to bring in women and they established a separate woman\u2019s\ncamp. And it turned out that one of the first groups in there included the wife, who had been\nwith us, of a fellow. She had worked in the kitchen and she got caught taking some food to try to\ngive to her husband. And first they shipped her to, I guess to Luneburg, to jail. And she was\nthere in jail for a while and the police apparently were trying to protect her from the Gestapo, but\ncouldn\u2019t. And ultimately she was shipped to Auschwitz. But the police had warned her about\nAuschwitz and so as she arrived she managed to walk from the incoming group to an outgoing\ngroup which happened to come to Belsen. And so she was back and she was in that group. And\nshe went to the fence and hollered at somebody to tell her husband that she was back by way of\nAuschwitz. That\u2019s how we knew that group had come from Auschwitz. You could talk to them\nusually across the fence as long as you didn\u2019t get too close to the fence.",
        "Q: Were you mostly speaking in German while you lived in Belsen?",
        "A: Dutch.",
        "Q: Did you use your German in speaking with any of the camp guards?",
        "A: No, you never spoke to the camp guards. And I\u2019m not so sure I still could speak German back\nthen. But no. They may give you an order, but that was it. You never talked to them. There\nwas no conversation at all.",
        "Q: Okay, moving to the time when you were, when you were shipped out of Belsen again, you\ndescribed that time in the first interview and how you had kind of gone on a two-week tour of\nGermany. And seen Berlin completely destroyed.",
        "A: Beautiful sight.\n9",
        "Q: I thought maybe we could just pick up with that time. And I wondered if you could tell a little\nbit more about, well the time of liberation, encountering the Russian soldiers. And you\nmentioned how they were sharing bread and so forth. Were they, the Russians have... had a\nreputation for being sometimes vicious even with the people that they liberated. Did you\nwitness any of that?",
        "A: No. Initially we woke up because of... we were on the train still and the train was stopped. And\nall kinds of noises, and here were the Russian Cossacks just the way they were pictured, you\nknow, in their furs and horseback and rifles slung over their shoulders. And we had learned, like\nyou said, the one word in Russian, chleb (ph), which is bread. And they let us off, and so we\nwent on into town. Then there must have been some discussion about where to go and whoever,\nthey told us just to go and if you need to, throw the Germans out. And we happened to go into a\nfairly large house along with some others, who... the woman claimed they were in the Nazis, but\nher husband was a minister. And he sure was in the SS. And so we didn\u2019t have any\ncompunction about bullying them. Somebody, apparently there must have been some people\nwho spoke Yiddish or either the Russian soldiers spoke Yiddish or they spoke Russian. I\nremember somebody said something about food, and so one of the Russians just pulled out a gun\nand shot a cow and said help yourself. One of the French women recognized the opportunity and\nwent with the frontline unit. And of course, that morning crossed the Elbe River into the\nAmerican part of Germany and managed to get back to Paris, which of course had been liberated\nthe year before. And put an ad in the Paris paper, those who were looking for their wives, and I\ndon\u2019t know whether she mentioned names or it was a specific group. And they responded.\nMany of them were of course in the French Army. And so they got the American Army to send\ntwo of those two and a half ton trucks over to come and get them. And of course, everybody\nwanted to go. And they promised they\u2019d be back and they did. I guess in the euphoria, you\nknow, the war was over by that time. I think we were in Tribitz (ph) for about six weeks. All of\nthe people that were still alive from that train, there were about a thousand of them, were\nevacuated by the Americans and taken to Leipzig, where they had a DP camp. And the Russians\nlet the trucks come in and get them.",
        "Q: What kind of condition were you in at the time of liberation?",
        "A: Barely alive if you can even count that. We had to be very careful. Many people died because\nthey ate things that they couldn\u2019t digest. Their digestive system was so severely weakened or\ndisturbed that a glass of milk would kill you. You just couldn\u2019t tolerate that sort of thing. You\nhad to be very careful that you ate only a little bit and a little bit. And of course a little bit was\nalways more than what we had had for a long time. So that was important that you didn\u2019t... I\nremember getting a hold, we heard that nearby was a Army depot, food depot, and we went\nthere. And sure enough there was. And I got some... I\u2019m not sure I got cans or an open bucket\nof condensed milk, you know, had a lot of sugar in it. And we just couldn\u2019t eat it, not for a\nwhile. Because we couldn\u2019t digest it, it was that rich.",
        "Q: But you were able to walk?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah.\n10",
        "Q: I think you mentioned how much you weighed, did you?",
        "A: Well when I got back to Amsterdam I weighed 78 pounds. So I don\u2019t know how much I\nweighed then, maybe fifty or sixty, strictly skin over bones. If I would have gotten a haircut, I\nwould have taken a pound off. (Laughing. )",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t shave your head while you were in Belsen?",
        "A: Yes, of course.",
        "Q: Were you with your entire family at that point while you were riding the train?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. We were all together.",
        "Q: Was that moment of encountering the Cossack unit, were you aware this 1s it, 1t\u2019s over?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Absolutely, absolutely.",
        "Q: Was that a particularly emotionally charged...\u2019",
        "A: Oh sure. Oh absolutely, joyous. Now you had an opportunity, you might live. Might actually\nsee 1946. Definitely. Yeah, everybody... I\u2019m digressing, but I didn\u2019t know anybody on that\ntrain. I had never run into anybody who was, for that matter, never ran into anybody who was at\nBelsen. And I guess it\u2019s three years ago now. We were, we took a trip, first grand circle tour we\never took. It was a river cruise from Vienna to Amsterdam. It was the first time that I was back\nin Germany and I wasn\u2019t sure whether I could tolerate it or not. We decided on this trip because\nI could just stay on the boat. Didn\u2019t have to go on land where I would have to be in contact with\nany Germans. But one night we\u2019re having dinner with two ladies. One of whom, very\ninteresting woman\u2014she was the one who introduced the Lamaze method to the United States\u2014\nand her cousin. And somehow the other woman was telling us that her daughter was taking her\ndaughter, the woman\u2019s grandchild, to Europe, Amsterdam. They had discussed Anne Frank in\nclass and she wanted to see the Anne Frank house. And she said, \u201cI told my daughter there\u2019s\nalways long lines at the Anne Frank house and if you can\u2019t get in, go next door, that\u2019s where\nyour father was hidden during the war.\u201d And I said to her, \u201cOh, were you in Amsterdam during\nthe war?\u201d And she said yes she was, but her two sisters both got found out. They all had gone\ninto hiding. And they ended up in Belsen. I said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s where I was. I never met anybody\nfrom Belsen.\u201d I said, \u201cAre they still alive?\u201d And she said yeah, the one sister was. But the other\nsister and her husband died after they were liberated. They were hauled by train. \u201cOh,\u201d I said,\n\u201cto Tribitz?\u201d And she said \u201cYes, how do you know?\u201d And I said, \u201cI was on that train also.\u201d\nAnd so that\u2019s as close as I ever came to meeting anybody or knowing anybody. But the irony,\nirony, small world: the sister who was still alive lived next door to my mother\u2019s closest friend in\nNew York. So you never know. But no, I didn\u2019t know anybody and outside of that incident I\nhave never talked to anybody who was there. As a matter of fact, my brother is very active.\nHe\u2019s on the Board of Directors of the Anne Frank house. And I happened to be talking to him\nabout a year or so ago and he told me, and I didn\u2019t realize, I went to school with Anne Frank. I\nwas in the same class, but I don\u2019t remember her at all. And I got to wondering if there is a class\n11\npicture that exists. I\u2019ll have to ask him of the grade school. Because we both should be in it.\nJust curious.",
        "Q: There is another woman that we interviewed last year or so, who went to school with Anne Frank\nas well. I don\u2019t recall her maiden name, but her married name was Barbara Rodbell.",
        "A: There is somebody and my brother knows about it, her, that 1s apparently active in the Anne\nFrank House Foundation and goes around speaking. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the same woman or not.\nBut somebody that was either a friend of Anne Frank or knew her.",
        "Q: And actually I might be mistaken, she might not have been in school, she was a friend of hers.\nHer sister especially. But they might have lived nearby. So, you\u2019re with your family and you\u2019re\nreturning to Amsterdam, and you described some, in the first interview, some of that... you were\nhoused first in the DP camp in Leipzig?",
        "A: First in Leipzig. Essentially what it was, was a military barracks that was used. We could come\nand go. We were not prisoners. They let us come and go. Matter of fact, very grateful about\nmany things. De-lousing with DDT. They sprayed us from head to toe with DDT. Think how\nenvironmentally unacceptable that is today. And I\u2019m still alive in spite of it. But it got rid of the\nfleas and in particular the lice which was so important. But we could come and go as we\npleased. And I don\u2019t remember it was with my brother or some other boys, anyway, young men,\nwe would get on the trolley and the conductor trying to collect money from us and we told him\nwhat he could do, or what we would do. We were pretty nasty. So they left us pretty much\nalone. And then we weren\u2019t there all that long. And then when they were told, they\u2019re going to\ntake us back to Holland, it was on a Red Cross train. We wouldn\u2019t go onto the beds because they\nwere absolutely starched, bleached, perfectly white sheets. And here we were, in spite of getting\nregular baths, pretty filthy. We only had one set of clothes and shoes. I\u2019m sure we had shoes. I\nhad a woman\u2019s blouse, because I remember it, Army blouse, because it buttoned the wrong way.\nBut they weren\u2019t even able to fit, not small enough. They insisted we get in the beds and don\u2019t\nworry about getting them dirty. And then they brought us bread that was as white as the sheets\nwere. Couldn\u2019t believe that. But anyway they took us back to Holland and they put us in a\nconvent in southern Holland, where the Dutch then sorted things out. And you had to have a\nplace to stay before they\u2019d send you back to Amsterdam. And that was taken care of.",
        "Q: While you were still in Germany did you witness anybody, any of the former prisoners taking\nrevenge on Germans or did you desire that yourself?",
        "A: No. Well, I suppose if you would have known somebody or run into somebody that you knew\nhad been a, recognized a prison guard, I don\u2019t think he would have survived. But that would\nhave been such a chance encounter. No. Well, for one thing we were wearing what looked like\nAmerican Army uniforms because that\u2019s the only clothing, I guess, that we were given. I\u2019m not\nsure what else the Red Cross had that they gave us. So that the Germans gave us a pretty wide\nberth. Because they didn\u2019t have anything to do anyway. Things were pretty chaotic.",
        "Q: Do you recall how you felt at the time? Angry or happy or any hopes?\n12",
        "A: Hopeful is probably the best. No, I don\u2019t think anger set in until later. At that point you\u2019re just\ntrying to revive, was probably the closest word to describe it. You\u2019re still fairly weak. You\u2019re\nbeginning to get a little better. You can eat a little bit more. Beginning to feel a little better all\nthe time. And at this point you\u2019re just trying to survive. You\u2019re really not thinking about the\nfuture, what you want to do, or what you have to do or what you\u2019re going to do. You\u2019re still\npreoccupied with eating, primarily.",
        "Q: And getting enough to eat?",
        "A: And getting, yeah, yeah, sure. And we did.",
        "Q: What about your, when you returned to Amsterdam and just adjusting to daily life again?",
        "A: Well, initially of course, I think we were all spread out. I stayed with one family who was a\nfriend of my parents. My brother stayed with a friend of his. His closest friend was an\nAmerican. His father was the distributor for Holland and Belgium of RKO, the movies. And I\nthink he stayed with them. And my parents stayed with, I don\u2019t even remember who it was.\nSomebody. So we were in different locations. We weren\u2019t really, and this was like, talking the\nsummer of \u201845. There really wasn\u2019t much going on. Trying to see about getting back into\nschool. My high school class had graduated. I think we may have actually been back in\nAmsterdam when the graduation was, but of course they wouldn\u2019t give me my diploma. Hadn\u2019t\nbeen there in four years. Four out of six wasn\u2019t good enough. And so my mother was making\narrangements to see what the school about me trying out, well both of us, trying to get back into\nschool in the Fall. What the requirements would be, and trying to line up a tutor and a place to\nlive. And I think, somebody... the Dutch did things fairly reasonably. The person that was\nliving in our house had gotten there in good faith. He did not know, or they did not know that\nwas the property or the residence of deported Jews. And so what they did, if the person had\nsomething in good faith, so you don\u2019t have, just transfer the victim from one person to another.\nThey could stay there. So my parents found a place to live. And I don\u2019t know where the\nfurniture came from, whether that was, whether those were donations or purchases or whether\nthey had given some of that furniture to somebody to hide. But anyway we ultimately had an\napartment where we lived. And then school started pretty soon. We had a tutor trying to get us\nup to speed, because I was allowed into the senior class on the condition that if I didn\u2019t measure\nup, that the school would have the right not to let me take the comprehensive exams at the end of\nthe year. Well that\u2019s the deal they made with my parents, obviously. Apparently I did all right\nbecause... and I do remember having to go to a couple of teachers after classes for additional\ninstruction. It\u2019s kind of tough to pick up solid geometry if you haven\u2019t had trigonometry. So,\ntrying to catch up.",
        "Q: Was it easy for you to focus on studies after what you had been through? Was that a challenge at\nall?",
        "A: I never thought of it in those terms, but I suppose so because that\u2019s the only thing we did, was to\ngo to school. And you come home, and you may have had to stay after class for additional\ninstruction. And depending on\u2014I\u2019m not sure whether you\u2019re familiar with the European\nsystem\u2014it\u2019s not ten minutes worth of homework. You spent every night doing homework, and\n13\nwe went to school on Saturdays half a day. And so maybe we were allowed to go and play for\nten minutes before dinner. Or if we happened to get done by eight o\u2019clock, the homework, we\ncould play for a half hour before going to bed. But it, it was all-consuming, essentially, except\nmaybe for the weekends.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t, you weren\u2019t necessarily ever... was there a point were you remember you started\nreally reflecting on what had happened to you?",
        "A: No, not really. It really would have been pointless anyway. The Dutch had been exceedingly\nhelpful, and trying to shield people. And not personally, but from others that they tried to hide\nan awful lot of Jews. The population as a whole, with minor exceptions, had always been very\nsupportive. And now you're back after the war and you\u2019re no longer wearing the star, you\u2019re no\nlonger distinguishable from the rest of the population. And so there was no need for anybody to\neither bend over backwards or kick you in the shins. So, no, I don\u2019t think, as a matter of fact, I\nreally haven\u2019t dwelled on it much all my life. I have a cousin who was a professional Holocaust\nsurvivor and I always detested that. It was one of those things that happened, nothing you can do\nabout it. I\u2019m not ashamed of it certainly. I\u2019m not proud of it. I mean, nothing you can do about\nit. I suppose like most unpleasant things, you try and put them out of your mind.",
        "Q: This maybe is kind of a digression, going out of the chronology, but was there a point where you\nreally felt compelled personally to talk about your experiences to anyone? Like that would help\nyou or help other people to...?",
        "A: No, never did. I\u2019ve never been much for psychologists. (Laughing.) No, I never, and I suppose\na lot of the reason I don\u2019t remember a lot of things because they\u2019re probably suppressed\nmemory, and why bring it up? What purpose does it serve? I know a friend of mine keeps after\nme to try and write a book. And I don\u2019t, I say absolutely not. One, there\u2019s not enough to fill a\npage, but aside from that, no, I don\u2019t... matter of fact, there\u2019s somebody come from the\nHolocaust Museum this month. Did you see that?",
        "Q: I heard something about it.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s, Goldfarb, is that his name?",
        "Q: Marvin, Martin Goldfarb.",
        "A: Yeah, whatever. It 1s Goldfarb, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Q: I\u2019m pretty sure. I\u2019m blanking on his name right now, but I know him.",
        "A: Yeah, okay. That\u2019s okay. Okay, that\u2019s all right. I got invitation, I don\u2019t know where it came\nfrom. It was an invitation to the Holocaust survivors in the second generation. And I was\ndebating whether to go or not. Because one thing, I don\u2019t know any of them that are here. And\nI\u2019m not so sure whether I care to or not. I haven\u2019t made up my mind. I may decide on the last\nminute whether I will or not.\n14",
        "Q: Okay, we have another minute or so on this tape. Well, that\u2019s interesting. Your brother has, it\nsounds like, taken kind of an active role in something that\u2019s related to being a Holocaust\nSUIVIVOT.",
        "A: Yeah. And that came about because he saw an article in a paper about the Anne Frank\nFoundation and somebody\u2019s name who was, I guess the Chairman of the Board, who lived near\nwhere he lived in Vermont. And he had never heard of the man before and he called him to meet\nhim, just out of curiosity. And apparently they got friendly and he got him involved in the Anne\nFrank Foundation and he\u2019s on the Board of Directors now, has been for a few years. And he\ngoes around the country every so often making speeches and fundraising and that sort of thing.\nAnd I\u2019m not sure whether he knew, because looking at his tape, I\u2019m not sure whether he\nmentioned the name of the school that we went to or not. Anyway I don\u2019t remember what it is.\nBut it was obviously the same school that Anne Frank went to. The only thing I remember about\nthat school is we made honey in the Fall. They had bee hives on the roof. I was thinking about\nthat earlier, I don\u2019t know why. Whenever it was ready we would go upstairs and they would take\nthe hives, the honeycombs out and put them in a centrifuge and we made honey. And I guess\ncarved up the combs and sold it with the wax and the honey. That\u2019s about the only thing I\nremember. (Laughing.) There was something else, too, animal-related about that grade school.\nCan\u2019t think of it.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go ahead and change the tape.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\n15\nTape 2, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side A. And would you say a little bit more about that? I was\nwondering about, continuing in this same vein of digression, I was wondering about your feeling\nas a Holocaust survivor, whether you feel that there\u2019s any benefit to be derived from identifying\nyourself that way? With the work that your brother... (Rosenberg bursts out laughing) ...it\u2019s a\nstrange way of putting the question, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: No, I tell you reason I am laughing 1s I suppose if you look for sympathy it would be. But no, I\ndon\u2019t. I\u2019ve never found any benefit to either, occasionally if I get pushed I will mention it. I\nnormally don\u2019t as a matter of conversation. We were in Spain and there was a couple in that\ngroup that we were with, who were Germans, who had retired. He had worked for General\nMotors and they lived in Windsor, across in Canada. And they had invited a friend of theirs\nfrom Germany to come down and join us. We were on the trip up to Granada to see the\nAlhambra. And on the way back we were sitting at a table and this man came wandering in by\nhimself. I said to him in German, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d He complained, \u201cNot very well.\u201d He\ndidn\u2019t speak English, and so unless his friends were around... blah, blah, blah. And then on a\nstop on the way back, we were standing in line together and he said, \u201cHow come you speak\nGerman so well?\u201d And I was debating what to say. I just said, \u201cI was in a concentration camp.\u201d\nAnd I totally devastated that man. And that evening he sought me out in the bar and came to\napologize. I said, \u201cHey, it\u2019s not your fault, you were too young.\u201d This man was in his fifties, he\nmay have been a child at the time. \u201cOh, please come to Germany,\u201d he would host us, et cetera,\net cetera. So I\u2019m always very careful because there\u2019s no need to upset people that have no, you\nknow, no responsibility. I\u2019m not looking for an advantage. So no, I rarely volunteer the\ninformation.",
        "Q: What about, you\u2019re doing this interview today. You did one other interview. What has made\nyou agree to do those?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s the neo-Nazism that says it never happened. And I think there needs to be as much\nevidence as possible to show that it really did happen. And that those many of us who survived\nare perfectly normal people. Or what passes for normal, at least I think so. (Laughing.) And\ndon\u2019t all go around looking, \u201cHey, you owe me a favor because I survived.\u201d But it\u2019s not a bias\nfree society. Until whatever it is, say five years ago... I\u2019ve been wanting to go and visit my\ngrandparent\u2019s grave. I just couldn\u2019t bring myself the thought of going to Germany. One,\nbecause it\u2019s Germany; and two, that I wasn\u2019t sure whether I could control my temper if\nsomebody were to say something to me that would set me off. And so we decided on a trial and\nthat was we went to Switzerland for a week with day trips out of Lucerne. And the first trip was\nto the Black Forest. You get out of it for lunch and you get back on the bus. The bus was the\nsafe haven. And then another day for a couple of hours. And it went all right. I didn\u2019t feel\nparticularly bad or tense. But on that boat trip, after Cologne it got to me suddenly, and I had to\nget out of there. And I actually during dinner, got up, went up on top of the boat, on the top\ndeck, to make sure we passed that border back into Holland. Because I just got obsessed all of a\nsudden, panicky. And haven\u2019t been back since.\n16",
        "Q: What about your children? Have you... people who are as far as can be from Neo-Nazis: do you\nfeel like it\u2019s important to you to leave them some kind of information or some kind of knowledge\nabout your life and your experiences?",
        "A: Well, they know about it, of course. At least one daughter, I think has... no, I think they all have\ncopies of the tape of the interview. The tape that one of my... it\u2019s really my father\u2019s cousin that\nwas much more informative than mine or, for that matter, my brother\u2019s. This fellow got to\nBelsen the day before the liberation or two days before the liberation. The Swedes took him out,\nsent him to Sweden. He was in a Swedish hospital for a year. But he decided to use that year to\nwrite down everything he could remember. And then spend the rest of his life filling in the\ndetails that he didn\u2019t remember, and try and get the... and he wrote a book. The original was\npublished in German and just before he died, supposedly it was published, finally got published\nin English. And I never did get a copy of it. I'll have to ask my cousin for it. But I got a copy of\nhis tape. But he remembers names and dates and... and he went from one labor camp to another\nlabor camp, and the name of the commander of the camp and all that kind of stuff that I have no\nidea about and really, don\u2019t really care. And yeah, my kids know, but they also really have no\nrelation to it. My youngest daughter couldn\u2019t, when I said something to her about the Vietnam\nWar, she says, \u201cBut Dad I was only six then.\u201d You know, so it\u2019s all ancient history. Just like\nWorld War One is ancient history to me. I know about it. I\u2019m a bit of a history buff and I\nwanted to see the Bosporus. That\u2019s a World War One site. The British took one hell of a beating\nthere. That was Churchill\u2019s doing. And went to Yalta, wanted to see that. But no, they\u2019re not\nreally interested.",
        "Q: Did you intentionally at some point start telling your children about...?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: ...your history? It just kind of gradually...?",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure. My wife may have told them something or my mother may have. It may have\ncome out, a comment here or there or something that occurred that made me bring it up or a\nprogram that I watched. Spielberg had a program, was it last week or week before last, it was on\nHBO. I was going to tape it, but I don\u2019t have HBO. When there\u2019s something on the Holocaust I\nusually tape it. More for my information than to show others.",
        "Q: And I\u2019m curious about what you mentioned a little earlier about someone who you know who\u2019s a\nprofessional Holocaust survivor.",
        "A: That was my cousin.",
        "Q: Your cousin?",
        "A: Well, my father\u2019s cousin.",
        "Q: And is that something... and you mentioned that it bothers you. Can you say more about what\nbothers you about that or what you think the danger of that 1s?\n17",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s danger in it, it may bore people to death, but you can do that with other\nthings, too. That was the singular defining incident of his life. And everything is being related\nto that. I... that may have been the most important event in my life, even though I don\u2019t think\nso. I think there are much more important things, I mean it\u2019s part of my history. I was fortunate\nthat I survived it, and I moved on. I don\u2019t particularly dwell on it. Or try and say, \u201cNow wait a\nminute, I married that woman because I didn\u2019t see that woman...\u201d or you know, and relate it to\nthe Holocaust. It has nothing to do with it. Well, in his case everything was. It came up in\nevery conversation.",
        "Q: And have you had the experience as somebody who has survived the Holocaust, of people maybe\nassuming that because you are a Holocaust survivor that was the defining event of your life and\ntherefore kind of maybe not seeing you clearly?",
        "A: No, because I doubt whether anybody that would know me or that I would know, would find out\nthat I am a Holocaust survivor until they really have known me for a long time. Because it\u2019s, see\nI don\u2019t normally bring it up. Not unless something happens to make it pop up for some reason or\nanother, inadvertently, but no, I wouldn\u2019t think so. They just see the lack of hair. (Laughing. )",
        "Q: Is being Jewish important to you?",
        "A: Yeah, definitely. I am the only Jew in my family.",
        "Q: Is that right?",
        "A: Yes. (Laughing.) And I am proud of it.",
        "Q: So, what does that mean to you, to be the only Jew in your family?",
        "A: Oh, I am saying it jokingly and seriously. My wife is Episcopalian. Our children were baptized\nin the Episcopalian church, but are not particularly religious. My youngest daughter was married\nin the Catholic church and now her children were just baptized in the last month, because they\nwant... the older one now is going to first grade. And with the public schools here in Louisville\nin such a mess, they want to put the boy into parochial school. And they belong to a parish and\napparently they are now going to church regularly, which 1s fine. I have no problem with it one\nway or the other. Our oldest daughter was married for the first time in the Episcopal cathedral in\nLexington, which as you may know is so orthodox that the mass was in Latin.",
        "Q: They don\u2019t even do that in Catholic church.",
        "A: I know. (Laughing.) That marriage didn\u2019t last and her current husband is a Baptist. I\u2019m not sure\nthat they are going to church, but their son goes to Bible school. He was in, going to public\nschool, not this Fall, but he was in a Baptist kindergarten and preschool. And the other one\ndoesn\u2019t have any children and as far as I know, they were married by a minister who was, whom\nthey knew. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying that.\n18",
        "Q: So, what does it mean to you, can you say what it means to you to be Jewish?",
        "A: No, not really. No more so than what it means being a chemist or of German extraction or\nmarried or grandfather or anything else. You better not say anything anti-Semitic or Ill blow\nyour head off. (Laughing.) But other than that, no.",
        "Q: It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean keeping certain traditions or going to synagogue?",
        "A: Not really, no, no. Keep certain traditions, but I... bit of a pragmatist, and I\u2019m not all that\ntradition-bound. I think the dietary laws make good sense from a health perspective, but I don\u2019t\nparticularly find the need to avoid eating shrimp.",
        "Q: What about, do you think of Judaism as a... when you say it\u2019s important to you to be Jewish, is it\nas a religion?",
        "A: Well it\u2019s really more ethnic than a religion. Did you by chance see that program on trying to find\nthe lost tribes a few weeks ago on PBS? Fascinating program. To some people being Jewish is a\nreligion, obviously, Sammy Davis Jr. is probably the... Elizabeth Taylor. But to... I would think\nmost Jews, it\u2019s more ethnic than religious. You can\u2019t help whatever your racial or ethnic\nbackground is. I\u2019m not hiding it and I\u2019m not flaunting it. So, I don\u2019t care. You know, whether\nsomebody knows or doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care personally, what I mean is I\u2019m not\nconcerned about it.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re not a particularly religious person?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m not.",
        "Q: Okay. Let\u2019s go pick up the timeline again.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: We left off in Amsterdam just after the war. You\u2019re going back to school, you\u2019re working hard\nat being a student. And as far as, you were talking about being hopeful at the time. What were\nyou, do you recall what you were hopeful for, what you really wanted for the rest of your life?",
        "A: Well, initially to graduate from high school, you know, trying to pass the exams or get far\nenough along that I would be allowed to take the exams. And then once they decided that I\ncould, then of course sweating like everybody else to pass them. But I did. I wanted to become\na chemist or a chemical engineer. And after I graduated from high school I went to Delft,\nTechnical Institute in Delft for one year, \u201846, \u201847, to study chemical engineering. Then much to\nmy dismay, my parents decided to come to the United States and I didn\u2019t want to go. Well for\none thing, you had to leave your friends, just getting into the swing of things having done my\nfreshman year in college. But they didn\u2019t give me a choice, and so then of course the logical\nthing was... a lot of my mother\u2019s family and some of my dad\u2019s family were over here, had been\nover here for years, so we came over here in \u201847, Memorial Day, \u201847.\n19",
        "Q: Did you consider not coming and staying? By then you were an adult.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. Not coming, I said, I wasn\u2019t given that option. I said, \u201cOkay, Ill go with you,\nbut I\u2019m going to go back.\u201d You get used to... it\u2019s a changed situation, and I probably didn\u2019t\nreally give it much serious thought after some months or some years to go back. Go ahead.",
        "Q: Did you have any... what were your notions about the U.S. at that time?",
        "A: Well, you know the only notions you have are the cowboys, and the skyscrapers of New York.\nAnd since it was Memorial Day when we got here, the night before traveling along the South\nshore of Long Island you saw the fireworks. Of course, you didn\u2019t know what was going on.\nMemorial Day didn\u2019t mean anything to us. Then it was hot. I\u2019m not sure if it was hot for\nMemorial Day, but like it is right now. It was one of these early hot spells. Our, my mother\u2019s\nbrothers came and picked us up, met us at the boat, and took us over to my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s\napartment.",
        "Q: Where was that?",
        "A: In New York, New York City. My mother was one of 13 brothers and sisters. And one, two,\nthree... four sisters were in the United States, and three of her brothers. And the three, three\nsisters and the three brothers lived in New York City. And my dad\u2019s sister, I think she may still\nhave been in Rochester at the time. I\u2019m not sure. And matter of fact, they had written, my\nmother\u2019s brothers had gotten an apartment for us, which was across the street from one and next-\ndoor to one of the other ones. In Queens, in New York City. And so we lived there. I guess, but\nI\u2019m not sure, we stayed with my aunt for a while until our furniture arrived, because I\u2019m not sure\nit was on the same boat. It came later. I don\u2019t remember, it\u2019s been a long time.",
        "Q: So, you came by ship?",
        "A: Oh Yeah, yeah. The Veyndam (ph) was the name of the ship.",
        "Q: Dutch?",
        "A: It was a Holland-America Line freighter built in 1914. I looked it up recently, that\u2019s why I can\nspout that stuff. (Laughing.) It was requisitioned during World War Two and was used as a\ntroop ship. And then this was the last trip across the Atlantic to the States to be reconverted, to\nhave all of the bunks and all that stuff taken out and be converted back to a freighter and was\nretired in 1954. I couldn\u2019t remember the name of the ship. I looked it up in the New York\nTimes a year or two ago. They had the comings and goings of all the ships and they listed them\nin the New York Times. Listed as May 30\", Memorial, May 30\" with 112 passengers.",
        "Q: You remember anything about the journey?",
        "A: Oh yes. (Laughing.) The... I\u2019m not sure how many, 20 or so people could live in the cabins and\nmy parents had a cabin. Most of us were down in the hold and like all troop ships, you know,\nseven stacks. And we used the bottom one or the second bottom one, there was nobody there.\n20\nAnd it was pretty good until the weather got rough. We really got tossed around and that day\nthat we got tossed around the dinner was bacon and beans. I just stayed in the bunk. But one\nfellow, he was a big eater. He never missed a meal and he came charging down the steps, threw\nhis teeth on the bunk and ran back up and fed the fish. Then he came back, got his teeth, and\nwent back to eat the second time. (Laughing.) That\u2019s about all. It was a long trip. It was 14\ndays, the ship was slow. But that\u2019s all I remember. It was unremarkable. Left from Antwerp,\nstopped in South Hampton to Hoboken, which was the Holland-American Line terminal. Ellis\nIsland had been closed about a month or two earlier, so we didn\u2019t come through Ellis Island.",
        "Q: Remember first impressions of New York?",
        "A: Hot, hot and dirty. Of course the high rise, and the frantic activity, cars going everywhere.",
        "Q: How was your English?",
        "A: Non-existent or very poor. Well, I had high school English. But didn\u2019t have much choice, had\nto learn in a hurry, because I got a job within a week as a lab technician at Mount Sinai Hospital.\nPaid the glorious wage of 100 dollars a month. And we had to work half day Saturdays. And\nthen we took, had to take... we didn\u2019t have to, we took turns taking calls on the weekends. That\npaid an extra six dollars. And the girls all were more interested in going to the beach, so I took\nall of their calls, because I needed the six dollars more than I needed a suntan. And then I got a\nticket. Two weeks in this country and I got a ticket. That was Saturday morning, going to work,\nI was going down the subway and a cop stopped me. I didn\u2019t know what he wanted. I didn\u2019t\nunderstand enough of what he was saying. And so I pulled my passport out and I opened it on\nthe immigration stamp to show him I don\u2019t, you know it was two weeks. I did understand what\nidentification was. And so he proceeded to write and tore this thing out, gave me my passport\nback and tore this thing out and told me it was a ticket. Well the only meaning of the word ticket\nI knew was admission to a theater. Didn\u2019t want to, don\u2019t have time to go. Tried to explain...\nfinally made me take it, he told me I didn\u2019t have to go myself, I could give it to somebody else.\nWhen I got to work I tried to tell the fellow I work with, I asked him if he wanted the ticket. He\nsaid what for? (Laughing.) I told him I didn\u2019t know, but a cop had given it to me. So he\nexplained to me that I had gotten a ticket for whatever, well, it was June and first of July was the\nend of the fiscal year and he had to make his quota, so he was writing tickets furiously and I\nguess I looked like a good sucker for one. And when I became a citizen you have to list all non-\nmoving traffic violations excepted. So I went back to court to find out what the heck I had done.\nWhatever it was, violation of city code something or other, disposition, two dollars. Fine of two\ndollars, that was it. But it\u2019s on my records.",
        "Q: It\u2019s not on your records as having, the infraction was not listed on your records?",
        "A: No, I had to list it on my citizenship application.",
        "Q: I mean the cause of the ticket being given.",
        "A: Oh it listed whatever it was, the code violation, but I have no idea what it was that I did. You\nknow, hopscotch down the steps into the subway, who knows what it was. The reason you had\n21\nto be so careful... in the \u201830s and \u201840s, well prior to let\u2019s say the \u201850s and \u201860s, anti-Semitism\nwas an acceptable feeling in this country. And the State Department was so strongly anti-\nSemitic, they saw it as their function to keep as many Jews out as they could, not to try and\nrescue as many and let them in. And the Immigration Service didn\u2019t help matters either. An\nuncle of mine when he went for his hearing was asked for his convictions. He said he didn\u2019t\nhave any. The judge says, \u201cThink it over and come back in six months.\u201d This went on twice.\nYou know, what the hell are you talking about? Well, it turned out that there was somebody\nwith the same name, apparently, who had gotten a parking ticket in Buffalo, New York. And\nthey accused him of lying because he didn\u2019t list it. And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t even know where\nBuffalo is and I don\u2019t have an automobile.\u201d So they finally... but his citizenship was delayed for\na year over something like that.",
        "Q: And you think it was because he was Jewish that they...?",
        "A: Oh sure. There wasn\u2019t any... they put a lot of barriers in the way. Of course then too, you\nknow, the rules were a little different. You had to be a resident for five years. You had to\ndemonstrate your fluency in English, not like today where they\u2019 Il give it to you in Spanish or\nFrench or whatever. And lastly you had to demonstrate a knowledge of American history. And\nthe Daughters of the American Revolution used to give courses in American history for\nforeigners. Who was the 23\" president? They asked my dad to name the 13 original colonies.\nAnd he got as far as one or two, I remember, and the judge said, \u201cGuess I asked the wrong\nperson, you tell me.\u201d Well, I started out with Georgia going up the coast, because I could never\nremember whether it\u2019s Maine or New Hampshire. (Laughing.) And he stopped me when I got\nto Vermont. So I got off easy. I got at least 12 of the 13. And he asked me, I still don\u2019t know\nwhy that was the wrong answer, he asked me, \u201cWhy do we celebrate the Fourth of July?\u201d I said,\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s Independence Day.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the right answer. I\u2019m not sure what it was\nsupposed to be. But they were pretty strict and... depending on the judge, most of those were\nnot all that bad. But there was... well Dupont did not hire its first Jew until World War Two.\nAnd when I graduated from college in \u201854, Armstrong-Quartz (ph) still didn\u2019t hire Jews. It was\nthat pervasive still.",
        "Q: When was your citizenship?",
        "A: \u201852. Matter of fact, my brother couldn\u2019t become a citizen because he was not in the country.\nYou had to be in the country. He was in the military. He had been drafted. He couldn\u2019t become\na citizen because he was not in the United States.",
        "Q: So you in those years, those first years that you came to the U.S... you came in \u201847?",
        "A: \u201847.",
        "Q: Were you, you were aware of having to be very cautious as a Jew?\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\n22\nTape 2, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape two, side B.",
        "A: Well in New York there really was very little that you could or couldn\u2019t do as such. But being\nignorant as to the American way, I asked a girl in one of my classes at City College for a date\nand she turned me down flat. She was Italian and I was Jewish and it just didn\u2019t go. I didn\u2019t\nknow that. I applied for admission to Columbia and RPI, Rensselaer in Albany, Schenectady.\nAnd I was turned down. In one instance, the Dutch quota was filled. You know, all kinds of\nbarriers that existed that you ran into either unwittingly or stupidly, whichever, for me mostly\nunwittingly. Natives would have known better and would have avoided the... either\nembarrassment or whatever you want to call it.",
        "Q: What were your parents doing once they arrived here?",
        "A: My... you were, you had to come with a job offer and the company that my dad had worked for\nin Berlin in the thirties had a... what was then a branch in New York, which then or now was of\ncourse was the only office. And they had offered him a job there and so he went to work there\nthe second day we were here or after the first week we were here. And I had gotten the job at\nMount Sinai Hospital. My brother got a job somewhere, I don\u2019t remember. And so everybody\nworked.",
        "Q: And you all shared an apartment?",
        "A: Yes, we lived with my parents and since we were... I\u2019ve been thinking about that, and of course,\nnever asked. But we were expected to contribute to the household. And I\u2019m not sure whether\nthat was a matter of need or a matter of discipline. That you live here, you gotta pay for it. Earn\nmoney, your share, which was no problem. Once in the Fall, I started at night at the City College\nof New York, went to night school and worked during the day. Did that all the way through.",
        "Q: How did you end up feeling about this country? You hadn\u2019t been happy to come. Did you end\nup feeling, at some point feel at home here?",
        "A: Oh yeah, very quickly, certainly. And I don\u2019t want you to think that I was paranoid about these\nbarriers that you ran into. It was just ignorance, you learn from it. One of my uncles took me\naside and gave me the facts of life. That there are some things that Jews can\u2019t do in this country.\n(Clock chimes with bird-call.)",
        "Q: Cardinal? That means it\u2019s three o\u2019clock?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. (Laughing.) I guess you didn\u2019t hear the two o\u2019clock bird. It\u2019s like the rules in,\nwhether you like them or not you have to abide by them. You\u2019re not supposed to drive more\nthan 65 miles an hour. And then New York being such a big place you can avoid unpleasantries.\nThere\u2019s no need to go looking for them.\n23",
        "Q: Did it strike you as hypocritical? Or did you think about that? This so-called Home of the Free,\ndiscriminating against...?",
        "A: No, frankly, no, no, I really never thought about it. There are some things that you... I guess it\nreally wasn\u2019t very important. They were minor inconveniences. It wasn\u2019t any big deal. I can\u2019t\ncomplain about that.",
        "Q: So, what happened next? You\u2019re going to school at night and you\u2019re working in the day. And...",
        "A: Trying to get better jobs. Getting paid more. And then I, of course, the Korean War started and I\nhad to go for my physical. I was classified 1-A to begin with before I ever took the physical.\nAnd then trying to get a student deferment. I had a very nasty Draft Board that made all kinds of\nunpleasant remarks when I went for a hearing for a student deferment, about \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter,\ndon\u2019t you want to shoot some Chinks?\u201d You know, that sort of thing. I graduated in January of\n\u201851. And went on to Graduate school, and they just gave me fits all the way through. They\nwould re-classify me 1-A, had to appeal it. Then they would get it back to a student deferment\nfor six months, but retroactive to a date of... so half the time I was deferred, half the time I\nwasn\u2019t, which was a real distraction while in school. But I made it through all right. Didn\u2019t even\nthink about it, I went to work for Shell Oil Company and that was deferrable employment\nbecause of the oil industry. Of course the war was pretty well over by that time anyway, \u201854.",
        "Q: Would you have felt willing to go and fight in the Korean War if you hadn\u2019t been involved in\nthis student... or what were your feelings behind that?",
        "A: Not very happy about it. I wasn\u2019t even a citizen. As a matter of fact, my brother, who was\ndrafted, he did not go to school, he was actually sent to Germany. And when this citizenship\nhearing came up, he couldn\u2019t, because he was overseas. I mean, that\u2019s the most preposterous\nthing. He was in the U.S. Army therefore he couldn\u2019t become a citizen. But not particularly\nhappy about it. Wasted enough time in my life already without having to serve a few more years\nin the Army. But no, I wasn\u2019t particularly, I was not unwilling. I mean, I wasn\u2019t going to refuse.\nBut I wasn\u2019t going to volunteer either.",
        "Q: When and how did you meet your wife?",
        "A: We lived in the same house. Well, I have to say that I was too poor to live in the dormitory and\nthree of us shared an apartment.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, what school was it?",
        "A: This was at Duke, at Duke University in Durham. And this is one of these old, you know, like\nold Louisville. Big homes and they made it into a number of apartments. We had one apartment\nupstairs, it was a Divinity student and his wife. Another apartment upstairs and the landlady\nrented out one of the apartments downstairs to Alice and her roommate. That\u2019s how we met. I\nwas at Duke, she was working. She was a lab technician working at the VA hospital.",
        "Q: And what was your major at Duke?\n24",
        "A: Chemistry.",
        "Q: A particular type of chemistry?",
        "A: Analytical chemistry. That\u2019s what I used to do for a living for a long time.",
        "Q: Had you thought... well it sounds like you didn\u2019t have any feelings as far as dating a Jew versus\na non-Jew or caring a lot on that?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Was your family equally indifferent?",
        "A: I think so. My dad certainly was, my mother, I\u2019m not so sure. I don\u2019t think any girl would have\nbeen good enough for my mother.",
        "Q: Did you ever talk within your family about what had happened during the war or was this kind of\na moot subject?",
        "A: No, oh no, no. They uh, no, certainly not. They, well as I mentioned, my mother is one of\nthirteen children, two of them were killed in World War One. Of the remaining eleven, three\nbrothers were here and four sisters. And the one brother was picked up during the Kristallnacht\nthing in \u201838 and taken to Dachau. And then was released because he had pneumonia, so he\nwouldn\u2019t die in a concentration camp, so they could count him as having released him, rather\nthan having him die there. And he died at home. And they decided they better get their son out\nbefore he\u2019s going to get it too. But my mother\u2019s sister-in-law with her daughter stayed and they\nperished. And another sister and her husband had moved to Belgium in the early \u201830s. He was a\nvery prosperous furniture manufacturer. They had two daughters. And they actually helped one\nof the other sisters\u2019 children, they managed to get out, I guess, as late as \u00b042, by way of Belgium\nand through Portugal. They stayed for a while with them. But that couple with their children,\nthe sister, they perished. As a matter of fact, I had documentation of them at one time, their death\ncertificates. And then on my father\u2019s side, my grandmother, my dad\u2019s mother, lived in\nAmsterdam also. And she had cardiac problems so bad, she couldn\u2019t have walked from here to\nthe front door without taking nitroglycerine, but she survived the cattle car ride to the gas\nchambers and died at Auschwitz. And one of, his sister was here, but his brother was still in\nGermany and he perished. And so no, we, and fortunately for my mother\u2019s, my grandmother,\nmy maternal grandmother, she died in late \u201844, so she never did find out what happened to her\nchildren, those that were in Europe. But no, that was a common topic of conversation in the\nfamily. My... the son that was sent over, he went back to his hometown looking for his parents\nor for his mother and sister. He was in the Army. Some of my other cousins that were in the\nArmy went looking for the relatives and for us. Of course once we got back to Holland, my\nparents, my mother contacted her sisters, and let them know that we had survived. Of course,\nthey also asked to see if we could find out from there what happened to the other relatives. And\nthere\u2019s the extended family as I mentioned, my dad\u2019s cousin, his parents did not survive.\n25",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Robertson, he... (Laughing.) I\u2019m laughing because you ask about the name. His name was\nRosenberg also and when he was in the hospital in Sweden a man came in, a British Army\nofficer and said to him, \u201cAre you Hans Rosenberg?\u201d He said yes. He said, \u201cI\u2019m Peter\nRobertson, your brother.\u201d (Laughing.) He had been sent out and was drafted in the British\nArmy and they wouldn\u2019t allow the name Rosenberg. Because in the event of he would be\ncaptured by the Germans that they wouldn\u2019t... he wanted to just anglicize 1t and make it\nMontrose, but there\u2019s a Lord Montrose and you\u2019re not allowed to use the name of a famous\nperson, so they made it Robertson. And so then when he came over here and became a citizen he\ndecided so he would have the same name as his brother he changed his name to Robertson.",
        "Q: What was his first name?",
        "A: Henry, Hans.",
        "Q: Okay, and this is the same one who you mentioned earlier, who had written the book?",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "Q: So, most of your family\u2019s conversation then, when you were talking about wartime issues was\nconcerned with what had become of various family members and tracking people down and\nmaking...",
        "A: Family members, to some extent, property, the carpet which is in our family room used to belong\nto my parents and then of course, the Germans got it. And my dad was, sometime, I\u2019m not sure\nwhen, in the fifties, he was in Holland on business and he saw it hanging in a carpet store in the\nwindow. And he went in and said, \u201cThat\u2019s my carpet.\u201d Fellow says, \u201cTough luck, it cost you so\nmuch,\u201d whatever it was. He took a picture of it, but 1t didn\u2019t do any good, because as I said\nearlier, the Dutch didn\u2019t want to transfer the victim from one to another. But they ended up\nbuying it again. And then I got it after my mother died. There are other things that come up\noccasionally or would come up about something that was missing, or wondering where it was. I\nhad a fairly nice stamp collection that I had given to a friend for safekeeping. And all the\nvaluable stamps are gone. You know, you can be harsh about it, saying they stole from you, on\nthe other hand, they may have traded it for food and needed it. They didn\u2019t know whether you\nwere going to come back or not. The only one that was absolutely and scrupulously honest was\nthe concierge of the business where my dad worked. He had everything that my dad entrusted\nto him and gave every bit of it back. Where many of your so-called friends denied they ever had\nanything. And there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s unfortunate and I didn\u2019t know about it until fairly\nrecently. Apparently my mother had written a long letter to one of her sisters, or maybe to all of\nthem, same letter addressed to all of them, about the deprivation, et cetera, et cetera. She said\nher ambition was to die in her own bed between clean sheets. And that letter wasn\u2019t discovered\nuntil one of my cousins, one of the sister\u2019s daughters, who lived on Long Island, but was moving\nto Florida and was going through the stuff to throw things away and came across that letter and\ngave it to... I think there may be one or two pages missing. But it was not until a year or so, two\nyears after my mother had died. And that explained a lot of things to us. But fortunately we\n26\nwere able to do that unknowingly. She died at home in her own bed. It was difficult to do it that\nway, but...",
        "Q: From where had she written the letter?",
        "A: From Holland after the war, she had wrote that to her sisters, describing what had happened to\nsome extent during the war and the deprivations and how that was her ambition. She wrote in\nthere, \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to give those bastards the pleasure of throwing me into a mass grave. I\nwant to die in my own bed between clean sheets.\u201d Probably one of the reasons for our survival\nwas my mother\u2019s strong will. I think that had a lot to do with it. Probably didn\u2019t realize it at the\ntime.",
        "Q: More so than your father\u2019s? Or your father was more of a...",
        "A: Much more easier-going person, yeah.",
        "Q: Was your family very close after you came to the States?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, definitely. Not only... you talking my parents and my brother and I, or overall\nthe relatives?",
        "Q: Both.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yes definitely, and still am. I mean there aren\u2019t that many of us left. But I talk to some\nof my cousins on a fairly regular basis. We don\u2019t see each other all that often because we\u2019re now\nscattered. A few years ago in Spring we decided to make a round-trip to Florida and visit Alice\u2019s\nbrother and then take a few days on the beach and then went to visit some of my cousins. When\neverybody lived in New York, when all they lived in New York I would see them whenever I got\nto New York once a year, but now they\u2019re scattering too. Retiring and dying, too. Not all of us\nare alive anymore in our generation.",
        "Q: When you met your wife, did she have any idea of what your history had been during the war?\nDid you talk about that during your courtship at all?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t think so. You\u2019d have to ask her, but I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: And did that become a, later, as you recall, a topic...?",
        "A: That never became an issue, no, not really. No, it would have to have only become a topic of\nconversation... well it did. I had back problems, it\u2019s now, what? 30-some years ago. And when\nI asked the surgeon what, was there any indication what the cause was. And he said, without\nknowing what my background was, he says, \u201cYeah, severe malnutrition during your growing\nyears.\u201d But other than that, normally it was not a topic of...",
        "Q: Does she ask you at all about it now or in recent years?\n27",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Does she know now?",
        "A: Oh yeah, she knows. I\u2019m sure my mother told her probably a number of things, and\noccasionally... well, she\u2019s seen the videos also. All the kids have seen them. I\u2019m pretty sure, I\nmay even have made copies for them. They\u2019re aware of it, but it\u2019s just a piece of history, not\n\u201cthe\u201d. A lot of difference there.",
        "Q: So, what happened after you got married? Did you move?",
        "A: Yeah, we... a bit hectic few days. I had my Ph.D. orals on Thursday and a final in a class on\nMonday. We got married on Tuesday and we left during that, after the wedding and went around\nthe coast of Houston, where I had to report for work a little less than two weeks later.",
        "Q: For Shell?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What were you doing for Shell?",
        "A: I was a research chemist. I stayed there for five years. I didn\u2019t like what I was doing and started\nlooking for another job and got a job with GE in Cincinnati and was there for almost ten years\nand then got transferred down here.",
        "Q: Where were your parents and your brother during those years?",
        "A: My parents, my dad actually died in \u201867 of a second heart attack. And my mother lived in New\nYork, New York City. My brother, after he got out of the Service in early \u201853, got a job with a\nDutch Ore company that had holdings all over the world. And matter of fact that\u2019s why he\nchanged his name. His last name is Rosley, ROS LEY. He anglicized it so he wouldn\u2019t be\nmistaken for a German after the war, when there was still a lot of anti-German feeling all through\nthe world. He was essentially overseas in one place or another until 1963, I believe, is when he\ncame back after having been in Brazil for a number of years. And he lived in New York then\nuntil he retired, oh, some ten years or so ago and moved to Vermont. Where he still officially\nlives in Vermont.",
        "Q: What was your real interest as far as your profession? Did you have any kind of guiding thing\nthat you really loved to do?",
        "A: Problem-solving using chemistry as a tool to solve a lot of technical problems. That was\nprobably my forte. I was pretty good at it, at the time.",
        "Q: So you were seeking work that, in which you were really able to do more of the problem solving\ntype than... what didn\u2019t you like about the job that you had in Texas?\n28",
        "A: Shell? Well, it was a particular development scheme, you took one step forward and maybe two\nbackwards. It just got to be a bore. And I asked for a different assignment and they said, \u201cNo,\nno, you\u2019re doing too well. You\u2019re getting where we want you to go.\u201d And I didn\u2019t want to go\nthere. And so I started to look for something else. And the most interesting job that I was being\nconsidered for was with the Navy in San Francisco. But the chief of that office was on a year\u2019s\nsabbatical in Belgium and they weren\u2019t going to make a decision until he came back. And I\nwasn\u2019t going to wait another year. And the assignment that they talked to me about in Cincinnati\nwas pretty interesting. And I had a good time. It was nerve-racking, because I didn\u2019t realize it at\nthe time, it was ACE, the Atomic Energy Commission was the primary contractor. And so it was\nat the whims of the government. And two years after I was up there we went overnight from\nthree thousand to three hundred employees. Fortunately I was one of the three hundred that they\nkept. I finally decided this is getting too much, these ups and downs, and mostly downs. And\nthere was another one coming, so I decided to look around the company for other possible\nopportunities and they happened to have an opening down here, so I applied for it and got it.",
        "Q: This is still for GE?",
        "A: Yeah, in the appliance business here as an analytical chemist. And then a year later or two years\nlater, | was made manager of analytical chemistry, chemistry and processes. But anyway,\nessentially a multitude of problems.",
        "Q: Did you have any preconceived notions about living in Kentucky?",
        "A: Well... (Laughing) funny, because we talked about it yesterday. While we were still living in\nOhio, the Riverfront Stadium was the big issue. It was being built, where to build it. They\nstarted construction. And they said when they got done with that they were going to build the\nbiggest zoo in the world. They were going to put a fence around Kentucky. So, that answers\nthat question, right? No, not really, didn\u2019t know much about it. I was commuting for about six\nweeks, no, longer than that, two months. And so got acquainted a little bit with the area while I\nwas still living up there. And there wasn\u2019t that much difference. People are people everywhere.\nAnd a pretty nice group of people here that I worked with and worked for. Matter of fact, \u2019'm\nstill friends with, fairly good friends with one of my former bosses. And I\u2019m particularly happy\nabout that.",
        "Q: For your community of friends, you said... when did you move to Louisville?",
        "A: \u201868, a little over 32 years ago.",
        "Q: And your community of friends and so forth here are most, acquaintances here are mostly\nthrough work or...?",
        "A: Work, neighbors, people I worked with or for, or that worked for me, neighbors, people who live\nin the area or met at the swimming pool, or wife was in a bridge club. And still have friends\nfrom Cincinnati days, too. In fact, one of our good friends, who was a neighbor in Cincinnati,\nnow lives in Fort Worth. Known him for 35 years maybe.\n29",
        "Q: And no involvement with a synagogue here?",
        "A: No, not particularly. Now I\u2019m on every Jewish organization\u2019s mailing list.",
        "Q: Why is that?",
        "A: There was an article in the Courier Journal, maybe a year ago, whenever it was, about the\nTemple and how the Temple needed expansion and they were going to have a quiet campaign for\nconstruction funds, for building funds. So, I sent them a check with a note attached that \u201cSince\nyou\u2019re having a quiet campaign I\u2019m sending you a check on the QT.\u201d And got a very nice letter\nback, as a matter of fact, a friend of mine who is quite involved with the Temple, the lady\nshowed him the letter not knowing that we knew each other. But that got me on the mailing list\nfor every Jewish organization locally, of course mostly asking for money.",
        "Q: And you mentioned a little bit earlier about how you don\u2019t really have contact with other\nHolocaust survivors in the area. And you\u2019re not sure you want to.",
        "A: Not on that basis. I mean, I\u2019m not saying that I say, \u201cYou\u2019re a Holocaust survivor, move aside, I\ndon\u2019t want a part of it.\u201d What I\u2019m saying is, if I happen to meet somebody who also is, I have no\nproblem with that. That\u2019s just...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side B\n30\nTape 3, Side A",
        "Q: Okay, this is tape number three, side A of an interview with Alexander Rosenberg. You were\njust saying about the Holocaust survivors in Louisville. Did you want to add anything else to\nwhat you had said?",
        "A: No not really, as I say, \u2019'm debating on whether to go to this meeting just out of curiosity. See, I\ndon\u2019t think I know anybody... well, I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t. I\u2019m sure they have to be all older\nfolks. (Laughing.) SoI may. I haven\u2019t decided yet. But no, no special interest as a criterion.",
        "Q: How about other, just looking back over your years here after the war in the United States. Were\nyou really mainly just focusing on your work and your family or did you have other interests or\npassions outside of that?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I have a number of hobbies. For one thing, I like to cook and obviously like to eat.\n(Laughing.) And gardening, although my garden right now doesn\u2019t show that. And I always like\nto travel, but of course, with a family and work that isn\u2019t always possible. So we made up for it\nsince I retired. And I enjoy history, learning about it, learned more about it since I retired, I\nguess. Now I have time to watch television and the History channel and A&E and of course,\nKET to some extent. So that... a lot more exposure and therefore an ability to learn a lot more.\nAnd then too, when we travel, we do it with the intent, not always the same. I don\u2019t go for these\nCaribbean cruises, you know, \u201cShow me, feed me, entertain me.\u201d I like cruises because they are\na lazy man\u2019s way of traveling\u2014you only pack and unpack once\u2014but there has to be a reason for\nit. And sometimes they are real eye-openers. A couple of years we went on an Eastern\nMediterranean and Black Sea cruise and we were in Constanta, Romania, which is the major port\nof Romania on the Black Sea. Ovid was exiled there for seven years or whatever. Well, never\neven thought that the Romans as well as the Greeks, both came up the west coast of the Black\nSea, east coast of the Balkan Peninsula. And that they had gone that far North into what is now\nOdessa and to the Crimea. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s of no importance right now, but in terms of historical\nevent, just didn\u2019t think about that or heard about it. A lot of things like that. But as we talked\nearlier about the famine, and what complicity the British had. The other day there was a\nfascinating program on the Vikings. They were the kings of Kiev in Russia. They went east.\nNobody... I never heard that before.",
        "Q: What about Holocaust-era history? Have you done much reading about that or taken an interest\nin finding out what happened on a broader scale?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, definitely. As you know there are a lot of programs, bits and pieces. There is a\nlot... new things, but also things that are being, I think, being hidden from view that never show\nagain. The... well of course, in addition to Spielberg\u2019s movie, I\u2019m not sure what the show was\nthe other day, but there are a number of programs that deal with the Holocaust or deal with\ncertain aspects of the Holocaust. Or for that matter, not necessarily in that context, but primarily\nin the context of Nazis or Hitlerism and their henchmen and how they got involved and what\nthey did. And the Holocaust in the broadest sense, in terms of the enslaving of particularly the\nSlavs, the eastern Europeans and the murder, genocide of them, not necessarily just the Jews.\nBut then one thing, and I have a video of it, it was on PBS maybe twenty-five years ago, about\n31\nFort Ticonderoga, and I have never seen it again. I mentioned to you earlier the anti-Semitism of\nthe State Department. In 1943, when the Holocaust became pretty well-known in government\ncircles, but was being hidden from the American population, a number of Henry Morgenthau\u2019s\nemployees went to him and said, \u201cYou go to FDR and tell him he does something or else we\u2019re\ngoing to go public that the U.S. government knows about this and isn\u2019t doing anything.\u201d And as\na consequence of that, they brought some six, 800, what was then called DPs, displaced persons,\nto this country. They had to sign a statement, which of course anybody in his right mind would\nhave, that after the war they would go back to their country of origin. And they put them into\nFort Ticonderoga. And after the war was over with, they tried to ship them back. Well, you\nknow, you signed this thing. But a number of couples had had children here. They were born at\nFort Ticonderoga and therefore they were native-born citizens, and therefore their parents were\nentitled to stay here as the parents of minor American citizens. The State Department declared\nFort Ticonderoga was not American soil and therefore they were not American citizens. Can\nyou imagine a place that is so historically important in the American Revolution being declared\nnot being a part of America? I mean that\u2019s the kind of convoluting, convolutions, unfortunately,\nour government went through. As I said, that was a PBS show, 25 years ago, I have never seen it\nagain. I guess too many toes were being stepped on. But... and of course, I went to the\nHolocaust museum, but I couldn\u2019t take it, make it past the Saint Louis, because I remember that\none vividly. Another black mark in our history.",
        "Q: So, it was too painful to be going through and reminded?",
        "A: Yeah, I mean the thing is, painful and the thing is that the Saint Louis had roughly nine hundred\npassengers and I don\u2019t think two dozen survived. It\u2019s incredible that the things that the U.S.\ngovernment could have done, should have done and never did do. It\u2019s that kind of malfeasance\nthat really upset me, particularly in that context.",
        "Q: Related to that, I\u2019m interested in something you said in your last interview, which was a piece of\nadvice that you were giving to other Holocaust survivors. That many have met with very good\nfortune in their post-war lives and that they ought to do what they can to give something back to\nthe community. And so on the one hand you have that compulsion or that desire and on the other\nhand, you have this knowledge of the shortcomings of this government and the ways that they\nhave, have really not served the... and in particular in the couple of instances you just brought\nup, Holocaust survivors. How do you reconcile those two?",
        "A: Well, those are, in my opinion, two totally separate issues. Maybe they are related, and that is by\ngiving back to the community, by helping people that are in need of help. Maybe because the\ngovernment should and isn\u2019t, that you\u2019re overcoming the shortcomings of our government. Even\nthough I don\u2019t take that into consideration. There are two ways that one can give back, one is\nfinancially and that\u2019s the easy way out that most of us take, is to make contributions to a variety\nof charitable organizations, or non-profit organizations. But then the more important one is to\ngive of your time and help people. I\u2019m sure the same thing holds true for Lexington, in\nLouisville there is a shortage, an incredible shortage of volunteers. And all of us retirees who\nhave spare time, and we should have spare time, should donate some of that time to some of\nthese organizations. Whether it\u2019s Dare to Care to sort out cans of food, or work at the Wayside\nChristian Mission as an example, any of these shelters, and dish out food for people in need. Or\n32\nI work in the tax program, in fact I have somebody come in who needs help with their taxes.\nOne of the great organizations in general of a variety of needs is Catholic Charities. And they\u2019re\ndesperate for volunteers. Obviously: they asked me to help. (Laughing.) And I have. But the\nthing 1s, that is one way that you can give back. And whether it\u2019s in your own expertise or if it\u2019s\njust plain labor. Some people are unwilling to become raw labor, drive for Meals on Wheels or\ndrive for Dare to Care and pick up bread at Kroger or whatever. But that\u2019s the kind of jobs that\nneed to be done. And that\u2019s the kind of things that makes many of these non-profit organizations\nclick. Newt Gingrich, who is so maligned, some four or five years ago, for his reasons felt that\nthe public radio should no longer be funded by the U.S. government. And I completely agree\nwith him. But that doesn\u2019t mean that today they give them big hunk of money and tomorrow it\u2019s\nzilch. Cut it back. I work for the public radio stations here as a volunteer. And they used that\nwithdrawal of government funds to encourage the public to contribute and they did tremendous,\nthe biggest drive they ever had. And rightly so. I\u2019m a firm believer in putting the public back\ninto public radio and public television, but it requires a commitment on the part of the people to\nmake financial donations. And that\u2019s just one, that\u2019s not nearly as, I suppose, important as\nhelping somebody who\u2019s hungry or reading for the blind, but it\u2019s one of the large variety of\nvolunteer jobs that needs to be done. It\u2019s amazing, I don\u2019t do that much. I\u2019m not trying to pat\nmyself on the back. But one of the people that used to work for me professionally now actually\nworks for me in a volunteer, one of his volunteer activities, got the GE volunteer award of the\nyear, he and his wife, jointly, this past year. Between the two of them they put in three thousand\nhours a year, that\u2019s a hell of a lot of hours. That\u2019s almost a fulltime job. If we could get half the\npeople to do half that or for that matter, ten percent of the people to do ten percent of that, it\nwould be a lot of help. And that\u2019s what I mean by that.",
        "Q: Have you traveled much within Kentucky?",
        "A: Not that much. I mean we\u2019ve been all over. Been both west and east, and south. Essentially\ncovered the whole state more or less, but not extensively.",
        "Q: Does the culture or the history of the state interest you particularly or are you more kind of\nlimited...?",
        "A: Oh yes, well, no I think or it appears at least that more recently that the antagonism toward\nLouisville, Louisville versus the rest of Kentucky, seems to be diminishing. But that is, you\nknow the large city versus the rest of the state. Look at New York and New York City, Georgia\nand Atlanta and you know, you can go on. I think it\u2019s probably true of most states that the large\ncities are thought to be representative and they\u2019re not. Even though they contain most of the\npopulation. And I can understand that. And the interests of Kentucky in particularly are so\ndiverse, from Appalachia with its problems, and Western Kentucky with some of the same\nproblems and some totally different problems. And Louisville, of course, for painfully obvious\nreasons having totally different problems that people in Appalachia couldn\u2019t care less about. But\nthat\u2019s true everywhere. And it\u2019s amazing, the thing that I thought that the United States was\nunique, unfortunately, in its race relations problems. They\u2019re not. It\u2019s the same everywhere. It\ndoesn\u2019t matter what country you go to, it may not be like we have, black and white. But we were\nin New Zealand and there was a big ruckus and the Royal Commission on Race Relations or\nwhatever it was, got involved, refused to get involved in it. Well, the mere fact that they have a\n33\nRoyal Commission on Race Relations says there\u2019s a problem there. And it\u2019s the Maoris, which\nare no longer in existence. The purest Maori is one-eighth Maori and seven-eighths white. And\nin Australia it\u2019s the indigenous people versus the settlers. And then of course among the settlers\nyou get the same ethnic divisions that you get everywhere else. Look right now, Fiji, the\nSolomon Islands, the whole world is erupting in ethnic and race problems. Africa is just a\nterrible situation.",
        "Q: Were you... was that something that you were particularly aware of in your early years 1n the\nU.S., segregation, the Civil Rights Movement, any of those?",
        "A: No, not really. I read about it and I heard about it and was only peripherally affected by it. But\nin the early fifties, while I was in Durham, the mayor of Durham was Jewish. Why I don\u2019t\nknow. There\u2019s a fairly good sized, there was a\u2014there may still be\u2014a good-sized Jewish\ncommunity in Durham because of the tobacco industry. Apparently they brought the Jews down\nin order to make cigars, like they did in Tampa with the Cubans. And then, I still remember the\nman\u2019s name, Bishop Waters was the Catholic Bishop for North Carolina. The little town of\nWashington, North Carolina was two parishes, a black and a white. Neither one of them could\nsupport a priest, and he ordered them integrated. Boy was there ever a stink, but it worked.\nWasn\u2019t... no more than two months and they essentially had ninety percent attendance of the two\nparishes in one church building. It was unheard of. Of course the press would claim race\nrelations are only bad in the South. Well, they\u2019re probably a lot better in the South than they\nwere elsewhere. But yeah, I certainly was keenly aware of it, and cautious. Before I bought a\nhouse in Houston, this was in the late fifties, I consulted with a local friend to say \u201cHey, so that I\ndon\u2019t stub my toe, 1s there anyplace that I cannot go? Where I would be refused because I am\nJewish?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes. Don\u2019t go to Oak Forest,\u201d or Forest Oaks, whatever it was called,\nwhich I couldn\u2019t anyway, that was the rich neighborhood. But you learned to do those things.",
        "Q: Is there something else that I haven\u2019t asked you about that you\u2019d like to talk about today?",
        "A: No, I can\u2019t really think of much. I don\u2019t know whether this gets perpetuated or not, but I\ncertainly would urge, not just Holocaust survivors, but all retirees to think about give something\nback to the community.",
        "Q: This is something that\u2019s very important to you, 1t seems. I mean, you brought it up last time, too.",
        "A: Yeah, I think so. There\u2019s such a terrible need. And what makes me particularly, actually\nangry... I have two or three acquaintances who are retired, who went back to work on a part-time\nbasis, because they don\u2019t know what to do with themselves. They\u2019re bored. This is utterly\nridiculous. And I keep trying to get them enrolled in some activity and they just won\u2019t do it. But\nthere\u2019s just too many people that need help, who cannot help themselves. And throwing money\nat the problem is not necessarily the solution. It isn\u2019t that it can\u2019t be done without money, but\nit\u2019s the personal help that\u2019s required. And here in Louisville, we are blessed with a number of\nthings. We have here three groups that make recordings for the blind. The Recordings for the\nBlind, the Audio Studio, and there\u2019s a third one. There isn\u2019t another city in this country that does\nthat. We have three public radio stations. There is not, even New York only has one. There are\n34\na lot of things that are good things, matter of fact I don\u2019t brag about Louisville, keep down the\npopulation influx. (Laughing.) Selfish.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re pretty much of a Louisville patriot, huh?",
        "A: We have it very good here in Kentucky, and particularly in Louisville, and of course, Lexington\nin many ways, much more dynamic than Louisville is, for one thing they\u2019ve got the city-county\ngovernment, which we won\u2019t get. It\u2019s up for voting on election day, you can bet money on it, it\nwon\u2019t happen. The race relations right now are just so terrible. All you have to do is look at\nother communities and other cities and that\u2019s not just... take this house here as an example,\nwhich you can buy similar house here for depending on the condition and age, but let\u2019s say 150\nto 250. Go to Silicon Valley you couldn\u2019t touch it for two and a half million dollars. In other\nareas, yeah you may be able to get for less, but most areas you can\u2019t touch it for twice the\namount of money. Matter of fact, most retirees moving out of California, sell their houses and\nlive happily ever after, because they can buy another house somewhere else in Arizona or in\nFlorida for a fraction of what it\u2019s worth in California. Our food prices are reasonable, with the\nexception of gasoline in Jefferson County. I went to Shelbyville last night and paid 40 cents a\ngallon less than what it is in Louisville. I mean that\u2019s ridiculous. Could have gone as far as\nSimpsonville, that\u2019s only ten miles, 25 cents a gallon. But outside of these temporary distortions,\nLouisville has grown up a lot in the last 15, 20 years. I used to get all my bread from Chicago,\nnow there\u2019s a grocery store over on Taylorsville Road that carries it and I can go get it there. We\nused to go to Cincinnati to get a three month supply of cold cuts, now I can buy almost all of it\nhere. And so on and so forth. We\u2019re blessed here with, within two miles or three, excellent\nbakeries and different bakeries. If you want a certain thing you get it here. How many\ncommunities can you say that? In 20 minutes I\u2019m at the airport.",
        "Q: You feel welcome here, comfortable here as a Jew?",
        "A: Oh yes, absolutely. That is not an issue at all in this community. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s always, well\nlike the Ku Klux Klan exists here, but you can ignore that. No, I have never had anybody make\na disparaging remark to me or denied me something because I\u2019m Jewish. Absolutely. Until the\npresent mayor, the Mayor of Louisville was Jewish, Jerry Abramson, one of the most popular\nmayors that the city of Louisville has had. I think he was in there for thirteen years, the longest\nthat anybody ever has. And he was quite, I mean it was not anything that was hidden. He was\nquite open about it. No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem at all here.",
        "Q: Anything else you\u2019d like to say?",

        "Q: Okay, so we\u2019re just going to start with a test of your voice. How many days were you in Ireland?",
        "Q: And what kind of... what was the most memorable sights, some of the most memorable sights\nthat you saw?",
        "Q: Oh, your brother?",
        "Q: Was that pure coincidence?",
        "Q: That\u2019s something.",
        "Q: Okay, it\u2019s June the 13\" of the year 2000 and we are in the home of Alexander Rosenberg for an\noral history interview that\u2019s mainly going to focus on his experiences after the Holocaust because\nhe has been interviewed by the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation once before. And we\u2019re\nmainly going to be following up on that interview and asking some pre-war and wartime\nquestions to clarify and expand and then moving on into the post-war era. And my name 1s\nArwen Donahue and we are in Louisville, Kentucky, this is tape number one, side A. I guess\nwhat I\u2019 Il do is just briefly summarize for the tape some of what was discussed in your first\ninterview and then you can correct me if I get anything wrong. So, Mr. Rosenberg was born in\n1927 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and moved with his family in 1937 to... well, moved to\nBerlin and between then and 1937 and then moved to Holland in 1937, where he lived until he\nand his family were deported to the Westerbork camp in Holland. And were there, and that was,\nyou said you weren\u2019t certain whether it was 1942 or \u201943, when you were...?",
        "Q: And Easter of \u201844 what you remembered was being in Bergen-Belsen.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you a little bit more about Bergen-Belsen, but I guess first what we\u2019ll do 1s...\nokay, so you were deported from Westerbork to Bergen-Belsen some undetermined date. And\nthen were in Bergen-Belsen until 1944.",
        "Q: Oh, yeah, around April 10\", 1945 you were away, and it was close to the time... of course. And\nliberated somewhere outside of, somewhere in Germany.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back then, one question that I had was about your earlier childhood before the war\nstarted. And you had mentioned in your first interview something about your family. Your\nfather was an investment banker. You had a brother who was ten months... was he ten months\nolder or younger?",
        "Q: Ten months younger. And did you, and you said that your family was not very religious. You\nbasically went to synagogue for high holidays. Was your family really very assimilated?",
        "Q: Did you speak Yiddish or Hebrew?",
        "Q: Were any of your friends, were most of your family friends Jewish and your own personal\nfriends?",
        "Q: And then another question from a different time. When you were living in Amsterdam, I believe\nyou mentioned in the first interview that before your family was actually caught in a round-up\nand deported to Westerbork, you had been caught in another round-up and somehow managed to\nget out. Now that wasn\u2019t clear to me from the first interview what had happened during that\ntime.",
        "Q: So it was just you? It wasn\u2019t members of your family?",
        "Q: And what happened the second time when your whole family was deported?",
        "Q: Yeah, you did talk some about that in the first interview. When you were heading towards\nWesterbork, did you know anything about Westerbork before you arrived?",
        "Q: Did you have any idea at the time of what had started to happen to Jews?",
        "Q: And you talked in some detail about what you remembered of your time in Westerbork and that\nyou had been, you had contracted polio. Had you really recovered from the symptoms of that by\nthe time that you were deported to Bergen-Belsen?",
        "Q: Tell me if, I have an impression, and tell me if it\u2019s correct. I have the impression that your\nfamily was fairly close-knit and that you\u2019re weren\u2019t necessarily forming strong bonds with other\npeople outside of your family. Is that correct?",
        "Q: Do you remember, was there kind of a gradual sense of deepening horror and insecurity or was\nthere a moment when you really, that you remember having been really, realized what was\nhappening?",
        "Q: So even as a young child you grew somehow hardened to this experience would you say?",
        "Q: Do you remember private conversations that you were able to have with your family?",
        "Q: Do you remember the day that you were deported from Westerbork to Bergen-Belsen? Anything\nabout that?",
        "Q: Had transports been leaving from Westerbork for some time before yours left? In other words,\nwere you...",
        "Q: So, you may have had the sense then that at any point your name could be called and you\u2019d be\ngetting on the...",
        "Q: And about your time in Westerbork, I\u2019m sorry, in Bergen-Belsen. You were there relatively\nearly as you just mentioned. And I wondered if in the long term you feel that having been there\n5",
        "Q: To what extent did you have contact with the other members of your family while you were in\nBelsen?",
        "Q: And what about, you mentioned having to steal food 1n order to survive. Was that something\nthat the newer prisoners maybe wouldn\u2019t have known how to do or that you kind of eventually\nlearned?",
        "Q: Was there a real uniformity of cruelty among the guards or were any of them kind at all to you?",
        "Q: What about friendships in Belsen? Did you, was it still pretty much each one for his own?",
        "Q: Roll call?",
        "Q: So was it seven days a week, every day the same?",
        "Q: Did you have any sense of time or way to keep track of time?",
        "Q: You mentioned that you were transferred after you were chopping the stumps into the detail that\nwas meeting the rail cars as they were coming in, and you said something about the Libyan Jews.\nI was wondering if you, were you there when the French women prisoners were coming 1n?",
        "Q: I read something about it, that was partially why I asked. It mentioned they came in the first half\nof \u201844 from Drancy in France. And I just was curious if you remembered anything else.",
        "Q: Tape one, side B of an interview with Alexander Rosenberg. So you want to just repeat what\nyou had just said?",
        "Q: Were you mostly speaking in German while you lived in Belsen?",
        "Q: Did you use your German in speaking with any of the camp guards?",
        "Q: Okay, moving to the time when you were, when you were shipped out of Belsen again, you\ndescribed that time in the first interview and how you had kind of gone on a two-week tour of\nGermany. And seen Berlin completely destroyed.",
        "Q: I thought maybe we could just pick up with that time. And I wondered if you could tell a little\nbit more about, well the time of liberation, encountering the Russian soldiers. And you\nmentioned how they were sharing bread and so forth. Were they, the Russians have... had a\nreputation for being sometimes vicious even with the people that they liberated. Did you\nwitness any of that?",
        "Q: What kind of condition were you in at the time of liberation?",
        "Q: But you were able to walk?",
        "Q: I think you mentioned how much you weighed, did you?",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t shave your head while you were in Belsen?",
        "Q: Were you with your entire family at that point while you were riding the train?",
        "Q: Was that moment of encountering the Cossack unit, were you aware this 1s it, 1t\u2019s over?",
        "Q: Was that a particularly emotionally charged...\u2019",
        "Q: There is another woman that we interviewed last year or so, who went to school with Anne Frank\nas well. I don\u2019t recall her maiden name, but her married name was Barbara Rodbell.",
        "Q: And actually I might be mistaken, she might not have been in school, she was a friend of hers.\nHer sister especially. But they might have lived nearby. So, you\u2019re with your family and you\u2019re\nreturning to Amsterdam, and you described some, in the first interview, some of that... you were\nhoused first in the DP camp in Leipzig?",
        "Q: While you were still in Germany did you witness anybody, any of the former prisoners taking\nrevenge on Germans or did you desire that yourself?",
        "Q: Do you recall how you felt at the time? Angry or happy or any hopes?",
        "Q: And getting enough to eat?",
        "Q: What about your, when you returned to Amsterdam and just adjusting to daily life again?",
        "Q: Was it easy for you to focus on studies after what you had been through? Was that a challenge at\nall?",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t, you weren\u2019t necessarily ever... was there a point were you remember you started\nreally reflecting on what had happened to you?",
        "Q: This maybe is kind of a digression, going out of the chronology, but was there a point where you\nreally felt compelled personally to talk about your experiences to anyone? Like that would help\nyou or help other people to...?",
        "Q: I heard something about it.",
        "Q: Marvin, Martin Goldfarb.",
        "Q: I\u2019m pretty sure. I\u2019m blanking on his name right now, but I know him.",
        "Q: Okay, we have another minute or so on this tape. Well, that\u2019s interesting. Your brother has, it\nsounds like, taken kind of an active role in something that\u2019s related to being a Holocaust\nSUIVIVOT.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go ahead and change the tape.",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side A. And would you say a little bit more about that? I was\nwondering about, continuing in this same vein of digression, I was wondering about your feeling\nas a Holocaust survivor, whether you feel that there\u2019s any benefit to be derived from identifying\nyourself that way? With the work that your brother... (Rosenberg bursts out laughing) ...it\u2019s a\nstrange way of putting the question, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Q: What about, you\u2019re doing this interview today. You did one other interview. What has made\nyou agree to do those?",
        "Q: What about your children? Have you... people who are as far as can be from Neo-Nazis: do you\nfeel like it\u2019s important to you to leave them some kind of information or some kind of knowledge\nabout your life and your experiences?",
        "Q: Did you intentionally at some point start telling your children about...?",
        "Q: ...your history? It just kind of gradually...?",
        "Q: And I\u2019m curious about what you mentioned a little earlier about someone who you know who\u2019s a\nprofessional Holocaust survivor.",
        "Q: Your cousin?",
        "Q: And is that something... and you mentioned that it bothers you. Can you say more about what\nbothers you about that or what you think the danger of that 1s?",
        "Q: And have you had the experience as somebody who has survived the Holocaust, of people maybe\nassuming that because you are a Holocaust survivor that was the defining event of your life and\ntherefore kind of maybe not seeing you clearly?",
        "Q: Is being Jewish important to you?",
        "Q: Is that right?",
        "Q: So, what does that mean to you, to be the only Jew in your family?",
        "Q: They don\u2019t even do that in Catholic church.",
        "Q: So, what does it mean to you, can you say what it means to you to be Jewish?",
        "Q: It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean keeping certain traditions or going to synagogue?",
        "Q: What about, do you think of Judaism as a... when you say it\u2019s important to you to be Jewish, is it\nas a religion?",
        "Q: So you\u2019re not a particularly religious person?",
        "Q: Okay. Let\u2019s go pick up the timeline again.",
        "Q: We left off in Amsterdam just after the war. You\u2019re going back to school, you\u2019re working hard\nat being a student. And as far as, you were talking about being hopeful at the time. What were\nyou, do you recall what you were hopeful for, what you really wanted for the rest of your life?",
        "Q: Did you consider not coming and staying? By then you were an adult.",
        "Q: Did you have any... what were your notions about the U.S. at that time?",
        "Q: Where was that?",
        "Q: So, you came by ship?",

        "Q: Remember first impressions of New York?",
        "Q: How was your English?",
        "Q: It\u2019s not on your records as having, the infraction was not listed on your records?",
        "Q: I mean the cause of the ticket being given.",
        "Q: And you think it was because he was Jewish that they...?",
        "Q: When was your citizenship?",
        "Q: So you in those years, those first years that you came to the U.S... you came in \u201847?",
        "Q: Were you, you were aware of having to be very cautious as a Jew?",
        "Q: This is tape two, side B.",
        "Q: What were your parents doing once they arrived here?",
        "Q: And you all shared an apartment?",
        "Q: How did you end up feeling about this country? You hadn\u2019t been happy to come. Did you end\nup feeling, at some point feel at home here?",
        "Q: Cardinal? That means it\u2019s three o\u2019clock?",
        "Q: Did it strike you as hypocritical? Or did you think about that? This so-called Home of the Free,\ndiscriminating against...?",
        "Q: So, what happened next? You\u2019re going to school at night and you\u2019re working in the day. And...",
        "Q: Would you have felt willing to go and fight in the Korean War if you hadn\u2019t been involved in\nthis student... or what were your feelings behind that?",

        "Q: Okay, and this is the same one who you mentioned earlier, who had written the book?",
        "Q: So, most of your family\u2019s conversation then, when you were talking about wartime issues was\nconcerned with what had become of various family members and tracking people down and\nmaking...",
        "Q: From where had she written the letter?",
        "Q: More so than your father\u2019s? Or your father was more of a...",
        "Q: Was your family very close after you came to the States?",
        "Q: Both.",
        "Q: When you met your wife, did she have any idea of what your history had been during the war?\nDid you talk about that during your courtship at all?",
        "Q: And did that become a, later, as you recall, a topic...?",
        "Q: Does she ask you at all about it now or in recent years?",

        "Q: So, it was too painful to be going through and reminded?",
        "Q: Related to that, I\u2019m interested in something you said in your last interview, which was a piece of\nadvice that you were giving to other Holocaust survivors. That many have met with very good\nfortune in their post-war lives and that they ought to do what they can to give something back to\nthe community. And so on the one hand you have that compulsion or that desire and on the other\nhand, you have this knowledge of the shortcomings of this government and the ways that they\nhave, have really not served the... and in particular in the couple of instances you just brought\nup, Holocaust survivors. How do you reconcile those two?",

        "A: Yeah, my brother happened to be in Ireland at the same time and we managed to meet.",
        "A: Pure coincidence, right. I got an e-mail from him two days before we left about my cousin\u2019s cell\nphone number. And I said what is this all about? And called him to find out. I didn\u2019t know he\nwas going to be there and he didn\u2019t know I was going to be there.",
        "A: And we met. That was fun.",
        "A: That is correct. I keep thinking it was September of *42 and we were there until the beginning of\n\u201843. My brother thinks I\u2019m off by a year, but I think he\u2019s off by a year. I clearly remember\n1\nEaster of \u201844 and we had to have been there about a year by that time, so I think my dates are\ncorrect.",
        "A: That is correct. Yeah, it was an air attack... well, a group of B-17\u2019s was returning from a bomb\nrun, possibly Hanover, and the escorting fighter planes came down to have a look. And our\nsuper-smart guards decided to let go with machine guns from the guard towers and they fired\nback. And nobody got hurt, but I clearly remember that incident.",
        "A: \u201c45.",
        "A: Yeah, east, Tribitz (ph) was the name of the little village, which is about ten, 15 miles east of\nTorgau. Torgau is on the river Elbe, where the German and Russian troops met on that same\nday, April the twenty-third, that we were liberated early in the morning by the Russian army.",
        "A: Younger, younger.",
        "A: Yes, I would say so, with hindsight in particular I would say so. Yes. My dad certainly\nconsidered himself German first and never expected the violence to get to the level that it did.\nAnd certainly would not affect him since he was a veteran of World War One that was wounded.\nHad volunteered for the army in the first place and was wounded, I believe two or three times\nand had the Iron Cross, which I\u2019ve been trying to locate and can\u2019t find. So that I would say they\nconsidered themselves primarily German and assimilated is the right word.",
        "A: No.\n2",
        "A: I think so, but I wouldn\u2019t know for sure. In Amsterdam I would say that was not necessarily the\ncase. But I really don\u2019t remember, I remember only really family from Germany. I don\u2019t\nremember any children from school or acquaintances of my parents. For that matter I wouldn\u2019t\nknow what their religion was. So, I really can\u2019t answer.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember whether I was picked up at home or off the street and taken to a collection\npoint where we were supposed to have been deported somewhere. And I walked away from it,\nand wasn\u2019t challenged in the process and got back home.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think it was just me, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: The second time they, as they always did, they came in the middle of the night and you had five\nminutes to get dressed and get your, your bags were always packed because you knew it could\nhappen. And you were hauled off in a truck along with other people, taken to the railroad\nstation. Put on a train not knowing where to. And then I went to Westerbork, which was the\ntransit camp that the Germans had established; it\u2019s in the eastern part of Holland near Zwolle.\nAnd we were held there for about six months. I don\u2019t think there were any other deportations.\nThere may have been one or two trains before we were hauled out. And I think the general\nimpression was that they were going to go to Theresienstadt. Why I don\u2019t know. But... never\nheard of Belsen before. As a matter of fact, we were one of the earliest ones in there. Belsen\nwas... I\u2019m not sure if it was on a previous tape or not. When we got there, of course it was a\nvery large facility. Part of it was a Russian POW camp. But obviously designed for officers,\nbecause they had little cabins and gravel walks between them and that sort of thing. And then\nthere were two sections to the non-POW prisoners. One was for, called criminals and the second\nsection was for the Jews. And as they started to fill up the Jewish section there were a number of\ntrainfuls of Jews from Holland, a lot of Hungarians, French women. They were the wives of\nofficers who were POW\u2019s from the French Army. And then after the, in \u201844, after the invasion\nof Italy, a lot of Libyan Jews that Rommel had shipped off to Italy and they had been held in\ncamps in Italy and apparently under Red Cross supervision. They all had British uniforms and\nheavy British, woolen coats and the like, and lots of good food.\n3",
        "A: No, never heard of Westerbork. And of course, you know, it\u2019s maybe a two hour train ride at\nmost. No, never heard of it before, at least I hadn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know whether my parents ever had.\nNo idea.",
        "A: No, no. They always said we\u2019d be relocating in a work camp or whatever. Or vague promises of\nexchanging for money, that relatives, particularly in America could buy you and so forth. But\nno, nobody had any inkling of what lay ahead in terms of the violence.",
        "A: I would say so. The problem that I had were primarily with the right knee and I still have some\nproblems with that knee. But I was spared the recurrence that apparently happened to older\npeople when it was discovered in the last ten or 15 years or so. It must have been a fairly mild\ncase even though polio, of course back then was rampant.",
        "A: Yeah, I think so. I don\u2019t think anybody formed any bonds at all. It was a matter of survival and\nI don\u2019t mean to imply that you tried it at the expense of somebody else. But once we realized,\nI\u2019m not sure we really realized, but when it became a matter of trying to survive, you didn\u2019t and\na fellow that was in the bunk either with you or next to you may not wake up in the morning.\nNobody really tried to get attached to anybody else. You didn\u2019t form any bonds other than to,\nyou didn\u2019t try to antagonize anybody, but there wasn\u2019t any real friendships or relationships of\nany kind. Well, there really wasn\u2019t much time either.",
        "A: No, it was, that was, 1n a way the tragedy was that it was a gradual tightening of the noose, so to\nspeak, in that... I remember the first two days in Belsen, there was so much food we couldn\u2019t eat\nit. There was no nutrition, but a liter of soup, even if 1t was only a liter of warm water with\nnothing in it. You\u2019re not used to drinking a liter of volume, a quart. It took two days and you ate\nit all and were hungry. And then the amount of food that you got kept getting less and less. And\ninitially there were, the guards kept changing constantly and surprisingly they kept getting more\nand more vicious rather than less so. The last group which maybe was there for a year, year and\na half, I don\u2019t recall for sure for how long, were World War One veterans who were too old or\ntoo feeble or had been wounded. But they were not suitable for frontline service in the German\nArmy. And you would think that they would be not so hateful. And they weren\u2019t maybe the first\n4\nweek, but they got there very quickly, got to be pretty vicious. And I\u2019m not sure whether they\nwere told to or it was a natural progression as the sensitivities wore off.",
        "A: Well you had to if you wanted to survive. You couldn\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t that you wouldn\u2019t help\nsomebody up if they had fallen, but you had to be very careful. Yes, you probably were...\nmaybe more encapsulated than hardened.",
        "A: None, absolutely none. I don\u2019t really remember very much. You remember the weird things but\nnot the everyday. And I\u2019m sure that others would have remembered something totally different\nthat I don\u2019t even remember happening. Like that Easter Sunday, the fighter attack. Well,\nbecause of it, one of the barracks that got shot up was the warehouse. And one thing the\nGermans had were cans of beef in its own juice. And apparently some of those got bullet-riddled\nso they had to use them right away. For a couple of days we actually got food, but then they\nmade up for it for a long time with nothing, because the food was gone again.",
        "A: No, nothing 1n particular. They, I guess in the afternoon the train was pushed into, the empty\ntrain was pushed into the compound. It was passenger cars. Then they posted names, they called\nthem out and you had to be there whenever, an hour or so later. Got on the train, nobody knew\nwhere it was going to go. Supposedly it was just a relocation and they always promised you\nsomething better. Of course it never was. But particularly initially you didn\u2019t know. And I\nguess they had to, that I\u2019m sure explains why there was no really massive resistance. If you\nknew you were going to go to the gas chamber you may as well try and fight it. So you get shot\non the spot. I think that\u2019s why there\u2019s, the general docility of the deportees.",
        "A: We were not the first ones, but yes, but I don\u2019t know whether we were the third or fifth or tenth.\nBut yes, there had been others. And of course you never got any feedback in terms of where\nthey went or how they were treated.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I think so. Yeah, I think it was generally recognized that Westerbork was a transit\ncamp and not a permanent installation. So, I think so.\nearly on enabled you to, or was an advantage as far as... you did mention that it was an\nadvantage as far as food. But I wondered if your resistance was stronger and if you knew the\nsystem better?",
        "A: Well system, there was really no system. But yeah, I think so, because the people who came\nvery late, particularly if they did not come from another camp but straight from home so to\nspeak. They were plunged from a normal diet to 200, 300, whatever it was, calories a day. And\nI think they died faster than those of us who, even though they may have had physical, physically\nmore reserves than we did, who our reserves were spent. But we may have been a little bit more\ncautious. And also we were so disease-ridden and I don\u2019t know whether our immune systems\nhad strengthened. Those are medical issues that I don\u2019t know about. People who were plunged\ninto this diarrhea, flea, lice, you know all the vermin. They could not tolerate it as much as those\nof us who were exposed to it more slowly.",
        "A: We saw them almost every day. My dad and my brother and I, we were in the same barrack. At\nnight the men and the women were separated, but during the day they could mingle freely if you\nwere there. We all were in work details. My mother worked in the, what do you call it?\nHospital, there was no hospital, so the infirmary. So, she physically stayed inside the camp. My\ndad worked, I think he worked the whole time on the shoe disassembly detail. I was on it for a\nlittle while before they shipped me outside to work details outside. My brother was working\noutside the camp too, I think. But I don\u2019t remember where, what details he was assigned to.",
        "A: Well (laughs)... no, I think everybody... you didn\u2019t steal from each other, generally. Even\nthough it was a matter of survival. I mentioned the Libyans who came from Italy. They came\nwith humongous quantities of food. And we had the opportunity to steal some of it. And we\nactually buried it between the tracks so we could bring it back slowly. The other thing is being\non the outside you were, not always, but sometimes you were patted down, and so you couldn\u2019t\nhave anything on your body that didn\u2019t belong to you. They must have had a bad storm some\nyears prior to establishing the camp. Bergen-Belsen was inside a military training camp, similar\nto Fort Knox. A lot of trees had been, had fallen over in this storm or storms. And they had cut\nthe trees and hauled them off, but there were the roots, you know, standing up. And for a\nnumber of months I worked in the woods digging up those tree stumps, which were then, were\nhauled into... once a week they came out with the horse-drawn wagons and we had to load those\ntree stumps that we had dug up on it and they were hauled in. There was another detail inside\nthe camp that was chopping them up into firewood. That\u2019s the one I was assigned to the day of\nthat air attack. There were blueberries growing in the woods and one, of course we ate as much\nas we could, but also we all had, like a bag that was tied to your belt inside your pants. So you\ncould pick berries and bring them in for the family to eat. So there was that and then, of course,\nif we could we stole the food from the guards. [Laughing.] Boy, they\u2019d take a whipping. They\n6\nwould get their food and most of the time if they didn\u2019t finish it, it just sat there. And if\nsomebody, we got a chance, we would try and get those cans and eat it. But apparently one day\nwe ate them before they had eaten and so we got a pretty good whipping for that. It was\nprobably worth it. It was good food. They didn\u2019t eat too bad. They got pretty decent food.",
        "A: There was one sergeant, who the rumor had it later on that he was a spy for the British, he\nseemed to be more of a... I wouldn\u2019t want to call him humane, but had a better sense of humor.\nAnd some individual guards were exceedingly cruel and would use any excuse to either kick you\nor club you with a rifle or shoot you, shoot at you. There was one incident that I recall where\none of the guards was giving one of the men, this was in the woods, gave him hell. And he\nresponded in Dutch, \u201cMan, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d And it turned out to be a Dutchman, the SS guy was a\nDutchman, and boy did he beat the living daylights out of him, out of the prisoner. And then\nwhen we came back that evening, the sergeant was there and he, we all had to stand at attention.\nAnd he demanded to know if anything had happened and this turkey said, \u201cYes sergeant, this\nman said I\u2019m crazy.\u201d The sergeant said, \u201cThat man was right, detail dismissed.\u201d We got sent on.\nBut it varied. Some of them would turn their back and just did their job. But they constantly\nchanged. You never knew. You never spoke to any of them. Some of them would drop a\ncigarette butt and walk away. Others would drop the cigarette butt and wait for you to, try to\npick it up and then step on your fingers. You never knew.",
        "A: Yeah, you didn\u2019t have time for friendships. You tried to sleep as long as you could in the\nmornings. You had a few minutes to wash your face and get dressed and stand at reveille, that\u2019s\nnot the right word.",
        "A: Roll call, thank you. Until they got done, depends on how they felt whether they got done or not.\nAnd then you went to wherever your work assignment was and then when you came back at\nnight, there could have been another roll call before or after and you may have got something to\neat and you went straight to bed. There was never any time to talk to anybody, unless somebody\nyou worked with, the guard had a back turned you could talk to each other. But most of the time\nyou couldn\u2019t. They wouldn\u2019t let you.",
        "A: Oh yes, pretty much so. Except they got better food on Sundays. They got three cans instead of\ntwo.",
        "A: Yeah, you knew pretty much what day of the week it was, what time of day it was, I\u2019m not sure.\nI don\u2019t think anybody had watches. Because at noon time they would bring the food out to\n7\nwhere you were working. We may get five or ten minutes to eat and that was it. And sunrise\nand sunset, but other than that whether it was ten of eleven or ten of twelve, nobody cared\nwhether you knew it or not.",
        "A: No, I think they were already in the camp. Trains came and went all the time, not only with\nprisoners, but also soldiers. They used the same railroad station. Occasionally we would meet\nPOW\u2019s. The Americans always were good. They would throw us packs of Camels where we\ncould get them. But I don\u2019t remember when the French women came. There were only two\nhundred of them, so they may have come in a group with others. Probably since very few of\nthem died, I would think they probably came fairly late. But I just don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Oh, I would think they would have been longer than that. I\u2019m sure they were there longer than\nthat, because first half of \u00b044... Oh, I\u2019m sorry, forty, yeah it would have been about a year and a\nhalf, a little over. Yeah, that\u2019s about right, I would think. No, I don\u2019t remember, other than I\nknew they were there, and...\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\n8\nTape 1, Side B",
        "A: Yeah, later on they brought in women from Auschwitz. And I have to back up here a minute.\nThere was an area where they had a huge circus tent, was set up. That\u2019s where they had the\nshoes. Apparently, I don\u2019t know over how long or what, the Germans had collected shoes for\nrecycling or for donations or whatever the reason they gave to collect them. And then also there\nwere a lot of military boots in there since many of them had bullet holes in them or shrapnel\nholes apparently from either wounded or dead soldiers. And what one of the big, quote,\n\u201cindustries\u201d was, was separating the upper leather from the soles and heels and then separate the\nleather from the rubber heels and/or soles. And that was done in that big tent. And then there\nwas a... the leather soles, I guess, was what they couldn\u2019t reuse. And so they were stacked up in\na humongous pile that was on the main drag and kept getting higher and higher. People, that was\nmy first assignment was working on that. You had a wheelbarrow hauling those, and then you\nhad to stack them so the whole thing wouldn\u2019t just fall over. And they emptied that, emptied that\ntent of all the shoes, and they started to bring in women and they established a separate woman\u2019s\ncamp. And it turned out that one of the first groups in there included the wife, who had been\nwith us, of a fellow. She had worked in the kitchen and she got caught taking some food to try to\ngive to her husband. And first they shipped her to, I guess to Luneburg, to jail. And she was\nthere in jail for a while and the police apparently were trying to protect her from the Gestapo, but\ncouldn\u2019t. And ultimately she was shipped to Auschwitz. But the police had warned her about\nAuschwitz and so as she arrived she managed to walk from the incoming group to an outgoing\ngroup which happened to come to Belsen. And so she was back and she was in that group. And\nshe went to the fence and hollered at somebody to tell her husband that she was back by way of\nAuschwitz. That\u2019s how we knew that group had come from Auschwitz. You could talk to them\nusually across the fence as long as you didn\u2019t get too close to the fence.",
        "A: Dutch.",
        "A: No, you never spoke to the camp guards. And I\u2019m not so sure I still could speak German back\nthen. But no. They may give you an order, but that was it. You never talked to them. There\nwas no conversation at all.",
        "A: Beautiful sight.\n9",
        "A: No. Initially we woke up because of... we were on the train still and the train was stopped. And\nall kinds of noises, and here were the Russian Cossacks just the way they were pictured, you\nknow, in their furs and horseback and rifles slung over their shoulders. And we had learned, like\nyou said, the one word in Russian, chleb (ph), which is bread. And they let us off, and so we\nwent on into town. Then there must have been some discussion about where to go and whoever,\nthey told us just to go and if you need to, throw the Germans out. And we happened to go into a\nfairly large house along with some others, who... the woman claimed they were in the Nazis, but\nher husband was a minister. And he sure was in the SS. And so we didn\u2019t have any\ncompunction about bullying them. Somebody, apparently there must have been some people\nwho spoke Yiddish or either the Russian soldiers spoke Yiddish or they spoke Russian. I\nremember somebody said something about food, and so one of the Russians just pulled out a gun\nand shot a cow and said help yourself. One of the French women recognized the opportunity and\nwent with the frontline unit. And of course, that morning crossed the Elbe River into the\nAmerican part of Germany and managed to get back to Paris, which of course had been liberated\nthe year before. And put an ad in the Paris paper, those who were looking for their wives, and I\ndon\u2019t know whether she mentioned names or it was a specific group. And they responded.\nMany of them were of course in the French Army. And so they got the American Army to send\ntwo of those two and a half ton trucks over to come and get them. And of course, everybody\nwanted to go. And they promised they\u2019d be back and they did. I guess in the euphoria, you\nknow, the war was over by that time. I think we were in Tribitz (ph) for about six weeks. All of\nthe people that were still alive from that train, there were about a thousand of them, were\nevacuated by the Americans and taken to Leipzig, where they had a DP camp. And the Russians\nlet the trucks come in and get them.",
        "A: Barely alive if you can even count that. We had to be very careful. Many people died because\nthey ate things that they couldn\u2019t digest. Their digestive system was so severely weakened or\ndisturbed that a glass of milk would kill you. You just couldn\u2019t tolerate that sort of thing. You\nhad to be very careful that you ate only a little bit and a little bit. And of course a little bit was\nalways more than what we had had for a long time. So that was important that you didn\u2019t... I\nremember getting a hold, we heard that nearby was a Army depot, food depot, and we went\nthere. And sure enough there was. And I got some... I\u2019m not sure I got cans or an open bucket\nof condensed milk, you know, had a lot of sugar in it. And we just couldn\u2019t eat it, not for a\nwhile. Because we couldn\u2019t digest it, it was that rich.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah.\n10",
        "A: Well when I got back to Amsterdam I weighed 78 pounds. So I don\u2019t know how much I\nweighed then, maybe fifty or sixty, strictly skin over bones. If I would have gotten a haircut, I\nwould have taken a pound off. (Laughing. )",
        "A: Yes, of course.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. We were all together.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Absolutely, absolutely.",
        "A: Oh sure. Oh absolutely, joyous. Now you had an opportunity, you might live. Might actually\nsee 1946. Definitely. Yeah, everybody... I\u2019m digressing, but I didn\u2019t know anybody on that\ntrain. I had never run into anybody who was, for that matter, never ran into anybody who was at\nBelsen. And I guess it\u2019s three years ago now. We were, we took a trip, first grand circle tour we\never took. It was a river cruise from Vienna to Amsterdam. It was the first time that I was back\nin Germany and I wasn\u2019t sure whether I could tolerate it or not. We decided on this trip because\nI could just stay on the boat. Didn\u2019t have to go on land where I would have to be in contact with\nany Germans. But one night we\u2019re having dinner with two ladies. One of whom, very\ninteresting woman\u2014she was the one who introduced the Lamaze method to the United States\u2014\nand her cousin. And somehow the other woman was telling us that her daughter was taking her\ndaughter, the woman\u2019s grandchild, to Europe, Amsterdam. They had discussed Anne Frank in\nclass and she wanted to see the Anne Frank house. And she said, \u201cI told my daughter there\u2019s\nalways long lines at the Anne Frank house and if you can\u2019t get in, go next door, that\u2019s where\nyour father was hidden during the war.\u201d And I said to her, \u201cOh, were you in Amsterdam during\nthe war?\u201d And she said yes she was, but her two sisters both got found out. They all had gone\ninto hiding. And they ended up in Belsen. I said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s where I was. I never met anybody\nfrom Belsen.\u201d I said, \u201cAre they still alive?\u201d And she said yeah, the one sister was. But the other\nsister and her husband died after they were liberated. They were hauled by train. \u201cOh,\u201d I said,\n\u201cto Tribitz?\u201d And she said \u201cYes, how do you know?\u201d And I said, \u201cI was on that train also.\u201d\nAnd so that\u2019s as close as I ever came to meeting anybody or knowing anybody. But the irony,\nirony, small world: the sister who was still alive lived next door to my mother\u2019s closest friend in\nNew York. So you never know. But no, I didn\u2019t know anybody and outside of that incident I\nhave never talked to anybody who was there. As a matter of fact, my brother is very active.\nHe\u2019s on the Board of Directors of the Anne Frank house. And I happened to be talking to him\nabout a year or so ago and he told me, and I didn\u2019t realize, I went to school with Anne Frank. I\nwas in the same class, but I don\u2019t remember her at all. And I got to wondering if there is a class\n11\npicture that exists. I\u2019ll have to ask him of the grade school. Because we both should be in it.\nJust curious.",
        "A: There is somebody and my brother knows about it, her, that 1s apparently active in the Anne\nFrank House Foundation and goes around speaking. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the same woman or not.\nBut somebody that was either a friend of Anne Frank or knew her.",
        "A: First in Leipzig. Essentially what it was, was a military barracks that was used. We could come\nand go. We were not prisoners. They let us come and go. Matter of fact, very grateful about\nmany things. De-lousing with DDT. They sprayed us from head to toe with DDT. Think how\nenvironmentally unacceptable that is today. And I\u2019m still alive in spite of it. But it got rid of the\nfleas and in particular the lice which was so important. But we could come and go as we\npleased. And I don\u2019t remember it was with my brother or some other boys, anyway, young men,\nwe would get on the trolley and the conductor trying to collect money from us and we told him\nwhat he could do, or what we would do. We were pretty nasty. So they left us pretty much\nalone. And then we weren\u2019t there all that long. And then when they were told, they\u2019re going to\ntake us back to Holland, it was on a Red Cross train. We wouldn\u2019t go onto the beds because they\nwere absolutely starched, bleached, perfectly white sheets. And here we were, in spite of getting\nregular baths, pretty filthy. We only had one set of clothes and shoes. I\u2019m sure we had shoes. I\nhad a woman\u2019s blouse, because I remember it, Army blouse, because it buttoned the wrong way.\nBut they weren\u2019t even able to fit, not small enough. They insisted we get in the beds and don\u2019t\nworry about getting them dirty. And then they brought us bread that was as white as the sheets\nwere. Couldn\u2019t believe that. But anyway they took us back to Holland and they put us in a\nconvent in southern Holland, where the Dutch then sorted things out. And you had to have a\nplace to stay before they\u2019d send you back to Amsterdam. And that was taken care of.",
        "A: No. Well, I suppose if you would have known somebody or run into somebody that you knew\nhad been a, recognized a prison guard, I don\u2019t think he would have survived. But that would\nhave been such a chance encounter. No. Well, for one thing we were wearing what looked like\nAmerican Army uniforms because that\u2019s the only clothing, I guess, that we were given. I\u2019m not\nsure what else the Red Cross had that they gave us. So that the Germans gave us a pretty wide\nberth. Because they didn\u2019t have anything to do anyway. Things were pretty chaotic.\n12",
        "A: Hopeful is probably the best. No, I don\u2019t think anger set in until later. At that point you\u2019re just\ntrying to revive, was probably the closest word to describe it. You\u2019re still fairly weak. You\u2019re\nbeginning to get a little better. You can eat a little bit more. Beginning to feel a little better all\nthe time. And at this point you\u2019re just trying to survive. You\u2019re really not thinking about the\nfuture, what you want to do, or what you have to do or what you\u2019re going to do. You\u2019re still\npreoccupied with eating, primarily.",
        "A: And getting, yeah, yeah, sure. And we did.",
        "A: Well, initially of course, I think we were all spread out. I stayed with one family who was a\nfriend of my parents. My brother stayed with a friend of his. His closest friend was an\nAmerican. His father was the distributor for Holland and Belgium of RKO, the movies. And I\nthink he stayed with them. And my parents stayed with, I don\u2019t even remember who it was.\nSomebody. So we were in different locations. We weren\u2019t really, and this was like, talking the\nsummer of \u201845. There really wasn\u2019t much going on. Trying to see about getting back into\nschool. My high school class had graduated. I think we may have actually been back in\nAmsterdam when the graduation was, but of course they wouldn\u2019t give me my diploma. Hadn\u2019t\nbeen there in four years. Four out of six wasn\u2019t good enough. And so my mother was making\narrangements to see what the school about me trying out, well both of us, trying to get back into\nschool in the Fall. What the requirements would be, and trying to line up a tutor and a place to\nlive. And I think, somebody... the Dutch did things fairly reasonably. The person that was\nliving in our house had gotten there in good faith. He did not know, or they did not know that\nwas the property or the residence of deported Jews. And so what they did, if the person had\nsomething in good faith, so you don\u2019t have, just transfer the victim from one person to another.\nThey could stay there. So my parents found a place to live. And I don\u2019t know where the\nfurniture came from, whether that was, whether those were donations or purchases or whether\nthey had given some of that furniture to somebody to hide. But anyway we ultimately had an\napartment where we lived. And then school started pretty soon. We had a tutor trying to get us\nup to speed, because I was allowed into the senior class on the condition that if I didn\u2019t measure\nup, that the school would have the right not to let me take the comprehensive exams at the end of\nthe year. Well that\u2019s the deal they made with my parents, obviously. Apparently I did all right\nbecause... and I do remember having to go to a couple of teachers after classes for additional\ninstruction. It\u2019s kind of tough to pick up solid geometry if you haven\u2019t had trigonometry. So,\ntrying to catch up.",
        "A: I never thought of it in those terms, but I suppose so because that\u2019s the only thing we did, was to\ngo to school. And you come home, and you may have had to stay after class for additional\ninstruction. And depending on\u2014I\u2019m not sure whether you\u2019re familiar with the European\nsystem\u2014it\u2019s not ten minutes worth of homework. You spent every night doing homework, and\n13\nwe went to school on Saturdays half a day. And so maybe we were allowed to go and play for\nten minutes before dinner. Or if we happened to get done by eight o\u2019clock, the homework, we\ncould play for a half hour before going to bed. But it, it was all-consuming, essentially, except\nmaybe for the weekends.",
        "A: No, not really. It really would have been pointless anyway. The Dutch had been exceedingly\nhelpful, and trying to shield people. And not personally, but from others that they tried to hide\nan awful lot of Jews. The population as a whole, with minor exceptions, had always been very\nsupportive. And now you're back after the war and you\u2019re no longer wearing the star, you\u2019re no\nlonger distinguishable from the rest of the population. And so there was no need for anybody to\neither bend over backwards or kick you in the shins. So, no, I don\u2019t think, as a matter of fact, I\nreally haven\u2019t dwelled on it much all my life. I have a cousin who was a professional Holocaust\nsurvivor and I always detested that. It was one of those things that happened, nothing you can do\nabout it. I\u2019m not ashamed of it certainly. I\u2019m not proud of it. I mean, nothing you can do about\nit. I suppose like most unpleasant things, you try and put them out of your mind.",
        "A: No, never did. I\u2019ve never been much for psychologists. (Laughing.) No, I never, and I suppose\na lot of the reason I don\u2019t remember a lot of things because they\u2019re probably suppressed\nmemory, and why bring it up? What purpose does it serve? I know a friend of mine keeps after\nme to try and write a book. And I don\u2019t, I say absolutely not. One, there\u2019s not enough to fill a\npage, but aside from that, no, I don\u2019t... matter of fact, there\u2019s somebody come from the\nHolocaust Museum this month. Did you see that?",
        "A: I think it\u2019s, Goldfarb, is that his name?",
        "A: Yeah, whatever. It 1s Goldfarb, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Yeah, okay. That\u2019s okay. Okay, that\u2019s all right. I got invitation, I don\u2019t know where it came\nfrom. It was an invitation to the Holocaust survivors in the second generation. And I was\ndebating whether to go or not. Because one thing, I don\u2019t know any of them that are here. And\nI\u2019m not so sure whether I care to or not. I haven\u2019t made up my mind. I may decide on the last\nminute whether I will or not.\n14",
        "A: Yeah. And that came about because he saw an article in a paper about the Anne Frank\nFoundation and somebody\u2019s name who was, I guess the Chairman of the Board, who lived near\nwhere he lived in Vermont. And he had never heard of the man before and he called him to meet\nhim, just out of curiosity. And apparently they got friendly and he got him involved in the Anne\nFrank Foundation and he\u2019s on the Board of Directors now, has been for a few years. And he\ngoes around the country every so often making speeches and fundraising and that sort of thing.\nAnd I\u2019m not sure whether he knew, because looking at his tape, I\u2019m not sure whether he\nmentioned the name of the school that we went to or not. Anyway I don\u2019t remember what it is.\nBut it was obviously the same school that Anne Frank went to. The only thing I remember about\nthat school is we made honey in the Fall. They had bee hives on the roof. I was thinking about\nthat earlier, I don\u2019t know why. Whenever it was ready we would go upstairs and they would take\nthe hives, the honeycombs out and put them in a centrifuge and we made honey. And I guess\ncarved up the combs and sold it with the wax and the honey. That\u2019s about the only thing I\nremember. (Laughing.) There was something else, too, animal-related about that grade school.\nCan\u2019t think of it.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\n15\nTape 2, Side A",
        "A: No, I tell you reason I am laughing 1s I suppose if you look for sympathy it would be. But no, I\ndon\u2019t. I\u2019ve never found any benefit to either, occasionally if I get pushed I will mention it. I\nnormally don\u2019t as a matter of conversation. We were in Spain and there was a couple in that\ngroup that we were with, who were Germans, who had retired. He had worked for General\nMotors and they lived in Windsor, across in Canada. And they had invited a friend of theirs\nfrom Germany to come down and join us. We were on the trip up to Granada to see the\nAlhambra. And on the way back we were sitting at a table and this man came wandering in by\nhimself. I said to him in German, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d He complained, \u201cNot very well.\u201d He\ndidn\u2019t speak English, and so unless his friends were around... blah, blah, blah. And then on a\nstop on the way back, we were standing in line together and he said, \u201cHow come you speak\nGerman so well?\u201d And I was debating what to say. I just said, \u201cI was in a concentration camp.\u201d\nAnd I totally devastated that man. And that evening he sought me out in the bar and came to\napologize. I said, \u201cHey, it\u2019s not your fault, you were too young.\u201d This man was in his fifties, he\nmay have been a child at the time. \u201cOh, please come to Germany,\u201d he would host us, et cetera,\net cetera. So I\u2019m always very careful because there\u2019s no need to upset people that have no, you\nknow, no responsibility. I\u2019m not looking for an advantage. So no, I rarely volunteer the\ninformation.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s the neo-Nazism that says it never happened. And I think there needs to be as much\nevidence as possible to show that it really did happen. And that those many of us who survived\nare perfectly normal people. Or what passes for normal, at least I think so. (Laughing.) And\ndon\u2019t all go around looking, \u201cHey, you owe me a favor because I survived.\u201d But it\u2019s not a bias\nfree society. Until whatever it is, say five years ago... I\u2019ve been wanting to go and visit my\ngrandparent\u2019s grave. I just couldn\u2019t bring myself the thought of going to Germany. One,\nbecause it\u2019s Germany; and two, that I wasn\u2019t sure whether I could control my temper if\nsomebody were to say something to me that would set me off. And so we decided on a trial and\nthat was we went to Switzerland for a week with day trips out of Lucerne. And the first trip was\nto the Black Forest. You get out of it for lunch and you get back on the bus. The bus was the\nsafe haven. And then another day for a couple of hours. And it went all right. I didn\u2019t feel\nparticularly bad or tense. But on that boat trip, after Cologne it got to me suddenly, and I had to\nget out of there. And I actually during dinner, got up, went up on top of the boat, on the top\ndeck, to make sure we passed that border back into Holland. Because I just got obsessed all of a\nsudden, panicky. And haven\u2019t been back since.\n16",
        "A: Well, they know about it, of course. At least one daughter, I think has... no, I think they all have\ncopies of the tape of the interview. The tape that one of my... it\u2019s really my father\u2019s cousin that\nwas much more informative than mine or, for that matter, my brother\u2019s. This fellow got to\nBelsen the day before the liberation or two days before the liberation. The Swedes took him out,\nsent him to Sweden. He was in a Swedish hospital for a year. But he decided to use that year to\nwrite down everything he could remember. And then spend the rest of his life filling in the\ndetails that he didn\u2019t remember, and try and get the... and he wrote a book. The original was\npublished in German and just before he died, supposedly it was published, finally got published\nin English. And I never did get a copy of it. I'll have to ask my cousin for it. But I got a copy of\nhis tape. But he remembers names and dates and... and he went from one labor camp to another\nlabor camp, and the name of the commander of the camp and all that kind of stuff that I have no\nidea about and really, don\u2019t really care. And yeah, my kids know, but they also really have no\nrelation to it. My youngest daughter couldn\u2019t, when I said something to her about the Vietnam\nWar, she says, \u201cBut Dad I was only six then.\u201d You know, so it\u2019s all ancient history. Just like\nWorld War One is ancient history to me. I know about it. I\u2019m a bit of a history buff and I\nwanted to see the Bosporus. That\u2019s a World War One site. The British took one hell of a beating\nthere. That was Churchill\u2019s doing. And went to Yalta, wanted to see that. But no, they\u2019re not\nreally interested.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure. My wife may have told them something or my mother may have. It may have\ncome out, a comment here or there or something that occurred that made me bring it up or a\nprogram that I watched. Spielberg had a program, was it last week or week before last, it was on\nHBO. I was going to tape it, but I don\u2019t have HBO. When there\u2019s something on the Holocaust I\nusually tape it. More for my information than to show others.",

        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s danger in it, it may bore people to death, but you can do that with other\nthings, too. That was the singular defining incident of his life. And everything is being related\nto that. I... that may have been the most important event in my life, even though I don\u2019t think\nso. I think there are much more important things, I mean it\u2019s part of my history. I was fortunate\nthat I survived it, and I moved on. I don\u2019t particularly dwell on it. Or try and say, \u201cNow wait a\nminute, I married that woman because I didn\u2019t see that woman...\u201d or you know, and relate it to\nthe Holocaust. It has nothing to do with it. Well, in his case everything was. It came up in\nevery conversation.",
        "A: No, because I doubt whether anybody that would know me or that I would know, would find out\nthat I am a Holocaust survivor until they really have known me for a long time. Because it\u2019s, see\nI don\u2019t normally bring it up. Not unless something happens to make it pop up for some reason or\nanother, inadvertently, but no, I wouldn\u2019t think so. They just see the lack of hair. (Laughing. )",
        "A: Yeah, definitely. I am the only Jew in my family.",
        "A: Yes. (Laughing.) And I am proud of it.",
        "A: Oh, I am saying it jokingly and seriously. My wife is Episcopalian. Our children were baptized\nin the Episcopalian church, but are not particularly religious. My youngest daughter was married\nin the Catholic church and now her children were just baptized in the last month, because they\nwant... the older one now is going to first grade. And with the public schools here in Louisville\nin such a mess, they want to put the boy into parochial school. And they belong to a parish and\napparently they are now going to church regularly, which 1s fine. I have no problem with it one\nway or the other. Our oldest daughter was married for the first time in the Episcopal cathedral in\nLexington, which as you may know is so orthodox that the mass was in Latin.",
        "A: I know. (Laughing.) That marriage didn\u2019t last and her current husband is a Baptist. I\u2019m not sure\nthat they are going to church, but their son goes to Bible school. He was in, going to public\nschool, not this Fall, but he was in a Baptist kindergarten and preschool. And the other one\ndoesn\u2019t have any children and as far as I know, they were married by a minister who was, whom\nthey knew. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying that.\n18",
        "A: No, not really. No more so than what it means being a chemist or of German extraction or\nmarried or grandfather or anything else. You better not say anything anti-Semitic or Ill blow\nyour head off. (Laughing.) But other than that, no.",
        "A: Not really, no, no. Keep certain traditions, but I... bit of a pragmatist, and I\u2019m not all that\ntradition-bound. I think the dietary laws make good sense from a health perspective, but I don\u2019t\nparticularly find the need to avoid eating shrimp.",
        "A: Well it\u2019s really more ethnic than a religion. Did you by chance see that program on trying to find\nthe lost tribes a few weeks ago on PBS? Fascinating program. To some people being Jewish is a\nreligion, obviously, Sammy Davis Jr. is probably the... Elizabeth Taylor. But to... I would think\nmost Jews, it\u2019s more ethnic than religious. You can\u2019t help whatever your racial or ethnic\nbackground is. I\u2019m not hiding it and I\u2019m not flaunting it. So, I don\u2019t care. You know, whether\nsomebody knows or doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care personally, what I mean is I\u2019m not\nconcerned about it.",

        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Well, initially to graduate from high school, you know, trying to pass the exams or get far\nenough along that I would be allowed to take the exams. And then once they decided that I\ncould, then of course sweating like everybody else to pass them. But I did. I wanted to become\na chemist or a chemical engineer. And after I graduated from high school I went to Delft,\nTechnical Institute in Delft for one year, \u201846, \u201847, to study chemical engineering. Then much to\nmy dismay, my parents decided to come to the United States and I didn\u2019t want to go. Well for\none thing, you had to leave your friends, just getting into the swing of things having done my\nfreshman year in college. But they didn\u2019t give me a choice, and so then of course the logical\nthing was... a lot of my mother\u2019s family and some of my dad\u2019s family were over here, had been\nover here for years, so we came over here in \u201847, Memorial Day, \u201847.\n19",

I said, \u201cOkay, Ill go with you,\nbut I\u2019m going to go back.\u201d You get used to... it\u2019s a changed situation, and I probably didn\u2019t\nreally give it much serious thought after some months or some years to go back. Go ahead.",
        "A: Well, you know the only notions you have are the cowboys, and the skyscrapers of New York.\nAnd since it was Memorial Day when we got here, the night before traveling along the South\nshore of Long Island you saw the fireworks. Of course, you didn\u2019t know what was going on.\nMemorial Day didn\u2019t mean anything to us. Then it was hot. I\u2019m not sure if it was hot for\nMemorial Day, but like it is right now. It was one of these early hot spells. Our, my mother\u2019s\nbrothers came and picked us up, met us at the boat, and took us over to my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s\napartment.",
        "A: In New York, New York City. My mother was one of 13 brothers and sisters. And one, two,\nthree... four sisters were in the United States, and three of her brothers. And the three, three\nsisters and the three brothers lived in New York City. And my dad\u2019s sister, I think she may still\nhave been in Rochester at the time. I\u2019m not sure. And matter of fact, they had written, my\nmother\u2019s brothers had gotten an apartment for us, which was across the street from one and next-\ndoor to one of the other ones. In Queens, in New York City. And so we lived there. I guess, but\nI\u2019m not sure, we stayed with my aunt for a while until our furniture arrived, because I\u2019m not sure\nit was on the same boat. It came later. I don\u2019t remember, it\u2019s been a long time.",
        "A: Oh Yeah, yeah. The Veyndam (ph) was the name of the ship.",
        "A: It was a Holland-America Line freighter built in 1914. I looked it up recently, that\u2019s why I can\nspout that stuff. (Laughing.) It was requisitioned during World War Two and was used as a\ntroop ship. And then this was the last trip across the Atlantic to the States to be reconverted, to\nhave all of the bunks and all that stuff taken out and be converted back to a freighter and was\nretired in 1954. I couldn\u2019t remember the name of the ship. I looked it up in the New York\nTimes a year or two ago. They had the comings and goings of all the ships and they listed them\nin the New York Times. Listed as May 30\", Memorial, May 30\" with 112 passengers.",
        "A: Oh yes. (Laughing.) The... I\u2019m not sure how many, 20 or so people could live in the cabins and\nmy parents had a cabin. Most of us were down in the hold and like all troop ships, you know,\nseven stacks. And we used the bottom one or the second bottom one, there was nobody there.\n20\nAnd it was pretty good until the weather got rough. We really got tossed around and that day\nthat we got tossed around the dinner was bacon and beans. I just stayed in the bunk. But one\nfellow, he was a big eater. He never missed a meal and he came charging down the steps, threw\nhis teeth on the bunk and ran back up and fed the fish. Then he came back, got his teeth, and\nwent back to eat the second time. (Laughing.) That\u2019s about all. It was a long trip. It was 14\ndays, the ship was slow. But that\u2019s all I remember. It was unremarkable. Left from Antwerp,\nstopped in South Hampton to Hoboken, which was the Holland-American Line terminal. Ellis\nIsland had been closed about a month or two earlier, so we didn\u2019t come through Ellis Island.",
        "A: Hot, hot and dirty. Of course the high rise, and the frantic activity, cars going everywhere.",
        "A: Non-existent or very poor. Well, I had high school English. But didn\u2019t have much choice, had\nto learn in a hurry, because I got a job within a week as a lab technician at Mount Sinai Hospital.\nPaid the glorious wage of 100 dollars a month. And we had to work half day Saturdays. And\nthen we took, had to take... we didn\u2019t have to, we took turns taking calls on the weekends. That\npaid an extra six dollars. And the girls all were more interested in going to the beach, so I took\nall of their calls, because I needed the six dollars more than I needed a suntan. And then I got a\nticket. Two weeks in this country and I got a ticket. That was Saturday morning, going to work,\nI was going down the subway and a cop stopped me. I didn\u2019t know what he wanted. I didn\u2019t\nunderstand enough of what he was saying. And so I pulled my passport out and I opened it on\nthe immigration stamp to show him I don\u2019t, you know it was two weeks. I did understand what\nidentification was. And so he proceeded to write and tore this thing out, gave me my passport\nback and tore this thing out and told me it was a ticket. Well the only meaning of the word ticket\nI knew was admission to a theater. Didn\u2019t want to, don\u2019t have time to go. Tried to explain...\nfinally made me take it, he told me I didn\u2019t have to go myself, I could give it to somebody else.\nWhen I got to work I tried to tell the fellow I work with, I asked him if he wanted the ticket. He\nsaid what for? (Laughing.) I told him I didn\u2019t know, but a cop had given it to me. So he\nexplained to me that I had gotten a ticket for whatever, well, it was June and first of July was the\nend of the fiscal year and he had to make his quota, so he was writing tickets furiously and I\nguess I looked like a good sucker for one. And when I became a citizen you have to list all non-\nmoving traffic violations excepted. So I went back to court to find out what the heck I had done.\nWhatever it was, violation of city code something or other, disposition, two dollars. Fine of two\ndollars, that was it. But it\u2019s on my records.",
        "A: No, I had to list it on my citizenship application.",
        "A: Oh it listed whatever it was, the code violation, but I have no idea what it was that I did. You\nknow, hopscotch down the steps into the subway, who knows what it was. The reason you had\n21\nto be so careful... in the \u201830s and \u201840s, well prior to let\u2019s say the \u201850s and \u201860s, anti-Semitism\nwas an acceptable feeling in this country. And the State Department was so strongly anti-\nSemitic, they saw it as their function to keep as many Jews out as they could, not to try and\nrescue as many and let them in. And the Immigration Service didn\u2019t help matters either. An\nuncle of mine when he went for his hearing was asked for his convictions. He said he didn\u2019t\nhave any. The judge says, \u201cThink it over and come back in six months.\u201d This went on twice.\nYou know, what the hell are you talking about? Well, it turned out that there was somebody\nwith the same name, apparently, who had gotten a parking ticket in Buffalo, New York. And\nthey accused him of lying because he didn\u2019t list it. And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t even know where\nBuffalo is and I don\u2019t have an automobile.\u201d So they finally... but his citizenship was delayed for\na year over something like that.",
        "A: Oh sure. There wasn\u2019t any... they put a lot of barriers in the way. Of course then too, you\nknow, the rules were a little different. You had to be a resident for five years. You had to\ndemonstrate your fluency in English, not like today where they\u2019 Il give it to you in Spanish or\nFrench or whatever. And lastly you had to demonstrate a knowledge of American history. And\nthe Daughters of the American Revolution used to give courses in American history for\nforeigners. Who was the 23\" president? They asked my dad to name the 13 original colonies.\nAnd he got as far as one or two, I remember, and the judge said, \u201cGuess I asked the wrong\nperson, you tell me.\u201d Well, I started out with Georgia going up the coast, because I could never\nremember whether it\u2019s Maine or New Hampshire. (Laughing.) And he stopped me when I got\nto Vermont. So I got off easy. I got at least 12 of the 13. And he asked me, I still don\u2019t know\nwhy that was the wrong answer, he asked me, \u201cWhy do we celebrate the Fourth of July?\u201d I said,\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s Independence Day.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the right answer. I\u2019m not sure what it was\nsupposed to be. But they were pretty strict and... depending on the judge, most of those were\nnot all that bad. But there was... well Dupont did not hire its first Jew until World War Two.\nAnd when I graduated from college in \u201854, Armstrong-Quartz (ph) still didn\u2019t hire Jews. It was\nthat pervasive still.",

I didn\u2019t\nknow that. I applied for admission to Columbia and RPI, Rensselaer in Albany, Schenectady.\nAnd I was turned down. In one instance, the Dutch quota was filled.

And I\u2019m not sure whether\nthat was a matter of need or a matter of discipline. That you live here, you gotta pay for it. Earn\nmoney, your share, which was no problem. Once in the Fall, I started at night at the City College\nof New York, went to night school and worked during the day. Did that all the way through.",
        "A: Oh yeah, very quickly, certainly. And I don\u2019t want you to think that I was paranoid about these\nbarriers that you ran into. It was just ignorance, you learn from it.

I graduated in January of\n\u201851. And went on to Graduate school, and they just gave me fits all the way through. They\nwould re-classify me 1-A, had to appeal it. Then they would get it back to a student deferment\nfor six months, but retroactive to a date of... so half the time I was deferred, half the time I\nwasn\u2019t, which was a real distraction while in school. But I made it through all right. Didn\u2019t even\nthink about it, I went to work for Shell Oil Company and that was deferrable employment\nbecause of the oil industry. Of course the war was pretty well over by that time anyway, \u201854.",
        "A: Not very happy about it. I wasn\u2019t even a citizen. As a matter of fact, my brother, who was\ndrafted, he did not go to school, he was actually sent to Germany. And when this citizenship\nhearing came up, he couldn\u2019t, because he was overseas. I mean, that\u2019s the most preposterous\nthing. He was in the U.S. Army therefore he couldn\u2019t become a citizen. But not particularly\nhappy about it. Wasted enough time in my life already without having to serve a few more years\nin the Army. But no, I wasn\u2019t particularly, I was not unwilling. I mean, I wasn\u2019t going to refuse.\nBut I wasn\u2019t going to volunteer either.",
        "A: We lived in the same house. Well, I have to say that I was too poor to live in the dormitory and\nthree of us shared an apartment.",
        "A: This was at Duke, at Duke University in Durham. And this is one of these old, you know, like\nold Louisville. Big homes and they made it into a number of apartments. We had one apartment\nupstairs, it was a Divinity student and his wife. Another apartment upstairs and the landlady\nrented out one of the apartments downstairs to Alice and her roommate. That\u2019s how we met. I\nwas at Duke, she was working. She was a lab technician working at the VA hospital.\n24",
        "A: Chemistry.",
        "A: Analytical chemistry. That\u2019s what I used to do for a living for a long time.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I think so. My dad certainly was, my mother, I\u2019m not so sure. I don\u2019t think any girl would have\nbeen good enough for my mother.",
        "A: No, oh no, no. They uh, no, certainly not. They, well as I mentioned, my mother is one of\nthirteen children, two of them were killed in World War One. Of the remaining eleven, three\nbrothers were here and four sisters. And the one brother was picked up during the Kristallnacht\nthing in \u201838 and taken to Dachau. And then was released because he had pneumonia, so he\nwouldn\u2019t die in a concentration camp, so they could count him as having released him, rather\nthan having him die there. And he died at home. And they decided they better get their son out\nbefore he\u2019s going to get it too. But my mother\u2019s sister-in-law with her daughter stayed and they\nperished. And another sister and her husband had moved to Belgium in the early \u201830s. He was a\nvery prosperous furniture manufacturer. They had two daughters. And they actually helped one\nof the other sisters\u2019 children, they managed to get out, I guess, as late as \u00b042, by way of Belgium\nand through Portugal. They stayed for a while with them. But that couple with their children,\nthe sister, they perished. As a matter of fact, I had documentation of them at one time, their death\ncertificates. And then on my father\u2019s side, my grandmother, my dad\u2019s mother, lived in\nAmsterdam also. And she had cardiac problems so bad, she couldn\u2019t have walked from here to\nthe front door without taking nitroglycerine, but she survived the cattle car ride to the gas\nchambers and died at Auschwitz. And one of, his sister was here, but his brother was still in\nGermany and he perished. And so no, we, and fortunately for my mother\u2019s, my grandmother,\nmy maternal grandmother, she died in late \u201844, so she never did find out what happened to her\nchildren, those that were in Europe. But no, that was a common topic of conversation in the\nfamily. My... the son that was sent over, he went back to his hometown looking for his parents\nor for his mother and sister. He was in the Army. Some of my other cousins that were in the\nArmy went looking for the relatives and for us. Of course once we got back to Holland, my\nparents, my mother contacted her sisters, and let them know that we had survived. Of course,\nthey also asked to see if we could find out from there what happened to the other relatives. And\nthere\u2019s the extended family as I mentioned, my dad\u2019s cousin, his parents did not survive.\n25",
        "A: Robertson, he... (Laughing.) I\u2019m laughing because you ask about the name. His name was\nRosenberg also and when he was in the hospital in Sweden a man came in, a British Army\nofficer and said to him, \u201cAre you Hans Rosenberg?\u201d He said yes. He said, \u201cI\u2019m Peter\nRobertson, your brother.\u201d (Laughing.) He had been sent out and was drafted in the British\nArmy and they wouldn\u2019t allow the name Rosenberg. Because in the event of he would be\ncaptured by the Germans that they wouldn\u2019t... he wanted to just anglicize 1t and make it\nMontrose, but there\u2019s a Lord Montrose and you\u2019re not allowed to use the name of a famous\nperson, so they made it Robertson. And so then when he came over here and became a citizen he\ndecided so he would have the same name as his brother he changed his name to Robertson.",
        "A: Henry, Hans.",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "A: Family members, to some extent, property, the carpet which is in our family room used to belong\nto my parents and then of course, the Germans got it. And my dad was, sometime, I\u2019m not sure\nwhen, in the fifties, he was in Holland on business and he saw it hanging in a carpet store in the\nwindow. And he went in and said, \u201cThat\u2019s my carpet.\u201d Fellow says, \u201cTough luck, it cost you so\nmuch,\u201d whatever it was. He took a picture of it, but 1t didn\u2019t do any good, because as I said\nearlier, the Dutch didn\u2019t want to transfer the victim from one to another. But they ended up\nbuying it again. And then I got it after my mother died. There are other things that come up\noccasionally or would come up about something that was missing, or wondering where it was. I\nhad a fairly nice stamp collection that I had given to a friend for safekeeping. And all the\nvaluable stamps are gone. You know, you can be harsh about it, saying they stole from you, on\nthe other hand, they may have traded it for food and needed it. They didn\u2019t know whether you\nwere going to come back or not. The only one that was absolutely and scrupulously honest was\nthe concierge of the business where my dad worked. He had everything that my dad entrusted\nto him and gave every bit of it back. Where many of your so-called friends denied they ever had\nanything. And there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s unfortunate and I didn\u2019t know about it until fairly\nrecently. Apparently my mother had written a long letter to one of her sisters, or maybe to all of\nthem, same letter addressed to all of them, about the deprivation, et cetera, et cetera. She said\nher ambition was to die in her own bed between clean sheets. And that letter wasn\u2019t discovered\nuntil one of my cousins, one of the sister\u2019s daughters, who lived on Long Island, but was moving\nto Florida and was going through the stuff to throw things away and came across that letter and\ngave it to... I think there may be one or two pages missing. But it was not until a year or so, two\nyears after my mother had died. And that explained a lot of things to us. But fortunately we\n26\nwere able to do that unknowingly. She died at home in her own bed. It was difficult to do it that\nway, but...",
        "A: From Holland after the war, she had wrote that to her sisters, describing what had happened to\nsome extent during the war and the deprivations and how that was her ambition. She wrote in\nthere, \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to give those bastards the pleasure of throwing me into a mass grave. I\nwant to die in my own bed between clean sheets.\u201d Probably one of the reasons for our survival\nwas my mother\u2019s strong will. I think that had a lot to do with it. Probably didn\u2019t realize it at the\ntime.",
        "A: Much more easier-going person, yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, definitely. Not only... you talking my parents and my brother and I, or overall\nthe relatives?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yes definitely, and still am. I mean there aren\u2019t that many of us left. But I talk to some\nof my cousins on a fairly regular basis. We don\u2019t see each other all that often because we\u2019re now\nscattered. A few years ago in Spring we decided to make a round-trip to Florida and visit Alice\u2019s\nbrother and then take a few days on the beach and then went to visit some of my cousins. When\neverybody lived in New York, when all they lived in New York I would see them whenever I got\nto New York once a year, but now they\u2019re scattering too. Retiring and dying, too. Not all of us\nare alive anymore in our generation.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t think so. You\u2019d have to ask her, but I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: That never became an issue, no, not really. No, it would have to have only become a topic of\nconversation... well it did. I had back problems, it\u2019s now, what? 30-some years ago. And when\nI asked the surgeon what, was there any indication what the cause was. And he said, without\nknowing what my background was, he says, \u201cYeah, severe malnutrition during your growing\nyears.\u201d But other than that, normally it was not a topic of...\n27",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Oh yeah, she knows. I\u2019m sure my mother told her probably a number of things, and\noccasionally... well, she\u2019s seen the videos also. All the kids have seen them. I\u2019m pretty sure, I\nmay even have made copies for them. They\u2019re aware of it, but it\u2019s just a piece of history, not\n\u201cthe\u201d. A lot of difference there.",
        "A: Yeah, we... a bit hectic few days. I had my Ph.D. orals on Thursday and a final in a class on\nMonday. We got married on Tuesday and we left during that, after the wedding and went around\nthe coast of Houston, where I had to report for work a little less than two weeks later.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I was a research chemist. I stayed there for five years. I didn\u2019t like what I was doing and started\nlooking for another job and got a job with GE in Cincinnati and was there for almost ten years\nand then got transferred down here.",
        "A: My parents, my dad actually died in \u201867 of a second heart attack. And my mother lived in New\nYork, New York City. My brother, after he got out of the Service in early \u201853, got a job with a\nDutch Ore company that had holdings all over the world. And matter of fact that\u2019s why he\nchanged his name. His last name is Rosley, ROS LEY. He anglicized it so he wouldn\u2019t be\nmistaken for a German after the war, when there was still a lot of anti-German feeling all through\nthe world. He was essentially overseas in one place or another until 1963, I believe, is when he\ncame back after having been in Brazil for a number of years. And he lived in New York then\nuntil he retired, oh, some ten years or so ago and moved to Vermont. Where he still officially\nlives in Vermont.",
        "A: Problem-solving using chemistry as a tool to solve a lot of technical problems. That was\nprobably my forte. I was pretty good at it, at the time.\n28",
        "A: Shell? Well, it was a particular development scheme, you took one step forward and maybe two\nbackwards. It just got to be a bore. And I asked for a different assignment and they said, \u201cNo,\nno, you\u2019re doing too well. You\u2019re getting where we want you to go.\u201d And I didn\u2019t want to go\nthere. And so I started to look for something else. And the most interesting job that I was being\nconsidered for was with the Navy in San Francisco. But the chief of that office was on a year\u2019s\nsabbatical in Belgium and they weren\u2019t going to make a decision until he came back. And I\nwasn\u2019t going to wait another year. And the assignment that they talked to me about in Cincinnati\nwas pretty interesting. And I had a good time. It was nerve-racking, because I didn\u2019t realize it at\nthe time, it was ACE, the Atomic Energy Commission was the primary contractor. And so it was\nat the whims of the government. And two years after I was up there we went overnight from\nthree thousand to three hundred employees. Fortunately I was one of the three hundred that they\nkept. I finally decided this is getting too much, these ups and downs, and mostly downs. And\nthere was another one coming, so I decided to look around the company for other possible\nopportunities and they happened to have an opening down here, so I applied for it and got it.",
        "A: Yeah, in the appliance business here as an analytical chemist. And then a year later or two years\nlater, | was made manager of analytical chemistry, chemistry and processes. But anyway,\nessentially a multitude of problems.",
        "A: Well... (Laughing) funny, because we talked about it yesterday. While we were still living in\nOhio, the Riverfront Stadium was the big issue. It was being built, where to build it. They\nstarted construction. And they said when they got done with that they were going to build the\nbiggest zoo in the world. They were going to put a fence around Kentucky. So, that answers\nthat question, right? No, not really, didn\u2019t know much about it. I was commuting for about six\nweeks, no, longer than that, two months. And so got acquainted a little bit with the area while I\nwas still living up there. And there wasn\u2019t that much difference. People are people everywhere.\nAnd a pretty nice group of people here that I worked with and worked for. Matter of fact, \u2019'm\nstill friends with, fairly good friends with one of my former bosses. And I\u2019m particularly happy\nabout that.",
        "A: \u201868, a little over 32 years ago.",
        "A: Work, neighbors, people I worked with or for, or that worked for me, neighbors, people who live\nin the area or met at the swimming pool, or wife was in a bridge club. And still have friends\nfrom Cincinnati days, too. In fact, one of our good friends, who was a neighbor in Cincinnati,\nnow lives in Fort Worth. Known him for 35 years maybe.\n29",
        "A: No, not particularly. Now I\u2019m on every Jewish organization\u2019s mailing list.",
        "A: There was an article in the Courier Journal, maybe a year ago, whenever it was, about the\nTemple and how the Temple needed expansion and they were going to have a quiet campaign for\nconstruction funds, for building funds. So, I sent them a check with a note attached that \u201cSince\nyou\u2019re having a quiet campaign I\u2019m sending you a check on the QT.\u201d And got a very nice letter\nback, as a matter of fact, a friend of mine who is quite involved with the Temple, the lady\nshowed him the letter not knowing that we knew each other. But that got me on the mailing list\nfor every Jewish organization locally, of course mostly asking for money.",
        "A: Not on that basis. I mean, I\u2019m not saying that I say, \u201cYou\u2019re a Holocaust survivor, move aside, I\ndon\u2019t want a part of it.\u201d What I\u2019m saying is, if I happen to meet somebody who also is, I have no\nproblem with that. That\u2019s just...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side B\n30\nTape 3, Side A",
        "A: No not really, as I say, \u2019'm debating on whether to go to this meeting just out of curiosity. See, I\ndon\u2019t think I know anybody... well, I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t. I\u2019m sure they have to be all older\nfolks. (Laughing.) SoI may. I haven\u2019t decided yet. But no, no special interest as a criterion.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I have a number of hobbies. For one thing, I like to cook and obviously like to eat.\n(Laughing.) And gardening, although my garden right now doesn\u2019t show that. And I always like\nto travel, but of course, with a family and work that isn\u2019t always possible. So we made up for it\nsince I retired. And I enjoy history, learning about it, learned more about it since I retired, I\nguess. Now I have time to watch television and the History channel and A&E and of course,\nKET to some extent. So that... a lot more exposure and therefore an ability to learn a lot more.\nAnd then too, when we travel, we do it with the intent, not always the same. I don\u2019t go for these\nCaribbean cruises, you know, \u201cShow me, feed me, entertain me.\u201d I like cruises because they are\na lazy man\u2019s way of traveling\u2014you only pack and unpack once\u2014but there has to be a reason for\nit. And sometimes they are real eye-openers. A couple of years we went on an Eastern\nMediterranean and Black Sea cruise and we were in Constanta, Romania, which is the major port\nof Romania on the Black Sea. Ovid was exiled there for seven years or whatever. Well, never\neven thought that the Romans as well as the Greeks, both came up the west coast of the Black\nSea, east coast of the Balkan Peninsula. And that they had gone that far North into what is now\nOdessa and to the Crimea. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s of no importance right now, but in terms of historical\nevent, just didn\u2019t think about that or heard about it. A lot of things like that. But as we talked\nearlier about the famine, and what complicity the British had. The other day there was a\nfascinating program on the Vikings. They were the kings of Kiev in Russia. They went east.\nNobody... I never heard that before.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, definitely. As you know there are a lot of programs, bits and pieces. There is a\nlot... new things, but also things that are being, I think, being hidden from view that never show\nagain. The... well of course, in addition to Spielberg\u2019s movie, I\u2019m not sure what the show was\nthe other day, but there are a number of programs that deal with the Holocaust or deal with\ncertain aspects of the Holocaust. Or for that matter, not necessarily in that context, but primarily\nin the context of Nazis or Hitlerism and their henchmen and how they got involved and what\nthey did. And the Holocaust in the broadest sense, in terms of the enslaving of particularly the\nSlavs, the eastern Europeans and the murder, genocide of them, not necessarily just the Jews.\nBut then one thing, and I have a video of it, it was on PBS maybe twenty-five years ago, about\n31\nFort Ticonderoga, and I have never seen it again. I mentioned to you earlier the anti-Semitism of\nthe State Department. In 1943, when the Holocaust became pretty well-known in government\ncircles, but was being hidden from the American population, a number of Henry Morgenthau\u2019s\nemployees went to him and said, \u201cYou go to FDR and tell him he does something or else we\u2019re\ngoing to go public that the U.S. government knows about this and isn\u2019t doing anything.\u201d And as\na consequence of that, they brought some six, 800, what was then called DPs, displaced persons,\nto this country. They had to sign a statement, which of course anybody in his right mind would\nhave, that after the war they would go back to their country of origin. And they put them into\nFort Ticonderoga. And after the war was over with, they tried to ship them back. Well, you\nknow, you signed this thing. But a number of couples had had children here. They were born at\nFort Ticonderoga and therefore they were native-born citizens, and therefore their parents were\nentitled to stay here as the parents of minor American citizens. The State Department declared\nFort Ticonderoga was not American soil and therefore they were not American citizens. Can\nyou imagine a place that is so historically important in the American Revolution being declared\nnot being a part of America? I mean that\u2019s the kind of convoluting, convolutions, unfortunately,\nour government went through. As I said, that was a PBS show, 25 years ago, I have never seen it\nagain. I guess too many toes were being stepped on. But... and of course, I went to the\nHolocaust museum, but I couldn\u2019t take it, make it past the Saint Louis, because I remember that\none vividly. Another black mark in our history.",
        "A: Yeah, I mean the thing is, painful and the thing is that the Saint Louis had roughly nine hundred\npassengers and I don\u2019t think two dozen survived. It\u2019s incredible that the things that the U.S.\ngovernment could have done, should have done and never did do. It\u2019s that kind of malfeasance\nthat really upset me, particularly in that context.",
        "A: Well, those are, in my opinion, two totally separate issues. Maybe they are related, and that is by\ngiving back to the community, by helping people that are in need of help. Maybe because the\ngovernment should and isn\u2019t, that you\u2019re overcoming the shortcomings of our government. Even\nthough I don\u2019t take that into consideration. There are two ways that one can give back, one is\nfinancially and that\u2019s the easy way out that most of us take, is to make contributions to a variety\nof charitable organizations, or non-profit organizations. But then the more important one is to\ngive of your time and help people. I\u2019m sure the same thing holds true for Lexington, in\nLouisville there is a shortage, an incredible shortage of volunteers. And all of us retirees who\nhave spare time, and we should have spare time, should donate some of that time to some of\nthese organizations. Whether it\u2019s Dare to Care to sort out cans of food, or work at the Wayside\nChristian Mission as an example, any of these shelters, and dish out food for people in need. Or\n32\nI work in the tax program, in fact I have somebody come in who needs help with their taxes.\nOne of the great organizations in general of a variety of needs is Catholic Charities. And they\u2019re\ndesperate for volunteers. Obviously: they asked me to help. (Laughing.) And I have. But the\nthing 1s, that is one way that you can give back. And whether it\u2019s in your own expertise or if it\u2019s\njust plain labor. Some people are unwilling to become raw labor, drive for Meals on Wheels or\ndrive for Dare to Care and pick up bread at Kroger or whatever. But that\u2019s the kind of jobs that\nneed to be done. And that\u2019s the kind of things that makes many of these non-profit organizations\nclick. Newt Gingrich, who is so maligned, some four or five years ago, for his reasons felt that\nthe public radio should no longer be funded by the U.S. government. And I completely agree\nwith him. But that doesn\u2019t mean that today they give them big hunk of money and tomorrow it\u2019s\nzilch. Cut it back. I work for the public radio stations here as a volunteer. And they used that\nwithdrawal of government funds to encourage the public to contribute and they did tremendous,\nthe biggest drive they ever had. And rightly so. I\u2019m a firm believer in putting the public back\ninto public radio and public television, but it requires a commitment on the part of the people to\nmake financial donations. And that\u2019s just one, that\u2019s not nearly as, I suppose, important as\nhelping somebody who\u2019s hungry or reading for the blind, but it\u2019s one of the large variety of\nvolunteer jobs that needs to be done. It\u2019s amazing, I don\u2019t do that much. I\u2019m not trying to pat\nmyself on the back. But one of the people that used to work for me professionally now actually\nworks for me in a volunteer, one of his volunteer activities, got the GE volunteer award of the\nyear, he and his wife, jointly, this past year. Between the two of them they put in three thousand\nhours a year, that\u2019s a hell of a lot of hours. That\u2019s almost a fulltime job. If we could get half the\npeople to do half that or for that matter, ten percent of the people to do ten percent of that, it\nwould be a lot of help. And that\u2019s what I mean by that.",
        "A: Not that much. I mean we\u2019ve been all over. Been both west and east, and south. Essentially\ncovered the whole state more or less, but not extensively.",
        "A: Oh yes, well, no I think or it appears at least that more recently that the antagonism toward\nLouisville, Louisville versus the rest of Kentucky, seems to be diminishing. But that is, you\nknow the large city versus the rest of the state. Look at New York and New York City, Georgia\nand Atlanta and you know, you can go on. I think it\u2019s probably true of most states that the large\ncities are thought to be representative and they\u2019re not. Even though they contain most of the\npopulation. And I can understand that. And the interests of Kentucky in particularly are so\ndiverse, from Appalachia with its problems, and Western Kentucky with some of the same\nproblems and some totally different problems. And Louisville, of course, for painfully obvious\nreasons having totally different problems that people in Appalachia couldn\u2019t care less about. But\nthat\u2019s true everywhere. And it\u2019s amazing, the thing that I thought that the United States was\nunique, unfortunately, in its race relations problems. They\u2019re not. It\u2019s the same everywhere. It\ndoesn\u2019t matter what country you go to, it may not be like we have, black and white. But we were\nin New Zealand and there was a big ruckus and the Royal Commission on Race Relations or\nwhatever it was, got involved, refused to get involved in it. Well, the mere fact that they have a\n33\nRoyal Commission on Race Relations says there\u2019s a problem there. And it\u2019s the Maoris, which\nare no longer in existence. The purest Maori is one-eighth Maori and seven-eighths white. And\nin Australia it\u2019s the indigenous people versus the settlers. And then of course among the settlers\nyou get the same ethnic divisions that you get everywhere else. Look right now, Fiji, the\nSolomon Islands, the whole world is erupting in ethnic and race problems. Africa is just a\nterrible situation.",
        "A: No, not really. I read about it and I heard about it and was only peripherally affected by it. But\nin the early fifties, while I was in Durham, the mayor of Durham was Jewish. Why I don\u2019t\nknow. There\u2019s a fairly good sized, there was a\u2014there may still be\u2014a good-sized Jewish\ncommunity in Durham because of the tobacco industry. Apparently they brought the Jews down\nin order to make cigars, like they did in Tampa with the Cubans. And then, I still remember the\nman\u2019s name, Bishop Waters was the Catholic Bishop for North Carolina. The little town of\nWashington, North Carolina was two parishes, a black and a white. Neither one of them could\nsupport a priest, and he ordered them integrated. Boy was there ever a stink, but it worked.\nWasn\u2019t... no more than two months and they essentially had ninety percent attendance of the two\nparishes in one church building. It was unheard of. Of course the press would claim race\nrelations are only bad in the South. Well, they\u2019re probably a lot better in the South than they\nwere elsewhere. But yeah, I certainly was keenly aware of it, and cautious. Before I bought a\nhouse in Houston, this was in the late fifties, I consulted with a local friend to say \u201cHey, so that I\ndon\u2019t stub my toe, 1s there anyplace that I cannot go? Where I would be refused because I am\nJewish?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes. Don\u2019t go to Oak Forest,\u201d or Forest Oaks, whatever it was called,\nwhich I couldn\u2019t anyway, that was the rich neighborhood. But you learned to do those things.",
        "A: No, I can\u2019t really think of much. I don\u2019t know whether this gets perpetuated or not, but I\ncertainly would urge, not just Holocaust survivors, but all retirees to think about give something\nback to the community.",
        "A: Yeah, I think so. There\u2019s such a terrible need. And what makes me particularly, actually\nangry... I have two or three acquaintances who are retired, who went back to work on a part-time\nbasis, because they don\u2019t know what to do with themselves. They\u2019re bored. This is utterly\nridiculous. And I keep trying to get them enrolled in some activity and they just won\u2019t do it. But\nthere\u2019s just too many people that need help, who cannot help themselves. And throwing money\nat the problem is not necessarily the solution. It isn\u2019t that it can\u2019t be done without money, but\nit\u2019s the personal help that\u2019s required. And here in Louisville, we are blessed with a number of\nthings. We have here three groups that make recordings for the blind. The Recordings for the\nBlind, the Audio Studio, and there\u2019s a third one. There isn\u2019t another city in this country that does\nthat. We have three public radio stations. There is not, even New York only has one. There are\n34\na lot of things that are good things, matter of fact I don\u2019t brag about Louisville, keep down the\npopulation influx. (Laughing.) Selfish.",
        "A: We have it very good here in Kentucky, and particularly in Louisville, and of course, Lexington\nin many ways, much more dynamic than Louisville is, for one thing they\u2019ve got the city-county\ngovernment, which we won\u2019t get. It\u2019s up for voting on election day, you can bet money on it, it\nwon\u2019t happen. The race relations right now are just so terrible. All you have to do is look at\nother communities and other cities and that\u2019s not just... take this house here as an example,\nwhich you can buy similar house here for depending on the condition and age, but let\u2019s say 150\nto 250. Go to Silicon Valley you couldn\u2019t touch it for two and a half million dollars. In other\nareas, yeah you may be able to get for less, but most areas you can\u2019t touch it for twice the\namount of money. Matter of fact, most retirees moving out of California, sell their houses and\nlive happily ever after, because they can buy another house somewhere else in Arizona or in\nFlorida for a fraction of what it\u2019s worth in California. Our food prices are reasonable, with the\nexception of gasoline in Jefferson County. I went to Shelbyville last night and paid 40 cents a\ngallon less than what it is in Louisville. I mean that\u2019s ridiculous. Could have gone as far as\nSimpsonville, that\u2019s only ten miles, 25 cents a gallon. But outside of these temporary distortions,\nLouisville has grown up a lot in the last 15, 20 years. I used to get all my bread from Chicago,\nnow there\u2019s a grocery store over on Taylorsville Road that carries it and I can go get it there. We\nused to go to Cincinnati to get a three month supply of cold cuts, now I can buy almost all of it\nhere. And so on and so forth. We\u2019re blessed here with, within two miles or three, excellent\nbakeries and different bakeries. If you want a certain thing you get it here. How many\ncommunities can you say that? In 20 minutes I\u2019m at the airport.",
        "A: Oh yes, absolutely. That is not an issue at all in this community. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s always, well\nlike the Ku Klux Klan exists here, but you can ignore that. No, I have never had anybody make\na disparaging remark to me or denied me something because I\u2019m Jewish. Absolutely. Until the\npresent mayor, the Mayor of Louisville was Jewish, Jerry Abramson, one of the most popular\nmayors that the city of Louisville has had. I think he was in there for thirteen years, the longest\nthat anybody ever has. And he was quite, I mean it was not anything that was hidden. He was\nquite open about it. No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem at all here.",
        "A: No, nothing in particular. Keep the good works up.",
        "A: Thank you.\nConclusion of interview\n35\n"
