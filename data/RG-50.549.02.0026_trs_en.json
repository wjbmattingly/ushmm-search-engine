This is a post Holocaust follow-up interview to a videotaped interview, that\nwas conducted by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with Mrs. Slivka on\nJune 15th, 1990. This is tape number one, side A. Okay, even though, in the first\ninterview that the Holocaust Museum did with you, we got a pretty good sense of your\nHolocaust era experiences, let\u2019s go back to before the war and just pick up on some\nthings and clarify some things that -- that -- that we could get some more detail on, before\ngoing on to post-war experiences. And the first thing that I wanted to ask you about is, 1s\na little bit about your family life in Poland --",
        "Answer: Poland.",
        "Q: -- before the war and you did say some things about it in the first interview, but we\ndidn\u2019t get your -- we didn\u2019t get the names of your family, your parents and your sister.\nAnd also, if you could say how old your sister was, relative to you, and something about\nyour relationships within your family.",
        "A: Yeah, we hav -- we were four people. My father, mother, and my sister and myself.\nMy sister -- I was -- when the war -- in -- I was born in 1922, in April and my sister was\nborn in 1925, in September. We had a pretty good life. My father was working as -- in\nthe Jewish kaheela -- that\u2019s like a federation or so -- so-social worker, there. My mother\nwas a housewife and we were normal children and when we started school, we went to --\nto -- we didn\u2019t go to public schools, they didn\u2019t accept -- we went to private elementary\nschool. Th-They didn\u2019t -- elementary was compulsory, but high school wasn\u2019t and they\ndidn\u2019t expect too -- a-accepted too many Jews to the public high schools. And my sister\nand myself went to private, Hebrew speaking schools, because my father was a Zionist.\nAnd, I hear --",
        "Q: What was your -- what was your sister\u2019s name?",
        "A: My sister\u2019s name is Sarah and she lives -- she survived the war with me and she lives\nnow in Israel. She has two daughters, ta -- also. One lives in Israel and one lives in\nCalifornia.",
        "Q: Were you very close with her before the war?",
        "A: Yes, we are. We were very close. We -- especially during the war, we kept very, very\nclose, because that\u2019s all we had. And because, the rest -- we had a lot of relatives, cousins\nand my mother had another brother in Lithuania, but it -- between Poland and Lithuania,\nthere was a conflict and we couldn\u2019t see each other. But, during the war, in -- when they\nopened the borders, we met my uncle and my mother saw hi -- her brother for the first\ntime.",
        "Q: Can you say a little bit more about your relationships in your family, before the war.\nWere -- What -- Did you -- and you -- you had a sister and your mother and your father.\nWere you particularly close with -- with -- I --",
        "A: All [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- your mother or your father, anyone in particular?",
        "A: No, we were c -- a close family, we were close to the mother and father and we had a\nvery -- a very nice fam -- life ma -- life. We -- We never experience any fighting 1n the\nhouse, we never heard about it. And the -- In the summer, we used to -- in the winter, we\nused to go to school, like here, and in the summer we used to go to -- on -- to summer\nhomes. We used to rent an apartment in a sum -- in a -- some village in summer -- 1-1n the\nsummer home. And we in -- we used to enjoy a life, we used to have a lot of company.\nWe had a lot of relatives. My father didn\u2019t have any relatives in -- in Vilno, where I was\nborn, because he was born in Poland and he had a sister in Poland, in Zamusht. And th-\nthe rest of his family were in the Soviet Union, that we never met them, we never saw\nthem and I don\u2019t know them up to -- up to date, even. And -- But we were very close with\nthe other relatives, with the cousins and aunts. Specially cousins, because we didn\u2019t have\nany aunts.",
        "Q: You mentioned in the first interview that some of your family was in the United\nStates.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When di -- When and how did that --",
        "A: Well, I had -- three of my mother\u2019s brothers, they came in early 19 oh si -- between\n1906 and 19 oh -- and 1910 or somewhere around there, they came to the United States,\nthree of her brothers. Then, in 1920, before they closed the borders, the -- the\nimmigration to the United States, he -- they brought over my grandparents, their gran --\nmy grandparents, my grandmother and grandfather, two sister -- two aunts and an uncle.\nAnd this uncle lived for awhile 1-1n Canada and then he moved to Syracuse, he got\nmarried and he lived in Syracuse, New York. And my uncles lived here, in the United\nStates. I never knew them until I came to the United States. When I came here, in 1949,\nmy grandfather wasn\u2019t alive any more, but my grandmother was still alive and my two\naunts and -- and three uncles. One uncle died in 1941 and I never knew him.",
        "Q: Why did your family come to the US? Did they have some understanding of what was\ngoing ha -- going to happen?",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- they -- they were in Lithuania some and the situation was very bad there and\nit was right with the Soviet Union and before the first World War, and life wasn\u2019t good in\nEurope. And they decided, the three brothers -- the three older brothers, decided to come\nto the United States, and the rest stayed. They couldn\u2019t afford at the time to come and\nthey stayed in Europe. And when the other families came -- the rest of the family, my\nmother was pregnant with me, and she go -- just got married and they couldn\u2019t come to\nthe United States. And my uncle from -- from Lithuania, couldn\u2019t make it either. They\ndidn\u2019t get a visa or something. I don\u2019t remember exactly what it was. There was another\nbrother in the Soviet Union, but we don\u2019t know what happened to him.",
        "Q: What were your parents names?",
        "A: My father\u2019s name was Israel and my mother\u2019s name was Chasia, a -- C-h-a-s-i-a.",
        "Q: And her maiden name?",
        "A: Her na -- maiden name was Schusta, but here in the United States, they changed --\nchanged to Schuman.",
        "Q: So, was it co -- I mean your -- your family, it seems that almost your entire family had\nan interest in coming to the United States.",
        "A: They -- My father wasn\u2019t interested. My father was a Zionist, he\u2019s always wanted to\ngo to the Israel. And during the war -- in 1939, when the wor -- war broke out, he got a\ncertificate for three people to go to Israel. But we were four people. Whom do you leave?\nThen he gave up his certificate to somebody else and we stayed home and they were\nperished, my parents, and -- my mother died in the ghetto and my father was burned alive\nin Estonia.",
        "Q: Back in -- Back to the war time. There was just one thing I -- a question I had about\nthe -- after Lithuania was -- after Vilna became part of Lithuania and you described in the\nvideotaped interview how the non-Jewish children who you used to play with, all of a\nsudden were pointing out the Jews -- the Jews and -- and -- and -- and after the German\noccupation, they were pointing out the Jews and that these Jews were then being --",
        "A: Being taken away, yeah.",
        "Q: -- taken away. Was that shocking to you? Did you have close relationships with your\ntowns non-Jewish townspeople before [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, we were very close. We used to play -- we -- we lived together. We -- It -- We\ndid -- there was a Jewish section, too, but the ghetto was later. But we lived in the section\nthat it was mixed, non-Jews and Jews. The majority were non-Jews and we lived very\nquietly with them. We played with them in the yard, and out on the street. You know\nhow kids play after school. And we never talked about it, but when the da -- Germans\ncame, I guess that it was entirely different. They used to sell a Jew for a pound of salt, a\npound of sugar, of -- a pack of cigarettes, they used to point out the Jew. And the\nGermans, with the help of the Ukrainian police, and Lithuanian police, used to come in\nand take them away. It was entirely different. We didn\u2019t -- we\u2019d never expected that, but\nlook, life changes. You can see it now, how countries change. It\u2019s still going on, they --\nthey still didn\u2019t learn from the fir -- the second World War and it\u2019s still going on in\nBosnia and previous Czechoslovakia and in th-the African countries, they kill each other.\nFor what? For a piece of land? Does it pay to kill people? Does it pay to -- to starve little\nkids, what is their fault? It hurts very much when you see those things on television.",
        "Q: Id like to talk more about that later, but just keeping with the pre-war or the war time",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: If -- I'd like to get a sense of your -- you\u2019re a young woman at the ti -- at the time that\nthe war began, what were your dreams and hopes at that time for yourself? What did you\nimagine for your future?",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you, we went -- when the war broke out, I was 17 years old. I didn\u2019t\nfinish high school, I was in the lith -- last year of high school. And then I -- we were\nplanning -- our parents planning to send me to the university, but they didn\u2019t accept Jews\ninto the university in Poland. They accepted a very small amount. Then all the --\npractically the majority of the Jews who went to college, went to other countries. Went to\nEngland, it was -- a lot of went to France, to Italy, to Germans -- to Germany you\ncouldn\u2019t go. But before the war -- bef -- in -- ba -- in the early 30\u2019s, in the 20\u2019s, the -- a\nlot of Jewish people went to -- to Germany to ca -- to the universities. And -- But, didn\u2019t\nturn out this way and we did the best we could and that --",
        "Q: Did you want to go to school -- to university, to study something?",
        "A: I think I did wanted to do something, but I -- I -- I didn\u2019t know myself what I wanted\nto do yet. Because we were in a turmoil, we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s what, what\u2019s going to be,\nbecause in \u201838, a-already, the anti-Semitism was very high in Poland and they were t-\ntalking about the war, what\u2019s going on and Hitler was taking Czechoslovakia at the time.\nAnd we were expected to be taken by the Germans also. And, when the bro -- when\nGermany attacked on September first, th-the Jews -- the -- Poland, it didn\u2019t last long. In\n17 days, Po-Poland was defeated. And that was the end of our lives.",
        "Q: So, really, your -- your own development as a young woman, imagining your future\nwas very much interrupted even before the war started --",
        "A: Before the war, yeah.",
        "Q: -- that you-your -- your mind was --",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know what to expect of our lives. We lived from day to day. Cause we\ndidn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be next. And in Poland, anti-Semitism was very, very high\nat the time. They were killing Jews, used to beat us up for -- without any reason, specially\nbefore Christmas or before Passover.",
        "Q: Were you beat up, personally?",
        "A: No, na -- not me, but especially they used to beat up boys ma --the most. But once in\nawhile, when we used to go to school, they used to call us, \u201cDirty Jew, where are you\ngoing?\u201d Because they knew we are Jews, because we were going to school and they were\ngoing to school, but we had uniform -- we had to wear uniforms to s -- when we were in\nEurope. And we had numbers and they knew that th-this and this is the Jewish -- we were\nJews. Here are some pictures from high school, the uniform.",
        "Q: I also wanted to ask about the Vilna ghetto.",
        "A: Vilna -- Vilna ghetto, yeah.",
        "Q: You mention -- you told in your first interview how you had -- how it happened that\nyou and your other -- other members of your community were gathered together and put\ninto this -- this ghetto, after -- after the pogrom at -- at [indecipherable]",
        "A: The ghet -- Right before the Jewish holidays, about a month before the Jewish\nholidays, e-everything -- it ha -- they used to kill and -- or round up Jews, but they tried\nto do right before the Jewish holidays. And they decided to make a ghetto in the -- in\nVilno. There was a section in the city where a lot of poor Jews lived. The syn -- The\nbiggest synagogue was there. The Jewish home for the aged, the Jewish hospital was\nthere and the orphanage -- Jewish orpha-orphanage was there. And one night they came\nin in -- in this place and they took out all the Jews from this -- this part of the -- of the\ncity and they drove them to a place, Ponari. And we heard some screaming during the\nnight and yelling and -- but we weren\u2019t allowed to look out to the window what was\ngoing on. Those who did, they were shot. And -- But the next day our neighbors told us\nwhat happened, that they took away all the Jews from there and they drove them to\nPonari. And we -- And couple weeks later, they round up all the Jews from the city and\naround the city, suburbs and they put us all in this place and surrounded us with walls and\na gate. And we lived two to three families in a two room apartment. We didn\u2019t have any\nbathrooms, we had to go outhou -- outhouses. One kitchen for two families, three\nfamilies, can you imagine? And -- But we did the best we could. We lived -- my mother,\nwhen we got into the ghetto, she took sick and she was in the hospital. We took her to the\nhospital. She died on October first, in the -- in the hospital. We were right there and my\nfather worked in the Jewish Judenrat, in the ghetto. He was still working from -- from\nbefore and he was still working there.",
        "Q: What was his role with the Judenrat?",
        "A: Whatever they gave him to work, but he -- he -- he used to work in the social\ndepartment -- Social Services department.",
        "Q: Did you know much about what his activities were?",
        "A: No, no. I know that he took care of poor Jews and some Jewish soldiers, from before\nthe war in Poland, they used to help them out. Before the holidays, they used to give\nthem packages, food -- and for Passover, they used to make them the seder, you know,\nthey used to -- the special holiday supper. And the -- they used to help out a lot that -- for\nJewish people.",
        "Q: Did you all live together, you and your father and your sister in the same apartment?",
        "A: Yes, we lived in a four room apartment. It\u2019s a -- a -- the -- a dining room, living room,\none room. Two bedrooms and a kitchen. A kitchen was counted as a room. We ha -- We\na -- We were lucky to have a bathroom and a bathtub in our house. We had to use coal or\nwood to warm our houses [inaudible] oven -- in the ovens, but we were lucky we had\nthis.",
        "Q: What did you do on a day to day basis? What was your day like in the ghetto?",
        "A: Well, I was already 17 - 18 years old, something. And I didn\u2019t go to school. Of course,\nthere -- th-there were -- had schools for younger children. I was working in a store and\nselling some hot water or selling some other things in the store I worked for awhile. And\n-- And that\u2019s all. My father had a suppl -- helped us out. My sister didn\u2019t do anything.",
        "Q: She wasn\u2019t in school?",
        "A: No, this -- the younger kids were in school. And one day when the ger -- the\nLithuanian and Ukrainian police came and took away all the kids from school. Those\nkids never said -- had a chance to say goodbye to the parents. We were -- never saw them\nagain. We used to have a theater once in awhile and they had our own police, our own\nfire department in the ghetto. We had concerts. Some people had good voices, they used\nto put up a concert to entertain, not to make life miserable, a little bit cheerful. We were\nhoping that someday maybe, maybe we will survive that. Cause we couldn\u2019t believe that\nGermany, the most so-sophisticated, the most wonderful c-country before the war, before\nHitler came, was Germany. And this should -- could happen, they could do those things.",
        "Q: Did you have any knowledge of the resistance movement in the Vilna ghetto --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- or contacts with?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have any contact, but I -- I heard about them. There were a lot of -- a lot of\nyoung people. During the night they used to sneak out and they used to go. I didn\u2019t,\nbecause I didn\u2019t want to leave my father and my sister. And there were a lot of young\npeople. The head of the -- this was Aba Kovner, maybe you heard about him. He was the\nhead. He died a couple years ago, in Israel. He went to the same school that I went, a few\nyears -- he was a few years older than I was. And there were quite a few young people\nwho went out of the -- of the ghetto and went to the woods. They resist -- and they\nresisted. They were fighting. But it wasn\u2019t easy for them either, because the Poles were\nfighting Germans and they fight -- wer f -- and -- and they were fighting the Jews, too.\nThey were killing Jews also. The Poles, the Ukrainians, the Lithuanians. Wherever they\ncould find a Jew, they used to kill a Jew.",
        "Q: Was there a discussion in your house, in your family about that -- the contradiction,\nthe difficulty in -- the difficult decision of resistance versus trying to get -- do the best\nthat you could under the circumstances?",
        "A: No-Not that I can remember. I can\u2019t remember, to tell you -- tell you the truth. Maybe\nmy father was talking to some other friends between them, you know, but I can\u2019t remem -",
        "Q: And -- we\u2019re jumping around a li -- a little here, but still, just thinking of -- of filling\nin some of the gaps from the first interview, since you do talk about your -- how the --\nwell, I wanted you to -- to talk about the day that you -- that -- or the time that the ghetto\nwas liquidated, that that order came in and that you were separated from your father and\nyou and your sister went --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- towards Kaiserwald. Do you remember the moment of separating from your father?",
        "A: A day before, it was right before the high holidays, a day before, they o -- they\nannounced over the loudspeakers that we sh -- that all the Jews from the ghetto should be\nconcentrated in front of the gates and will be resettled. We can take only what we can\ncarry with us. We all segregated, 1t was the -- it wasn\u2019t a nice day, it was a rainy day,\ncold, Septe -- in the September. It was a rainy day. And the next day, we\u2019re all segrega --\nwe're all -- we\u2019re there at the gates, all went together. We were holding hands together.\nAnd we were driven to a field. They took away the men -- sa -- when we came, the first\nthing we saw, three people hanging in front of us. Two young men and a young woman, I\ncan s-s-still see them in front of me. And they told us, in case somebody has in mind to\nrun away, will be caught and killed in front of us, or hanged in front of us. They took\naway the men separately, a different part of the field and women and children somewhere\nelse. It was a miserable, cold night. We said goodbye to our father and he said to -- kissed\nus both, wished us good luck. And that\u2019s -- and we went to the field and he went to his\nside. He was taken to Estonia and there they burned them alive. Put logs -- people and\nlogs and burned them alive. Quite a few years ago, we were in Israel and in a kibbutz,\nLachaima agetta ot, there is a s-survivor\u2019s kibbutz. All this -- a lot of the s-survivors live\nthere. And there is a museum about the Holocaust. And we were walking around. Our\ndaughter and her husband and two children were with us. And we were walking around\nthere, we were looking and I saw pictures from this concentration camp. And we saw\nhow the men were lying on the logs. And at this -- on this side were handwritten,\nbeautifully, beautifully handwritten, their names and their number, and I found my\nfather\u2019s name there. My t -- My daughter had a camera, she took a picture of that. And --",
        "Q: What was the name of the camp where your father was killed?",
        "A: Klooga, I think. In Estonia. And we were sitting the whole night in this field. It was a\nmiserable, miserable cold night, rainy night. Whenever a child cried, they -- one of the\nsoldiers used to take away the child from the mother and take it for their feet and tear\nthem in half like this and throw them back to the mother. And some mother, from fright,\nused to kill their own children. Didn\u2019t know what to do. They\u2019d kill -- some mother killed\ntheir own children, in fright. This was going on like that, the whole night. And the next\nmorning, we had to stay in line and be sorted. I was lucky enough, with my sister, we\nwent to the right. And some other of my cousins went to the left. We never saw them\nagain. I don\u2019t know where they went, to Majdan --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number one, side B, of an interview with Rochelle Slivka.",
        "A: And then we were sorted and we were put on -- on the cattle cars, 100 women to a car,\nwithout food, without bathrooms, without water. And taken to the -- and driven to the\nconcentration camp in Latvia, Kaiserwald. Some women tried to escape, they tried to\nsneak out through the windows -- th-the small windows. Whoever -- some got killed,\nsome got shot. Nobody survived, whoever tried to run away.",
        "Q: When you said a little earlier -- you were talking about your father and -- and how h --\nhow he had been burned alive at this camp, did you -- when did you learn about this?",
        "A: I learned in the -- before they liquidated -- 1-1n -- I think in Stutthof, I learned. I met a\nwomen there who was in this camp, but she survived somehow. Or sh -- I don\u2019t know\nhow she did and she -- she told me. She knew my father and she told me about it. That\u2019s\nhow I knew. In Stutthof.",
        "Q: Had you -- Did that -- I -- You described how much your -- your outlook was\ndisrupted from very early o-on, before the war even started, but after you heard about the\ndeath of your father, did that change your -- your outlook? Had you -- Had you been\nhopeful, or were you still hopeful at all? Did you think there were --",
        "A: I -- We lived from day to day. We didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be tomorrow. We\nstuck together. This -- My sister and myself. We met a girlfriend of ours, she used to be\nour neighbor, years, years ago. And she didn\u2019t have anybody. She came over to us and\nshe says, \u201cI am alone. I would like you -- to be a third sister to you. You -- Maybe it will\nhelp me to -- to overcome some things.\u201d I says, \u201cSure.\u201d We said, \u201cSure.\u201d And we all\nstuck together. And we all liberated together. And -- And we lived from life to li -- from\nday to day and we were ho -- I -- I was still hoping that maybe someday III survive and\nI'll be able to tell the world what was happening. And not to let that happen again to\nanybody. Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a Jew or a -- a Pole or a Gypsy or a f -- whoever you\nare, we are all human being. Doesn\u2019t matter the color, you are green or blue or white or\ner -- or black. We are human beings. And treat everybody like a human being. At the\ntime we didn\u2019t know about the gay people, you know, we were -- 1t wasn\u2019t so popular at\nthe time and we didn\u2019t -- we were young enough not to know about those things. But, we\nare all people. It\u2019s their lives, it\u2019s up to them how they live. And it wasn\u2019t easy. Some\nwomen couldn\u2019t take it. They used to sneak out during the night to the barb -- electrified\nwires and touch the wires and kill themself. And some -- We were like animals. We were\nhappy that somebody died in front -- near us. We could have their clothes, their rags to\ncover out feet, not to be -- we didn\u2019t have any shoes, to keep warm. We were like\nanimals. The Germans treated us like animals. They treated their dogs better than us. It\nwasn\u2019t easy.",
        "Q: And then -- You describe in your other -- in your first interview of course, how you\nwent from Kaiserwald to Stutthof and then there was a -- a forced march.",
        "A: [indecipherable] long march, yes.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go ahead to -- to the time that you were liberated and you described seeing a\ntruck full of Russian --",
        "A: Russian soldiers.",
        "Q: -- soldiers coming along. C-Can -- Can you go into that moment and recall what you\nwere feeling then or what the atmosphere was on that day?",
        "A: Pll tell you, as far as I can remember, we were so numb, that when they told us the\nwar is over in this part of Germany and we can go wherever we want -- we want to go,\nwe couldn\u2019t go anywhere. We were skeletons. We had the fr-frostbitten feet, frostbitten\nhands. We couldn\u2019t do anything. And they saw that we can\u2019t do anything and they send\nin a truck and they took us into a village and where we came into the village, they let us\nloose. Nobody was in the village, because it -- the Germans went back -- th -- retreated\nwith the other ger -- with the German army, they didn\u2019t want to fall into the Russians.\nAnd we were like animals. We grabbed anything, whatever we could find to eat. We\ngrabbed any -- any clothes, whatever we could find and some women overate and some\ndied from overeating, because they couldn\u2019t take it any more. Our stomachs couldn\u2019t\ntake. We were sick there for awhile, but after awhile we got better. We had to wash\nourselves in kerosene every day, to get rid of the lice and change our -- burn our clothes.\nAnd after a couple of months later, my sister, myself, decided to go back to the city of\nVilno. I didn\u2019t want to go back to Vilno, because I didn\u2019t know -- I knew that nobody\u2019s\nalive, but my sister insisted to go back.

I decided I wouldn\u2019t go, but my sister insisted she wants to go and she wants\n-- maybe she can get from our Polish neighbors, some clothes, or furniture, whatever we\nleft with them. We left a lot of things wi -- you know, a household, you had a lot of\nthings in the house. And when she came to their houses, they didn\u2019t give her back\nanything, they threw her out.

Anyway, it was a cold, it -- it\u2019s -- I -- I felt very uncomfortable there. I\n-- | -- | was amazed how it looked. It was such a beautiful city. It was a cultural city. It\nhad a university.

I-It was a very cultural city. It has a seminar for teachers. A-\nA-And now it was nothing. It was hurting very much. It was -- this -- the main street, it\nwas such a beautiful street, called Mitskaveetcha at the time. I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t\nremember how it\u2019s called now. And when we were in the hotel -- I knew there was a\nhotel, but this wasn\u2019t the hotel I -- and I asked her, I said, \u201c\u201cTher-There was a hotel in\nhere, but I don\u2019t think this is the hotel, sh -- a-and -- there was,\u201d -- she says, \u201cNo, this was\na high school.

        "Q: Did -- How long did it take you to feel that this was your home?",
        "A: After I came, I started -- I did my best to make up my mind this is my home. It is my\nhome, because I lived in Poland only for se -- for 17 years. I was born, then I was in the\nconcentration camp. And since 1949, I am here. This is my home. It\u2019s the longest time\nthere ever I -- I lived, that the United State, that\u2019s my home, my country.",
        "Q: But you made up your mind even soon after you arrived here that that\u2019s -- that this\nwas where your home was going to be?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. I didn\u2019t think about anywhere else.",
        "Q: How -- So your fa -- you lived in -- in Massachusetts then, for --",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you know that about each other?",
        "A: No. I started to talk about the Holocaust, in -- when they showed the first time, the\nmovie \u201cHolocaust\u201d. After that, they called me -- a girl -- a -- a friend of ours, ca -- they\ncalled her, she should speak about the Holocaust. She says she never was in the\nHolocaust, but she knows somebody who speaks ab -- who was in the Holocaust, I never\nspoke at the time. And she says, \u201cIll call her and Pll ask her if she could talk to you.\u201d\nShe called me, I said, \u201cFine.\u201d It was, I think, in 1978, or something like that. And when I\ncame to the school, the principal says to me, \u201cYou talk as long as you can, because there\nwon\u2019t be any questions.\u201d I says, \u201cI'll talk as much as I can.\u201d And that -- When I fin --\nFirst of all, when I was talking, it was so quiet, you could hear a fly go by. Th-The girl --\nThe kids were sitting like this. And then I says, \u201cIll take some questions,\u201d and I'll -- I\nanswered as m-many as I could questions. If I had more time -- I had 250 kids at the time.\nIf I had more time, they would ask me more questions, because I had to wait another half\nan hour or so -- another session, 250 kids to talk about -- to talk about the Holocaust.\nKids came over to touch me, if I am real. And since then, I\u2019m talking -- didn\u2019t stop\ntalking yet.",
        "Q: I -- I imagine it would have been very difficult to talk that first time.",
        "A: It is -- It was. I was shaking like this. But, I got used to it. I talk -- It hurts, it --\neverything comes in front of me, but I told you, I used to get a cigarette. Now, I don\u2019t\nsmoke. But still, I do my best. I talk to schools, I talk to teachers. In Bates College, they\nhave every year some teacher\u2019s conventions. I talk to them -- I talk to -- teach them about\nthe Holocaust. And I spoke a few years ago, in Caribou, for 900 students. High school\nand university and wherever they ask me, I go.",
        "Q: Why did it happen that you didn\u2019t talk until the late 1970\u2019s? Were you not ready, or\nwere people not interested?",
        "A: They never asked me. I don\u2019t think they -- they -- they kn-knew about. They knew\nabout the Holocaust, but they never were interested, I guess, until they saw on television\nand they st -- de-decided to teach the kids, to let them know what was going on. Not to\nhappen -- what the hatred means.",
        "Q: Was it difficult for you, those years of not talking about it?",

        "Q: So, your family didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t ask you about it, either?",
        "A: They u-used to ask me a question here, a question there, but they weren\u2019t interested so\nmuch. The people weren\u2019t interested in the beginning. Now, they are more interested than\nit used to be. Especially -- you know who are interested? Junior high school kids. They\nare more interested than the high school kids. They ask a lot of questions. High school\nkids are afraid to ask 1n case it\u2019s the wrong question, the other kids will laugh at him.\nThey will make fun of him -- of them. But the junior high, they don\u2019t give a damn. They\nask -- whatever it comes in -- in their mind, they ask. I do my best I can and I try. Spoke\nto churches, spoke to university.",
        "Q: So you said that during those years before you started speaking, that your experiences\nweren\u2019t so much on your mind. What was on your mind? What was important to you\nthen?",
        "A: Life, from day to day, to bring up the kids. I was busy with the children. They were\nsmall. And I\u2019m a -- I was a housewife. And that\u2019s all. And then, after they went into\nschool, last year I spoke to -- in -- in the -- in a high school where my kids went and the\nteachers kno -- knew my kids.",
        "Q: What -- What did you want your children to learn? Did you have ideas about them --\nsomething that was -- you really wanted to pass on to them?",
        "A: To be human beings, not to hate anybody. We are all the same. And be kind to people.\nThe same thing I say to the grandchildren, too. Don\u2019t hate anybody. You don\u2019t like him,\nyou don\u2019t agree with him, don\u2019t have anything to do with them. You don\u2019t know them\nand that\u2019s that. But don\u2019t take advantage and don\u2019t hate.

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and what did you -- what did you witness about that?",
        "A: Yes, it made me very, very much -- it hurts me very much when y -- when I see on\ntelevision the discrimination of people. And the -- the hate [indecipherable] to other\npeople, especially with the lesbians and with the gay people, how they discriminate them.\nYou saw what happened in Wisconsin, that boy. Why? Why did they do that to him? He\nwas a -- anice boy. What did the -- We have here, a Black neighbor, very nice. There\nwas another neighbor here, he says, \u201cA Black neighbor is moving here? I\u2019m going to\nmove out.\u201d Move out. Go ahead. He is very nice, I wouldn\u2019t change him for him anyway.\nKeep quiet, nice, very educated, keep ki -- children. Why? Why discriminate? We are all\nhuman beings. There are poor people and there -- there are rich people. But give them a\nchance.",
        "Q: Did you experience any discrimination in this country?",
        "A: No. There was, couple weeks ago, in another part, in upstate, they desegregated a\nsynagogue before the holidays. They marked down swastikas on the road down. Burn all\nthe Jews and did a lot of damage. Couple days later, they did it near -- somewhere in\nupstate, too, in a church, in a Baptist church. Why?

Those\nkids never said -- had a chance to say goodbye to the parents. We were -- never saw them\nagain. We used to have a theater once in awhile and they had our own police, our own\nfire department in the ghetto. We had concerts. Some people had good voices, they used\nto put up a concert to entertain, not to make life miserable, a little bit cheerful. We were\nhoping that someday maybe, maybe we will survive that. Cause we couldn\u2019t believe that\nGermany, the most so-sophisticated, the most wonderful c-country before the war, before\nHitler came, was Germany. And this should -- could happen, they could do those things.",

I didn\u2019t,\nbecause I didn\u2019t want to leave my father and my sister. And there were a lot of young\npeople. The head of the -- this was Aba Kovner, maybe you heard about him. He was the\nhead. He died a couple years ago, in Israel. He went to the same school that I went, a few\nyears -- he was a few years older than I was. And there were quite a few young people\nwho went out of the -- of the ghetto and went to the woods. They resist -- and they\nresisted. They were fighting. But it wasn\u2019t easy for them either, because the Poles were\nfighting Germans and they fight -- wer f -- and -- and they were fighting the Jews, too.\nThey were killing Jews also.

We can take only what we can\ncarry with us. We all segregated, 1t was the -- it wasn\u2019t a nice day, it was a rainy day,\ncold, Septe -- in the September. It was a rainy day. And the next day, we\u2019re all segrega --\nwe're all -- we\u2019re there at the gates, all went together. We were holding hands together.\nAnd we were driven to a field. They took away the men -- sa -- when we came, the first\nthing we saw, three people hanging in front of us. Two young men and a young woman, I\ncan s-s-still see them in front of me. And they told us, in case somebody has in mind to\nrun away, will be caught and killed in front of us, or hanged in front of us. They took\naway the men separately, a different part of the field and women and children somewhere\nelse. It was a miserable, cold night. We said goodbye to our father and he said to -- kissed\nus both, wished us good luck. And that\u2019s -- and we went to the field and he went to his\nside. He was taken to Estonia and there they burned them alive. Put logs -- people and\nlogs and burned them alive. Quite a few years ago, we were in Israel and in a kibbutz,\nLachaima agetta ot, there is a s-survivor\u2019s kibbutz. All this -- a lot of the s-survivors live\nthere. And there is a museum about the Holocaust. And we were walking around. Our\ndaughter and her husband and two children were with us. And we were walking around\nthere, we were looking and I saw pictures from this concentration camp. And we saw\nhow the men were lying on the logs. And at this -- on this side were handwritten,\nbeautifully, beautifully handwritten, their names and their number, and I found my\nfather\u2019s name there.

Whenever a child cried, they -- one of the\nsoldiers used to take away the child from the mother and take it for their feet and tear\nthem in half like this and throw them back to the mother. And some mother, from fright,\nused to kill their own children. Didn\u2019t know what to do. They\u2019d kill -- some mother killed\ntheir own children, in fright. This was going on like that, the whole night. And the next\nmorning, we had to stay in line and be sorted. I was lucky enough, with my sister, we\nwent to the right. And some other of my cousins went to the left. We never saw them\nagain. I don\u2019t know where they went, to Majdan --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",

But, we\nare all people. It\u2019s their lives, it\u2019s up to them how they live. And it wasn\u2019t easy. Some\nwomen couldn\u2019t take it.

Nobody was in the village, because it -- the Germans went back -- th -- retreated\nwith the other ger -- with the German army, they didn\u2019t want to fall into the Russians.\nAnd we were like animals. We grabbed anything, whatever we could find to eat. We\ngrabbed any -- any clothes, whatever we could find and some women overate and some\ndied from overeating, because they couldn\u2019t take it any more. Our stomachs couldn\u2019t\ntake. We were sick there for awhile, but after awhile we got better. We had to wash\nourselves in kerosene every day, to get rid of the lice and change our -- burn our clothes.\nAnd after a couple of months later, my sister, myself, decided to go back to the city of\nVilno. I didn\u2019t want to go back to Vilno, because I didn\u2019t know -- I knew that nobody\u2019s\nalive, but my sister insisted to go back.
