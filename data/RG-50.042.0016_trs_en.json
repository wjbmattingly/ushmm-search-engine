        "JOHN KOMSKI\nJanuary 30, 1992\nTake one\nBeep\nMr. Komski, can you tell me what happened to everyday life when the Germans occupied Poland.\nWell, I was, uh, first, I was uh, in Krakow after I have come uh,\na few days after the war. Just, uh, very miserable life because eh, there was uh actually no food.\nUh, we had to go, in order to buy a loaf of bread I had to stand up, get up at 4 0 clock in the\nmorning and go to the bakery, and stand in line for several hours before I got a loaf of bread.\nAbsolutely nothing to buy immediately. And, of course, uh, you have to have a spectacle of seeing\nall those uh soldiers running, you know, the streets. Uh, I uh, I faced the first encounter with the\nsoldiers, you know, when uh, I was stop on the street, and eh, I had the impression that he wants to\nask me a question, and instead he kicked me, you know, without reason, you know, and this is\nwhere I realize that the Poland is in war, that we have been occupied, that that things are not\nnormal anymore. You know, something now, it struck me as something so unjust that he struck\nme, you know. I didn't do anything to him, and I, I remember it almost vividly today as it was then.\nSo..\nWhat did you decide to do, and why did you decide to join the resistance?\nWell, it was, 1t was a spontaneous thing, you know, I had uh, several, uh, uh, uh, friends of mine\nwho were in the military, and in the action at that year, 1939, and they all came back home. And,\nfirst of all, it was nothing. It, 1t was, 1t was just a situation where uh, except of uh, uh trying to, to\nstay away from uh, from German view, you know, it was nothing else to do. It was uh, late fall,\nthere was no school. There was absolutely no, no, no activity allowed. There was a police out all\nthe time. So, spontaneous, our spontaneous thing, behavior was, you know, to organize something,\nuh, uh, uh an action against them. And uh, in the beginning it was just a 'we are trying to\nuh.....trying to find a proper people. Uh, and eh, and eh the role that we entered, the action.\nSo, how did you go about doing that?\nTake 2 Beep.",
        "Okay, Mr. Komski, go ahead.\nYeah, and uh, at the beginning, you know, uh, uh, uh affair was a, a just a try, or just, just\nsomething that we are trying to, we, we have not, uh, any, uh, uh, no experience in doing, uh, uh,\nthings like that. So, um, it was eh, eh probably no, from the, for the outside it probably looked\nfunny at the beginning, you know. There was no guidance, no, no uh, there was no higher, uh, uh\nauthority that were established, and uh, there was no connections at the beginning. It was, as I say,\nspontaneous thing. Uh, few months later, the thing grew up into, uh, several eh, several eh\nactivities. First of all, there was one, (clears throat): listen to the underground--to the, to the\nforbidden radios. And then, uh, we tried to print a, a sort of a newsletter, uh, the, this was the\nsecond thing. And, of course, build a membership, and organize into the units, you know. But, I\nwas mainly active in the, in the, this eh, newspa, newsletter business because uh, was always to do,\nsomething to do with it, you know, and also, you know, I was a, I just finished the Academy of\nArts, so I know, uh, uh, I could compose, I could uh, uh do the lettering which was necessary--lot\nof things was done by hand. Uh, um, le, by hand. And this is the thing that I could do. And, of\ncourse, there was another thing that's uh, uh, uh, headline story was always uh, uh, uh, went always\nwith a caricature or cartoon on and, and this is where I became useful, you know, because I could\ndo this. As a matter of fact, later on, uh after war, when uh, when uh, my case was in the Bavarian\ncourt, I won my case because I could uh, could uh testify to the fact that I was doing the caricature\nof Hitler himself. And, and that is why the court, uh, uh, uh, uh developed, why I won my case.\nOtherwise, I uh, uh, for example, cases, uh, uh of uh, uh other than that, you know, just a regular,\nreg, regular activity against the German army, and against Germany was considered a normal thing.\nThe judge would not refuse, uh, refuse to, to, to, to see any offense.\nCan you describe how you hid and crossed borders, and finally ended up getting turned over to the\nGestapo.\nYeah, you know, after a while it became eh very dangerous to stay at home. At that time, I was\nalready in my home town Sojov (ph)--a small town with a German garrison, which was a, a station\nin the, in the eh the high school building. And, of course, uh, uh, uh there was snooping around\nthe soldiers, you know, looking especially for a radio. And, uh, uh, the organization was uh in\ndanger that it might be, you know, it might be uh, uh, uh, uh might uh be uh known to Germany\nafter a while. So, uh I decided to, to leave the that hometown and go to France, you know, and in\nFrance, the army was being uh, uh organized. The government in exile was at that time in frenzy\nsince 1940, beginning of 1940, so with uh two other uh friends of mine, we walked to the railroad\nstation about 15 km. away from my hometown, we boarded a train, and then by train we travelled",
        "to Novitark near Sacopana(ph). We left, we get out of that train at\nthat time, and then we walk toward the Sacopana, Boucovina, it is in a village about uh near\nSacopana, and then we crossed uh, the Datre Mountains. It was in the beginning of uh March. Uh,\nso it took us two or three days, I think it was three days, uh to, around the higher reaches of, of uh\nmountains and of course you know we wa, we had to walk in the deep snow. Uh, this way, we\nentered, we came to a, a, a around the em, Datre Mountains uh to the Slovakian side of it. And\nthen we walked right the Slovakia, and, and almost, almost we reached the Hungarian border. It\nwas necessary to go to Hungary because in Hungary at that time were the, the uh Polish camps uh\nwhere uh we could uh, you know, stay for a while, you know, and uh, and then walk toward the,\nthen find a, a possibilities to go further through other countries, especially through, through\nYugoslavia and Spain and through France. So before we could uh cross that border, we was, we\nwere spotted by a Slovakian man, you know. And I think it was he who was responsible for our\narrest because he uh, uh reported us to the, to the police. And we were stopped...\nWe're going to stop and reload the film.\nRight.\nCR-2\nThis is John Komski's interview, SR-2, CR-2, TAKE 3\nbeep\nMr. Komski, can you describe for me your arrival in Auschwitz?\nIt was uh, uh, I came to Auschwitz from the prison in Tarnow by train. We arrived in Auschwitz\nabout afternoon, about 5 0 clock in the mor, in the in the afternoon, and uh, we really did not know\nwhere we arrived, where we came. When we arrived at the station, Auschwitz, which is in ----------\n----, we saw that huge sign, AUSCHWITZ, written on the second floor of that uh, Auschwitz, or\nthat uh station bldg and we didn't know where we are, where we were, where, we thought we, we\ncame to Germany already. But we uh saw an uh, uh railroad worker, and he uh, uh told us that this\nis really uh ---------, and, of course, em, in uh, were, were, of course, did--did--we didn't not know\nanything uh, uh further wha, wha what's going to happen to us. But the train started rolling to a uh\nside truck, and eventually we came in the front of 3 large buildings. This was tobacco company\nbuildings. The middle bldg was surrounded w/uh towers and uh, uh, uh barbed wire. And there",
        "were, uh, and in the middle on that courtyard of that bldg, we saw about I uh, about uh 20 or 30 of a\nman, men dressed in striped uniforms, which, to me, looked like uh uh oh uh hospital patients. But,\nwhen the train stopped, and I looked around, and I saw everywhere guards lying with the machine\nguns in the bushes...uh, I saw those 30 men rushing towards the, the train, and when the door open\nthey start, you know, hitting us with uh pipes and sticks, and los, los, los, you know like the\nGermans used to do. And, eh, we --------------, and uh, and uh, in eh this fashion, we were brought\nto that courtyard, and immediately we were uh, uh, uh, uh segregated into smaller groups, and each\ngroups went in the front of a uh, uh, uh rider with a tug, a tug machine, who would, you know,\ntake the person--------of ours, and everybody received uh numbers, and that this was the all the,\nbelongings of ours were taken away. We are not dressed in any uh, uh, uh uniform, uni, prisoner's\nuniform at that time because there were none. We are still walking in our civilian clothes. Uh, we\nwent to the, inside that building, and there was a bedroom, there was a place to sleep, you know,\nuh, right on the floor. There was little straw on the cement floor, and, and uh, uh we spent the\nnight, that that first night in this uh, almost in a sitting position because no room to stretch out. The\nnext morning from the very early we woke up before the sunrise, and a...exercise began, and it\nlasted the whole day, that exercise, which consisted of, of, of, of, of jumping, running, uh, uh was\nuh really very exhausting. I remember when we arrived there was a tall grass all around bldg. The\nsame day in the evening there was no blade of grass standing. We were, we destroyed it by our, by\nour bodies, you know, rolling and uh, uh, and uh jumping, and, and, and so. So that was the, the\nbeginning of Auschwitz. We did not go to work. There was no work at that time. There were only\nfive hundred, seven hundred-twenty-seven people in that transport. I arrived on June 14, 1940, uh,\nso our uh activities were daily exercises that lasted about 16 hours, so you can imagine how that\nafter a while, everybody was had to have that. A week later came another transport from Krakow,\nfrom Montelupi (ph), about 300 men strong, and these ones was housed in a original Auschwitz.\nThere were only 2 or 3 blocks uh, uh separated from the rest of the area with uh, uh barbed wire.\nThere were provisor, uh, uh small kitchen added to it, and that is where they started uh, the\nactivities, and you know, they started working on building a fence, on, for, around whole area, and\nalso, the plans were drawn for building a prisoners' kitchen. Until this thing was done, we were uh,\nuh only living in those 3 barracks, and later on the, the uh our uh, uh temporary fence was removed,\nand we became the first inmates of the real camp.",
        "Over the years that you were there, how did things change--in a very general sense.",
        "Well, first of all, the Germans--this used to be--that uh Auschwitz used to be a military uh uh\nbarracks. For design for cavalry. So there was inside a depression, inside the camp, for uh, exer,\nfor a running the horses. So the Ist thing what the German did they uh leveled this depression up,",
        "you know, raised them up, and the first commando that worked on uh mm uh doing the job was\ncomposed of priests???? and Jews, and the commander of this group was a, a German uh, uh\ncriminal called Krankenmann. Uh, he was responsible for killing most of those people. You know,\nwithin a few weeks. Uh, the reason why they have to level up that depression was because they\nwanted to build another blocks, and they built six more buildings resembling the old style\nbuildings. They needed desperately a space. Uh, the population of Auschwitz from uh the\nbeginning several hundred immediately jump up to several thousand when the Ist transports of\nprisoners arrived from Warsaw of about 4 transports within about six weeks. And, still, the same\nyear in 1940, the Germans discovered that they don't have enough room, so they started making\nplans for building another camp between the, uh this camp where uh, and the railroad station, and\nthey called it-------------. Later on, uh, they brought about 15,000 Russian prisoners of war. From\nuh, Germany, there were uh, uh, mmm, forgot the name right now where, where they were\nstationed. Anyway, there was 15,000 men who (clears throat) started to build building a Birkenau.\nBirkenau was, in Polish name was Brezinka, there was a this name village which was level up, and\nall the surrounding villages bet, uh, uh, between the, the uh rivers Vistula and Sowa, from the,\nstarting from the uh, uh mine uh, coal mine, uh bro, ------. So, it was uh 40 square kilometers\nearlier, which became the, the uh the, the terrain, called Interessengebit(ph), means the, the terrain\nof the, of the camp. And with two camps in operation, the old uh, uh Auschwitz, which they\nnamed Auschwitz |, and then Birkenau, which they called Auschwitz 2.\nWe have to reload now.\nBeep\nI want you to explain to me about the different types of people who became inmates at Auschwitz,\nand whether they were treated differently. Were Jews treated differently from other people?\nWell, basically, everybody was treated very bad, and there was no really difference. Regardless of\nwhat type of uh, (clears throat), fir, uh the Germans uh, uh (clears throat) segregated them by\n(clears throat) attaching them a, a crime, uh, which was visible by the triangle that everybody has to\nwear. I wore red triangle, which meant that I am political prisoner. Outside of that were greens,\nwhich was a professional criminal--these are mostly German. There were people wearing black\ntriangles, which was uh, uh, uh people who committed uh, committed uh, uh, uh...were, who didn't\nwant, really did uh refused to work for German um, eh industry, for German war industry. Wore a\nblack triangle. But, if that inmate was a woman, and she wore a black uh triangle, she was a\nprostitute. For example, when a, whe, uh, women's camp open in our camp, they did it by uh,",
        "segregating us from women by a high concrete wall. The first ten one thousand inmates that came\nfrom uh, from uh, Robinsbrik(ph) were the prostitutes. They were all German and prostitutes, and\nthey became the functionaries of the women's camp. The women who came uh from all uh, uh\nother European countries, you know, first women came from Czechoslovakia, uh, were Jewish,\nJewish, uh they were, uh, they received a bla, a red triangle. They were considered uh, uh political\nwith this distinction that they are Jewish, that means that they had, you know opposite triangle, uh,\nyellow, which together formed a David star. So this was a sign for all Jews in Auschwitz, that they\nwore that star. So, it might, there were a few uh, uh Jews that I saw with the black and yellow, or I\neven saw one with the green and yellow, but always had to be that yellow, which altogether looked\nlike a star. So, besides that there were other crimes registered in by the Germans in the books, like\nfor example, homosexuals. The camp in Gross Rosen, for example, where I was later on, had\nmostly homosexual, homosexual prisoners, all German, and they wore pink triangle. Those who\nwere committed to the camp for religious purposes, like, for example, there were Jehovah\nWitnesses--were very -------- that were very spread out in Germany at that time. They wore purple\ntriangle. And, oh, so this way, but as they prisoners, they were all treated equally. You know, that\nmeans, you know, very, very bad (clears throat). We are not, I would describe situation in\nAuschwitz and then in, in, in the other camp, same was, I would compare a prisoner to a soldier,\nwho, uh, fights the enemy in the trenches (clears throat), and we were different from that soldier\nthis, in this respect: a soldier had a gun, he had a rifle, and he could shoot his uh enemy before he\nwas shot. We were like soldiers exposed every minute to a danger of dying, but we couldn't help\nourselves because we have nothing for our defense, except the will to survive, but eh, will, not\nalways eh was enough because very often, in most cases, the prisoner died, they were gassed, they\nwere executed by the order of a Gestapo. And, in this case, nobody could, you know, do anything.\nWe were helpless.",
        "Tell me the story of the Auschwitz Museum and the translation of the bible.",
        "Auschwitz uh, Museum (clears throat), and a symphony orchestra, there was 2 things that were\nestablished in Auschwitz eh, there was idea of a commandant Fritsch. The museum, the eh, the eh\norchestra was supposed to indicate that there are joyful moments in the prison also, you know, in\ncase if a commission, a commission would arrive and, and check on the uh living condition in\nAuschwitz. So was with the museum. The museum was supposed to uh, revealed to a would be\ncommission that uh created like activities of prisoners have a uh, could be, could be uh uh exercise\nright in the museum eh where there was a sort of a like a studio, art studio. Besides that, there were\nall uh exhibits. Exhibits consisted of uh the uh items that were taken away from arrivals like when\nthe Jews came, you know, a lot of devoted Jews came with bibles, especially from the Warsaw",
        "ghettos, so the bibles found its way to the museum. There was military medals. There were maps.\nThere were all kinds of uniforms. Of this kind of nature and all the, the, the artifacts. And uh, the\nAuschwitz museum from the very, very beginning employed two Jews. They were found, they\nwere called by the report fuehrer, uh, uh, on one of the uh, uh rail, uh roll calls in the evening. The\ncommandant wanted somebody who is a writer. So one step out, several step out, he just one.\nAnd, he was a rabbi. So he says, you gonna translate a bible into German. But, he says, \"I don't\nknow German. I know only Polish.\" He was from Warsaw. You know. So they chose another\nfellow who could translate from Polish to German. And, they received the place to work in the\nmuseum. Of course, they did only one page in the whole two years when I was there uh, uh, uh in\nAuschwitz, and uh, and they never uh, in the meantime, the commandant was changed. Came\nanother one who didn't know nothing about this project because this was a personal project\nanyway, so but they survived because of that. Because they had a place to stay, and they were\nforgotten people. You know, other thousands of men were arriving daily to Jejinka (ph) men,\nwomen and children, they were gassed, but those two stayed alive and nobody care about them.\nYou know, that is the ironic situation of the camp. If you found yourself in the situation that you,\nyou became nobody, you could survive.\nWe're going to put another roll of film...\nCR-4, TAKE 5beep\nNow we want to talk about how you came to attempt to escape, and I want to know how it ended\nup that you could drive through the main gates of Auschwitz on your way to freedom.\nWell, it, I have to say at the beginning that it took me one year to plan the escape. And uh, I really\ncame to Auschwitz with the idea of escaping. This is why, therefore, I chose to uh, false name, I\ncame with a false name. And, uh, but, there were no possibility of any kind of escape. The first\npossibility that I came on was when I walk one day with the uh mmm, with a group of surveyors to\nthe city of Auschwitz, and beyond, into the terrain near the town, Auschwitz, and while they were\nsurveying, I was painting a landscape for a commander of that surveying team, who was a German\ncalled Reischwein. And that was the, my first uh, uh, uh...time when I was uh, when I could eh,\nexecute a sort of escape on my own. But, this was a time when there were uh, there were uh\npersecution for, for escapes, you know, they were always taking ten people hostages, and, and , and\nthey finally, and they usually, they were found dead after a while. So I couldn't dare to put into\ndanger the, my friends, in this uh, outfit. The, that next day, I, uh, found another fellow who had\nalso a, uh, a false name, and that time, we were working in Arbegeisetz (ph). Arbegeisetz is a em,",
        "office of uh labor, a labor office. He, uh, at that time, uh, we uh, that fellow who, who I\nmentioning, you know, he was, he was a good organizer. He knew everybody, uh old prisoner, and\nhe knew most of the old-timers who work in various positions around the camp, where they could\nuh, uh come up with uh, with the items that the SS would like. Like money. Like uh, like for\nexample, like the play things from the Canada; Canada was the name which would uh, which\nwould uh, uh, which uh, uh, uh mean anything of value that came from the Jewish transports. At\nthat time the Jewish transports were already arriving to the Brezhinka to the gas chambers. So uh,\nuh she orga---she make a story that uh, she would uh, give him that uh, uh SS man, who was our\nboss in the office of uh, uh, uh of that uh arbegeisetz, uh money. You know, the boss wanted the\nmoney because he wanted to buy bikes for his children. And the SS man did not earn lot of money,\nyou know. So, we came one day to uh, uh, left the camp, went through the Auschwitz, to a place\ncalled Starstave, on the outskirts of the camp, where uh, the underground were uh, prepared for us\na, unifo--the civilian clothes, and weapons even, and also they had a car waiting for us on a road,\nand to take us to the mountains. Of course, how we wanted to get rid of that SS man, who went\nwith us. And, we prepared a whisky with a sleeping pills in it, you know. So, we thought, well, he\nmight, he might drink some of it, the stuff, and then, fall asleep, and make, enable us to go away\nfrom, to run away. Of course, he said, \"No, he, he, he was not liquor, you know, which is\nunbelievable, soldier not drinker. He says \"Maybe beer or two, but not the whiskey.\" You know,\nso we couldn't get rid of him, we had to come back to, to the camp. And then, at that time we\nrealize that we cannot uh, uh, uh wait for a situation where uh, uh a SS would be willing to, to take\nus out or something--we have to escape by our own eh means. So, we started to organize the\nGerman uniform. We decide that one of us will be uh, uh dressed as a SS man, and guard us on our\nescape. (Sigh) By this time, there were four of us already. Two others joined. So, the organizing\nof the items of uh, uh, that would, that would uh eventually became a, a full uniform took lot of\ntime, and we had to hide it, we have to wear it several, all the, the, the pieces under our tunics, you\nknow, going to work, coming back, uh, risking a revision on the, on the, the gate. Of course, we\nalso knew that we have to have something tangible, you know, some money or something. So, one\nof us was a, a dentist. He worked for a while in the dentistry, and he knew everybody in that dept.\nSo, he went to his friends, and he organized some gold. You know, there were Germans uh, were\ncollecting about 2 or 3 Ibs only removing the gold teeth from the dead. Uh......",
        "missing some dialogue",
        "got, and we had, you know, a chunk of, a, a piece of gold that we had to carry in our pockets, oh,\nagain, going back and for the through the gate, you know, risking all of this uh, uh revision. When,\nwhen this, everything, was, you are ready, there was a question of (clears throat) providing a uh, uh",
        "necessary documents for the SS, who is gonna be accompany us on the escape. Now, the one who\nwas supposed to be a SS man, he went to the effectenkamer(ph), which is the storage of the\ncivilian clothing, and he found in his bag, an old photograph that he brought from home. We sent\nthis photograph outside through Auschwitz through the underground. Uh, they made it an\nenlargement necessary for the identification card. It came back, and I painted on that photograph a\nuniform and a hat and everything, all the distinction, and again, it went out, and it came a uh, Mr.\nKujbara, who was the, the friend of mine who was supposed to be the, the SS, and already looking\nlike an SS man. And, in a uh, in the uh, uh, uh printing shop in Auschwitz, uh, in, in, in, in the\ncamp, I had again, a lot of friends, who supplied me with the forms for identification. So, the rest\nwas easy. I had to make the stand, and everything. Everything was uh, uh copied on original, on\noriginal documents. Uh, the SS would have to have with him in case, in ca--, in case if we are\nstopped on the gate and he has to show a document. On the top of that, there was a question of the,\nthe order that uh, he was suppo-that we have to go as a group, as a commando, you know, outside\ndoing something. And, with a SS man. This was always issued by the labors uh, uh officer uh,\nnight before, because we all work in arbeseisetz, which was preparing these documents.\nWe have to reload again.\nRight.\nCR-5, TAKE 6\nbeep\nSo now you have just about everything...\nYeah, I had, you know, this uh, the document was signed by an SS man in charge, and we had it in\nour pocket next morning. Next morning was 29 of eh, Dece-December. On that day, I did not go\nto the office in a normal way, only behind the backs of the SS men. So my number was not\nregistered. I did, I did this in order to create some confusion because at the end of a day, there was\nalways a roll call. On that roll call, everybody, all the number had to fit into an, an, an, if\nsomebody was missing, they would immediately know the number, which was missing. In this\ncase, in my case, they did not know, and it took them several hours before they found out that I was\nmissing, because there was a situation that a prisoner was missing, but there were no number of his.\nUh, and I, we did it in order to confuse them, and delay a eh, eh, rescue operation that was always\nuh immediately follow the escape. Because we wanted to have a time to hide in between. So, on,",
        "on the 29th of eh of Decem-December, we uh, I went to the office by the, on the uh, uh on, on, un\nrecognized, and 2 of ours escapees, they, they went to the uh, to the uh place called uh\nLandviersaw(ph). Landviersaw was a uh, uh, well a office for all the uh activities having to do\nwith the agriculture. And they uh rent a, a pair of horses, and a ------ in exchange for bringing the\ndirector of that office to uh, uh, uh cabins, office cabins. With that empty platform, prisoner by the\nname Otto Kiesen, he was a German, we took a German. He was number 2, he was one of the first\nKapos who arrived from the camp of Zaksenhaus. He had, also had a green triangle--that means he\nwas a professional uh criminal, but he was extremely well uh, uh, uh, extremely nice fellow, and he\nnever hit anybody, and he always liked Poles in the Auschwitz. So, we thought we have a friend in\nhim. We took him because he had this possibility of organizing many things, and we needed to\nmake that escape successful. So, he drove into the camp with that platform and horses, and ordered\npeople who were running around in that area to bring four uh, uh, uh, uh, oh uh, the cabins, you\nknow, the four cabins from the uh lot 24, which is not far from the gate. He loaded on that\nplatform, he drove out of the gate, gate--in Auschwitz, the main gate was not guarded during the\nday because during the day, the guards were stationed around the large area of the camp uh where\nthe pri-prisoners were performing uh doing uh work. So uh, he drove out of that uh gate with the\ninscription Arbeiten-------------. He drove to the Landviersaf, he left over there two cabins, and he\ndrove to the Noybough(ph), to that unfinished camp near the station where uh, one, uh, that\nprisoner who was supposed to be a guard and I, we uh, uh waited for him, he dressed already in the\nprisoners uniform, and when they arrived, two of them, you know, we jump on, and we had a uh,\nuh, uh we had a guard, an SS man, and us 3 prisoners, and we started toward the gate, main gate\nnear the architect office at the point near, at the road, uh, toward Auschwitz, near the Sower River.\nIt did not, it went very well, you know, the, the uh in between something happened because as we\nwere driving, riding toward that uh gate, all of a sudden from nowhere we sighted a commander, uh\nFritsch, and he knew all of us because we work in the same barrack where he had his office. So he\nstopped for a while, and he thought that he will see what we are, what we are up to, and then uh, he\njust made a motion with the hand like\nthat, you know, see, he went away. This was enough. It was a signal for us to hurry up, and we\ndrove by the gate, you know, the SS raised the hand, said Heil Hitler. He had a response Heil\nHitler. The gate was uh, raised up, and we drove on the road. And uh, and that's it. You know,\nthat's was the...\nSo who was in the wagon when you drove through?\nWas 3 prisoners and one guard. There was a driver, and his asst and myself. And a guard in the,\nsitting on the cabins in the back. We also had a, I had a in eh, under my care, the documents that",
        "we have stolen in our office, and in the, the uh hospital area, hospital office, especially those in\nhospital, these were a very uh, uh, very important documents because this was the uh uh list, list of\npeople who were supposed to be all were already executed with original signature of a SS doctor.\nIn our office, I took some 40,000 names of dead in the, from the uh, uh from the files. In, in the, so,\nwhen we arrive in our place of hiding, which was in the Libuge, this uh, uh, uh this documents\nwere taken from us, and, and, and, and travelled to Warsaw, to the main headquarters of the\nunderground organization.\nAnd, were you worried about people being killed after they discovered you escaped?\nNo, not at that time because uh, so many SS were involved in it, to a degree that we knew that they\nwill try to, you know, try to, find excuse for themselves rather than persecute and make that whole\nepisode very famous. So, there was not a lot of fame at that ------- at that time, you know. I\nremember only that only one man went uh, I mean I know that from the report that I heard about\nlater on, it was a German--he was a LagerFeuhrer, he was the oldest in the camp, uh, uh it was a\noffice of the, the eldest of the camp, you know. He, name was uh, his name was Brodnevich,\nPolish name, but he was a German. And uh, he was accused being helpful to that fellow, Otto\nKieser, who was #2 in uh, uh also German. Uh, in that group of that arrived once, you know, from\nthe uh, uh Ranenburg(ph). So, this is the only one who really was demoted, and uh later on and he\nspent uh time in, in bunker, but he was such an ugly uh fellow anyway, you know, he was such a,\nhe, such a killer, that it really work for a good for a lot of prisoners.\nLet's reload.\nBeep\nSR-3, CR-6, TAKE 7\nIn your time in the camps, what different kinds of resistance did you see? Did you see spiritual\nresistance?\nYeah, I did. There were a lot of, a lot of uh, uh priests...at the beginning. Uh, preachers, and there\nwere pre, protestant preachers, and there were Jews who were praying constantly that I know.\nThere was a mass even that uh took place in one of the blocks in my time, which I didn't attend\nbecause, you know, in camp, you didn't believe the people which you, whom you didn't not know,\npersonally. As a matter of fact, even father, if he happened to be together with his son in the camp",
        "would not really trust his son, because, you know, people were uh, uh, uh, uh for, the\ndenouncement, you know, the revealing of uh, this kind of uh personal stories to the to the SS were\nuh very common. So, uh, there were a lot of things happening that uh a common prisoner did not\nknow nothing about it. I would say that uh, most prisoners, they went to Auschwitz, if they don't\ndie, and they really survive, they only knew they own account--what happened to them. Otherwise,\nthey did not know where they were, how the camps is operated, who is responsible, how many\npeople are dying. People generally did not know in Auschwitz that the gas chambers are in\noperation until the time that there was, they have so many bodies, and the stench from these ovens\nindicated that something very fishy is going on in Birkenau. Because the things were, the gas\nchambers were located was camouflage, nobody has any access to it, except those who work there,\nso the average prisoner did not know much. So, it goes for the any eh, uh, uh resistance movement.\nThe first resistance movement was at the very beginning to go out, if it's possible, and uh, carry the\nnames of imprisoned people to the outside world. There were ladies, and there were a voluntary\ngroups of people, young and old, all around Auschwitz, and in -------- who'd volunteer and, and\ntake all those addresses, and then, uh, uh, get in contact with the families, you know, you have to\nremember that the beginning the reading, writing of letter was not allowed for about one year, so\nthe people who once were in the prison, they finally, the even--they disappeared and the families\ndid not know where they were. So, uh, this was a very important function, to, to organize, to make\na contact between the families, and those who were in a, in the camp. Now, through this uh, uh, by\nthe same way, found the way to the camp, the medicine, and an extra food, which, and the group of\nsurveyors, I work with them very often, were very eager to do this. They always bring, brought\nmedicine and food to the camp. In excha--in uh, we, prisoners, we were working on drawing maps\nof the defenses of the Auschwitz, of the position of the uh, uh guards and the machine guns becau--\nwhich the underground wanted from us. They were always uh, uh, uh, uh making us uh believe\nthat one day they will uh, uh come to the camp, and destroy every all the guards, all, all the\ndefenses, and, and free us. Of course, this never happened. Uh, the, the part, it did happen several\ntimes that the uprising was uh, uh taking, uh taking place in Birkenau, in the area of uh, of the gas\nchambers, uh, uh, of course, I know this only from other people telling me that because I at that\ntime, I was already in other camps, but I understand that uh, some 2 or 3 times, the, there was a\nrevolt in the crematorium area with the use of weapons, and some people were killed, some\nbecause of that, some were able to escape. I know of one name, a man who escaped and went\neventually to Czechoslovakia, and, uh, and he wrote a book--I have that book uh right here, and he\nnotified the uh, the Jewish authorities over there what's happening in Auschwitz, but he was not\nbelieved. That's what he reveals in his book. He was not revealed that he's telling the true story.\nNobody could believe from on the outside, in the outside world, you know, that this uh, uh what is\nhappening behind the barbed wire in Au, in Auschwitz. You know, because this was uh, an",
        "inhuman story. That everybody would tell you about. So, besides that, there were attempts to steal\ndocuments, and then send these documents, the originals, out into the uh, uh, uh outside world to\nthe organization, especially to the, to the underground uh, uh resistance movement, and one of the\nsuccessful ones was stealing a book of Bunker. I was in Bunker once, and uh, I got a book, uh,\nwith all, with the list of the uh, of all those imprisoned in the bunker, and my name is over there\ntoo. That book uh, uh, Bunker was, in Auschwitz, was a, an extra prison. In the basement of block\n11, where the people were uh, uh, uh, uh, uh kept in the, in the dark rooms and awaiting execution.\nOr they were brought from a civilian life, as a civilians, and faced a special court that once or\ntwice a week would, would uh function in Block 11, and then they were executed on the courtyard\nof Block 11. So, the stealing of that book was a very important thing in our mind, because it was, it\nuh, it was a very important document. There were uh organizations who uh tried to save the lives\nof famous people, of known politicians, of the people of uh, uh, uh, like actors, like writers,\npainters, by finding them a suitable job, a job on the roof, where they would, you know, for\nexample, uh peel the potatoes, or instead of going on and face the rain and snow and cold. Uh,\nthese, there were uh, there were uh, attempts made to uh, to hide the people who were in danger of\nbeing called for execution. Several times, this was a successful. For example, in my case, when I\ncame 2nd time to Auschwitz, uh, I was immediately not knowing even about it, you know, taken\ncare by a group of uh people, organization uh, they, they, they saved me from being uh, uh, uh\nbeing uh, uh, uh taken, being uh dressed into the prisoners guard right in the place, in the old\nAuschwitz, uh Auschwitz. Uh, uh, they took me to the, to Birkenau instead where nobody knew me\nat that time, and uh, uh, I received a number, which was a, a, a completely different number from\nmy first number, and then they sent me to another camp.\nReload one more roll.\nYeah.\nCR-7, TAKE 8\nbeep\nWhat choices could one make in the camp that could help you survive?\nI would say that all those people with the special talents, with special professions, had chance to\nsurvive by uh, uh working in that uh, in uh, in uh, in that field, in his own field, field. Like, for\ninstance, spo-sports people, you know, those who could play a soccer game, had a time, good time",
        "for survival because they would occasionally, the SS would get tired of this camp routine, and they\nwould say, \"Oh, let's play a game.\" So they would play a game. In camp Gross Rosen, where I\nwas sent later on in 1944, commandant of the camp was a sportsman, and a soccer player himself,\nso we had 27 teams of soccer team, soccer game. Of course, in Auschwitz, a painter had a place,\nuh, his place in, in uh museum, where he could, you know, do his thing, and also earn a little more\nuh food. A musician could survive by playing in the orchestra. Good cook would go and cook for\na SS people in the, in the SS club. Things like that. But no teacher, no lawyer, no uh, uh, uh\nscientist would have any chance of survival, you know. As a matter of fact, the higher education,\neducation you were, the more in danger were you were, because, you know, they would just kill\nyou because , you know, there, there was a, a trend, trend to, to eliminate all the intelligentsia.\nWhat about age? Who was eliminated from an age standpoint?\nAmong Jews, children first, and mothers. All the women and children were eliminated always\nfirst. They went to the gas chambers 100%. The young Jewish women, you know, when they were\nattractive, or uh, uh educated, or strong enough, you know, sometimes they found its way to the uh\nwoman's camp, and they had certain various function. In 1944, for example, as my friend's told\nme, in most offices, the Jewish women were, are, are occupied. From the, from, overall from each\nof the transports that arrived in Auschwitz, only about between 10 and 15% of people were spared\nof gassing. And it was always a doctor who was a functionary uh whose job was to pick up those\nwho were strong enough you know to do the, the, the uh physical jobs in camp. So, about, as I say,\nabout 15% most, they went and were mixed up with other prisoners. There was no special camp\nfor, for Jews only. There was no special camp for Poles only. You know. The only distinction, the\nonly difference was, you know, of gypsies, they had they own camp in Birkenau. They were\neventually all destroyed by gas too.\nCan you tell me the story of Paleish, is that right?\nPalietsch. Pali. Palietsh. Palietsh. Palietsch was a report fuehrer. It was a rank of Sergeant. His\nfunction was to count all the, all the, the, the present at the roll call, you know, added up, and report\nthis to the uh the uh commandant of the camp. That was his function. Besides that, he had a\nspecial function. He was an official executor. At that time, well, the execution were uh, German\nwere performing on the, uh cor--on the courtyard of Block 11. He was the one that did most of the\nexecution. The first execution were by the, the team of uh the uh by the uh, uh small commando of\nGerman soldier who had came in the uh, uh with the rifles, and he would shoot--it was just like a,\nlike a, like a military show. Later on, they discontinued this because the cannonat, after that",
        "execution was so loud that the people in Auschwitz heard this, and then the story about the\nexecution went further towards everywhere else. You know. So they stopped that, and instead,\nthey employed Palietsch. He would go, uh, uh, he would go to the Block 11, with a silencer, small\nrifle, small caliber rifle, silencer, and he would uh, while the naken uh, uh prisoner would run to the\nwall where the execution were taking place, he would place that uh, uh rifle right at that spot, and\npull the trigger, and the man right away was, the, the blood burst through eyes and mouth and nose\nand everything, and he fell dead immediately. And, at one point, he killed that way over 350\npeople, in one sitting. This was a transport of intelligentsia that came from Krakow. Uh, it was\narrested in uh 1942. And, there was in the camp one maybe allowed to stay about 2 weeks, and\nthey were all executed. It was done by Palietsch. The Palietsch later on fell in love with a Jewish\nwoman, and he was put into that Bunker where he used to lock lot of prisoners. And after that, he\nwas removed from there, and taken probably to an East front, and of course, he is the only one, and\nthat we don't know what happened to him. You know. Really we don't know--you know--he is a\nquestion mark until today.\nOkay, I think I've asked all the questions. We just need to get room tone, unless you have\nsomething you want to add.\nWell, what?\nMaybe, maybe I would tell something about the uh, uh tattoo, you know. A tattoo that was uh, uh,\nuh, uh place on the arm of each prisoner in Auschwitz was an accident of things. Nowhere in other\ncamps that I saw any tattoos--only in Auschwitz. And the reason for it was that when the women\narrived, and they lived in such a horrible sanitary condition, that, you know, they accumulated lot\nof dirt on the, on the hands and on the chest, where the number was written all because there in a\nspecial pencil. When uh, uh, when the woman died, and they tried to wash that place, and come to\nthat number, they couldn't. The number was washed with the dirt. And, by the number, we were\nall registered in the books, not by the name. So the number was utmost important. So, somebody\ncame an idea, how \u2018bout making a tattoo? And they did the tattoo to all the women. Later on they\nfound out, this is a fantastic thing because it makes it more difficult to escape. And they did it on\nthe men in Auschwitz, but only in Auschwitz.\nDo you still have your tattoo?\nI have tattoo when I came the second time. See? When I came the second time, also under false\nname, a different one, uh, the second or the third already, you know, so I came and they made this",
        "tattoo in Birkenau. And I stayed in Birkenau. And with this tattoo, I was transferred to the camp of\nuh Buchenwald. At, the reason why I have only that because I escaped before the order came to\ntattoo everybody in Auschwitz, the old timers. You know, so I didn't have that, you know.\nDid you know a man named Sam Bankhalter. He was at Auschwitz for a long...\nbeep\n...time.\nNo, no, no I didn't.\nCR-8, TAKE 10\nbeep\nFirst I want you to talk to me about how you feel about what people experienced when they were in\nthe camp. Whether they knew what was going on around them.\nMost, in most cases, not. Uh, uh, and this is uh, why so many died before they could realize where\nthey were, because they didn't know, they were shocked. First of all, by beating, you know, by the\nreception that they received. The reception was so ugly, so terrifying, that they forgot to eat, that\nthey forgot to stand in line for food. Therefore, they were immediately hungry. Lot of people\ndidn't like the food that they were giving, so they refused to eat it. The beginning, they were still\nfull of good things from the uh, from Warsaw or Krakow, or somewhere you know, good\nrestaurants, so they refused. And, if they kept on refusing more than one week, they died. Because\nthey, they finally, you know star--became so hungry you know that you know from hunger they\ndied. And, uh, it 1s only those who immediately realize that they have to be on guard, physically\nand emotionally, psychologically, that they cannot show any, any anything that would uh register\nas a, a, a rejection, or uh, something that they didn't like because, you know, there were uh\nspecialists who only look for this kind of thing, and they would teach you a lesson immediately.\nAnd, therefore, beating was the most tragic thing that happened to almost everybody. And a\ncommon prisoner, when he came and---------------------and performed that uh, low job, that means\nhe was going to, he worked with the wheelbarrow and a spade. He was uh, subjected to a, to the, to\nthe heat and the cold, he was rain, uh during rain and during snow for 16 hours, who could not\nsleep because there was such an overcrowding that 6 people sometimes slept in one bed, that means",
        "that they didn't could, could, they didn't uh, uh lie down, they were just sitting right there in that\nbed, you know. So, when he uh, instead of resting, he got uh, he got uh, uh in this situation during\nthe night, and then he was uh, he had to go, and work 16 hrs a day, and at the end even uh, when,\nthe work was over, he still had to march on the parade before a commandant when he entered the\ncamp, before the commandant, and the orchestra they was playing tangos! You know, so (laughs),\nand then, he had to encounter a uh, uh roll call, which sometimes it lasted 2 hours. Suppose\nsomebody was es-escaped? And they were looking for him? So until they found him or dead or\nalive or you know, the rest of the camp has to stand at still stand and wait for that to happen. So,\nthe whole atmosphere in the camp was designed in such a way to make you immediately so low\nand so despair, that sometimes a death that came, that was a salvation, really, for many, many\npeople.\nTell me about the----------------\nOh, oh, yeah. I work in the, in the, with the files, you know, I had two files, besides working, uh\ndoing artwork in the office, I had also files. And I had to go out and register newcomers too. So,\nuh, uh I had to do some uh, some uh filing and uh and pulling out the files when the list came from\nthe Gestapo announcing, you know, so and so------the whole list from the, from the, when they\ncame once in 24 hours. So, we had to, first of all, pull out all the files of the dead, put it in a special\ncompartment. And, in the book, in the main book, where there was a name, there was just one\nbook with a name, you know, we have to put, you know, by the dead person, a cross, a red cross,\nthis was a sign that he is dead. In oth, uh other instances everywhere else, in all the files in the\nwhole business of the camp, the dead was hidden under the few character which indicated ---------,\nwhich means transferred dead or alive from this camp to another, or to another life, if, if you\nbelieve in it. Because, as a matter of fact, this was the end, this was the, the, the, the, the common\nthing in every camp, the proceeding. When the transport, for example, was sent from Auschwitz to\nanother camp, we used to pull out all the cards and put that Eiberstadt mark on every one of them.\nWhen the people were executed, the same thing happened, you know. When uh, when uh, uh\nsomebody escape, uh he was uh his file was pulled to a separate compartment, but in the book was\nregistered as Eberstedt too. They always keep that sac, uh, uh sacred, you know, what happen to\nthe people.\nTalk about you anger.\nOh, (laughs) I was angry from the very beginning, you know. I was angry that I allow myself to be\narrested. Therefore, at the very beginning, still, when I was on the, in the Slovakian territory, I",
        "gave, I gave my uh false name, you know, register false name, and with that name, I came to Au, to\nAuschwitz. Of course, it was very inconvenient, and dangerous too because, you know, they are\nall looking for, because every, after, under every name of that kind, you know, there was always a\nsecret, a story that the Gestapo wanted to know. So, uh, even to the friends, you did not say to\nanybody, absolutely to anybody that you have a false name. And, what happen when you run in a\nperson that you know you. And it happened to me many, very often, you know, that the people\nknew me, you know. In uh, in, in certain point, to Auschwitz was brought one of my professors\nfrom the Academy of Art. You know, Professor Denekovsky, the, the sculptor, you know. Uh, and\nhere I am with the name of Baras (ha ha ha), and he knew me! In the school! So, and it was a, a\nthing that they have to be always on the guard, and uh, always creating a, a uh, uh lies about\nyourself, and about the circumstances. The second thing that makes me so mad, uh, uh, was that I\nhad to take the hat off in front of every SS man, even the common soldier. This was a rule. For not\ntaking a hat and standing still in the front of him when you talk, when he spoke to you, this was a, a\npunishment of 25 on, on your eh, behind, you know. At least. Or sometimes, it was a hanging for 3\nhours on the, that way, on a, at stake, I hung that way 3 hours on a stake, and until today, you\nknow, this finger is always numb, you know, for 50 years. So, uh, sometimes I wander a 1/2 mile\naway when I saw an SS man, so I could, you know, escape uh marching in the front of him, and\nhaving this uh, uh, the burden of taking the hat off. So this everything accumulated to the point\nthat I couldn't stand anymore. And all those uh, uh execution. This was a terrifying thing, a nerve-\nbreaking situation when you stand in the line, and the report fuehrer Palietsch is calling the\nnumbers, this one and that one and that one, your friend next to you might be called, you know, or\nsomebody else you know, you know, and they have to, and immediately they taking out to Block\n11. And nobody knew, no uh, uh, uh, whether next time, you never was sure that the next time,\nyou not be that, the one that would be called too. Because we all were, all the secrets about our\ncrimes, that were written in our uh files in Gestapo were never uh, was always in secret, you know.\nPut on another roll.\nTake 11\nBeep\nCan you tell me about some of the differences between camps, and how Auschwitz related to other\ncamps?\nAs I mentioned before, Auschwitz had two industries, one uh, the main industry of Auschwitz was",
        "death industry. The people were brought by thousands, tens of thousands every day in order to die.\nAnd they were brought as civilians. They were not considered prisoners. All those who went to\nthe gas chambers came direct straight from the car, from the railroad car. And uh, there were no\nlist made of records, any records made of how many of them were, you know, the only records that,\nthat were made was of those who were chosen to become a prisoners, and that's generally about 10\nto 15% of each transport were saved that way, uh, because, the Ger-the Germans needed uh, uh the\npeople uh, to do the killing. You know, the Germans, SS, was never using a gun. Uh, officially.\nUh, they were never assisting a death officially. There was always a prisoner who dood it, who did\nit. A prisoner who, who was uh burning that, that corpse in the oven, or the prisoner who was uh,\nuh, uh loading the, the cars with the corpses from the gas chamber to the, that went to, from gas\nchamber, to the, to the crematorium, and so forth. There were always prisoners who assisted\nkilling the people. And they in turn were killed later on too. Because, you know, the, the transport,\nsometimes the transport, I know some transports that was called ------------- Commando. They\nwere called different names. They, they consisted of some 5-600 men, strong men, you know, who\nlived in special quarter, uh, isolated from the rest of the camp, who had enough food, who had\neverything what they needed, who were half drunk, in order to do the job, but, whose life was very\nshort, sometimes only one month. They, then, then, they, too then, later on, became those who,\nwho were gassed because the Germans that way wanted to get rid of all the witnesses.",
        "Did you or did you see others try to warn people what was happening when they came in?",
        "No, because those who assisted the transport were part of that special group who assisted the dead\nof the people. So, they were uh, they were, they had no uh, no uh, uh, opportunity even to tell\nbecause there were always SS around. And, if a person tried to warn somebody, he would be\nthrown into that pack immediately and executed immediately! You know, so uh, so just simply,\nthere was not occasion to do that. But, as I say, there were some revolts of those who knew what is\ngoing to happen to them, and some were successful, most of them not. Few probably escaped. But\nnot many, because these was in under constant guard, and there was a hundreds of SS who were\nguarding that area. The area was completely isolated, a common prisoner did not know where the\ngas chambers, where the gas chambers are. The chambers were camouflaged, there were trees\ngrowing around, you know, that, that that, most of the buildings were underground, the, all those\nprisoners, there was areas where uh the gas chamber was uh, uh where the gassing was executed,\nwas done primarily underground, you know, in those uh, uh rooms. Of course, nothing, uh,\nnothing survived because German, before they retreated, they destroyed everything. We only\nknow how the, the gas chambers and all those crematoriums looked like because there are some\nphotographs that survived in the files, in this architect's office. They were all designed in",
        "Auschwitz. I even don't know name, you know, of those who designed them. You know, there\nwere two officers, one name was Gediako, another was Ertre. They were both from uh, uh Austria,\nyou know. And good SS, you know, and they were, they were the leading architects in Auschwitz.\nThey did, they built everything. And more important things were built by the, by the uh, in\nGermany by various industries. You know, the ovens, for example, they, we know that, they are in\nfile, the names, I don't know them, but, uh..\nWhat happen to families? When they arrived. Tell what it was like to be a family arriving in\nAuschwitz.\nYou mean a family arriving as a prisoners, that's what you mean?\nNo, as a transport, and someday they would become prisoners.\nOh, well, you know, they were separated immediately. Uh, children, uh, uh, uh, mothers and\nchildren were, and all the women were kept in one group and men separately in another group.\nAnd they never saw each other. Maybe there were some instances if they happened both uh uh\nmembers of the family, if they have survive, and lived in the camp later on, probably they were\ntrying to find each other. Maybe there was a situation like that. But the Birkenau area consisted of\nseveral camps, each camp was with a spe, with a had its own set of uh barbed wire. (clears throat)\nElectrified fence, and visiting a ------was non-existent. So, uh, uh, uh there was situation like for\nexample, I had a friend. He worked in the same room where I was in Arbegeisetz. He was in\nAuschwitz. His wife was in Ravensbriick. Both survived, happily, you know. But, uh, there were\nother other uh, uh instances where, you know, one of them died , you know. But, uh as I indicated\nbefore, and I always say it, uh, it was up to the Gestap-the Gestapo, local Gestapo, the arresting\nGestapo was a, the organization that uh, uh, uh directed a prisoner to a certain place in a certain\ntime, with a certain purpose. Lot of prisoners went, with this description, that, uh, his or hers\nreturn, is uh, is uh, not unwelcome. It was, they would say it this way, \"Richter ommervierst,(ph)\"\nfor example, and it was this adnotation?? would be in the file. You know, this was indication that\nthat person sooner or later would be called out on the, on the roll call, and uh, uh, uh would go to\nthe uh Block 11 in Auschwitz, or to the eh, eh area where the gas chambers were in Birkenau, and\nit would be finished with it.\nDid you have no control over this?\nNo control. No, no. You live from day to day. You are happy to have lived one day. Especially,",
        "you were so more happy if you were not beaten, if you were not hit during a day. Because, you\nknow, this, uh, uh seldom happens too, especially if you work uh, if you eh, if you eh, with the eh,\nif you work with the, the, with wheelbarrow and spade. You know, they were always hollering\nyou, rushing you, \"Loos, loos, loos, loos!\" They were always telling that, you know. And, it was\nnot SS, because the SS was a commander of the group. It was a German kapo with the eh green\ntriangle, you know, professional criminal, who was your boss. And, each kapo had at least hundred\npeople under him. Some kapos who were called Oberkapo, you know, had even thousands of\nprisoners under them, you know. And, they were directing them to work, although they were, they\ndidn't know nothing what about the eh, eh, eh characteristic of that work, but just the--standing\nthere and shouting and beating the prisoner or killing them because, you know, sometimes eh a\nkilling was a eh prescription for the, for how, how the, you know, the commando eh, eh should, eh,\nshould eh, eh, look like after they return to the camp. Sometimes it was said eh, eh before --------,\nyou know, they have to leave 5 or 6, you know, bring them dead.",
