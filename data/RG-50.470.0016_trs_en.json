        "Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/13/95 COL JAMES MONCRIEF JR\nPage l\nColonel James Moncrief Jr. interview 2/13/95\nSWB: Tell me how you first heard about ...\nCOL. MONCRIEF: Okay. Uh, in April of 1945, the war had\nreached the stage where soldiers, had reached the stage that\nsoldiers called it a rat race. The Germany army was pretty\nmuch, uh, upset and it was a matter of the Americans just\nchasin' \u2018em. It became a real rat race. Uh, on the\neleventh, part of our division overran a camp at Buch-\nconcentration camp at Buchenwald. Uh I was a, I was a G-l,\nlieutenant colonel, as a G-l of the division headquarters.\nG-l is a staff officer on the general staff of the\ncommanding general. His capa- his job has to do with many\naspects of personnel. Part of which are prisoners. So when\nthe message came into division headquarters, the general\nwasn't at the headquarters. At this stage of the game, I\ndon't remember where the headquarters was located. It was\nnorth of Buchenwald. When the message came, it was, we\nbecame sort of frantic. It talked about thousands of people\ndying, and our troops had overrun \u2018em. So immediately I\nknew that something had to be done and I said before we can\nreally recommend a course of action we've got to know more\nof the facts. So I told the chief of staff that I would\njust go to Buchenwald, and, for myself, find out about it.\nThe message we had received was over radio through two",
        "echelons of command before it reached the division. From\nthe battalion first to a, b- t- to the b- patrol to _ the\nbattalion to combat command A and then _ to division\nheadquarters. So I got in the jeep mounted uh with a radio,\nand took off for Buchenwald, while driving. So I got to\nBuchenwald about uh, I'd say about two hours after this was\njust my-my estimate at this stage of the game. I got to\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/13/95 COL JAMES MONCRIEF JR\nPage 2\nBuchenwald about two hours after it had been discovered by\nour troops. Troops of the ninth armored infantry battalion,\na patrol commanded by Captain Fred Keopfer, found the camp,\nand fortunately, he had a man who understood German and\nRussian to some extent, whose name was Gotschok. Now\nSergeant Gotschok overheard a conversation taking place on\nthe side of the road between what our troops consi- our\npatrol considered to be Germans. Some of them had German\nCivilian, German military uh, some military uni- -tire,\nattire. While also had some civilian clothes. But they\nwere being roughed up and by some people who Gotschok\ndetermined to be Russian because they were speaking Russian.\nSo when they were finally separated to the point that uh",
        "Gostchok could get them guieted down enough to understand\nwhat they were talking about, he found out that there was a\nconcentration camp out the road, ten or twelve, six or eight\nmiles out, I don't know how far they were from it. SO\n[Ahem] Jefferson said okay, mount a couple of these guys up\non our scout car and we'll just go out there and see this\ncamp. So he radioed into his battalion commander, task\nforce commander actually, it wasn't a battalion commander,\nwho was Colonel, at that time, Captain Bennett. And Captain\nBennett said well go on out there and see what 1s taking\nplace, come back in and let me know. So with that, uh,\nKoepfer then had these Germans up on the front end of his m-\nuh, scout car, and went out to the north rim of the camp,\nwhere the RusSians apparently had gotten out. Now these\nRussians turned out to be former inmates of the camp. When\nthe German guard left the camp, they all took off in a cloud\nof dust when they heard all the commotion of the war coming\non, artillery and sound of tanks and so on. There was no\nfight for Buchenwald. The German guard had just simply ran.\nAnd when they, Russians, after the German guard got out, the\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/13/95 COL JAMES MONCRIEF JR\nPage 3",
        "Russians had cut a hole in the fence, north edge of the\nperimeter, they cut a hole in the fence, barbed wire, and\ngotten out. And then they found these Germans guards up in\nthe little village, and that's the reason that led to how\nare troops getting in there. So when our detail, our patrol\ngot down there, they went to the same opening that these\ntroops had gotten ou-, Russians had gotten out. And found\nthemselves in the camp, by the time they got there though,\nthey were overpowered with able-bodied, as able-bodied as\nthey were, not many of them were that strong, believe me.\nBut some were able-bodied and were out in the compound area\nand were therefore for the Americans when they came\nin. So they began to have a big celebration. Pitchin, they\njust want to touch the Americans, and they were touching by\ngrabbing them and throwing up in the air and trying to catch\nthem and so on. And Koepfer said that he was afraid he was\ngonna get killed, dropped out there and get hurt. SO we\nfinally got some order maintained, told them to quiet down.\nBy this time, he was led to a man who appeared to be the\nleader of the group, and they were well organized,\nincidentally, the inmates were. And then between them the,\nI don't know, well Gotschok was there to-to interpret for\n\u2018em. Uh, Koepfer told em to stay in place, we gonna. get\nhelp quick as we can. And he sent his radio message,\nthrough these various echelons, came to the division. And I\ngot there about two hours later. Our troops, Koepfer and\nhis patrol had already gone. There might have been, and I\ndon't remember, there might have been some other American",
        "troops there and I think there were, b- from our battalion\nheadquarters, the ninth armored infantry battalion\nheadquarters, who got the message and they came, some of\nthem came up there. But other than a half a dozen other\nAmerican soldiers, I don't remember seeing any other\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/13/95 COL JAMES MONCRIEF JR\nPage 4\nAmerican sol- all of whom I thought were in our division.\nLooking back, that's the only thing I can remember about it.\nSo when I got there [clears throat] in the meantime I had\ngone round and I went through the main gate as I recall it.\nI didn't go through the hole in the fence that the troops\nhad found. So when I got through the- I went through the\nmain gate and there were still a lot of milling around of\ninmates. Now let me tell you something about the condition\nof the inmates, the ones that were milling around.\nObviously, uh, not as in good physical condition at all.\nBut still able to maneuver and move. Most of them that I\nSaw were men who were, skin was a-_ looked, skin\nwise, and it looked, next layer under that was just bone.\nIt was absolutely no flesh on the, on the few[?] people that\nI saw at all. Uh some of them were dressed in prison garb",
        "and some had on what I would call a T-Shirt, uh, and uh,\nwere just mixed type uni- clothes, none of had on uniform\nclothing. So then I said well I'd like to see some of the\nplace, and uh there was a language barrier, obviously. I\ndidn't have a German or a RuSSian interpreter. So in s-\nSign language and some way or other, I wanted to find out\nwho was in charge or somebody I could talk to. And finally\nthey brought a young man, a younger inmate, who a man who I\nconsidered to be thirty-ish. Uh, who had, they called him\ndoc-tor. And it turned out, and when I started talking to\nhim, that he had been a pre-med student and therefore earned\nthe title doctor. So I told him what I who I was, I was\nfrom division headquarters and I wanted to get some of the,\nsome specifics of the problems, and he apparently being a,\nthe doctor, uh knew something of the details and he could\nme. And he told me that there were thousands and I tried to\npin him down and he didn't really know whether there was 18\nor 25 thousand, but he said it was somewhere in that\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/13/95 COL JAMES MONCRIEF JR\nPage 5\nneighborhood, thousands of people there. And he-he_ said\nsome of them are actually dying, all of them are in need of",
        "medical attention, food, uh, fresh water, all of the other\nrequirements for life. So then I said, well I'd like to\nlook in a barracks, and he was my guide through, I went\nthrough one barracks. And the condition, uh, the conditions\nI saw there would just turn your stomach. Uh there was some\nleaning on the wall, inmates, some lying on the floor, and\nthose lying on the floor I couldn't tell whether they were\ndead or alive. Some were in their bunks, they were they\nwere stacked bunks. And honestly I've forgotten I don't\nknow whether there were three or four stacks. But there was\na-not enough room fo- in the bed space, for a big man _ to\nturn over. If aman my size got in there, he'd have to get\nout if he wanted to turn over, he'd have to get out, get in\nthe bed a different manner, where, in which he wanted to\nlie. They were that thin. And th- some of the people lying\nin those bunks were so uh near dead that they didn't have\nenergy enough to turn their head. When I would walk by.\nNot that th- not that they would anyhow, but at least there\nwas a stranger in the barracks, and I know that they-they\nthey recognize if they was still hearing, because I was\ntalking and obviously talking in English. And I was talking\nto this, my guide, all through this barracks tour, and none\nof them bothered to say anything, uh, they just let me walk\nby. Well, I went through the barracks, and I told them, uh,\nI said, is there a mess hall. So I went through what he...\nSWB: We need to put up another roll\n[CAMERA RELOAD |",
        "[CR#2 ]\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/13/95 COL JAMES MONCRIEF JR\nPage 6\nCOL. MONCRIEF: Uh my guide led into what he called a mess\nhall, it really wasn't much mess hall, I Saw\u2019 some, a big\nstove, uh with some dirty looking pans and pots around but\nthere was very little space for anybody to sit, in the mess\nhall. Uh so I presumed that people got, went by the chow\nline and got their little rations and then went out and ate\nit on the grounds somewhere, I don't really know. Well,\nthere wasn't much there that I could, pay much attention,\nexcept that I did see that there was no, no supply of food.\nHe showed me where they did have, what would be a pantry.\nBut there was nothing there. So then he sh- took me, he\nsaid he wanted to show me the crematoria. Now the crema\ntorium that I saw at least, when I knew, what I saw at\nBuchenwald, was not any huge thing, it only had two uh big\novens, but they were obviously had been used, they were big\nenough where you could uh poke a body through it to the end\nof the doorway, and uh, the thing that I remember more",
        "distinctly than anything else about the crematorium was,\napparently they had uh brought people in, brought them in to\nthe room alive. And had yanked them up or tied them up by\ntheir feet. Because at, about my height of my eyesight, on\nthe walls, were these places where somebody had, it\nobviously hadn't been done by any tool to make them even and\nsmooth, it was clawed with fingernails, into the wall. And\nyou could, you could this uh shook me up. Uh there were\nonly two place, two ovens as I said there. Now, uh, there\nwas a, although the uh ovens were warm on the outside, it\nwasn't hot, it just feel it warm, I could see no evidence in\nthe side of the ovens, this b- my guide opened the door for\nme and there was nothing that I could detect in the way of\nbodies, or ash or bodies. Uh, just outside and around the\ncorner was a whole stack of bodies, just stacked up like\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/13/95 COL JAMES MONCRIEF JR\nPage 7\ncord wood. Some clothed and some not. Uh whether they had\nbeen uh, whether they just died naturally and were moved out\nthere to one central spot, or whether they had been murdered\nand brought there, I don't know. But they were just stacked\nup out there. Well, with that, I figured I had enough, I",
        "tried to pin him down some more and I s- he showed me where\nthe area of the camp was, I did not go through the whole\narea, mine was just a cursory inspection, I did not inspect\nin great detail. But he did show me the, where the, how far\nthe camp extended, on each side of where we were. And based\non that information, I made a horseback estimate, there must\nbe 20,000 there if they were all billeted in the barracks\nabout like similar to the one that I had seen. So then I\ngot on my radio and at this stage of the game I don't\nremember now whether I talked in the clear or whether it was\nall in code. TI think by this time in the war, everything we\ncould talk in the clear. So I think I was able to relay it\nto division headquarters, uh, what I had _= seen. And my\nmessage was in effect, it's far worse than we had\nanticipated. Now, in the division headquarters, uh, that's-\nthat's the purpose of the staff officer, take care of all\nthese little details. And so, although this waS a major\ndetail, I g- I got the G-4 on the other end of the, a G-4\nwho was a very good friend of mine, just recently died,\nformer senator from the state of Delaware aS a matter of\nfact, name was Bowes, Kale Bowes. I said Kale things are a\nwhole lot worse than we thought, and uh, so I know you want\nto get them to radio to the army if you haven't already been\nin touch with the army. And tell them what we need. And I\ncan't begin to tell you what all we need. Uh, I'm not gonna\ntry to identify every bottle of iodine or anything of that\nsort. We need all kind of medical supplies. We need enough\nfood for 20,000 people. We probably need a whole medical",

We need a\nguartermaster company, at least a company to come in here\nand set up some uh kitchen operation, with food. Uh we need\nsome engineer people in here to purify the water. Uh, we\nneed uh, other support troops to administer, military\ngovernment. In the mean time, military government had\nalready been alerted, we had, it- now, within our resources\nwithin the division we were somewhat limited in what we can\ndo in, in terms of these lu- furnishing this type of\nlogistical support. But they had already been alerted,\nwithin our division. So we did exhaust the capabilities\nthat we had even before uh we turned it over to army. But\nremember now, our division's mission was to fight the war\nand we were pursuing the Germans, and they were running\nfast. So we couldn't tarry there very long. Uh, Koepfer\nand his patrol, being of leading elements of the, of that\ntask force down south, they had already gone. So he had to\ndash to catch up, when he sidetracked to come over to\nBuchenwald. That's how rapidly we were moving. And he had,\nhis mission was to uh fight the war. And likewise uh _ the\nechelon of division headquarters wasn't able to tarry there",
        "very long. So we, we exhausted, from what we had in our\nrear echelon, what we called it, trains command, they have\nth- gu- support and logistical support people. Uh, they\nbrought, they did leave some rations and some medical\npeople, they have a medical battalion that supports the\nwhole division. And so they had, I believe it was a medical\ncompany that was able to stop there and start some sort of\nmedical treatment. But that was only just as a temporary\nexpedient. Army headquarters had to furnish some, and they\nfurnished the, what I call the s- the uh occupying forces to\ncome there and occupy the place and administer and set up\nall these logistical things.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/13/95 COL JAMES MONCRIEF JR\nPage 9\nSWB: Did you give anybody any food?\nCOL.
