        "A: It was...1t was, you know, it was a a medium-sized town and it was like a like a county\nseat or something like that. There were lots of Jews, very poor Jews. A few who had\nbusinesses and lived a little better, but the majority of the people were...lived in one room\napartments. A religious community, not very assimilated. It was the part of Poland that\nwas kind of Polish-Russian, not Austrian-Hungarian or German so they were not\nassimilated as much. There were in the town maybe ten families that were very\nassimilated. There was a rabbi and another rabbi and it was very very orthodox and\noriented in very kind of orthodox religious way. I was too young to really take any active\npart in in in the life of the town, you know. I went to school in the morning and came\nhome and, you know, did my homework and had a couple of little girl friends and, you\nknow, boys didn't come yet into the picture, so you know...can't tell you very much about\nit. I can tell you that each holiday we got together with my grandmothers, you\nknow...tradition was a big thing, you know. My grandmother had a business. She was\nsupplying dairy to the army.

Father did not do too well, financially I think, you know. What I can remember,\nyou know, we had a nice apartment like two rooms but I don't think there was wealth,\nyou know. I think he had...he struggled a lot, you know. First, you know, he was he lived\nin one place and then, you know, he kind of couldn't establish himself when he was sent\nback to Poland. So Grandmother helped and whatever, you know. The families kind of\nlived together.",
        "Q: When did things begin to change?",
        "A: For me personally, you know, some time after the holidays, our Passover holidays in\n1939, my aunt came from Warsaw. And my father sent me to live with her for a while,\nyou know. I finished elementary school. There was no question about going to college\nbecause there was no money, so I lived... went sometimes in May to Warsaw in 1939. In\nSeptember the war started. Then, you know, lasted the whole month until, you know,\nuntil the Germans really came in Warsaw. The family four months. In that\napart...in that apartment, you know, uh we all lived in the basement and every morning\nyou had to, you know, go up and every evening go down into the basement until the\nbombardment was over, and I stayed with them until in the '40's. In the fall in the '40's.\nAnd there was a janitor in that house who offered, you know, that I should move in with\ntheir family and live with them. In the meantime, you know, they started...other people\nstarted moving in. It's up in the in the district where later on the ghetto was. The street\nwas called . And when they started really giving a very hard time to all the Jews\nand beating and and resettling, the people started moving in. My aunt bought me a ticket\non the train and said go home. So I was on the train traveling from Warsaw to ;\nSometime...half-way they stopped the train. They said all the Jews off. And they gathered\nus all in the station...1t was a railway station. A tall guy, a Polish railway worker, came\nover to me, took my hand to walk me out, and and maybe about half-mile from the\nstation there was three big buildings like apartment buildings where railway workers\nprobably lived, you know. And he took me to the apartment. In the apartment there were\nmaybe twenty other Jews, so he kept us over there like some of them he kept like a week,\ntwo, two days, five days and slowly he and his wife took them through the fields and\ntried to help them go on, get out of there. He kept me six weeks I was over there, and one\nday he said it's time to move on, and he took me through the fields and I walked like\nmiles and miles...[ don't even know what direction, you know. Some people gave me a\nride, you know, and I told them where I want to go and finally I came to the city where I\nwanted to go home to . I[came over there. There were no Jews. I knew I had an\naunt, my mother's sister, in . So I walked to . You know, on on the way I\nasked where to go and since I was little blonde girl and uh nobody really suspected that\nI'm Jewish you know. Because nobody in all these people who gave me a ride, you know,\nasked me where you want to go, and I said I want to go there, to . They took me.\nThey they...nobody suspected I was Jewish. I came to . Was nobody there\nanymore. My aunt was, you know, was a wealthy woman. She had businesses. It's a small\ntown. She had a big...and for that time a brick house was a big thing, you know. She had\na big house. The house was empty, you know. Some Poles lived over there and they were\nnot there anymore. So I went back to , and I remembered that while my\ngrandmother, you know, had the dairy, she used to also to deliver some stuff for a\nhospital, you know. I remembered that man who was in charge in the hospital is a doctor,\nso I said I'll go over there, you know, and I'll tell him who I am and maybe he can tell me\nsomething where they are, because I didn't know where anybody 1s, was, you know. So I\nwent to the hospital and he was very nice. He put me in a bed, you know. He said pretend\nthat you are a patient and that you are sick. We will try to see your your family is in\nRawa Russkaya (ph). This is...next to was Belzec (ph), and next to Belzec, maybe\ntwenty miles, was a city, the Rawa Russkaya. He let somebody know...I don't know\nhow...by peasants or who sent somebody, that I am in the hospital, in his hospital. Then\nmy mother and my two sisters are now in Rawa Russkaya. You could not get through\nBelzec anymore, so she came...she got some peasants to help her and she came for me.\nShe came to the hospital, and she smuggled me through fields into Rawa Russkaya.",
        "Q: How did she do that? Tell us about...",
        "A: She she had, you know...Rawa Russkaya was a little village. It was in the fields...miles\nand miles of fields. And she paid some peasants who lived over there, and they brought\nher in, you know, into the city. She came to the hospital and picked me up and through\nfields and and forests and ___, you know, we went back. We hadn't seen a soul over\nthere. There was not a German or or Poles. Just the peasant and my mother. And she\nwalked me back to Rawa Russkaya. Next day, you know...they lived in a, you\nknow...they they really came from to Rawa Russkaya and they didn't have\napartment or anything, you know. They didn't have money, so the Jewish community\nover there gave an apartment in somebody's basement. Next day there was a knock at the\ndoor. The Russians were there. And they took the whole family in about whoever was,\nyou know, about five hundred families from or maybe more...on a on a train and shipped\nus off to Siberia. We were in Siberia on the Mongolian border in the Tigress (ph) in the\nforest as prisoners. We were over there until 1943, '44, when General who was in in\nEngland in the made...you know, they had made a deal with the Russians and they kind of\nliberated us from the Tigress and sent us into the little town.",
        "Q: OK. Before you were liberated, uh but you are being shipped to Siberia...can you tell us\nabout the trip to Siberia and then we'll ask you what it was like there?",
        "A: The trip took us five weeks in cattle cars without food, without water. Once in a while\nthey stopped the train...didn't let us off...just brought 1n some herring, some water, some\nbread...maybe in the whole five weeks maybe six times. People were hungry, dirty. The\ntrip was absolutely horrible. Absolutely horrible. And then they took us, you know, to...it\nwas a little town and they put us in trucks and drove us into the woods, into the forest.\nThere was nothing there but these tremendous trees. It was...the Russian Tiger (ph) is is\nunbelievable because the only thing you have over there is trees and was not a house. We\nhad to build our own barracks, and they had... __ couple of day commandant and some\nothers who overseed us. We could not leave the place. It was not fenced in or anything.\nBut where would you go? There was a village about five or ten miles away, but you\ncouldn't leave without having a permission to leave and at the...what we had to do over\nthere is get up every morning and cut down trees, cut the trees down into one meter\nblocks and pile it up in the forest. And for this you got the ration bread, just bread. Was\nhunger. The families built like a barrack and each barrack was divided into tiny little\nplaces. You lived on the floor. It was cold. The winters were horri...winter was...we were\none winter there...absolutely horrible. The snows went up six, seven feet and uh was was\nbad. It was bad, you know. And we thought that when we came...if we're ever liberated of\nthese these miserable forests, we'll have stories to tell, and fortunately when we came\nback after, you know, the war ended...they let us go back to Poland. On the way back,\nyou know, once we crossed Ger...the Polish border, the Russian-Polish border, the Poles\nstarted, you know, wanted to dynamite the train. And, you know, everybody had to get\noff the train. The train was escorted by Russian military. We had to get off the train. It\ntook them hours and hours until they cleared what they were \u2014\u2014_\u2014s and we came into\nPoland and nobody wanted to go, you know. They took us to a town with the name of\n. It used to be a German town and when belonged to Poland. We didn't know what\nto do with ourselves, so I joined the kibbutz.",
        "Q: This is after the war?",
        "A: That's right after...around '45. I joined a kibbutz, the . This is...and I was in the\nkibbutz for a while. I was working and get...you know...wanted to leave to go to Israel.\nThat was the purpose of joining the kibbutz.",
        "Q: What was the kibbutz like?",
        "A: It...the kibbutz was really a transient place where people came, stayed a while, worked,\nand from there tried to leave to go to Israel. It was not a kibbutz like you have in Israel\nwhich you work and you establish a life and you're...it was really a place where people,\nJewish people could come, be safe. The place where they gathered. There was a Jewish\ncommunity center, but it did not have the the facilities to accommodate people who came\ninto town, Jewish people, because where would they go. So I I was in that kibbutz for a\nwhile, and then somebody came to me by the name of Andre _ (ph), and said, you\nknow, you better come and join us. And I joined the Brichah (ph). And they sent me to\nLodz and to Warsaw to be trained, you know...tell me what to...what I'm going to have to\ndo and things like that, and my main job was to try to find children and bring them to\n, to the kibbutz. And from there, we put them on trucks into and tried to smuggle\nthem in through the Russian border into Berlin.",
        "Q: Tell us about uh some of the children and some of the things that you did in the Brichah.",
        "A: Most of the children that we gathered were orphans. They were children who Jewish\nfamilies left either with neighbors or some other Poles or people who wanted to make\nsome extra money from the Jewish families, kept the child through the whole thing. You\nknow, once the war is over and they can dispose of the child or send it back or and get\nlots of money paid for it, if they can track, you know...lots of Polish people came to us\nwith these children and demanded a lot of money. Others wouldn't give up with the\nchildren. Some adopted them. The others had free labor and most of the children didn't\nreally know that they're Jewish. We had to find out. There were different ways to find\nout. We used to come to a town and, you know, pretend that they are Poles, and go to the\ninns and sit and drink and eat with the Poles and joke around about the Jews and here and\nthere you could hear a rumor from...somebody say...hey, you know these five kids of\nthese and this and this family were all blond but there is a black one over there too. I bet\nyou she's Jewish. Or I'd bet you he's Jewish, so we kind of found out this way how the\nkids are, where they are, what they're doing, and tried to gather them in order to send\nthem to Israel.",
        "Q: How did you get them...how did you go about getting them?",
        "A: Getting them to Israel?",
        "Q: Physically get them out of the families first?",
        "A: Well, most of the times we came and negotiated. We paid money. We gave jewelry.\nSometimes even you had to just grab them, just kidnap them. I hate to use that word,\nbecause it's really not kidnapping, you know. It's getting back what was yours. Now let's\npause. (Pause)",
        "Q: It's OK. (Pause) It's OK. Take your time. (Pause)",
        "A: Anyway, we gathered them to the big building to the court in the center in the building\nwas like a square. The front part had a big gate, and we had guards over there because it\nwas dangerous. The Poles didn't let us be. One night we had seventy-five kids, and we\nkept them in the back of the building, because it was like a square and Polish hooligans or\nwhoever, you know, attacked the building with guns and was shooting and stones and the\npolice was right there on the corner. Nobody came out to say a thing. It went on for\nhours, and everybody was scared and the children were scared, you know. There was\nscreaming and crying and really, you know, we didn't know how to keep these kids quiet.\nThey was really scared of this all the shooting. That's what happ...1t happened not only\nonce...many times, so next day we used to take some on trucks and drive them down to\nthe border. Normally there were Russians on one side and Germans on the other side.\nMeans to either pay off uh with money, bribe the borders, guards, you know, to let you\nthrough. On the other side there were Brichah from Germany who took them over and\nthey took over...they continued on the other side and we went back. And uh this lasted\nand maybe about two years and one day they came, the Polish police came and said\nthey're looking for a little blonde with a blue cape and you see, the Brichah the Brichah\nhad it's quarters on top on the fourth floor and the guards sent up somebody and said, you\nknow, that they're looking for me. So they got me out and they put me 1n truck and I went\ninto Germany and I went to Germany and I reported to Munich. It was the Brichah and of\ncourse I worked over there and my job was different. My job was to find new ways to\nget...this was illegal...to get people through the borders, through the mountains into\nAustria and Italy, and from there some oth...some other people came. Well...",
        "Q: Tell us about those trips, or one of those trips.",
        "A: Us...usually, you know, uh we waited for the night. You know, we...I'll give you one\nexample...we were in and we had to find a way to get people through the\nmountains, the Alps. So at night there was me, two other guys, one Israeli, one German\nJew young man and another girl, and we were pretending that we are hiking and got lost\nin the mountains. To find a better way, a route, so if, you know, that will, you know, we\ncould smuggle through people. And after a couple of weeks we established the route. We\nmarked it and and it was a place from where me could smuggle through the people into\nItaly and into Austria.",
        "Q: Can you...as it were, take us on one of those journeys? What, what did you do?",
        "A: Well, we..whenever, you know, the trip was scheduled to go through the mountains. We\nhad a building over there where we stayed. A truck used to come with seventy people,\neighty people, husbands, wives, children, luggage, packages and we used to take them\nclimbing up the mountains and it was terrible. People couldn't...it's hard for older people.\nIt's hard for little kids. Not equi...not really too many children that to climb mountains,\nyou know, you really have to equipped for. You have to have the proper clothing. You\ncan't carry anything. On the way they left their...they used to carry suitcases with these\npots and pans, with everything, you know, hoping that they'll come someplace and have\nsomething, you know. They have to leave everything. They used to climb up and go\nthrough the route that we have established before, that we cannot be caught by the by the\npolice, by the guards, by the border guards, and on the other side the others took them\nover and we went back. This we did three times a week, four times a week, whenever it's\nnec...was necessary. I became a good mountain climber. (Laughter)",
        "Q: What was it like for you, doing all this?",
        "A: I think it was the most gratifying time in my life. I find still now...I came to New York to\nsome affair a couple of years ago, and a young woman by the name of __....I forgot her\nlast name...came over to me and says, I know you. You know, when my mother and\nfather and my brothers cross the border, you took their jewelry to have it saved, and\nsmug...smuggled it through into Italy. We'll never forget it. I mean it was the most\ngratifying time in my life and now it's different, you know. Now...but at that time there\nwas nothing. No future. It was worthwhile. Then we came, you know...I was in Germany\nand then liberation...after liberation we still had some work to do and I was, you know, in\nthe Brichah. It was attached to the Jewish agency in Munich, so I was still...they kept me\na little bit busy still and then I came to Frankfurt and final got to Israel, but while I was in\nFrankfurt I have a chance to apply for to come to the United States, and everybody said\nwhy not. Try it. What can you lose? So I applied, you know, for immigration to the\nUnited States, and I went to Israel. One day I had a telephone call...1f you want to go to\nsee the United States, now is the time to go. And I had a boyfriend in Israel, but he said\ngo, you know, so you'll come back in a couple of months. I mean such chances not\neverybody gets. So I came to the United States and I met George. And I didn't go back.\nAnd a year later we got married, you know, and George was a television repairman. I\nmean he had no education. He had sev...four years of elementary school in Poland when\nthe war started. He he was in the Army. They drafted him, and when, you know, when\n____ four years and we got married and we decided, you know, we had the choice of\nstaying in New York and doing what everybody else does...uh he wanted to go to school,\nso he said fine. He went __ to Syracuse. He used to...we lived in Rome, New York, and\nhe went to Syracuse University and I had my kids and we stayed over there for ten years.\nThey were good years. Hard but good and safe. And then he was, you know, invited to\ncome here by the Department of Defense and we came to Washington.",

I remembered that man who was in charge in the hospital is a doctor,\nso I said I'll go over there, you know, and I'll tell him who I am and maybe he can tell me\nsomething where they are, because I didn't know where anybody 1s, was, you know. So I\nwent to the hospital and he was very nice. He put me in a bed, you know. He said pretend\nthat you are a patient and that you are sick. We will try to see your your family is in\nRawa Russkaya (ph). This is...next to was Belzec (ph), and next to Belzec, maybe\ntwenty miles, was a city, the Rawa Russkaya. He let somebody know...I don't know\nhow...by peasants or who sent somebody, that I am in the hospital, in his hospital. Then\nmy mother and my two sisters are now in Rawa Russkaya. You could not get through\nBelzec anymore, so she came...she got some peasants to help her and she came for me.\nShe came to the hospital, and she smuggled me through fields into Rawa Russkaya.",
        "A: She she had, you know...Rawa Russkaya was a little village. It was in the fields...miles\nand miles of fields. And she paid some peasants who lived over there, and they brought\nher in, you know, into the city. She came to the hospital and picked me up and through\nfields and and forests and ___, you know, we went back. We hadn't seen a soul over\nthere. There was not a German or or Poles. Just the peasant and my mother. And she\nwalked me back to Rawa Russkaya. Next day, you know...they lived in a, you\nknow...they they really came from to Rawa Russkaya and they didn't have\napartment or anything, you know. They didn't have money, so the Jewish community\nover there gave an apartment in somebody's basement. Next day there was a knock at the\ndoor. The Russians were there. And they took the whole family in about whoever was,\nyou know, about five hundred families from or maybe more...on a on a train and shipped\nus off to Siberia. We were in Siberia on the Mongolian border in the Tigress (ph) in the\nforest as prisoners. We were over there until 1943, '44, when General who was in in\nEngland in the made...you know, they had made a deal with the Russians and they kind of\nliberated us from the Tigress and sent us into the little town.",
        "A: The trip took us five weeks in cattle cars without food, without water. Once in a while\nthey stopped the train...didn't let us off...just brought 1n some herring, some water, some\nbread...maybe in the whole five weeks maybe six times. People were hungry, dirty. The\ntrip was absolutely horrible. Absolutely horrible. And then they took us, you know, to...it\nwas a little town and they put us in trucks and drove us into the woods, into the forest.\nThere was nothing there but these tremendous trees. It was...the Russian Tiger (ph) is is\nunbelievable because the only thing you have over there is trees and was not a house. We\nhad to build our own barracks, and they had... __ couple of day commandant and some\nothers who overseed us. We could not leave the place. It was not fenced in or anything.\nBut where would you go? There was a village about five or ten miles away, but you\ncouldn't leave without having a permission to leave and at the...what we had to do over\nthere is get up every morning and cut down trees, cut the trees down into one meter\nblocks and pile it up in the forest. And for this you got the ration bread, just bread. Was\nhunger. The families built like a barrack and each barrack was divided into tiny little\nplaces. You lived on the floor. It was cold. The winters were horri...winter was...we were\none winter there...absolutely horrible. The snows went up six, seven feet and uh was was\nbad. It was bad, you know. And we thought that when we came...if we're ever liberated of\nthese these miserable forests, we'll have stories to tell, and fortunately when we came\nback after, you know, the war ended...they let us go back to Poland. On the way back,\nyou know, once we crossed Ger...the Polish border, the Russian-Polish border, the Poles\nstarted, you know, wanted to dynamite the train. And, you know, everybody had to get\noff the train. The train was escorted by Russian military. We had to get off the train. It\ntook them hours and hours until they cleared what they were \u2014\u2014_\u2014s and we came into\nPoland and nobody wanted to go, you know. They took us to a town with the name of\n. It used to be a German town and when belonged to Poland. We didn't know what\nto do with ourselves, so I joined the kibbutz.",
        "A: That's right after...around '45. I joined a kibbutz, the . This is...and I was in the\nkibbutz for a while. I was working and get...you know...wanted to leave to go to Israel.\nThat was the purpose of joining the kibbutz.",
        "A: It...the kibbutz was really a transient place where people came, stayed a while, worked,\nand from there tried to leave to go to Israel. It was not a kibbutz like you have in Israel\nwhich you work and you establish a life and you're...it was really a place where people,\nJewish people could come, be safe. The place where they gathered. There was a Jewish\ncommunity center, but it did not have the the facilities to accommodate people who came\ninto town, Jewish people, because where would they go. So I I was in that kibbutz for a\nwhile, and then somebody came to me by the name of Andre _ (ph), and said, you\nknow, you better come and join us. And I joined the Brichah (ph). And they sent me to\nLodz and to Warsaw to be trained, you know...tell me what to...what I'm going to have to\ndo and things like that, and my main job was to try to find children and bring them to\n, to the kibbutz. And from there, we put them on trucks into and tried to smuggle\nthem in through the Russian border into Berlin.",
        "A: Most of the children that we gathered were orphans. They were children who Jewish\nfamilies left either with neighbors or some other Poles or people who wanted to make\nsome extra money from the Jewish families, kept the child through the whole thing. You\nknow, once the war is over and they can dispose of the child or send it back or and get\nlots of money paid for it, if they can track, you know...lots of Polish people came to us\nwith these children and demanded a lot of money. Others wouldn't give up with the\nchildren. Some adopted them. The others had free labor and most of the children didn't\nreally know that they're Jewish. We had to find out. There were different ways to find\nout. We used to come to a town and, you know, pretend that they are Poles, and go to the\ninns and sit and drink and eat with the Poles and joke around about the Jews and here and\nthere you could hear a rumor from...somebody say...hey, you know these five kids of\nthese and this and this family were all blond but there is a black one over there too. I bet\nyou she's Jewish. Or I'd bet you he's Jewish, so we kind of found out this way how the\nkids are, where they are, what they're doing, and tried to gather them in order to send\nthem to Israel.",
        "A: Getting them to Israel?",
        "A: Well, most of the times we came and negotiated. We paid money. We gave jewelry.\nSometimes even you had to just grab them, just kidnap them. I hate to use that word,\nbecause it's really not kidnapping, you know. It's getting back what was yours. Now let's\npause. (Pause)",
        "A: Anyway, we gathered them to the big building to the court in the center in the building\nwas like a square. The front part had a big gate, and we had guards over there because it\nwas dangerous. The Poles didn't let us be. One night we had seventy-five kids, and we\nkept them in the back of the building, because it was like a square and Polish hooligans or\nwhoever, you know, attacked the building with guns and was shooting and stones and the\npolice was right there on the corner. Nobody came out to say a thing. It went on for\nhours, and everybody was scared and the children were scared, you know. There was\nscreaming and crying and really, you know, we didn't know how to keep these kids quiet.\nThey was really scared of this all the shooting. That's what happ...1t happened not only\nonce...many times, so next day we used to take some on trucks and drive them down to\nthe border. Normally there were Russians on one side and Germans on the other side.\nMeans to either pay off uh with money, bribe the borders, guards, you know, to let you\nthrough. On the other side there were Brichah from Germany who took them over and\nthey took over...they continued on the other side and we went back. And uh this lasted\nand maybe about two years and one day they came, the Polish police came and said\nthey're looking for a little blonde with a blue cape and you see, the Brichah the Brichah\nhad it's quarters on top on the fourth floor and the guards sent up somebody and said, you\nknow, that they're looking for me. So they got me out and they put me 1n truck and I went\ninto Germany and I went to Germany and I reported to Munich. It was the Brichah and of\ncourse I worked over there and my job was different. My job was to find new ways to\nget...this was illegal...to get people through the borders, through the mountains into\nAustria and Italy, and from there some oth...some other people came. Well...",
        "A: Us...usually, you know, uh we waited for the night. You know, we...I'll give you one\nexample...we were in and we had to find a way to get people through the\nmountains, the Alps. So at night there was me, two other guys, one Israeli, one German\nJew young man and another girl, and we were pretending that we are hiking and got lost\nin the mountains. To find a better way, a route, so if, you know, that will, you know, we\ncould smuggle through people. And after a couple of weeks we established the route. We\nmarked it and and it was a place from where me could smuggle through the people into\nItaly and into Austria.",
        "A: Well, we..whenever, you know, the trip was scheduled to go through the mountains. We\nhad a building over there where we stayed. A truck used to come with seventy people,\neighty people, husbands, wives, children, luggage, packages and we used to take them\nclimbing up the mountains and it was terrible. People couldn't...it's hard for older people.\nIt's hard for little kids. Not equi...not really too many children that to climb mountains,\nyou know, you really have to equipped for. You have to have the proper clothing. You\ncan't carry anything. On the way they left their...they used to carry suitcases with these\npots and pans, with everything, you know, hoping that they'll come someplace and have\nsomething, you know. They have to leave everything. They used to climb up and go\nthrough the route that we have established before, that we cannot be caught by the by the\npolice, by the guards, by the border guards, and on the other side the others took them\nover and we went back. This we did three times a week, four times a week, whenever it's\nnec...was necessary. I became a good mountain climber. (Laughter)",
        "A: I think it was the most gratifying time in my life. I find still now...I came to New York to\nsome affair a couple of years ago, and a young woman by the name of __....I forgot her\nlast name...came over to me and says, I know you. You know, when my mother and\nfather and my brothers cross the border, you took their jewelry to have it saved, and\nsmug...smuggled it through into Italy. We'll never forget it. I mean it was the most\ngratifying time in my life and now it's different, you know. Now...but at that time there\nwas nothing. No future. It was worthwhile. Then we came, you know...I was in Germany\nand then liberation...after liberation we still had some work to do and I was, you know, in\nthe Brichah. It was attached to the Jewish agency in Munich, so I was still...they kept me\na little bit busy still and then I came to Frankfurt and final got to Israel, but while I was in\nFrankfurt I have a chance to apply for to come to the United States, and everybody said\nwhy not. Try it. What can you lose? So I applied, you know, for immigration to the\nUnited States, and I went to Israel. One day I had a telephone call...1f you want to go to\nsee the United States, now is the time to go. And I had a boyfriend in Israel, but he said\ngo, you know, so you'll come back in a couple of months. I mean such chances not\neverybody gets. So I came to the United States and I met George. And I didn't go back.\nAnd a year later we got married, you know, and George was a television repairman. I\nmean he had no education. He had sev...four years of elementary school in Poland when\nthe war started. He he was in the Army. They drafted him, and when, you know, when\n____ four years and we got married and we decided, you know, we had the choice of\nstaying in New York and doing what everybody else does...uh he wanted to go to school,\nso he said fine. He went __ to Syracuse. He used to...we lived in Rome, New York, and\nhe went to Syracuse University and I had my kids and we stayed over there for ten years.\nThey were good years. Hard but good and safe. And then he was, you know, invited to\ncome here by the Department of Defense and we came to Washington.",
