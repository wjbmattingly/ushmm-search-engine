How open were communities?\nHow much did people know about one another?\nA No, no non-Jewish friends.\nQ No non-Jewish friends.\nA It's not only that, the Jews lived in Lithuania, not like in Germany. In Germany,\na Jew was not a Jew. He was only believed in the religion of Moses. But mainly he was a\nGerman. Wherein Lithuania and Poland, no. Mostly in Lithuania. Lithuania is\nvery classic forit. It 1s a society -- a Jewish society which doesn't mingle with the\nunJews. I mean, when the children, of course, the grown-ups used to make business\nfriends. But I didn't have any non-Jewish friends. I had no Jewish friends when we\nwent to Palanga, not Kretinga, Palanga because there were no other Jews. We are the\nonly family, maybe another one.
