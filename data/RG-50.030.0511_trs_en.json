        "Answer: Good morning.",
        "Q: It\u2019s nice to be with you here in Delray Beach.",
        "A: Pleasure.",
        "Q: Kurt, when were you born?",
        "A: August 10\", 1922.",
        "Q: And what was your name then?",
        "A: Kurt Julich.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s the same name now?",
        "A: Same name.",
        "Q: Can you spell your last name?",
        "A: Julich.",
        "Q: And where were you born?",
        "A: In Cologne, Germany.",
        "Q: And I-let\u2019s talk a little bit about your -- your family and your brother. So tell me what did\nyour father do?",
        "A: My father had a business in Cologne, and --",
        "Q: You know what kind?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. At that time -- we\u2019re talking in the 30\u2019s, it was very fashionable that lady used\nto wear lacy jabot and things like that.",
        "Q: What is a lace jabot?",
        "A: It\u2019s those --",
        "Q: Jacket?",
        "A: -- those things there that, you know, puffy lace, you know?",
        "Q: Ah, ah, I see.",
        "A: And then also lace for decoration of various dresses, gowns, whatever. And also buttons in\nmother of pearl, and basically that\u2019s what it was. He had an office acro -- pretty much across the\nstreet in Cologne [indecipherable] where the eau de Cologne, which is called corniche eswassa,\nhave their offices. 4711 is the name of the cologne, which will be on every bottle, so his office\nwas across the street, you know? And a fairly large office with, of course, what you would call\nthe storage area for the product and whatnot. And few employees and a partner. So he was on the\nroad half of the time, selling, and then he switched with his partner and he stayed in the office\nand did the paperwork as it would be, and so on and so forth. And then of course when Hitler\ncame, and it was before Hitler was sworn in, he couldn\u2019t make -- he wasn\u2019t allowed to make a\nliving any more. You see, history has a way of being a little bit mistaken at times. He had to stop\nhis business 1n \u00b032, before Hitler was actually sworn in as the head man there, as it would be.",
        "Q: Why did he have to stop?",
        "A: Because Jews weren\u2019t allowed to have a business any more.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And so my grandfather, who lived a few -- you know, few miles out in a very lovely town\ncalled Siegburg. And he had the very large house there. And so my father, mother and my\nbrother and I, we went to live there. And I lived there until 1933, August 17\", when I left for\nFrance and I got some French tutoring lessons before I went there, but I had taken French in\nwhat you commonly call in Germany, gymnasium.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Which would be sort of like high school - college mixture because you can start with -- like\nyou don\u2019t even have to go to a public school, you can start and finish pretty much, you know and\ngraduate there. So I was in one of these and their main language was French. And obviously I\nhad the heads up for French, you know?",
        "Q: Right. Tell me something about what your father was like when you were growing up, before\n-- before you left and before you have to move from Cologne to your grandfather\u2019s and\ngrandmother\u2019s house.",
        "A: Well, he wa --",
        "Q: Were you close with your father?",
        "A: Oh yeah. He was -- he was really strict, but he was perfect, you know? No nonsense, but he\nloved us very much. And he was on the road the whole week and he came home Friday night,\nyou know, for religious purposes, I guess, you know. And Saturday and Sunday and that allowed\nhim to catch up on his accounting for what he did during the week, also. So I saw him Friday,\nSaturday and Sunday, Monday he was gone again. And actually, I would say -- how old was I?\nMaybe seven, eight -- six, seven, eight years old, I don\u2019t know for sure, he got sick and tired of\ntraveling with those big sample cases, so he hired -- he bought a car and he hired a chauffeur,\nbecause he was not very adept at driving. That wasn\u2019t his forte. At that time obvi -- obviously he\nhad to shift, so he had the chauffeur and in the morning it was very nice, the chauffeur took us\naround the block to the school. You know, I was in what you call grade school, you know, it was\nvery nice. And oh, of course, that ceased after a little while, as -- it\u2019s quite obvious.",
        "Q: What was your father\u2019s name, his first name?",
        "A: Leo.",
        "Q: Leo. And what about your mother? Your mother\u2019s name is what?",
        "A: Martha.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And what was she like?",
        "A: Perfect.",
        "Q: She was perfect.",
        "A: Angel. Wonderful. And she -- well, like I said, she was born in my grandfather\u2019s town, which\nwas like oh, let\u2019s say 10 miles away. It was a small town called Siegburg, which was very, very\npicturesque. I mean, without seeing a picture, you can\u2019t believe it, but -- and so my grandfather\nhad plenty of room there. She had three sisters who were, when I was born, maiden aunts, and I\nguess this is why I loved women, because I was always pampered, I was -- first of all, I was the\nfirst male grandchild around, so you know, it\u2019s -- left an impression on me, I had three lovely\naunts, you know?",
        "Q: And did your father have siblings, did your fa --",
        "A: Yeah. My father had one sister and two brothers.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: He happened to be a twin. My grandmother on my father\u2019s side had 12 children, of which\neight died. You know, it wasn't like nowadays, you know. Didn\u2019t have the medications to keep\nyou alive and what not. And so four -- four of them lived. His twin died, he survived. He had two\nbrothers, and one sister. And they lived little bit further away in a beautiful town in the\nmountains, in the Eyffel. It was called Munster Eyffel. Minster is sort of like an abbey, and then\nEyffel is the mountain, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And it was up in the mountains and it was a resort town for pulmonary problem people. And\nit was, I don\u2019t know, a thousand years old, and things [indecipherable] have pictures about all\nthis, which words don\u2019t describe everything properly, a picture is worth a thousand words --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- we -- we all know that, you know. So -- and so we went a few times here. We were much\ncloser to my mother\u2019s --",
        "Q: Mm-hm, family.",
        "A: -- family, obviously, it\u2019s always the way, you know. Children are closer to their mother than\nthey are to the father, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s normal, the father is on the road, he\u2019s working, and then of\ncourse, his family, his father was sort of like I don\u2019t know what, religious in the synagogue,\nsomething or something. And my sister married a Christian man, wonderful fellow who had a\nfurniture factory up in that particular place, refinishing antiques and all that, it was marvelous.\nHe had two children, a daughter and a son. The reason I say daughter first is because she was the\noldest, the son was second. And well, when we went -- went visiting once in awhile, he took us\nout early in the morning in the woods so we could see the deers. You know, and it was bu --\nbeautiful scenery, you know.",
        "Q: And who is this, one of your mother\u2019s sister, who married this guy?",
        "A: Beg pardon?",
        "Q: Who -- who are you talking about now? The --",
        "A: My -- my fa -- my father\u2019s sister.",
        "Q: Your father\u2019s sister?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I see. And what was your mother\u2019s name?",
        "A: Martha Koppel, K-o-p-p-e-l.",
        "Q: So did she -- did you have maids in the house, did she take care of you? You did have maids.\nSO you -- was --",
        "A: Well -- well -- ha -- ha -- haf -- th-things were going quite well, we had a sleep-in maid, so\nwhen my parents wanted to go out, the maid stayed with us --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you know, and things like that.",
        "Q: Was your mother a cook?",
        "A: Y-Yes, yes, as a matter of fact, when they left Germany and went to France, and after than\nwhen they came to the United States, she was a -- I wouldn\u2019t call it co -- you know, there\u2019s cooks\n-- cooks, and then there is chefs.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No, she was a gourmet chef.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Oh, the same way -- we are not talking about oh -- I wouldn\u2019t insult my wife by calling her a\ncook, she was a chef, because what she could do without fat, cooking and baking, was mind\nboggling.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Or let\u2019s say minimum of fat. My mother loved -- she made the most marvelous cakes and\nwhatnot, but if a quarter pound of butter 1s good, half a pound of butter is better.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And six eggs -- six eggs would just barely cut it. So obviously it had to be perfect.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Taste-wise.",
        "Q: Do you -- do you remember her food as a -- as a child?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: So she cooked a lot when you were a kid?",
        "A: Yes, yes, no, she -- she cooked. I mean, even when we had maids, I -- I di -- I was small when\nwe had maids, you know, and I don\u2019t remember at that time what she was doing. But later on, I\nmean, in -- in Germany, I remember later on when she was cooking, when we didn't have a maid\nany more. And then in France, of course, and then of course when they came to the United\nStates, mind boggl -- it\u2019s li -- France was very bad because starting in 1940 when the Germans\noverran France, until the end of the war, they plundered France with efficiency unparalleled in\nthe history. There wasn\u2019t a thing to be had for the French [indecipherable]. And then the French -\n- I came here in \u201948, in \u201948 I still haven\u2019t seen white bread in France. And it was still rationed,\nthere was nothing to eat.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I -- I wasn\u2019t exactly a heavyweight when I came over --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- you know [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Tell me about your youngest brother, Harry.",
        "A: Harry\u201d?",
        "Q: What was it like for you when he was born? Was this a great thing for you, or wou -- did you\nfeel invaded?",
        "A: I -- I loved my brother because he was my brother. On the other hand, he was not as\naffectionate as I was. I\u2019m a loving, touchy, feely type guy. He\u2019s not, you know? So everybody is\ndifferent, you know? And he is more of a scientif -- scientist, you know? When he came over\nhere, he went to college. He\u2019s a little younger, a year and a half, and he became a physicist, and\nwith a lot of degrees and things like that. And he thinks like a physicist.",
        "Q: What was he like when he was a kid, when -- when -- when you were growing up together?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: Before -- before France now, before --",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, I remember that. He used to be, shall we say, a shade abrasive, and he wasn\u2019t\nall that tall, so I used to have to fight his fights for him. I didn't want anybody beating up my\nlittle brother, hm? Not that he remembers that, but I do.",
        "Q: Was he more like your mother --",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "Q: -- or your father? Was he more like your father, you think?",
        "A: Not even.",
        "Q: Not even that. So he --",
        "A: Not even. He was -- he was his own person.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know. My mother was very loving, my father, in his own way was very loving, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: And warm. Of course I can\u2019t say anything that my brother isn\u2019t that way, but he doesn\u2019t sh --\nshow it --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- you know, physically.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So everybody\u2019s different.",
        "Q: Yes. Did you like school?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I went to school because I had to. I mean, it\u2019s as simple as all that. In Germany\nyou do what you\u2019re told.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: End of discussion.",
        "Q: But -- but di -- did you happen to like it? Or you don\u2019t even remember?",
        "A: Oh, I went to school because that\u2019s something you had to do. I have no likes for it. As a\nmatter of fact, when I was nine years old, my father send me to the local gymnasium, and you\nknow, they have uniforms there, the caps, the whole mcgilly, you know, everything. And what\nwas our language? I\u2019m nine years old, remember that. Latin. Well no, try as I might, there was\nno way wa -- that I was going to go cut -- cut it in Latin. So after six months my father took me\nout, put me in another one where the language was French like I mentioned before, so that was\npiece of cake.",
        "Q: Right. You were supposed to speak Latin? Or just read it?",
        "A: No, the whole thing --",
        "Q: You -- you\u2019re supposed to speak --",
        "A: -- the whole thing.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Not just reading, understanding, spelling and talking.",
        "Q: And did Harry go to that school?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Harry was a year and a half younger.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So henceforth, by that time -- you see, Hitler came into power and we went -- we had to leave\n-- you see, in Germany when I went to -- what do you call that, grammar school I would say?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, they didn\u2019t make a-any differentiation. There wasn\u2019t that much antici -- anti-Semitism\nin Germany in spite of what people will say. We went to school, school had catechism, so I sat in\nwith the Christian children and I got catechism. No big deal. I got my Jewish education after\nschool, you know? Several days a week we went and we had Jewish education in a different\nplace.",
        "Q: Were your parents religious in any way?",
        "A: Well yes, I mean, for the holidays yes, but when I went to my grandfather, very religious,\nFriday night synagogue, Saturday morning synagogue, Saturday afternoon or evening\nsynagogue, right? Of course holidays obviously. And I got so good in Hebrew that at the ripe old\nage of -- by 11 I left Germany, so I had to be 10, and I was living with them because I couldn\u2019t --\nwe weren\u2019t allowed in a Christian school any more, so we went to the Jewish school that the\nrabbi was running in my grandfather\u2019s town. I could conduct the service at 10 years old. There\nwas some kids my age that were actually better than me yet.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They rattled it off like machine gun. But the world has a way of changing, and we change\nwith it.",
        "Q: So you went to a Jewish school when you were 10, in 1932, not 1933? And that was because\nyou had to do that?",
        "A: Jew -- Jewish children were not allowed to go to a regular school with Christian children.",
        "Q: In 1932?",
        "A: \u00b032.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I mean, I don\u2019t know whatever the date is, April of \u201933 Hitler came to power, whatnot. Yeah,\nbut that was just on paper. He owned the place from 1930 or \u201931 on.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: His goons were running everything. And believe me, the terror that they initiated in the\npopulation -- we\u2019re talking Jews, you -- you have to live through it to understand the total feeling\nof terror, with the brownshirts, which was called the SA, sturm abteilung. Forget the SS, the SS\nis something totally different. And they were marching, had parades every Sunday, flags. Of\ncourse, you locked up your place and what not, and hoped that nothing bad would happen. But it\nwas frightening, I\u2019m telling you.",
        "Q: So you were very frightened as a child?",
        "A: Well, as a child you take everything in stride. The one thing that the Germans were fabulous\non, they created those what you would call Hitler type songs with the very marshall type music,\nand that appeals to the masses. You -- you have [indecipherable] every country has their own\ntype of marshall music. The Germans are the best. The French are not bad. The United States is\nso-so, because we\u2019re not really all that marshall. You know, we have a few songs. The Marines,\nyou know. A-And -- and -- and [indecipherable] the Navy, Air Force, but it\u2019s not really -- but the\nGermans, I mean, they have th -- a song for every occasion, or a march. And I\u2019m telling you,\nthere was one song I remember, and it\u2019s [speaks German here]. Translation - when blood -- when\nthe Jewish blood spurts from the knife, then things will be twice as good. So that\u2019s was a -- wa --\none of the lyrics in the songs. I don\u2019t know where people know these things. These are minor\ndetails.",
        "Q: Do you remember hearing that song as a kid?",
        "A: Of course. How -- why -- why would I remember it to this day?",
        "Q: And who -- who sang it -- when -- do you remember when you heard it?",
        "A: The -- the SA troops marching in the streets.",
        "Q: And they sang?",
        "A: And on the radio, and wherever you went that -- and they had more, you know, that\u2019s just\none, that\u2019s the most bloody of them. Hate the Juden [speaks German]. I mean, hang the Jews, kill\nthe bosses, or something like that, I mean like that\u2019s the most marvelous songs. I mean horrible,\nhorrifying. If you were a Jew, and you understood this, the terror was unbelievable. And it didn\u2019t\nmatter, because he appealed -- first of all, the mistake was made in the tret -- Treaty of\nVersailles, where they made Germany pay unbelievable reparations that they couldn\u2019t handle,\nand Germany was really in a bad way. So, lot of people out of work and things like that, people\nwound up in prison, Hitler saw his chance. He took the worst elements out of prison, the people\nout of work, hung a beautiful uniform on them, nice jack boots, nice cap. [indecipherable] and\neverything, had them marching. Tried to get them job, oh, whatever you take away from the\nJews, you know, all right? So, th-th-these weren\u2019t the nicest people in the world that were\nenrolled in those troops, I can\u2019t call them strup -- storm troops, even though it says sturm\nabteilung, right? Sturm means storm, you know, but that\u2019s not the -- the SS is like I said,\nsomething totally apart. But they weren\u2019t nice people. The head man was Mr. Worm, and he was\nalso a very disreputable character, you know, out of prison, and all kinds of quirks shall we say.\nSo, it was horrible.",
        "Q: Did it surprise you that there was so much anti-Semitism? You say you didn\u2019t grow up with a\nlot of anti-Semitism.",
        "A: No. Was --",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t sur -- it didn\u2019t surprise you?",
        "A: You see my father, the last free election, he volunteered for the election board.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: You know, because there was other people running than Hitler. And already at that time it\nwas a losing proposition because Hitler promised all kinds of things to the masses, which he\nactually implemented eventually, which the other people didn\u2019t have the nerve to come up with\nthings like that. So, you know, that\u2019s why I say, hit -- Hitler ran the show way before he was\nelected.",
        "Q: But let me ask you something, Kurt, you\u2019re a child.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You\u2019re 10 years old in 1932.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So there\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know, or necessarily understand.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: What\u2019s -- what\u2019s happening between you and your friends? Do your Christian friends stop\nbeing friends with you? Do you live in a neighborhood where it\u2019s mixed? What\u2019s -- what goes on\nwith you as a child?",
        "A: Well, when I went to my -- wh-when I couldn\u2019t go to Christian school any more, regular\nschool, and my next door neighbor, I used to be friends with the boy, he was a little bit older than\nme. I don\u2019t know whether he stopped being friends with me, I\u2019m -- I really don\u2019t know for sure.\nBut then I associated with all the children that went to the Jewish school that were in my grade,\nboys and girls, and things like that. So I did not associate with Christian children any more.",
        "Q: So no one said something to you? No -- no -- somebody was [indecipherable]",
        "A: No remarks were made, no.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Right. Now, when was the decision made, and were you involved in a discussion about -- you\nwere leaving to go to France? You were just told you were going to go? Did you not want to do\nit, or did you think that this was exciting?",
        "A: Remember, in Germany you do what you\u2019re told, okay? As much as you\u2019re being loved, you\nfeel that that is the right thing, if your parents -- if your parents, your father, your mother tell\nyou, look, you\u2019re going to France to Uncle Pierre and Aunt Emma, you know, because things\nhere -- well, I realized how f -- how bad things were. So my father was smart enough, the oldest\nson, he got se -- out of Germany first. It was on my 11\" birthday, basically. And I got on the\nrailroad, on -- my aunt must have picked me up in Paris and we lived in Rennes at the time.",
        "Q: So this is August of 1933?",
        "A: Yeah, August 17\", 1933, I left Germany.",
        "Q: So that --",
        "A: Was a week after my 11\" birthday. And then I went to live with my aunt and uncle. My -- my\nuncle was a French career officer.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He was a doctor, right? And he met my Aunt Emma during the occupation of first -- of the\nfirst World War. After the first World War, he was sent -- French troops were occupying the\nRhineland with the British. And he met my aunt in Germany, in her hometown, and they hit it off\nsomehow. And then of course, an officer 1s called to duty wherever it\u2019s called, so then he went to\nthe Middle East, and he went to the bak -- Balkans, and things like that. So they got married in\n1930 in our -- in our apartment in Cologne, they have a very large house. I mean house, a very\nlarge apartment.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Actually, we had -- which was totally unheard of at the time, we had a bathroom like in the\nUnited States where the bath and the toilet and the sinks, everything is in one, and then we had a\nseparate toilet. And we had two entrances, one for the servers and one for the regular people. So\nit was quite large, and I remember the wedding quite well. And they got married by us, you\nknow, was [indecipherable] his family couldn\u2019t be there, was in Germany, his fra -- fa -- parents,\nhis brother lived in France. So anyway, so they got married there, this I remember, henceforth --\nand then she left with him to live wherever he was stationed, which was Rennes. And that\u2019s\nwhere I went.",
        "Q: Okay, we have to stop the tape and change it.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Kurt, so you knew your aunt and uncle when you -- before you went to see them?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Were they older than your mother and father, much older, or --",
        "A: My aunt was two to four years older than my mother. I think two years, maybe.",
        "Q: But na -- so there wasn\u2019t a big difference?",
        "A: No, no. She -- there -- she -- she looked pretty much -- they looked pretty much alike, my\naunt -- the one that I went to, and my mother. And -- and my uncle was born in \u201989, so by that\ntime it -- no -- yeah, \u201989 -- \u201989, it was \u201933, so what was he? 11 and 33 is 44 years old.",
        "Q: Right, so he was a bit older. They didn\u2019t have children?",
        "A: No, obviously that --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- helped a lot. And he was like a second father to me, he was wonderful.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: He just -- they took me to their heart. Now, my aunt of course, that\u2019s family. But he a\nstranger. That\u2019s very -- the most wonderful man I ever met.",
        "Q: So he touched you a lot. He [indecipherable] you.",
        "A: Oh [indecipherable] fantastic.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Fantastic, I mean, you know. And I lived with them for five years.",
        "Q: Right. That\u2019s a long time.",
        "A: Passed by very quickly.",
        "Q: Right. But it was good for you there?",
        "A: Oh, fantastic.",
        "Q: And you went to school?",
        "A: Yeah, there I went through what they call in France this -- are we taping?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: In France they call it lyc\u00e9e, in Germany it\u2019s gymnasium.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Okay? So they put me in this sixth degree. You come s -- like I say again, you start like in\ngrammar school, and you wind up, you know, with your baccalaureate.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So they put me back one year due to the language, but within three months I rattled off\nFrench, with the proper accent and things like that. Well, I was only 11, so you catch on real\nquick. And as a matter of fact, even if I didn\u2019t understand everything, I remember one day -- the\neducation is a little different in France than it is here. It\u2019s mainly the arts and history and such,\nnot how to make a dollar. Over here it\u2019s much more sensible. They teach you economics and\nthings like that. In France, no. Ancient history and things like that. Some poetry. So I remember\nAesop\u2019s Fables, they were all translated into French 1n a big book by Mr. LaFountaine and they\nwere pretty strict in school, so we have to learn a fable per session, whatever it was. So I rehearse\nwith my uncle. So I rattled off that whole fable, perfect intonation, stop, go, whatever. My en --\nmy uncle looked at me and he said, do you know what you say? I says no. It was so perfect, but I\ndidn't know what I -- what I really was saying, you know? The thi -- that\u2019s when you\u2019re a child,\nyou mimic anything, and I did fantastic. Of course, later on I have to [indecipherable] same thing\nwith mathematics. They used to throw numbers at you, multipliclati -- multiplication, addition,\nsubstraction, a teacher went like this, like that, picked you and you better be on the ball. There\nwas no missing. That\u2019s how come you didn\u2019t need a calculator at the time. You know what I\u2019m\nsaying?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You really knew how to calculate in your head. That -- these are the things that were\nimportant there.",
        "Q: Now your parents and brother came to Paris in 1934, a year after you?",
        "A: After me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But it took that long for my father to get all the permits, and to -- he was still able at the time\nto take all the furniture and everything that they had out of Germany, plus his money.",
        "Q: Still he could take his money?",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t know how he did that, that was a serious piece of change. And then he went to\nParis, but of course, the French had accepted a lot of German Jewish refugees, also Polish for\nthat matter. And -- but the only thing, there were restrictions. You could not start a job in a\nfactory or anything like that. You had to start a business as it would be. So my father opened up a\nmeat cutting -- meat packing business, you know?",
        "Q: That\u2019s very different from what he was doing in Germany, yeah?",
        "A: Absolutely. The thing was, some of my mother\u2019s relative\u2019s children, they were butchers. So\nhe had two or three of them that did the work. My father was a businessman, he knew how to run\na business, and he\u2019s the one with the money, so he bought or rented the building, he bought the\ntrucks, he bought the machinery and he did the advertising. So it was hard -- you got to\nunderstand, France is a very culinary country. So to break in to the -- like what they call\n[indecipherable] which is the wurst, sausage business and ja -- ham and things like that, it\u2019s not\nthe easiest, so you have to really make a good product. But the Germans are fabulous when it\ncomes to sausages and such. So the boys were good, they made inroads, slowly. The only thing\nwrong about the whole situation was there were young boys. In the early 30\u2019s in France, \u00b034 -\n\u00b035 - \u00b036, everybody flocked to Paris. Americans, everybody, British, they loved it.\n[indecipherable]. So the boys discovered the races, they discovered the women, and they\ndiscovered gambling. Now, they were drawing a fairly decent salary, but that wasn\u2019t enough for\nthe lifestyle. So what they did, unbeknownst to my father, obviously, they looked at the delivery\nschedule for the -- today. So they filled the truck with all the stuff, and before the regular\ndelivery boys could start, they went to the customers and sold the stuff at a little discount. So\nwhen the regular discount -- ah, the regular driver came along, sorry, you delivered this morning.\nSo before my father found out, it was a little late. The business was shut there. So who was stuck\nwith everything? My father had to pay off the machinery, had to pay off the trucks, have to pay\noff everything. So whatever money you have goes down the sewer. And the guys, couple of\nthem, disappeared to the hospitality of countries such as Argentina. You know, a lot of these\ncountries have been populated by people that weren't totally clean in their native country, okay?",
        "Q: But this -- these were relatives?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Not these boys?",
        "A: Only one of them was sort of like a relative.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And he had nerve, what they call in Jewish chutzpah, unbelievable. He had his -- he had the\nnerve to come and had his clothes in my parent\u2019s apartment and he used to come and visit\noccasionally, and my father wanted to kill him. And he would have been able to do it, physically.\nSo my mother says, no [indecipherable]. So that\u2019s how come he survived. Now I jump a little bit\nforward. The war is over, the guy is alive, he went back to Paris -- he was hiding in the south of\nFrance, he was -- went back to Paris, opened up the same business, and he had the nerve to use\nmy father\u2019s trade name for his own business. But being that nobody was cheating him, he went\nto be very, very successful. I met him after the war, also.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Did you -- when your -- your s -- you\u2019re still living with your aunt and uncle for --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- for five years. You don\u2019t go back to your parents until 1938.",
        "A: Ah, well --",
        "Q: But you s -- but you see them?",
        "A: -- we visited, she -- my mother came, and -- or I visited Paris, I mean.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: As a matter of fact, I remember I was a young kid, I was 11 - 12 years old, and my father -- I\ntell you, Paris was unbelievable, he used to take me to nightclubs where the White Russians, who\nfled the revolutions were dancing, the Cossacks and things like that, and the -- in France, it\u2019s\nokay. Children 11 - 12 years old, it\u2019s not a problem. So I went to all these places, you know?\nThat\u2019s when my father still was in business, you know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then after the thing went, shall we say south, I have to use euphemisms, he had a\nmagnificent apartment in Paris. I think it was -- I -- I don\u2019t remember the exact name, it doesn\u2019t\nmatter. Fantastic, maybe seven rooms and things. Concierge, elevators, the whole bit. Couldn\u2019t\ncarry that one any more.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we had to entrench somewhat. Not that it was bad, we still had a concierge, and instead of\nseven rooms, we had now five rooms of -- you know, and things like that. So it wasn\u2019t really all\nthat bad, but then my father had to back to it -- to this -- his original business in Paris, you know.",
        "Q: But he still made enough money so that you didn\u2019t have to live in a terrible circumstance, 1s\nthat right?",
        "A: Oh, no [indecipherable]. Things were pretty decent. My father worked very hard, and my\nmother took a little job.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: You know, as a nanny to chi -- to -- to a child, you know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Very nice people. Jewish, of course. And so they made ends meet. And ma -- my mother,\nfood-wise, was easy to get along with. If you give her a pound of chocolate today, that\u2019s all she\nneeded. Skinny like that.",
        "Q: Yes. Right.",
        "A: It\u2019s genes. But sh-she knew si -- how to cook. I used to know how to cook, too. I remember\nwhen I went to Paris after, in 1937 to live with them, and my mother was working, my father was\nhome, or came home. My brother was there. I used to make French fries. In French they have\nthese special things, you know, like a container with a screen and the oil --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- and it bub -- and you know exactly when to throw the French fries -- the potatoes in, when\nthey pop up to the surface, I remember, I -- I wasn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t exactly a -- you know\n[indecipherable] as it would be, so I --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- you know. So I -- and later on, as a matter of fact, I was but -- I went to school in Paris, and\nI used to iron. I was the -- I must have been a big 15 at the time, I used to iron my -- when my\nfather came home, you know, we had this -- these two big suitcases where all the samples were\nin.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I used to refresh the -- like I say, the jabot, the lace creations, and I used to iron them. 15\nyears old. Think about that. Amaze.",
        "Q: That\u2019s pretty complicated.",
        "A: So that\u2019s -- I\u2019m telling you, I -- I was quite talented.",
        "Q: Right. When you moved back -- when -- when you moved back to your parent\u2019s place --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- rather than visiting, did your brother stay there, or did he go now to the aunt and uncles?",
        "A: N-No, he -- he switched over, he went --",
        "Q: He switched over.",
        "A: -- he went with my aunt and uncle. Well, it\u2019s good for them to have a child, you know.",
        "Q: Child, right, right.",
        "A: Of course you --",
        "Q: Was it easier for your parents also not to have two of you at home?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, well listen, he wasn\u2019t making the money he was used to.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, and my mother had to, you know, have a little job, so it was easier for them. Of\ncourse I think they -- they sent some money, minimal amounts, even while I was there, to my\naunt and uncle --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- you know, so that it wasn\u2019t total charity case, you know what I\u2019m saying.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea how much your parents missed having the two of you in the house?\nCause it\u2019s very different to have one child, rather than the two together.",
        "A: No, no, no, it\u2019s totally different, it\u2019s totally different. I mean, my parents went through so\nmuch that they were very staunch and strong people of character. What is needed, has to be done.\nIt\u2019s no beating your breast and -- and -- and -- and -- and running to the shrink or anything like\nthat, uh-uh. They were far stronger than that, you know?",
        "Q: What -- you\u2019re now a-at an age, by 1935, you\u2019re not a child any more. You\u2019re now --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- 13 years old.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you get Bar Mitzvahed, by the way?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: In France?",
        "A: Oh that -- that -- that\u2019s the most amazing thing. I got Bar Mitvahs -- Bar Mitzvahed in\nGermany, my father\u2019s hometown, with the rabbi.",
        "Q: How [indecipherable]",
        "A: We went back -- we went back to Germany, 1935.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Honest. We managed. Just things are -- you -- you were still abe -- my aunt, my youngest aunt\nwas still living in Germany. So was my oldest aunt, okay? And my grandfather still had his\nhouse. My aunt sort of like hat -- she had haberdashery, beautiful, you know my -- see, when -- it\nwas customary when your daughters get married, to give them a dowry. Now, three of them were\nmarried. My youngest one -- aunt, was not. So instead of a dowry, he bought her a haberdashery.\nReally fine stuff. Really. And it was in the house, the bottom. Two show windows, central\nentrance, you know, the whole bit. She had decorators come and do the windows and whatnot.\nAnd I remember playing in there when I was a kid, I used to love it, you know, I -- on the\nholidays, you know, Christian holidays, people used to shop for shirts, hats, [indecipherable],\nties. I used to lo -- pla -- love to play with the ties. I used to know how to present a tie, you know,\nwith the knot and things like that. I was a kid, and the people loved to see me around there.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So that part was okay. And so I went back, and of course I had to learn my Bar Mitzvah\nreading. I had at least a whole month to learn everything, not a year or two. And I went to the\nrabbi every day in the afternoon, when he had time.",
        "Q: So you were in Germany for a month in 1935, or did you do this in --",
        "A: Yeah. No, no, no, that was in Germany.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We went to Germany a month before so that I could get the teaching to read the Torah. Which\nI had only one month, I mean, I tell you, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not stupid now, but I was pretty\nbright as a young man, or child, you know.",
        "Q: Now your mother stayed in France.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: She came too?",
        "A: My mother went with me, sure.",
        "Q: I see. So what was that like to be in Germany three years after hit -- or two years after Hitler\ntakes over. Is it -- was it terrible?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t hang out too much. I went from my grandfather\u2019s place\nto the rabbi\u2019s place and back. And the synagogue was still standing and there was the Jewish\nschool where we eventually went because there was a Jewish center, a magnificent gothic\ncathedral, I mean like -- a -- a synagogue, excuse me. I mean, whoa, fantastic. Of course it was\nConservative with the mab -- women upstairs and the men downstairs, a separation, you know,\nwith the pulpit, this, that, what, the Torah, it was magnificent. Oak -- oak things there for\neverybody who -- who bought a -- a seat there, you know, like put your stuff in, your tallis, your\n-- your -- your tefillis, you know, the whole thing. And the [indecipherable] it was beautiful. And\nthen there was the Jewish center next door, and the bottom floor was the Jewish school where the\nrabbi taught the various grades of Jewish children, from the community, you know? I mean, it\nwasn\u2019t a hundred children, you know what I\u2019m saying, but they were -- ranged in age, let\u2019s say,\nfrom -- from I -- argument-wise, from let\u2019s say seven to 14 -15 maybe? I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. You said earlier that your father had to give up his business 1n\nGermany --",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: -- because Jews had to not have businesses. But you go back in 1935 and your aunt has a\nhaberdashery and she\u2019s Jewish. So how is that?",
        "A: I -- this I can\u2019t figure. I don\u2019t know whether she\u2019s -- I think she was still in business. It was\ndifferent. My father had a different kind of business, I think. And they had signs -- I don\u2019t even\nthink that they had signs on the stores that said Juden, meaning Jews. You know, you were s --\nnot supposed to buy there. Of course, the business must have fallen off drastically. But there\nwere some people that weren't so diehard, you know what I\u2019m saying? In a small town\neverybody knows each other. It\u2019s different than in the big city. You know?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So henceforth -- the house was still -- my grandfather was still in the house. My grandmother\nhad died in 19 -- no, I don\u2019t know when she died. I want to say in -- I wa -- I think I was in Paris\nwhen my grandmother died. And then my grandfather died later, around \u201939, and my aunt stayed\nwith him, the single one, because she couldn\u2019t abandon him, it -- she felt obligated.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And then she managed, at the last minute, to get shipped to England. Of course, whatever she\nhad, went. I mean, she couldn't take a nickel along.",
        "Q: But she survived.",
        "A: The store, the house, they took everything.",
        "Q: Right. But she survived.",
        "A: But sh-she managed to go -- to get to England.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: From there, eventually she -- during the war actually, she transferred from England to the\nUnited States.",
        "Q: Now, are you hearing about things that are going on in Germany? I mean, you\u2019re there for a\nmonth, and you say pretty much you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. When you go back to France,\nare -- are you reading the papers as a 13 - 14 year old kid, or you\u2019re not?",
        "A: Yeah, sort of. You -- a-and then you hear on the radio, when we -- the one thing I remember\nwas [indecipherable] Olympics, you know, with Jesse Owens.",
        "Q: In \u00b036?",
        "A: \u00b036.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And Hitler occupying the Rhineland. And we thought for sure they gonna cut him off at the\npass.",
        "Q: Who was going to cut him off?",
        "A: The French, they had the --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- they had the biggest army in the world. Two million people [indecipherable] arms. All they\nhad to do is move. They moved out of the Rhineland, they weren't supposed to occupy the\nRhineland, Hitler moved into the Rhine -- this I remember, and my uncle, who was a military\nman, couldn\u2019t understand that the politicians screw everything up, you know. Why they didn\u2019t\nmove? Go figure.",
        "Q: So what did -- what did you all -- what were people talking about? Were you talking with\nadults or were you talking with kids about what -- what\u2019s Germany going to do? Once they go\ninto the Rhineland, do you now think they\u2019re going to go someplace else, you think they\u2019re going\nto stop?",
        "A: No. No, no, no, no, that -- it was a shock, as it would be --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- already.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So you know, you get shocked often enough, it doesn\u2019t shock you any more.",
        "Q: Right. So does going into Austria shock you? The Germans.",
        "A: No, no, that --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- that was anschluss.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They\u2019re German speaking people and they did [indecipherable] Austria and then a little bit\ntricky was Czechoslovak -- I think, was Czechoslovakia in 1938?",
        "Q: It\u2019s before. It\u2019s before the anschluss.",
        "A: 1938?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And that was a bad one. And so by that time, he was getting stronger and stronger and\nstronger. He had Austria on his side, he owned all of Germany, now he had Czechoslovakia, hey,\nhey, hey, hey, we\u2019re becoming a big power. And everybody loves it, nobody does anything to\nhim. So Hitler gotta be the right man, right? If you\u2019re German.",
        "Q: Were you afraid?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Because you didn\u2019t think he was going to come west? You didn\u2019t think --",
        "A: Not with a two million dollar army. The -- the -- there was a big fallacy. Again, the Maginot\nLine was the most beautiful military construction ever conceived. Everything was underground,\nwhole towns and whatnot, with elevators, [indecipherable] blah, blah, blah. What was wrong\nwith the Maginot Line? It was supposed to go from the Swiss border to the ocean. So when they\nhit Belgium, the Belgian got bent out of shape. How can you do this to us? I mean, I don\u2019t invent\nthis, this is fact. How can you do this to us? We fought for you in World War I, and we will fight\nfor you if World War II should happen. Belgium is gonna be -- is gonna be a big problem for the\nPanzer divisions? I don\u2019t think so. So the Germans left the -- the Maginot Line where it was, and\ncame right through Germany like an open gate. You see? So what do you do? And th -- from that\nmoment on things got real bad.",
        "Q: Where y -- Harry stays with your aunt and uncle until when? He -- you come in 1938 to your\nparents -- or \u00b037?",
        "A: No, no, to my parents [indecipherable |",
        "Q: You come to \u00b037.",
        "A: 1937, right.",
        "Q: Right, and he goes to your aunt and uncle.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay. Now, does he return in \u201938 - \u201939, or what?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: He does.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Before the Germans take over France?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, \u201939 the Germans -- you see, from the declaration of war o -- by France and\nEngland was on September -- the ulttmatum was acember -- December the third. That\u2019s *39,\nthat\u2019s when the war was supposed to start in earnest, but nobody was shooting at anybody. The\nFrench mal -- French mobilized, the Germans obviously were mobilized, and they called it the\nfunny war because nobody did anything. The Germans were behind the Siegfried Line, the\nFrench behind the Maginot Line. They figure ah, you know. Figure that goes on forever now.\nThe British sent over Hindu troops to France. I remember, I was there. You know the ones with\nthe turban? The Sikhs, you know and all that? And the French had the colonial troops and\nwhatnot, and -- but didn\u2019t cut the mustard. Once the Germans started rolling, that was it.",
        "Q: What did you think in 1939 when they attacked Poland?",
        "A: I didn't think",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t think.",
        "Q: I mean, I remember exactly when they walked into Poland. Across the street from where we\nwere living, which was very large central area where all the avenues converged towards this\narea, and there was a beautiful park up there, and my boss and I, we were, you know, we went\nthrough the park, you know, we sat around and you know, and a guy comes by after lunch, and\nhe\u2019s all bent out of shape, and I said to him -- so he said, the Germans just invaded Poland. Then\nwe ran home, we knew that -- that wasn\u2019t good, you know?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And that\u2019s when we hung up -- hu-hung on to the radio to hear the ultimatum, you know, in\nlater afternoon that either you get out of Poland, or we going to start fighting you.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. We have to s -- change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: Okay. All right, so now you hear that the Germans have attacked Poland. Is this the start of\nWorld War II in your brain? This is it. Do you begin to hear about ghettos being formed 1n ger --\nin Poland? Nothing? No.",
        "A: The following morning at five o\u2019clock, my father put my brother and me on the train to\nBrittany, out of Paris because everybody thought the Germans were going to bomb Paris, which\nthey never did, obviously. And what was in Brittany, my aunt, while my uncle, being a soldier,\nwas on the front. She was alone, so she took a vacation in Brittany on the coast, and rented a --\nthe bottom floor of a house. So my father called her, she was, send them over, so we went there,\nand stayed in Brittany for a f-few months, you know? It was still -- the weather was still nice.",
        "Q: And your mother and father remain in Paris?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And when do you meet up again? After the Germans come in and occupy France?",
        "A: Yeah. I -- the first time I saw my parents was on April 12\", 1941.",
        "Q: 1941? That means after you have been in at least one camp?",
        "A: Oh yeah --",
        "Q: Or two --",
        "A: -- ha -- ha -- at least three camps.",
        "Q: -- si -- at -- at least three camps. So from Brittany, after that, and your brother doesn\u2019t see\nparents either?",
        "A: My brother went back to live with my parents.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: But he was younger than me, see, it\u2019s a matter of age, see?",
        "Q: All right, so in \u201939, you\u2019re sent -- both of you were sent to Brittany. Within a few months he\ngoes back to Paris and you stay in Brittany? Okay.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: I went to Le Mans. My aunt --",
        "Q: Another aunt?",
        "A: No, the same aunt.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That had rented the house in Brittany.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Rented now a house in Le Mans. You know Le Mans? Car races 24 hours.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Also beautiful town. There\u2019s so many nice towns in France, I'll tell you. Anyway, and -- so\nfor a little while, I used to hang around as the word goes, I didn\u2019t do anything.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So eventually they had to put me back into school, around -- before Christmas, \u201939. My uncle,\nof course, was on the front and I was keeping my aunt company.",
        "Q: Now this is the original aunt?",
        "A: Yeah, from -- from -- from France.",
        "Q: From -- from [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, so that we --",
        "Q: You [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- don\u2019t change aunts --",
        "Q: Okay, this is the same person?",
        "A: -- this -- this -- always the same aunt.",
        "Q: Okay. And you\u2019re now 15 years old?",
        "A: No, no --",
        "Q: You're 16 --",
        "A: -- Tm 17.",
        "Q: -- 17. Okay, so you\u2019re an old guy already.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, okay, so you\u2019re 17.",
        "A: SO --",
        "Q: So you\u2019re with Emma?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Now, being that I went to school in Le Mans previous, before I went to Paris, right? From \u00b035\nwhen we left Rennes, we went to Le Mans until \u201937 --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- when my uncle got transferred from Le Mans to Veldun.",
        "Q: Okay, so now you\u2019re back.",
        "A: Then -- now I\u2019m back and I had two real good friends who we went to school together, we\nwere inseparable, right? So I used to meet them every evening, you know. One of them worked\nfor a newspaper. The other one decided to become a salesman in a very high fashion female or\nladies\u2019 shoe store.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He was handsome, bi -- was tall, very handsome guy. He just was in the right business, if you\nknow what I mean. And so we met every evening after they were finished working. We had a\ngay old time, I mean, the th -- the three of us together like nothing happened.",
        "Q: In spite of the fact that your country is occupied?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s not occupied yet.",
        "Q: No, this 1 -- this is \u201939, this is not occupied yet.",
        "A: Thirt -- no, no, si -- the Germans started running through the [indecipherable] countries in\nMay 1940.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they hit France big time in -- you know, I\u2019m not dead on the dates, but I would say\naround June 20\" or so, the French signed the armistice. By that time the Germans had rolled up\nwhatever was left of the French army, horse and buggy types. You know what I\u2019m saying?",
        "Q: But before that, so you\u2019re with your three friends having a -- a good old time?",
        "A: They -- they -- they nailed me when the Germans started invading [indecipherable] countries\nin 1940, in May -- May 20-something or other. Towards the end of May, I think. And they\nrounded up everybody of German origin. Now, I was a German origin.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Jewish didn\u2019t come into consideration. They didn\u2019t know. You know what I mean?",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: The French don\u2019t make you wear a star. That\u2019s Germans, you know. So --",
        "Q: Did anybody ask you if you were Jewish?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It\u2019s not on the record anywhere?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. Okay.",
        "A: You were ec -- you\u2019re in France, you speak French like a Frenchman, you act like a\nFrenchman, you expected to be Catholic in a 99 percent Catholic country. Very simple. You\nknow what I\u2019m saying? So, they rounded us up, together with what I would call the real\nGermans, Aryans that were caught. It\u2019s called the fifth column. You heard about the fifth column\nin the Spanish civil war, where they put civilians to infiltrate a place, and then they take over the\nplace. You know, so they had the same thing in France and the French actually did make German\nprisoners.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they happened to be -- we happened to be concentrated, or quartered in a military base in\nLe Mans. So we -- there we are, the Germans in the German uniform. The German Nazi type\ncivilians, plus a whole bunch of Jews, too. So we\u2019re all together. I mean, the masses --",
        "Q: This is --",
        "A: -- soon found out we were Jewish, but the soldiers weren\u2019t up -- you see, there\u2019s a big\ndifference between the Nazis and the German army. The German army isn\u2019t as bad as the Nazis.",
        "Q: But how did they find out you\u2019re Jewish?",
        "A: Listen, nothing stays secret for long, okay?",
        "Q: Yeah, but who is te -- do you know how they find out?",
        "A: Who knows? I have no idea. I don\u2019t even know. I -- I assume they found out we were Jewish.",
        "Q: So at first you\u2019re taken because you\u2019re from Germany\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So -- so the German refugees into France --",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: -- get taken?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: My assumption is that most of these German refugees are Jewish --",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: -- because why are they leaving Germany\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So maybe that\u2019s the assumption.",
        "A: Who knows? It\u2019s hard to tell. The German soldiers in German uniform, there were a lot of\nflyboys there, in German uniform, they were hanging out by themselves, with possibly the fifth\ncolumn types, and the Jews were hanging out with themselves. They were all going to associate\nwith shall we call it the enemy, right? So obviously there must have been a shift, or a sh-schism,\nwhatever you call it. And --",
        "Q: And where do they put you in Le Mans?",
        "A: Well, I told you, we were s-stationed in a military base. The place was okay, we have beds\nand things like that, or cots.",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t like a prison?",
        "A: No, no, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a military camp. And then what happened, across the street there was the\nBritish military camp, and you know, [indecipherable] had a lot of British soldiers in France, you\nknow. And of course, we didn\u2019t know that. So one night, they told us to get up, pack our things\nand marched us out. That\u2019s how come we found out a little bit up the road was the British camp.\nBut the British were -- might have been gone by that time. And they marched us, and we were\nbasically running away from the oncoming German army, surrounded by French soldiers. You\nknow, and there was a lot of people [indecipherable] like the Germans, and the German Jews,\nand everybody. It was a column of people walking. How many? Don\u2019t ask me. Hundreds, maybe\nmore, 200, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: But you\u2019re surrounded by French?",
        "A: Surrounded by French soldiers.",
        "Q: Cause it\u2019s the French [indecipherable]. Okay. Kurt, I\u2019m sorry, there was a bit of a technical\ndifficulty. So where we stopped was, you began to speak about, you were marched out of the\ncamp and you were surrounded by French soldiers.",
        "A: French soldiers, yeah.",
        "Q: And so, repeat what happens then.",
        "A: Well, then we\u2019re walking down one of the main roads, and we\u2019re not alone, the French were\nrunning away, too, and the French army was running the same way with horse, carriages, and\nthings like that, dragging maybe some cannons or something, I don\u2019t know for sure. And all of a\nsudden, aft -- I -- I\u2019m talking this been going on, it\u2019s very hard walking, but few hours, you\nknow, later, it\u2019s now daytime, we started at night. All of a sudden we get a visit from German\nfighter planes that come over and they start strafing us, you know, with bullets and things like\nthat. And well, we scattered sideways and whatnot, and then when they\u2019re gone, we start all over\nagain. Keep on marching, and then every once in a blue moon, we have a rest, you know, by the\nside of the road, you collapse on the grass over there for, you know. And didn\u2019t have really much\nfood, or anything. I had the -- I had two suitcases, my aunt took good care of me. Two large\nsuitcases, one with food, one with clothing. Well, that lasted about a mile or two, because 30 - 40\npounds on each side, I -- I couldn\u2019t walk like that for long. So I took a few things out of there, a\ncouple of cans of food, took a pajama, turned it, tied a knot, inside out, put it over my shoulder.\nAnd I put that in front of a house we were passing by around midnight or two in the morning, I\ndon\u2019t know, that was -- that was the end of my possessions.",
        "Q: There are a lot of people leaving the north, right? Lot of people from --",
        "A: Ev-Every -- everybody was running away because they knew the Germans were coming and\nthey were getting away from the Germans.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Now, the most amazing thing of it all, it was like the stranger than fiction. All of a sudden I\nhear my name being called, and I turned around. And who the heck is on the main drag, we were\non the side? My aunt, my brother, my friend and his parents, they were all leaving at the same\ntime. I meet them in the middle of nowhere, 12 hours after we left the camp. Do you believe\nthat? Of course, I didn\u2019t have much of a chance to say hello and hug them --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- whatnot because the Germans, the French soldier says, that-a-way fellow, none of this.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, they were afraid I was going to get lost in the masses.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, but that\u2019s the most amazing thing that -- think about it, the odds. There\u2019s hundreds of\nthousands of people and all of a sudden I\u2019m at the same heights as my -- my aunt, my brother\nand my friends from the --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- they were -- they were leaving together, you know?",
        "Q: So they were also going?",
        "A: Yeah, they were going south, yeah.",
        "Q: Were they -- were they walking, or they had a car? Do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: Tell you the truth, I really don\u2019t know what. I don\u2019t think they have a car. Well, they -- they\nmust have had something, you know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Because they mo-moving faster than we were, so they must have had something, okay?",
        "Q: You took out a couple of cans of food, you must have been still very hungry, cause you were\nmarching for a long time.",
        "A: Oh, but -- we marched for -- for several days. We marched approximately, I would say, a\ngood -- I -- I mean 20 miles a day, at least.",
        "Q: 20 miles a day?",
        "A: Yeah, at least. So we walked for three days, must have been about 60 miles. Of course, at\nnight we stayed someplace, you know, whatever horror place they could drum up. They couldn\u2019t\nthrow us in a prison, no prison was big enough, you know. So they put us in a schoolyard, or a\nrestaurant, or you know, whatever was handy, could accommodate us cramped together. I\nremember the worst part was one day -- one night, found some what yo -- I would call a beds --\nbedstand. The frame, and wires strung across, you know, like a -- this. And I laid on that. I mean,\nlike wasn\u2019t very comfortable, you know? Can you imagine how hard it is to lay? But you\u2019re\nyoung. Well the next thing I know, I wake up. Somebody is urinating on my feet. Wonderful,\nI\u2019m telling you, the I-life was great. There wasn\u2019t -- he coul -- he couldn\u2019t even get out because\nwe were so jammed together, so he stood up and he urinate on my feet, hey.",
        "Q: And you thanked him, I\u2019m sure.",
        "A: Oh, I -- I gave a -- I -- I gave him a piece of my mind, but too late, I was wet. Of course, urine\nisn\u2019t the worst thing.",
        "Q: What were your shoes like?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: But did your feet hurt? Do you remember that? Walking that much?",
        "A: My feet hurt, are you kidding? The whole sole of my foot was a callus. Then fortunately, after\nthree days of walking, they found a truck and they put us on a truck. A --",
        "Q: Oh, that was nice.",
        "A: Oh, I tell you, and the countryside was beautiful. That doesn\u2019t change. I remember once we\nwere resting, and I was against the wall, like about at least that high there, you know, sitting,\nresting against the wall. You know, I had a little lunch or something, a bite to eat, whatever. And\nthe Germans were shelling us. And all of a sudden I hear this big explosion. And man, I don\u2019t\nknow how I did it. In one flash I was over the wall, on the other side of the wall.",
        "Q: Well, this must have been a nine foot wall.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Must have been a eight or nine feet wall --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah --",
        "Q: -- right? And you went -- and you --",
        "A: -- yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I -- I jumped over that like it was -- 1t wasn\u2019t even there.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Scares s -- does a wonderful thing for you. And of course I was young, and I had -- I hadn\u2019t\nsuffered yet, you understand?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And so -- it gave me a good scare though, but th-that told me that things weren\u2019t exactly\ngoing well. So anyway, then, eventually we got the truck and the truck brought us to a railroad\nstation, and then we got put into cattle cars, you know? Eight horses, 40 men, that\u2019s what\u2019s\nmarked on the cattle cars. [speaks foreign language here]. That\u2019s what they did in World War I.",
        "Q: Forty men or eight horses.",
        "A: Or eight horses, right. And that\u2019s where they put us in these cattle cars, and of course we had\na French -- two -- two French soldiers per car to guard us, you know. And being that things\nweren\u2019t going exactly a hundred percent, 1t was stop and go and stop and go. So we went from --\nwell, what would I call it? Brittany, sort of like France, Normandy, all the way down to southern\nFrance in -- in the train, and then they turned around and shunted the car, and the next thing we\nknew, we\u2019re in central France in the plateau region. You know, there\u2019s the mountainous region\nlike 3,000 feet up. And that\u2019s -- we have to walk some more from the main town which was\ncalled Marvejols, to a little place in the mountains, which was a sh-sheep ranch. It was called\nMalavillers. And that\u2019s where we stopped, and that\u2019s where we were going to stay. And we had\nthe greatest accommodation in the world. We were staying in a sheep barn, and we were sleeping\non a small layer of straw over the sheep dung. It was just wonderful.",
        "Q: Over dung?",
        "A: Over the sheep dung. They didn\u2019t take the sh --",
        "Q: Oh, sheep.",
        "A: -- the sh -- the dung out, they left it there.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: They just put some straw over it, so that\u2019s where we stayed.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Wonderful accommodations.",
        "Q: Did it stink?",
        "A: Ah, who knows? Who knows? I can\u2019t remember that any more.",
        "Q: Now this is -- this is the French, this is not the Germans still?",
        "A: No, that\u2019s the fr --",
        "Q: That\u2019s still the French.",
        "A: -- that\u2019s still the French, oh yeah. And we got f-fed very well. We had quite a bit of freedom.\nWe were in the mountains, how far can you run? You see, even if you were -- if you were of a\nmind to run away, it was -- it wasn\u2019t going to work. Here\u2019s why.",
        "Q: Still, it\u2019s interesting, isn\u2019t it, that you have the kind of freedom that 1-it -- you were --",
        "A: Yeah, w-w-way up in the mountains. And once in a blue moon on a Sunday, we went down to\nthe nearest village, see what you could get, little something or something. Human contact, you\nknow, French people. Strangest village I ever saw. All the houses were built without windows.\nYou never saw a soul. A dog occasionally, and a nice little brook run -- river, small brook,\nwhatever, run alongside, really picturesque. And the houses -- w-we went inside a few times\nbecause made friends with the locals. And they were heated like -- there\u2019s places like that I think\nin England, too, there\u2019s hot springs that run underneath the houses. It\u2019s the most amazing thing\nwhat you can learn. I mean, not because you\u2019re looking for it, because the circumstances bring it\nout. And the people were quite ugly. Must have been a lot of intermingling, you know?",
        "Q: Is that why be -- because of the hot springs, is that why they didn\u2019t have windows? You don\u2019t\nknow?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t delve into this too much.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know, but the -- did -- nobody did nothing to us, so then we saw so -- went to some\nfarms, the people were quite nice. Well, you see, we all spoke perfect French, no accent, no\nnothing. So obviously, some stranger comes, speaks in French, ah -- ah, the people up there in\nthe mountain, you know. You know, we didn't look like dangerous criminals, so wha -- what?\nThey treated us pretty good.",
        "Q: So then you went back to --",
        "A: Of course we went back. See, we\u2019re -- ex -- e -- allow me, where were you going to go\nwithout papers?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Right. As a young man, you were supposed to be in the French army of sorts, or y -- if you\nwere German, you were supposed to be in the German army. You had no business ha-hanging\naround at a young age gallivanting in the country, you see? That\u2019s -- that\u2019s why. And the French\nwould nail everybody because you need papers. I have the papers yet. I mean, it\u2019s like an\naccordion, those papers, it\u2019s not like a nice little card like this, you know? I mean, even in\nGermany.",
        "Q: So how --",
        "A: So they had everything nailed down to a science, there was no place to go.",
        "Q: How long were you in Malavive?",
        "A: Malavillers --",
        "Q: Malavillers.",
        "A: -- I would say, okay, the war was over, it was June, right? July, August, yeah, maybe two\nmonths. Oh, by the way, at very -- at the very beginning, being that the German Germans, you\nknow, soldiers and whatnot were with us --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- the German armistice commission, meaning colonels, majors, generals, SS, government\npeople, came to check out who was in the camp. So immediately the Germans, like have a\ndogtag, whatever it 1s, they were put aside and sent back to the Fatherlands to fight another day\nor whatever, you know? And then all of a sudden we weren\u2019t German any more, now we were\nJews. Now we were officially Jews. You gotta understand that. We were not with Germans any\nmore, German nationals that fought for the Germans, we were Germans of German origin. So\nnow that they took the Christian people away, all of a sudden I wasn\u2019t German any more, now I\nwas a Jew, officially. So that the Germans made the French nail the Jews. That\u2019s how come we\nnever got out from under. See, the French nailed us because we were of German origin. And they\nwere eventually gonna screen us, and then they was -- was gonna let us go. Never got to this, the\nGermans got there first.",
        "Q: But there is an anti-Jewish law in Vichy, and you\u2019re in Vichy.",
        "A: No, that came later. That was all the way at the beginning. They\u2019re talking 1940, they -- --\nthey -- they barely have time to get themselves organized. You know, the Germans took over the\ne -- the end of June, a-and this was right then and there, so what, you know?",
        "Q: So are you now under German rule?",
        "A: No --yeah -- well, we are now under French rule, doing what the Germans tell them to do,\nkeep the Jews, you know, locked up. So, after a little while, for some reason, they send us to a\ndifferent camp. You know, again train, but this time we -- we picked up people from all over. We\nwere hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of people. And they\u2019re winding up in the south of\nFrance, the eastern coast by the Mediterranean and we\u2019re walking from the railroad station\nthrough the town -- I don\u2019t know how far it was. And then we wind up on a camp that is built on\nthe boards on the sand of the beach. Was a very large, long beach. And there were dozen upon\ndozens of barracks. And things were pretty primitive at the time. There was no running water, no\ndrinking water. They hadn\u2019t set up the food situation yet, and that wasn\u2019t very nice. That\u2019s the\nonly time that I really fell apart, I collapsed. I went -- couldn\u2019t move any more, so I fell asleep.\nAnd when I woke up, I was alright again, you know, and I dealt with the situation, because I\ncouldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t handle it any more. That was too much. I went catatonic. S --",
        "Q: Did anyone do anything to you when --",
        "A: Oh, the other people have their own tsoris, you know. Enough problems of their own. So, then\nlater on we get assigned to barracks. Now that was the final insult. The barracks are just built on\nthe beach sand. Which, that in itself, sleeping on the beach is not the worst thing in the world.\nWhat made it so bad is that just before us, they had stationed a regiment of Senegalese soldiers,\nwhich is the black African contingent of the French army, in those barracks. Now they were not\ntoo keen on what you would call hygiene. They used --",
        "Q: No, it\u2019s okay.",
        "A: -- they used every area where you would sleep as a toilet. And you found bowel movements.\nAnd that\u2019s where they made you sleep. That really cuts it. Of course, on top of that, being to --\ndue to that situation, there were -- I -- of course, I have to say millions of fleas there, because I\nmyself got bitten up so badly, it\u2019s frightening. From the upper thighs to the groin, my stomach,\nup to the hips, thousands of bites. I mean you can\u2019t just believe this, it was unbelievable. The\nmost beautiful setting in the world, which was hell. Dante\u2019s Inferno doesn\u2019t even come close.\nAnd then, to make matters worse -- eventually we got food there, the French brought you know -",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to -- I\u2019m going to ha -- I\u2019m going to have to stop you, I\u2019m sorry, we have to change\nthe tape.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: Okay. Where are you? What camp is this, on the beach?",
        "A: This is called San Cyprian, which is right next to the town of Erne, on the Mediterranean,\nclose to the Spanish border. And the reason that the camp was there was that the French had to\naccommodate all the Spaniards that ran away from Franco when the war was over, the Spanish\nCivil war was over in 1939, so the French, they came over by the hundreds of thousands, so they\nhave to put them up someplace, so that they had to build barracks in a hurry. Now when I say\nbarracks, which goes for any time that I mention a barrack, this is something like a wa -- one\ninch thick, you know, which 1s like three-quarters thick woods, and one layer, and covered with\nblack tar paper, which is wonderful in the summertime, because the black reverberates the sun,\nand takes it in. So if it\u2019s 80 degrees inside, it\u2019s a hundred deg -- 0-outside, it\u2019s a hundred degrees\ninside, it\u2019s wonderful. In the winter it doesn\u2019t do anything for you, it doesn\u2019t protect you from\nanything. So --",
        "Q: So the situation there was pretty awful.",
        "A: Y-Yeah, yeah. We still, even there, we still had quite a bit of freedom. If you asked for a pass,\nthey gave you a pass to go to the near town, you know, and things like that. But the unfortunate\nthing is that being we were in such unsanitary condition, there was a epidemic of typhoid,\ndiphtheria, and so on and so forth.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And we fortunately -- this was at the beginning, the French still had stuff, we got vaccinated\nfor these miseries. They da -- it took care of three shots, you know, we -- a week apart. The\ntrouble was that they were administered by German trained doctors and I don\u2019t know what\npossessed the Germans, they put the vaccination in your pectoral, whether you\u2019re male or\nfemale, okay? Not nice. Hurts a lot. So the first one, I took it. At that time I might also say that\nthe needles were approximately a good five to 10 times larger than what they are now. And of\ncourse, there was no such thing as AIDS, so everybody got stuck with the same needle. So\nanyway, the first shot in, fine. A week later, second shot in. It hurts. And the third time, they --\nthe doctor was like this and I go like that, I jerk back. So the needle being half in, it zigzagged a\nlot. The doctor didn\u2019t bat an eyelash, pulls the needle out. Straightens it out with his hand and\nthen he sticks me again. End of discussion. Of course, I didn\u2019t get any of the sicknesses.",
        "Q: Is -- 1-is -- does it surprise you now that you would vaccinate you? I mean, why are they\ndoing that if they\u2019re what -- if they\u2019re supposedly not caring about who you are, or what you --",
        "A: Well, the French are very nice people. They are ha -- they are not at all like the Germans,\nthey\u2019re not out to kill you. They\u2019re forced into a situation that was abhorrent to them. You see\nthat -- that\u2019s what people don\u2019t understand. They didn\u2019t like to do that. There was anti-Semitism\nin France, too, mind you, 99 percent Catholic country, you know, that you gotta understand that\nthe -- the Jews did all ba -- kinds of bad thing to Christ, which wasn\u2019t true, but that\u2019s the\npreaching as it went, you know? One of the popes in 796 says, hey, forget about that, but at that\ntime it was still running. But the French really are not vicious.",
        "Q: But what did you know la -- in this camp, if you didn\u2019t know? Anything about the Vichy\ngovernment versus the occupied [indecipherable]. You didn\u2019t know anything?",
        "A: We were -- we were -- we were -- we were so worried about ourselves that, you know, and\ntrying to -- to make a life for ourselves -- I mean some guys even went swimming in the ocean. I\nmean, you could swim in the ocean over there, you know?",
        "Q: Did you have to work at all?",
        "A: No, nothing, no.",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "A: As a matter of fact, come to think of that, I was friends with two -- I -- what I would call --\nwhat I called at that time, elderly gentleman, around 50.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Now when you\u2019re 17, 50 is like getting there, right? So they decided, let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t get\na little bit better treatment, let\u2019s volunteer to work in the office --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- French office, you know, do clerical work. There -- that was their profession. So he says,\nwhy don\u2019t you come with us, oh lo -- they liked me. Don\u2019t want to go into the reason why. But\nanyway -- So I tried it for a little bit, but I felt so lousy and it\u2019s so hot, and the offices weren\u2019t air\nconditioned any better than anything else. I says, so what am I doing here? I\u2019m getting treated\nthe same, I eat the same stuff. Why? So I stopped doing that, too, you know? But da -- that\u2019s the\nonly kind that -- that was voluntary.",
        "Q: Now, we --",
        "A: I seen people die there, I remember one young, strapping fellow about 17, six foot, 180\npounds, got dysentery over there, right? He was dead in a week. That goes to show you what\nkind of fantastic genes I had.",
        "Q: Did you think about escaping, since there was so much freedom?",
        "A: Like I said to you, nobody escapes from anyplace. What do you do without papers? And\nthere\u2019s police, civil servants, all over the place. You see, the French, if they didn\u2019t want to go and\nbeing drafted into Germany, they had to go into some sort of French service. Army, police, or\nsome like that. So they had them all over the place. There was nowhere to go. It never even\noccurred to me because I had enough brains to realize a-and where you going? I tried the escape\nbusiness once with my brother in 1942, February 40 -- oh no, wait, you\u2019re not there yet, okay, so\nI won\u2019t -- we\u2019ll keep that for later.",
        "Q: How long are you in San Cyprian, how are you -- long are you at the beach?",
        "A: About two months.",
        "Q: Two months again?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: About two months in s --",
        "A: Give or take, towards winter.",
        "Q: -- right, right.",
        "A: Then they decided, oh this is not good for you, the winter. We got to bring you to a better\nplace, more suited for the winter.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Okay, so back in the train and we wind up on the other side of France. Now we\u2019re on the\nAtlantic side, but still by the Pyrenees. The [indecipherable] was called Gurs. So we wind up\nthere and they got the same kind of barracks, with barbed wire around it. Sections, they called\nthem, elou. Each section was called an elou, which was an island, all right? So, had maybe 20\nbarracks per, and they had letters, A, B, C, D, you know, and so on, so forth. So I -- I believe my\nmemory serves, I went in number H. Of course, the only trouble was that the barracks were of\nthe same construction, even though we\u2019re facing winter now. Same thing, black tar, once inch\nply -- one inch wood. Now the only thing is, no Senegalese left their deposits there. This was\nokay because who was there before us were the Spanish refugees. And a few Spanish refugees\nwere still left there to do maintenance work, the nicest young men you ever met in your life.\nFriendly, gregarious, helpful, God knows what. Now this time we were together with women.\nNot together, but the camp held half women, half men.",
        "Q: That was not true in San Cyprian?",
        "A: In San -- San Cyprian, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember seeing women.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Right. So, we\u2019re in this camp, and by that time it\u2019s the winter of 1940 and the Germans were\nvery busy already, plundering France for the homeland, you know, the Fatherland, you know,\nwhatever you had there. So by that time the food situation wasn\u2019t that good. Very, very minimal.\nIt consisted of cabbage at lunchtime, boiled cabbage at lunchtime and boiled cabbage for dinner.",
        "Q: This is in Gurs, in the --",
        "A: In Gurs.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Once in a -- in the morning you got a slice of bread. Now, if you excuse the expression bread,\nflour as we know it was in the minority in the mixture. Everything else was in there. Ground\nacorns, whatever you could find. And we got a slice a day. Coffee, nonexistent. Some sort of\nbrew in the morning and that was it. Boiled cabbage at lunch, not the most nourishing food, and\nat dinner the same time. I think once a week we got about -- let me exaggerate, two ounces of\nmeat. I\u2019m exaggerating now, you know.",
        "Q: Did you have attacks of diarrhea from the cabbage? No, you were okay?",
        "A: No. No, no, I was okay. I\u2019m basically constipated, so you know. All right? Even as a child.",
        "Q: So that served you well then, in Gurs.",
        "A: Whatever. So, the problem 1s that the latrines -- we\u2019re not talking bathrooms, we\u2019re talking\nlatrines, you know what latrines are, right? Okay? In bil --",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you explain, what do they look like in -- in Gurs?",
        "A: Okay. They take those big oil drums, right, and over each oil drum they put -- they build a\nwood frame, all right, they throw a roof over it so that you\u2019re not exposed to the rain from the\ntop. From the s -- the back is covered, the front 1s open, and there\u2019s a walkway, and then you --\nwhatever one of the latrines, there might be 10 spots per, maybe more, I don\u2019t know. I doubt -- I\ndidn't make a business of committing that to memory, it wasn't that pleasant. They weren't close\nby. Why was that bad? In San Cyprian they were God knows how far away on the -- on the\nborder of the ocean. Over here, it started to rain and the soil, which was clay, turned to mud.\nNow we had to be very careful because you sank in up to here, because the mud has a tendency\nto suck your shoes right off your feet. I got pictures to prove all that, too. This is not something\nthat I make up. So it was quite unpleasant. So sometimes -- they had made a little walkway, you\nknow, threw some pieces of wood over there on some runners, you know? So that was already\npretty good, but that wasn\u2019t all over, you know? So anyway, the food was horrible, and they\ndidn\u2019t mistreat us. We never had to wor -- look, we were so damn weak, my stomach growling\nall the time, I was hungry all the time. Whenever I say hungry, I mean not hey, I would like to\neat some, I mean hungry that you were starving, okay? And the stomach is growling, there\u2019s\nnothing in there. So once in a blue moon we scrounged through garbage cans to see whether we\ncould find a piece of beet, or something like that, you know? Oh, it was very nice, very nice.",
        "Q: Were there a lot of kids -- boys your age, or were they --",
        "A: Nah, nah --",
        "Q: -- were they mainly older?",
        "A: -- nah, I was one of the few.",
        "Q: You were one of the few?",
        "A: Yeah. Most of them -- most of them were grown -- grown men. As a matter of fact, at one\ntime, we got the survivor of the Saint Louis, I don\u2019t know whether you know the Saint Louis was\nthat ship that left Germany, where al -- everybody had cub -- Cuban visas and when they hit\nCuba, Batista said, sorry fellows, I got your money, but I don\u2019t want you. So they shipped them\nover to the United States, and the United States said the same thing, so what was left over, they\nsend them right back to Germany, and the Germans said, you see, I told you nobody wants the\nJews. So we happened to wind up with survivors from the Saint Louis. Now these were all top of\nthe line people. I mean, we\u2019re talking the intelligentsia, you know? Lawyers, writers, movie\nproducers, and whatnot. And they showed the stress of the trip there. I remember one movie\nproducer, must have been in his heydays maybe 250 pounds. Well, the reason I can say that 1s\nbecause first of all, those barracks didn\u2019t have any yo -- windows. A door at one each -- a door at\neach end. And we had one bulb hanging from the ceiling in the middle, which went on for one\nhour at night, if it\u2019s a lot, okay? And so we -- at night we stripped to look for lice -- you know,\nlice? And tried to kill whatever you could find in your clothing. So I saw him stripped one day,\nand whatever his stomach was, was now a big flap hanging there. So I know the situation well --\ntoo good. And then it gets to be winter.",
        "Q: Wait -- let -- let me ask you something. How many people from the Saint Louis do you think\nwere in Gurs?",
        "A: All 900 of them.",
        "Q: No, they went to different countries.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re not sure?",
        "A: They sent them back to Germany.",
        "Q: No, some of them went to England and some went to Holland and some went -- they went to\ndifferent places, they didn\u2019t all go back to Germany. They stopped off at different places. So you",
        "A: Yeah, well, good for them because I only know about the ones that wound up in my barrack.",
        "Q: But do you know how many that you met, 10, 20, do you have any idea?",
        "A: In my barrack maybe -- I\u2019m not just talking my barrack, my --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- there were 20 barracks, I didn't know what was --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- in the next barrack. I would say about 20 of them.",
        "Q: But you were assuming that all of the people from the Saint Louis were there.",
        "A: I assumed.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: If -- if nobody wanted to accept them, well, they have to go -- the ship was a German ship,\nhave to go back to Germany.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know. So anyway, they were very nice people, I -- I got friends later on with one of the\nyounger lawyers, and that\u2019s a different story, you have to wait for later. But there were ---",
        "Q: What was it -- what were your relationships like with the other people?",
        "A: Very nice, very good --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- very friendly. Cause they were old, young, didn\u2019t matter, they were nice people. Peop --",
        "Q: Were people afraid of what was going to happen if the Germans took over this --",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t think so?",
        "A: [ll tell you why, here\u2019s the story. Gets to be winter, right?",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Now, I discussed the construction of the barracks. Every morning when you woke up -- there\nwere Stalactite hanging from the ceiling, I -- I mean a lot. The condensation of the breath. The\nbreath goes up, form stalactites.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Right? And then, after awhile, from southern Germany, the Germans had a shipment of\npeople from part of German -- it\u2019s about maybe 6,000 of them, they shipped them over to Gurs.\nWomen, children, babies, old people. And I remember that because I was involved with them\nlater on. And you know, the wintertime, the icicles from the ceiling, every morning the door\nopened up and one of the French workers came and he yelled, any stiffs? Meaning, anybody\u2019s\ndead, frozen to death? Well, fortunately my barracks, we weren\u2019t that old. But the people from\nGermany, you had the old people, and you saw -- well, maybe -- no, not necessarily, there were\nsome people, older people, because I remember looking at the truck and all you saw sticking out\nf-from the truck were the feet with the socks -- with the socks on. You didn't see the body, they\nwere covered. And we have the cemetery at the end of the camp, was -- the camp was maybe a\nmile long. At the em -- end of the camp was a cemetery and they used to bury them there. And\nit\u2019s a situation -- I\u2019m telling you, if -- if we have no -- no light at all in the barracks, nothing, one\nbulb hanging in the middle, maybe one hour at night, I\u2019m telling you that\u2019s all, and that\u2019s where\nwe quickly stripped, whether winter or summer, didn\u2019t matter, and looked for the lice, and\n[sound effect]",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Where did you eat? In the barrack, or outside?",
        "A: Well, they -- at lunchtime they rang the -- you know, the bell or something, and you went\nthere with a whatever it was, and you got the ladle of soup.",
        "Q: Where -- where -- where would you go? Was there --",
        "A: To the kitchen.",
        "Q: There was a kitchen?",
        "A: Yeah, with the big cauldrons, you know?",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: I once volunteered to work there, too.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: [indecipherable] my reward was to get up at four in the morning, start the fire, and I could eat\nas much cabbage as I wanted. And that didn\u2019t cut it either.",
        "Q: So, everybody in the camp went to one kitchen, or was there a kitchen --",
        "A: No, no, no, every --",
        "Q: -- every section has --",
        "A: -- every section, every --",
        "Q: Island?",
        "A: -- island had its own kitchen.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah. So that was it.",
        "Q: Did you work there? Was there work indoors?",
        "A: Later on, later on. I dis --",
        "Q: But not this first time?",
        "A: N-Not at -- not at the beginning. It ca -- really start to get to me, freezing and whatnot.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So the same guys that I mentioned before, volunteered to work in the office.",
        "Q: Is this Charles, one of the people? Is that his name? Or is that not his real name?",
        "A: No, one of them was George.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I can look it up to get the real name, and Abrams, I think his name was Mr. Abrams, they\nwere bookkeepers.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: I said ah [indecipherable] let\u2019s go the office, at least 1t was heated. They had the same\nbarracks mind you, but they were much better with doors and things like that, and it was heated.\nSo that was great. The food was the same. We still had to go back --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and we had to go back to sleep.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But during the day at least you got to eat.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s good.",
        "A: And you made friends.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know, the police inspectors that were there, they were very nice. They were very nice.\nNobody mistreated you, I tell you. So after a little while, there was one plum job to be had. That\nwas working for the director of the camp in the head barrack. So the guy was one of the Spanish\nCivil War refugees, and he had the [indecipherable]. Very nice fellow, but he got a little greedy.\nHe got into problems, so they dumped him. And I heard about that, I says, that\u2019s my job. So I\nwent and [indecipherable] he didn\u2019t speak French as perfectly as I did. I went there, I impressed\nthem no a -- no end, you know. Was him and the -- his assistant. I was hired on the spot. So now\nI\u2019m living in splendor. There is -- you -- look at the barrack, the -- they have the same barrack.\nThe only difference is, picture a railroad car, and offices to either side with doors. And he has the\nwhole back end of the barrack, the director, right? He lived on camp, as it would be, or on\ncampus, what -- however you want to put it. He had a beautiful house a little away from\neverything else, big villa, you know, with his wife, two kids. And so we had also what you\nwould call a reception room. The reception room had a little window, people ask questions, then\nthe door, and then part of the reception room was partitioned off about -- I\u2019d say about three feet.\nA wall, with a curtain. There was a bed in there. Luxury unlimited as far as I\u2019m concerned. I\ndidn\u2019t have a bed before. Like a regular cot, you know? And I -- whatever I had, th-th-the three\npieces of clothing I could hang up, whatever. Was three feet by maybe eight feet. Luxury\nunlimited, and it was separated from the reception area. And I dealt with the inspectors, I dealt\nwith the radio operator, I dealt with the boss, I del -- I dealt with his assistant. So they made me\ndo jobs, you know, like little jobs and things like that. But it paid off in the end, I tell you, big\ntime. So the most amazing thing 1s that -- of course there was no gasoline to be had in France, so\nthe French invented cars that -- the regular cars were converted to run on charcoal gas. They had\nthose big cylinders mounted in the back of their car, and you threw charcoal in there and you lit\nit and that created gas and that went through a tubing to some sort of fuel indi -- gas injector.\nAnd you weren't ri -- winning any races with it, but you could at least do 25 miles an hour with\nthat, flat of course, you know. So th-the -- th-the Germans were even smarter than that, they\ninvent -- they were so -- so brilliant, they invented something, they had two cylinders on the\ntrucks, one on this side, one on that side. And then they had bags of chopped green wood, mind\nyou. You took a bag of green wood, threw it in that cylinder, that transform it into charcoal, send\nit over to that cylinder, and that\u2019s how the trucks worked. I mean, you -- you gotta give them\ncredit. You don\u2019t have to like them, but you gotta give them credit.",
        "Q: Did it go faster than 25 miles an hour? The same.",
        "A: Like I said, you were -- y-you won\u2019t win races, okay?",
        "Q: How long were you in Gurs at this time, the first time?",
        "A: Okay. Tell you, I got out of there on April 12\", 1941. I got there maybe October \u00b040.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So the first time was what, seven months? No, six months.",
        "Q: Now does your father have something to do with your leaving somehow?",
        "A: Yeah. Now, my parents were in Paris, so when situation went bad, the Fr-French rounded\nthem up too, in the [indecipherable], which was a big stadium in Paris. The women were sent to\none camp. My mother happened to be, coincidently be sent to Gurs.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: But you were there the same time?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: And my father was sent to another camp, and I don\u2019t remember exactly the name. So, after\nthey get screened, with references and things like that, they saw they were totally harmless, they\nlet them go. But, they were assigned residents, forced residents.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And the forced residents was in some minor, small village in southern France, you know? So\nthat\u2019s where my mother and my f-father wound up. And my mother heard on the rumor mill that\nI was coming from San Cyprian, so for weeks she didn\u2019t eat her bread and was keeping it for me,\nso that I should have enough food.",
        "Q: She heard that you were coming to Gurs?",
        "A: Uh-huh. The rumor mill is fabulous.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And she was saving the bread for me, you know, the rest, I mean the -- the cabbage she can\u2019t\nsave, you know? My mother didn\u2019t look too heavy, either.",
        "Q: So, did you get this bread?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t -- you had no idea that she was there.",
        "A: I found out --",
        "Q: Much later, uh-huh.",
        "A: -- once -- once I joined them in Castelno --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you know.",
        "Q: We have to stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: Kurt, can you explain what forced residence is? You said that your parents --",
        "A: Right. Well, the same applied for me and my brother. When you are released from the camp\nwith all the proper papers and whatnot, you\u2019re assigned to live in a certain area. Now, first thing\nyou do, you present yourself at the police station, and the police station ho -- tells you at the\npolice, whoever it is, tells you how often they want to see you a week.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You have to check in with them to make sure that you\u2019re still there. You see they usually --\nvillages don\u2019t have a -- you know, even -- even in towns doesn\u2019t matter, they cannot be with you\n24 hours a day. They want to make sure that you don\u2019t escape or run away, or do something that\nyou\u2019re not allowed to. So anytime you want to go, or you have to go to let\u2019s say the nearby town,\nyou have to go up to police department and ask them for a pass. So that\u2019s what forced residence\nis, that you check in with them all the time. Can\u2019t move from there.",
        "Q: Now, was your father in Vernette? Is that where he was?",
        "A: Le Vernai.",
        "Q: Vernai?",
        "A: I think that\u2019s what it was.",
        "Q: So both he and your mother, who had been taken to two different places --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- were -- were released?",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And they went to the small, little village called?",
        "A: Castelnot Rivierbas.",
        "Q: Right. Now, they were both sent there on purpose cause they knew they were husband and\nwife, or no?",
        "A: Oh yeah, no, no. Somehow my father, who is a very bright man, might have gotten in touch,\nthrough some organization or whatnot, to find out where my mother was.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: And that\u2019s how they got together and wound up in Castelnot at the same time. I never\nquestioned it because we had other worries at the time --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- you know, how. I know where and when, but not exactly, you know, how they got together.",
        "Q: Got together, right. Now, how do you end up there?",
        "A: Where? In Castelnot? Oh, when it came time for me to be released -- this was the strangest\nthing, my father, who is an alien resident -- alien resident, actually, whatever you call it, is now\npretty much an unwanted person, right? Went to see the mayor, the governor, whatnot. Got an\naudience and pleaded my release with them. And then they gave him a pass to come and see the\ncommandant of the camp where I was, showed him the goods, and that\u2019s how come I got\nreleased. Can you imagine my father, who -- who -- who had -- who had no standing whatsoever,\nmanaged to do all that? Of course, when they released me, we are to Castelnot Rivierbas. Why?\nMy father, mother lived there, simple.",
        "Q: Now where is Harry at this time?",
        "A: Harry was already in ca -- in Castelnot Rivierbas.",
        "Q: Had he been put into a camp also?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: He was too young.",
        "Q: So it was only people over 17, or Germans over se -- was -- cause you -- you were the sort of\nthe line --",
        "A: I -- just lucked out, what can I tell you?",
        "Q: Right. So when you go back, when you go there, you\u2019re with your father and your mother and\nyour brother, and your aunt is where? Where\u2019s Emma?",
        "A: My aunt came to live, after a little while, came to live with us.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Because she couldn\u2019t stay where she was, was the occupied zone, remember?",
        "Q: Right. So she couldn\u2019t stay.",
        "A: When the Germans decided that they\u2019re going -- I -- I mean, before they decided to take all\nover France, at -- at beginning she -- she got along pretty good with the Germans, because the\nGermans respect each others Army officers, things like that. So being she was the wife was -- of\nan Army officer, you know --",
        "Q: And where was her husband, do you know?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Or -- your uncle?",
        "A: When the war was over, he was prisoner of war in Germany.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s where he was the whole time, so --",
        "A: No, not the whole time. After -- after about a year or so they released him.",
        "Q: And he came to where you -- you were? Do you -- or you don\u2019t know, because by then you\nwere gone?",
        "A: You know, this is a little hazy in my mind. I remember my aunt living with us. You gotta\nrealize, my parents had rented a small, little house. It had a kitchen, and two rooms. A living\nroom and a bedroom, so the living room was transformed into a three people bedroom, my -- my\naunt, my brother and me -- when she came. That was -- they were small rooms anyway. And so\neventually my uncle was released and then -- by that time they made him a general because the\njob asked for it. The -- he was in charge of the medical military, I guess, otherwise too, I don\u2019t\nknow, of the hospital, or hospital with an s in Vichy, Vichy, France, you know, where the\ngovernment was?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And he managed to -- to do in his position, to do a lot of good to save some French soldiers\nfrom, you know, unpleasantnesses.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know.",
        "Q: So ho -- what do you do when you go to this little village?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: What do you do when you go to this little village?",
        "A: Well, originally I couldn\u2019t work. So the only job open was as a farm hand. So, I got a job as a\nfarm hand. But the funniest thing is, for the first -- 1t sounds strange -- 40 days, I couldn\u2019t go to\nwork. Why? The Bible repeated itself, we had 40 days of rain. I\u2019m not kidding you. The only\ndifference was, sometimes it rains heavy, and sometimes it rains slower. Now, how come not\neverything was flooded? Because -- I happen to appreciate the French, very brilliant, they had\nditches alongside the road on either side. That\u2019s where the water went, and then the water went\ninto the big river. Of course, they also have a person with a scythe, you know what a scythe is,\nright, to move this. This was a county job. He was in charge of moving the grass from the -- from\nthe ditches.",
        "Q: So he took out the grass that -- that flowed in, so 1t wouldn\u2019t --",
        "A: N-No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: It can\u2019t overgrow. They wanted to keep the ditches as drainage.",
        "Q: I see, right.",
        "A: In perfect condition, not to impede the water, with grasses growing all over.",
        "Q: So for the first 40 days you can\u2019t work?",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s so funny, 40 days of rain.",
        "Q: Did you sleep a lot? Were you exhausted from being in Gurs, or you were okay?",
        "A: I was mainly s -- mainly [indecipherable] what I did, I did a lot. I don\u2019t know where I got it\nfrom. I mended my father\u2019s jeans, he would be very fashionable now, had patches all over. I\nmade my mother --",
        "Q: Your father was wearing jeans then?",
        "A: Oh, the jeans are invented in France.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The Nimes. Da Nimes. Nimes being southern France. That\u2019s where the name comes from.\nAnd these were working pants for -- for when you work. You couldn\u2019t wear a suit. And all the\nway at the beginning too, I did something else. I -- my father got into a deal with some of the\nfarmers, to cut their hedges and some of the trees. So my father was at the time [indecipherable]\n57 years old. And so we went there, and in exchange of what he did, he got half the wood that we\ncut down, because we had the wood stove, and that\u2019s the only thing that worked, my mother\ncooked on the wood stove. So we had heat in the winter. I did that at the beginning, right.",
        "Q: So let me ask you something, you\u2019re now 20 years old, right? 19 -- you\u2019re born in --",
        "A: Not yet, not yet, I\u2019m only 19.",
        "Q: I thought we were --",
        "A: \u201822",
        "Q: -- we\u2019re in 19 --",
        "A: \u00b022 -741.",
        "Q: All right, we\u2019re in \u201941, okay.",
        "A: I\u2019m not going to be -- I\u2019m not even going to be 21, because right now we\u2019re in April 12\",\n1941.",
        "Q: We have to wait til August.",
        "A: You have to wait four months.",
        "Q: Right, okay, forget [indecipherable] forget my question. So how long do you do the farm\nwork?",
        "A: Well, farm work from let\u2019s say, yeah it was the summer. June \u00b041 til geez, when did they lock\n-- lock us up again? August \u201942. Yeah, August \u201942, when they round -- they -- they round -- the\npolice rounded us up again, put us on truck and back to Gurs for deportation purposes.",
        "Q: Right, right. Now, you have one or two relationships with young girls?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: You have some dates?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: You have some dates, or you have --",
        "A: Oh, we -- well, I -- the one that I -- that\u2019s a very strange story. Like again, I said like truth is\nstranger than fiction. Did you hear of Lourdes in your life, Lourdes, holy place, the Virgin, da\nda? Anyway, the train from [indecipherable] Sainte Marie was close by Gurs to my parents, goes\nfrom -- to Pau and then Tarbes. Tarbes is the big center, and the local train from my parent\u2019s\nplace, Castelnot and further up, comes there twice a day, once in the morning and once at night.\nRemember, it\u2019s war time. So I\u2019m sitting in this big -- you -- you know what the European rail\nstation look like? They\u2019re like all glass, you know, tremendous ceilings and whatnot, you know?\nAnd I\u2019m sitting there, you have to wait for my train, I -- I got there li -- let\u2019s say 10 - 11 in the\nmorning, or 12, and my train is at four or five in the afternoon, right? So I\u2019m sitting on the bench,\nwaiting, looking around, nothing is happening. Tr-Train pulls in, and down yonder\n[indecipherable] I see two ladies. I says, oh, it can\u2019t be, it\u2019s my mother and my aunt. I says no,\nyou\u2019re hallucinating. And as they come closer, lo and behold it\u2019s my mother and my aunt. Now\nmy father knew I was going to get released that day, it was a Sunday, Easter Sunday. My mother\nand aunt had left before the message got to them, and they decided [indecipherable] for my\nuncle, who was Christian decided, let\u2019s go to Pau, couldn\u2019t hurt. Everybody else goes there for a\nmiracle. Ah, what else we got to do? So they took the train to Pau, and then to Lourdes. And they\ngot off the train from Lourdes because they had to change it at Tarbes, same that I did, and man\nwas that emotional. Totally -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m telling you, truth is stranger than fiction, there\u2019s my\nmother and my aunt in the same station, the day I got released from the camp. Okay, fine. Now,\nhow did I know -- get to know this little girl? We\u2019re waiting for the train, go into a compartment\nand then three people come in the compartment, a man around 50, woman around 28, and a real\nnice looking young lady around 17 - 18. Looks interesting, okay. The weirdest thing is they get\nup at the -- get off at the same station we did. My mother happened to know them, which she told\nme later, blah, blah, blah. They were Belgian. The f -- the husband must have been very rich\nbecause he bought the local castle, chateau, okay? And they also sold some dairy products. So\nthe following morning my mother says, look, why don\u2019t you go up the road there and see -- try to\nget a few eggs, maybe something else, cottage cheese, whatever. I don\u2019t remember what. So I go\nthere, and there\u2019s a big gate and two Dobermans, black things. No -- was never too fond of dogs,\never since I was bitten at the ripe old age of 11 by a dog to whom I didn\u2019t do anything. So I was\nah -- but fortunately they didn\u2019t do anything to me. So, you know, a castle, big driveway, you\nknow, circular driveway. So I walk on to the side entrance there, and that\u2019s where they used to\nsell stuff from. Th-Th-They were cultivating the farm, they were using the farm. And who 1s\nthere? This magnificent creature. So now, I never lose time beating a dead horse. No, I knew this\nwas going to work. I ask her, would she like to have a date, you know, something like that. So\nshe says, I have to ask my -- whoever it was. Couldn\u2019t have been her mother. At 28 you don\u2019t\nhave an 18 year old kid, I don\u2019t care what age you start. Relative, somebody, [indecipherable]\nbrother-in-law, so [indecipherable] so the lady says, you sure don\u2019t waste any time. You know,\nsays [indecipherable] so I picked her up on Sunday, and we hit it off pretty good, but it didn\u2019t\nlast too long because after awhile the man of the house, who was 50, realized hey, what\u2019s this\nforeigner doing with my whoever it is, shall we say prot\u00e9g\u00e9e? Gets better. And I couldn't see her\nany more. So they locked the door, they locked the gates when I was supposed to pick her up.\nAnd his foreman was a big dude about six three or four. He says to me, you know, I like you, but\nif you know what\u2019s good for you, desist. Cease and desist. So I can take a hint. Funniest thing 1s\none day while I was waiting for my -- let\u2019s say girlfriend to get ready, the lady of the house says,\ngee, would you like to see the place? Now you gotta understand one thing. This is not the United\nStates. The United States I would have been shall we say a little more up to date and not as naive\nas I was, okay? I was -- you know, I was not necessarily shy, but -- I don\u2019t like to discuss things\nlike that, but anyway. So she takes me up to her bed-bedroom. Carpeting that high, white. Now,\nwhat I didn\u2019t realize at the time is I [indecipherable] the spot, her for the little girl. She was going\nto get for -- go for me in a big way. But I was too dumb and young. I was afraid. The husband,\nbig guy, look at the co -- position I\u2019m in, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m like under the gun with the\npolice. All anybody has to say, I\u2019m dead meat. So she got very, shall we say depressed once they\nopenly got together outside, the husband and the young lady. You always saw them together in\nthe carriage, you know. You know, a s -- little horse carriage, you know, for two people. And\nshe, from what the rumor had it, she jumped out of the first floor balcony, you know, trying to\nkill herself. Of course, she was -- she was going to make sure it wasn\u2019t deathly. So that was my\nstory with that sweet thing.",
        "Q: So it didn\u2019t work out.",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: Exactly.",
        "A: First of all, I didn\u2019t have -- had sex at my ripe old age because I spent most of my time in\nplaces like Gurs etcetera, etcetera. And the war got in between a lot of things and the reason I\ndidn\u2019t have sex is because A, I didn't have sex. So I said to myself, what if you don\u2019t do it right,\nand the lady isn\u2019t happy with your efforts? You know, that was my thinking. I was always\nthinking about somebody else, never about myself. You know, most people think about\nthemselves, hey, I want to get laid, amen. Sorry about the language, but you know, that wasn\u2019t\nme, I just --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- I did -- I did that twice, like a schmuck, but later on I caught on.",
        "Q: So are you, before you are captured again and taken away --",
        "A: I was [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- you\u2019re doing far -- you\u2019re doing this farm work the whole time?",
        "A: Yeah, oh -- only 16 hours a day.",
        "Q: That\u2019s all?",
        "A: They actually want -- wanted me on Sunday too, but I says, uh-uh. I c -- I could barely move.\nThe first thing I did for six weeks, they gave me a hoe and I hoe the vineyard. Now, you know,\nvineyard is not from here to the door. How many rows there are in a vineyard? I was -- my back\nbent to the sun, I had to take shirt off, didn\u2019t have -- I didn't even have money for a hat, wa -- had\nno money. You know what they paid me at -- let -- let\u2019s not exaggerate. I think they paid me at\nthe current exchange rate, 25 cents a day. 1941, okay?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Even that wasn\u2019t a lot of money, even in 1941. The only thing is, they fed me. What they feed\nme morning, noon and lunch was, considering my gall bladder, not the right thing. Pure, white\nlard for breakfast. You know what that does to your in-intest -- gall bladder and liver? That was\nmy breakfast, huh? Not bacon, bacon has -- got half -- half meat in there. Pure, white lard. Well,\nthey didn\u2019t have that much to themselves because the Germans took all their cattle out, you\nknow. So the only thing that left was pork and geese, you know, the geese that you fatten? So --",
        "Q: What -- what do you hear now about what\u2019s going on in the east, because now Germany has\nattacked Russia, and they\u2019re starting to kill Jews, as well as some other people.",
        "A: Who does?",
        "Q: The Germans.",
        "A: Oh --",
        "Q: In 1941, do you hear anything?",
        "A: No, not a word. We knew through the grapevine that there were camps and things like that,\nbut we don\u2019t know exactly what. There was Dachau what -- that was in Germany, Buchenwald is\nGermany, and there was a couple other ones right in Germany.",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m talking about -- I\u2019m talking about Poland now.",
        "A: Yeah, I know. Well, Poland --",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t hear.",
        "A: -- we didn't know from yet. It\u2019s when they started trying to de-deport us in Gurs. That\u2019s when\nwe knew it -- Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Which 1s later, right?",
        "A: Well, you see, we met with a lot of Jews from various areas --",
        "Q: Who told you.",
        "A: -- and they had good intelligence, you know.",
        "Q: So how do you get captured, why do you get captured in \u201943, I believe? You\u2019ve been --",
        "A: Now \u00b042 --",
        "Q: -- two --",
        "A: -- I got released after months. Being that I was -- I told you I worked for the chief of the camp",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: -- and all his police inspectors were my buddies. So when we came there they were sitting at\nthe table, and they, you know, took your name and everything like that, and my brother. So\nobviously I never showed up on the deportation list.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: My pals, right, [Il tell -- ve -- Pl tell you, it paid off, that one time I worked. And you\nknow how good the French were, and how good the people were at that time over there? They let\nus keep our pocket knives. They weren\u2019t afraid that they [indecipherable]. Can you imagine you\ngo to -- you put a prisoner in one of the prisons here, and you let him have a nice pocket knife?\nThat\u2019s -- that wa -- just what they\u2019re looking -- I\u2019m telling you, was different times and different\npeople.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. Were you afraid about being deported?",
        "A: Well, I wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled.",
        "Q: All right, what did you think? Did you know anything at that point in \u00b041? Wa\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Well ha -- I -- I knew I\u2019m as good as dead if I get on the train, okay?",
        "Q: That\u2019s what you knew?",
        "A: Yeah, that much we knew.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t know how or why or where.",
        "A: No, Auschwitz we knew.",
        "Q: No, forget why. You knew Auschwitz.",
        "A: We knew Auschwitz, the train was for Auschwitz.",
        "Q: What year do you think that is, \u00b042?",
        "A: The first year was \u00b042 in August.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And they needed 5,000 people.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the few Jews they had left, they -- they were so efficient, they collected them all, there\nwere more than 5,000, because there were a few left over, including my brother and me, you\nknow.",
        "Q: So after that first month, you get released --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and then you\u2019re -- they you --",
        "A: Go back to Castelnot --",
        "Q: -- then you get -- right.",
        "A: -- go back to work on the farm.",
        "Q: Right. And then the police come to try to get you again, and you and Harry try to escape. And\nyou make it until what?",
        "A: Well, okay. We were prepared this time, we said --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- next time we jump out the window, the side window. We had a little suitcase, you know,\neach and every one of us, put some food in there, whatnot, and we\u2019ll try to make it to a different\ntown and get on the railroad and try our luck going that-a-way, which is stupid, but when you\u2019re\nyoung, you\u2019re stupid.",
        "Q: Which was that-a-way? Which way is -- which way were you going to go?",
        "A: Towards central France.",
        "Q: To central France.",
        "A: Central central. Not just east or west, but halfway between north and south and the massive\ncentrale, we had --",
        "Q: But still in Vichy?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, right, okay.",
        "A: So we made it through a few fields, the farmers looked at us a little strange, and the next thing\nyou know, who is waiting for us? One of the local cops. On bicycle, as we were crossing the\nroad. So he said to us, how can you do this to me? I says, excuse me? He was insulted that we\nrun away because that puts a bad -- it puts him in a bad light. And that\u2019s when my parents left\nCastelnot because they knew. They\u2019re down on us now, you know? Now, I had that one time, we\nhad some friends by the name of Rothchild, which Rothchild also denotes serious deniros, you\nknow? And they had the son, one and only son. They lived in the nearby village, also residents.\nAnd the son tried to make it to Spain. Well, he paid big money to some of the what do you call it,\nguides, and the guides --",
        "Q: No, wait, let\u2019s stop for -- let\u2019s stop for a minute. Okay? Sorry, he\u2019s choking.",
        "A: Okay, so they had a son, and he paid somebody big bucks to get him out of France over the\nmountains. Well the guy took it from both sides. Took his money, took the German\u2019s money and\nthat was the last time you heard from him. So you know, money isn\u2019t the answer to everything.\nBut, what they did for us, they managed to get authentic, blank false papers. Okay, blank. So like\nI said, I don\u2019t know, I saw in retrospect, I\u2019m amazed at myself how talented I was. I managed to\nforge those papers so efficiently, I forged the mayor of the village\u2019s handwriting that he could\nhave sworn he signed it. Couldn\u2019t do it today any more. So my parents had false paper making\nthem French people, you know. And the right age, right everything, you know they were, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Where did you get the false papers from? From th --",
        "A: From the Rothchilds.",
        "Q: From the Rothchilds, I see.",
        "A: See, they had -- they had -- they had more money than God, so they could buy anything they\nwanted, you know.",
        "Q: And why were they willing to give you the false, blank --",
        "A: We were friends.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: My parents and them were friends.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: My parents had a lot of friends, I mean --",
        "Q: Okay, so y --",
        "A: -- very likable people, my parents.",
        "Q: So you -- you got them these forged papers that you forged for them?",
        "A: Mm-hm, and that\u2019s when they pssshhht. After they nailed us the second time.",
        "Q: They took you away.",
        "A: In August \u00b043.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Now that time it didn\u2019t go too good because I wasn\u2019t released. Oh, I was released. I was\nreleased in the custody of the German slave labor. Organizatione Tote, working on the Atlantic\nwall. That was a lot of fun.",
        "Q: And what camp are you in when you\u2019re doing this?",
        "A: La -- Labenne. Labenne Oceane.",
        "Q: Labenne?",
        "A: Yeah, from Gurs, we di -- we were -- got on a train, and da da da da da, you know?",
        "Q: Wait a minute, now. We did -- we didn\u2019t actually do this. In \u201943, after you\u2019ve released for a\nmonth and you go back, they you\u2019re captured again and you go to Gurs.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- re-released again in \u00b043 --",
        "Q: \u00b043, right.",
        "A: -- then we run away, then they put us on the truck in front of the house.",
        "Q: Right. And you go to Gurs.",
        "A: And then Gurs. There\u2019s a little side story, very interesting.",
        "Q: All right, hold the side story for the next tape, cause there\u2019s not a --\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "Q: All right, so you\u2019re in Gurs, you\u2019re taken on the truck to Gurs. Harry is with you. Am I\ncorrect?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you go to Gurs, and you\u2019re there for?",
        "A: Oh, as -- as long as it took to make a convoy, but they didn\u2019t put me on the convoy again,\nbecause like I said, when you get checked in, my pals were the ones that --",
        "Q: Got you out.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Or didn\u2019t put me on the list.",
        "Q: So at that point they were deporting Jews to Auschwitz as far as you knew?",
        "A: No, that was the second time, in \u201942 they deported them to Auschwitz. In \u201943, they fi -- the\nGermans figured there must be enough Jews left to make another convoy. So that was \u00b043 in\nAugust.",
        "Q: Right. But you don\u2019t get put on that and Harry doesn\u2019t get put on that.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: But you and Harry do not stay together at that point.",
        "A: No.",

        "Q: Yeah, he\u2019s past 18 --",
        "A: -- something.",
        "Q: -- right? You\u2019re 40 -- you\u2019re 21.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, right, right.",
        "Q: So he\u2019s past 18.",
        "A: \u00b043, I\u2019m -- yeah, I -- ?'m 21 right then on my birthday, right.",
        "Q: Right, August.",
        "A: So, what happened, after a little while they segregate us and they pick me and a few other\nguys, and they send them to the Germans on the Atlantic coast for slave labor.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Now, we went with a truck from Gurs to Labenne Oceane, which is the name of the site, and\nstrange as it seems, we pass right in front of the Lourdes Cathedral, you know, where all the\nmiracles happen? And the truck stops dead. So we all have to get off the truck and push it up the\nhill until it starts cranking again. That was ver -- very strange things happen in life. And if you --\nyou can add meaning to it if you want to, or just add it to coincidences. So I -- personally I think\nit\u2019s coincidence you know, but whatever. So, but you can make things out of that, you know.\nAnd then I wound up with the Germans, and the first thing I know -- they show us where we\nsleep, and then they march us out to the worksite. Now, 5,000 people swarming around there,\nokay? They weren't Jews. We were the only Jews, eight of us. At that time they didn\u2019t know it,\ntoo -- n-no -- no -- they\u2019ve ra -- okay, let\u2019s put it that way, not everybody knew we were Jews,\nokay? So, they put us to work right there. I\u2019m facing a mountain of gravel a little bit higher than\nthe ceiling, you know, like this is 15 feet, let\u2019s say 20 feet and a good 150 feet long. And they\ngive us shovels, and we have to shovel wa -- I don\u2019t remember where, most likely in\nwheelbarrows. And we have to shovel that throughout the night. And I said to the foreman, in\nGerman -- German foreman, I says, look, I\u2019m exhausted, can\u2019t we get a little sleep? He says, a\nwar -- there\u2019s a war on, nobody sleeps. That took care of my complaint, okay? Later on, being\nthat I spoke German, he made me sort of like in charge of translating from him to the rest of the\nworld, okay? So was pretty good because once in awhile we traded something for some food,\nyou know, e -- they -- they got fed. We -- we got -- the -- the -- it\u2019s not a repeat of Gurs, but it\u2019s\npretty close. Boiled pasta for lunch and supper. Now that don\u2019t do much for your system either,\nyou know, like beriberi?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know? Which happened to hit me after X amount of time. So I go to the nurse, I didn't\nknow what it was. Could be measles, could be rubeola, I don\u2019t know. I says, look I got red spots\nall over myself, I don\u2019t know. Well, the re -- German nurse, of course. She didn\u2019t know what it\nwas either, but just to be on the safe side, she was going to put me in insulation, right? So I don\u2019t\naffect --",
        "Q: Isola -- isolation.",
        "A: -- ins -- isolation.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Or insulation, isolation --",
        "Q: No, isolation.",
        "A: -- same difference. I was in -- isolated from everybody, but insulated too, but okay, fine.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So just at that time, our friendly camp commandant comes in, points to me, he says, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s\nthe matter with this bastard?\u201d The nurse tells him, he blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh, he goes to\nhis holster, unstraps the holster, takes off his gun and says, \u201cI\u2019m gonna shoot that bastard right\nhere.\u201d So the nurse said to him, of course in German, \u201cYou are not going to do any such thing\nHerr Commandant, in my office.\u201d Well, he actually didn\u2019t shoot me, but she put me someplace\nand I stayed there for a little while. And I got hold of some real type food, and after a little while\nI got better, and I got back to where I was. Now, after a little while --",
        "Q: Why would she do that, do you think?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Why did she protect you? Or was she --",
        "A: Well, first of all she might not have known I was Jewish. Secondly not all Germans were\n[indecipherable]. She was a nurse, she wasn't there to kill people, she was supposed to heal them.\nSo she didn't want to -- I swear to you [indecipherable]. That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: But he also could have taken you outside and shot you. If he was going to pay attention to her,\nright?",
        "A: She took the wind out of his sail. Oh, not only that, wait. She said to me, yeah you\u2019re pretty\nsick, let me give you a pass so you can go on leave. Oh, I says, well, I got nobody. She\n[inaudible]. So that\u2019s when she put me in the isolation, you know. Was very funny, she was a -- a\nnice -- a nice human being. I mean, I ge -- that\u2019s all I can say.",
        "Q: And this was in Labenne?",
        "A: Labenne Oceane. And you know, I tell you, we were right on the ocean.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Actually the bluffs overlooking the ocean, because you can\u2019t dig on the beach, because there\nyou hit water, that\u2019s no good. So we used to dig for the emplacement for the bunkers. Oh, that\u2019s\nall by hand ha -- no machines, everything by shovel. We used to dig a hole that was maybe 30\nfeet deep and 40 feet square and then flaring up to about a hundred feet at the top so that the sand\ndoesn\u2019t run down, you know what I mean? Was all done by shovel, can you imagine how many\npeople it took? Was like the Chinese coolies. And anyway -- and we worked until everything\nwas finished. From -- from -- and we -- what I -- what my specialty was -- I didn\u2019t pick it, you\nknow what rebars are? Rebars are those steel rods that they put in reinforced concrete. So the\nfirst thing before you pour the concrete, and I think we -- the walls must have been about 12 feet\nthick if they were an inch. We built the rebars from the bottom up like this, then straight across\nand then this way. And they gave us a bunch of wire, you know, wire, and we -- when rebars\nmet, we tied them like that and a pair of pliers to -- to cut it off. And we were like -- like frigging\nmonkeys hanging onto those rebars and the gale from the ocean was something unbelievable.\nCold? Oy. And that was already March at the time, or what -- whatever time it was. No, first\ntime was August, this was -- this was February, March.",
        "Q: And this is when you\u2019re building the -- what\u2019s called the Atlantic wall?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Well, let me ask you something, be -- between Gurs and Labenne Oceane, did you go to\nCamp Albi?",
        "A: No, no, that\u2019s later.",
        "Q: That\u2019s later.",
        "A: That comes after -- after Labenne Oceane.",
        "Q: I see, okay.",
        "A: So, anyway, we\u2019re still building the stuff there. Just to tell you how nice the Germans were,\nfirst of all they came by, they took the biggest guys they could find, of course, with the biggest\nGerman Shepherds you ever saw and they pat -- and they patrolled the work area. And s --\nbelieve me, you didn't want to be reminded to work harder by them. They didn't do it kindly. One\nday -- I\u2019m not inventing things -- they found a guy, they says, guy\u2019s not working hard enough,\nlet\u2019s teach him a lesson. They grab him -- do you know what a grease gun is? For -- for\nautomotives or machinery? They took the grease gun, inserted this in his rectum, filled it with\ngrease, and that was the end of that particular episode, and man.",
        "Q: And you saw that?",
        "A: No. I was told firsthand, by firsthand. I mean, I didn\u2019t see it.",
        "Q: So is this period of time the first time that you\u2019re in a situation where there\u2019s a lot of\nbrutality? Because the other situations, they may have been uncomfortable and you didn\u2019t have\nenough food --",
        "A: No, Gurs they die -- they -- they died too, in the winter, plenty of people died there.",
        "Q: No, no, I\u2019m not talking about dying. I\u2019m talking about brut -- brutality.",
        "A: Oh yeah, it\u2019s the first time I saw brutality, yeah. Oh, they were -- th-th-they used to cou -- ther\n-- you see, you\u2019re working 16 hours a day in hard labor, you get a little tired. So once in awhile it\nwould be logical for you to sort of like rest on your shovel a little bit and so on. And if they\ncaught you, they brought you back to life, you know. So anyway. So one day I\u2019m coming back,\nthe food still was horrible, and it\u2019s suppertime, we\u2019re sitting at a table, and the next thing I know,\nour commandant -- there\u2019s a few more episodes in between there. They actually paid you. The\norganization paid you, not -- we happened to fall in there because we happened to be Jews, we\ndon\u2019t really belong there, but we were there, okay? So one day he found out we were Jews, well\nthat was the end of that. He came at night to scream at us while we were sleeping. And he\nhappened to be a gay, and he had a retinue of young men with him, shall we say? And then,\nwhen he came time to get paid, well you know, they sit at the table there, with the paychecks and\nwhatnot, you know? And well, by the time -- by that time he knew who was Jewish -- well, every\ntwo weeks, I guess -- and what he did when he saw us come up, he took his gun, and he put it on\nthe table right next to the pay envelope. And you knew better than to grab for the pay envelope,\nokay? That\u2019s how we managed nicely. So one day he realized [indecipherable] that\u2019s not enough,\nI gotta get those guys. He called the Gestapo and one night when we came home from work, the\neight of us Jews were taken off and put on train, in a compartment that\u2019s enough for eight, with\nthe head Gestapo dude, and a soldier at each end of the train, do you -- the -- the car, you know,\nwhatever it 1s, you know, what you call that, a b -- the unit, a car unit, so that you couldn\u2019t run\nout, whatever. And -- and the guy was very nice, but what he really was, he was trying to con\nthese yi -- they were all young men, into revealing where their relatives and parents were, just in\ncase they were hiding. And they were so stupid, I\u2019m tell -- no, the -- the young guys there, I\u2019m\ntelling you. That\u2019s when I realized the whole world is not exactly what you\u2019re supposed to have\nheard about it. People are mostly stupid. I\u2019m telling you, how c -- you could fall in this trap?\nWrite me a letter, I -- I\u20191] make sure it gets mailed, give me the address. And they did. How\nstupid can you get? I mean honestly, they didn\u2019t have the brains they were born with. And they\nweren't stupid people, but they\u2019re stupid. You gotta be -- you gotta be up to every occasion that\ncomes along.",
        "Q: So what --",
        "A: How the heck you going to survive?",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: What did you do when they asked?",
        "A: Oh, I have -- I have nobody, I\u2019m all alone in this world.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Not only that, I spoke German, okay? The other one might have been Polish --",
        "Q: So where did they -- where did they take you?",
        "A: Well, to the nearest fortress, which was Bayonne, an old French fortress that the Germans had\ntaken over for a regiment of whatever it was, and they threw us in a prison cell, was very narrow,\nand there was a steel door, with a little flap that you could open to look out. I mean, not from the\ninside, from the outside. So I think only four people fitted in a cell. And I remember the -- the\nGerman officer corps came and looked at what Jews look like. You know, I mean what the heck?\nHe comes in there, hey -- hey Jews, we\u2019ll pick them up tomorrow morning, but I just wanted to\nkeep them overnight. And the place was run by the German army, which wasn\u2019t really bad. And\nI remember in the morning they let us out to go and wash up. And whether it was courage or\nstupidity, so you heard the phrase that you hear a lot in the funny German sitcoms, mach schnell,\nmach schnell, right? That means hurry up. So I had this orderly there, the German orderly was\nwatching us while we were washing, or something. And he saying this mach schnell, mach\nschnell. I got so mad and I start tearing him to pieces in German. I mean, really ripping into him\nin German, you know. Told him, what the heck you think you\u2019re doing? Who the heck do you\nthink you\u2019re dealing with and whatnot. You know, not a peep, not one repurs -- reparcation --\nrepercussion, it was the most amazing thing. I could have gotten shot [indecipherable] on the\nspot. Once in awhile you\u2019re -- you know, it -- it pays to get mad. So anyway, so the fellow --",
        "Q: This -- this was in Bayonne?",
        "A: Bayonne.",
        "Q: Bayonne.",
        "A: Bayonne. There\u2019s a fortress there.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure it\u2019s still there. Only because it\u2019s 60 years later, doesn\u2019t mean anything. Must have\nbeen built 60 years prior to that too. So anyway, they put us on a train, and up north we go.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And we stop at Albi.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That\u2019s the name of the railroad station and town. And the Gestapo man must have called\nahead to the militia and said, I want a contingent of militia men, I\u2019m coming with some\ncriminals, whatever he must -- I don\u2019t know what he said, I just saw the result. There\u2019s eight of\nus, we\u2019re coming, get them out of the train, there\u2019s 40 black-clad, helmeted, armed, militia men\nfor eight guys. They didn't know it, that was that -- how many we were. So they send him 40\nmilitias. So -- and they told them -- and they only kept maybe a half a dozen to guard us. Put us\nin the truck and we wound up in this camp. And this camp was not for Jews or foreigners, this\ncamp was for the French resistance fighters that were caught by the Germans, or by the French\nsympathizers. You know, either -- either or, right? And they were going to get deported to\nGermany to do slave labor. The Germans use any kind of slave labor they could get their hands\non, and they were all young people, obviously. But this was a very upscale camp, as far as camps\ngo. Clean, neat, beds. They actually had some decent food. I was shocked. But I know that this\ncouldn\u2019t last, so after a few days -- now, it -- you gotta remember, I lived for five years with my\nuncle who was an officer in the French army, high ranking officer, and I used to hang out with\nall his cronies all the time, you know, the colonels and the majors and their wives, and all the --\nbecause they used to take me over for tea. In France there\u2019s a big thing, you have tea in the\nafternoon, you know, little cake, whatever. So I was young, they used to schlep me, my aunt\nused to schlep me along, all the ladies liked me, you know, I didn't make the nuisance of myself,\nso I knew how to, you know, behave. And I had the nerve, I asked for an audience with the camp\ncommandant. I had -- his name I remember. His name was [indecipherable]. He was a Corsican.\nYeah, I didn\u2019t think he was that bad because after the war they had -- they h-hu-hung him as a --\nas a war criminal, but I didn't think he was that bad [indecipherable]. Not for me, it\u2019s for the\nFrench people that he did in, you know? Anyway, so I said to him in my best military upper class\nvoice, I says, mon commandant, I know we are miscast here, we don\u2019t belong here, and if you\npermit me, I would tell you who to contact to get rid of us. Lo and behold, think that I sound one\nof his kind, picks up the phone, calls the commandant of Gurs. Now I know the guy loved me, I\nworked for him for you know -- and he says, I got this guy here, blah, blah, blah, you know, I\nunderstand you are -- you\u2019re -- you\u2019re in charge, would you take him? Oh, s-sure, send him over.\nSo again, in handcuffs, on the railroad, you know [indecipherable] such a wonderful with the --\nwi-with the regular people, you gotta understand. So they looked at us, man, some criminals, I\ndon\u2019t know. Was very embarrassing, you know -- tell you. And so we got --",
        "Q: All eight of you were sent?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: All eight of you were sent?",
        "A: Yeah, well I take the ra -- take the eight with me, what are we going to do, just me?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: When I was young I saved a lot of people, I got a flash for you. I really mean that, not a joke.\nWe'll get to that later, maybe. So, we get there, put us on a truck, drive us to Gurs. Now Gurs\nhad a big gate there, and be -- you know, the gate, 1t says Gurs and blah, blah, blah, big portal\nthat. And you know, the most touching scene I\u2019ve ever seen in my life, the whole administration\nof the camp was there to welcome us, on account of me. Now, that is touching. You know? The\nmost -- the police inspectors that I knew. The boss, his assistant and whoever else, was a whole\nbunch of people. Really very touching. And at that time, the camp that used to hold on the\naverage, 13,000 inmate, male, female or whatever, was down to 16 people. Germans worked\nvery good. From 13,000 to 16, it\u2019s not bad. And the reason that the French were able to save\nthem, they said we need maintenance personnel for the camp. Now, who did they keep is the --\nthe top of the line, of course. The doctors, the dentist, the lawyers, you know. A musician, I\nremember him. His sister was the nurse, and so on, so forth. So they were -- they were there, you\nknow? And then the -- the eight of us. And now all of a sudden we have 24, it was great. We also\n-- we \u00a7 -- still lived in the barracks, but not in the barracks barracks. We lived in the barracks that\nthe police inspector -- oh yeah, they also didn\u2019t need all the police inspectors any more because it\nwas only 24 people, right? They only needed administrative people. So they put us up, again I\nluck out. I got my own room, a real bed, a stove, you know? The only -- the only, the -- oh, 1-1t\ngets better, even. The only drawback 1s, in order to justify us, we all had to become lumberjacks.\nSo they took us out in one of those famous cars. Was a Chevy as a matter of fact, station wagon.",
        "Q: What, that was run on coal?",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: I mean on charcoal?",
        "A: A 1936 Chevy station wagon. And they drove us up in the woods, you know, like the\nmountains, the beginning of the mountains 1s woods. And the foresters had marked up the trees\nthat needed to be cut. Now, they were all dead oak. Now, oak by itself is very hard. If it\u2019s dead,\nit\u2019s like trying to cut steel. Not only that, you had to clear away the underbrush, you know? So\nfirst you had to clear the underbrush, I had -- well, I had the -- the other guys with me, eight guys\nand me. Teams of two there with the saws. You know those long saws that slightly curve\n[indecipherable]. So I was the hatchet man, the axe man because I have experience in Castelnot\nas a lumberjack. I did that for quite a long time in the winter over there. They send me in the\nwoods, they told me which trees to cut down all by myself. Anyway, so I have plenty experience,\nI was the axe man. So I was the one that had to clear the underbrush. And if you notice, if you\nlook at the tree, the roots grow up like this. The roots don\u2019t grow underneath, they grow outside.\nAnd when they\u2019re oaks and when they\u2019re like a hundred years old, I mean we\u2019re talking. So you\nhad to chop that up before you could get at the basic tree trunk, and the prerequisite was not like\nthe lumberjacks over here with the power saw at arm\u2019s height like this, cutting the thing, no. You\nhad to cut it right flush with the ground. Wonderful, wonderful exercise. And I have to decide\nwhich way the tree would fall, so I had to notch it in various ways, and then the saw team came\nand they went opposite of the notch, and -- and then we had to cut it in three foot lengths, you\nknow, stack the wood, cords of wood, and split it. I mean, can you imagine splitting trees that big\naround? Oh, such fun. And then at night they took us back. The reward was, we ate in the\nnoncommissioned officer\u2019s mess, and we wore civilian clothes. And that saved our life, because\nafter a little while, the Germans in Pau, in the commandanture must have heard that there\u2019s some\nJews around there someplace in Gurs. Will never do. So one night we\u2019re eating in the mess, and\nall of a sudden I see a pair of my favorite black suited militia come in. French. Okay. Get\nnervous already. Then I see another pair coming in. And another pair. So I said to the guys,\nwe're all eating at the same table, I says, look fellows, let\u2019s not make it obvious. Let\u2019s just go out\nhere one or two at a time like we\u2019re finished eating. We weren\u2019t finished eating but that was no\ntime to stick around, right? So we got out and [indecipherable] out and we saw -- see, there\u2019s the\nmain route, what they call route nationale was running alongside the camp. I told you, the camp\nwas like a mile long. Would you believe they had truckloads of these militia men that surrounded\nthe camp every 50 or a hundred feet, so that nobody could escape? So, what to do, you know?\nThe guy\u2019s already in the camp, but I happened to be very good friends with one of the -- it was\none of the older police inspectors in his -- must have been 40\u2019s or some like that. And he was\nmarried and he was still living in the camp, across the street in Quonset huts. Very civilized\nthough, and he had two kids. So I have one guy with me also, big guy, but he was a real baby. He\nsays, what are you gonna do, what are you g -- I says, what, I\u2019m going to try to sneak through the\nwire and run across to in -- 1t was night, and see whether this inspector would put me up\novernight until they have left and done their dirty deed, right? He\u2019s like, please take me along,\ntake me along. I says, hey man, what are you crazy, nobody knows you. Well, he made such a\npest of mys -- of himself, I took him along. So -- you -- you remember, it was the war, so there\u2019s\nblackout, there\u2019s no lights anyplace. Knock on the door and either he or his wife open up the\ndoor, I says, blah, blah, blah --",
        "Q: Kurt, excuse me, I have to stop, cause we need to stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "Q: All right, so you\u2019re now in the process of escaping with this other guy, and you\u2019 ve knocked\non the commandant\u2019s door and the wife answered.",
        "A: No, not the commandant, one of the inspectors.",
        "Q: Oh, I mean one -- one of the inspectors, I\u2019m sorry, right.",
        "A: Yeah. And I says -- explained my situation whether we could come in and you know, I have a\nproblem. Oh, she pulls us in, and explained to them. Oh, she says, sure. Now you gotta\nunderstand how good the French are. I listen to them being torn apart all the time, and I don\u2019t\nlisten to this. She had two children. First thing she did, she took the kids out of bed, where did\nshe put them to sleep, I don\u2019t know. Then, I haven\u2019t slept in a bed in how long, I don\u2019t know how\nlong. She goes ahead and changes the sheet. I said, lady, you don\u2019t have to change the sheet. She\nchanged the sheet. Now, you know why I say that. You couldn\u2019t get soap in France, or stuff you\nuse to do a wash. I mean a -- I\u2019m telling you, it -- it -- 1t was a horror show. So she insisted on\ngiving us fresh sheets. So we spent the night there, we slept together in the bed, of course, and\nthen the following morning we went back and we saw how much damage the German did.\nCouple of guys managed to get lucky, but they got a few, you know. And then that was a signal\nfor me that it\u2019s getting towards the end, you can not hang out here any more. So I took a gamble.\nI was -- I told you, when I was the orderly there at this little room, the recepti -- reception room,\nand next to me was the radio operator, you know, in touch with who knows what. So his name\nwas Otis. So I go and see him, I says, Otis, gotta ask you something. Do you by any chance\nknow anybody on the underground that\u2019s a guy that takes people over the Pyrenees? Took a\ngamble. Could have handed me over to the police, too, right, or the Germans? Says, let me see,\ncome back in a little while. He set up an appointment with me -- for me with some mountain type\nguy, and we met, supposedly some sort of bridge, I -- I could get out, you know. I me -- I worked\nfor the assistant and he -- he had the gate right behind his house, so I knew how to get out of the\nplace without getting through the barbed wire. So I met him, and meanwhile it became known\nfor some reason that I was gonna get out of the camp. And the next think I know, I got four guys\nbugging the bejeebers out of me to take them with m -- with me, along. There was only one\ndrawback. After I saw the guide, he says it\u2019s -- argument-wise, 5,000 whatever it is per person. I\nsays Okay. I had -- I always had some money, I worked. Even in the camp when I was the orderly\nI made money, fine. Always had money. But the other dudes didn\u2019t have any money. So what are\nwe gonna do? I have to rustle up a fortune of money. So in the middle of the night we used to\nsneak out of the camp and sell everything we could get rid of, we didn\u2019t need. So eventually --\nand then I went to some guy I know who had a lot of money, and I says, look, blah, blah, blah,\nI\u2019m shy so much money, how about it? So he gave it to me. So finally I have got all the money\nand when we went out the camp at night, was the winter anyway, it was January the 21, 1944 --\nso I gave him the money and the money wasn\u2019t for him. He -- during the day they had to hide us\nin a farmhouse and the farmer had to feed us. In order to buy food they needed money, that\u2019s\nwhat the money was for. And you know the Pyrenees fooled me a lot. I had no idea, I\u2019m telling\nyou, I\u2019m naive in every re-respect. Only once though, you don\u2019t do it twice with me. But the first\ntime around, anything goes. I saw the mountain, I says, oh, you climb that mountain, on the other\nside is Spain, no big deal. Imagine my disappointment when we get on top of the mountain,\nwhat\u2019s across the s -- from me as far as I can see, another mountain, just as high. Well, there\nwere six of them. I\u2019Il make it short because w-we don\u2019t have a week. The last week -- the last\nday, we hit the glacier, we were that high up already, you know, past the snow line, glacier.\nNow, we weren\u2019t exactly dressed. Remember this is between January 21, and January 27\",\nalright? And in the mountains that\u2019s not exactly summertime weather. And especially without the\nproper equipment. So we hitting this glacier -- oh, by the way, those guides were all volunteer.\nThey walked the whole night, and then they c -- they -- they could walk much better than us,\nthen the following -- well, the following morning, they ran back to the -- their day job. Some of\nthem were e-engineers on a -- on a train. Some did ta -- they -- th-they did that -- they didn't get\nany sleep for 24 hours. They did that without a nickel of remuneration. The money was strictly\nfor the farmers so they could buy food for us. Logical situation, which we didn\u2019t know but we\nfound out. So we climbed during the night. The reason that it took so long -- there\u2019s a perfectly\ngood road that goes along in the valley, the only trouble is that it\u2019s patrolled by Germans,\nbecause that\u2019s the road between Spain and France. So we went over every mountain without any\nroads whatsoever. Was horror show. I once fell down the side of a mountain cliff just like that.\nAnd it\u2019s just like in the movies, th-the only thing that stopped me between heaven and earth,\nthere was this shrub sticking out from that cliff. And I get ahold of it. So now I\u2019m looking up and\nI see the guys on top and I look down below. And the guides came, he was like s -- more of a\nmountaineer, right? You see, there was -- the pass was that wide, there was no light. And it had\neroded, there was a hole like that and I didn\u2019t see, and I stepped right in that hole. The way we\ncould see is -- you know what a musette is? That\u2019s like a bread bag that they have in France for\nthe soldiers or for anything, a -- a bag, and they\u2019re usually in light canvas. So, was flung over the\nback from the guy, so that\u2019s what you were focusing on because him you couldn\u2019t see, you\nknow? Phew. So he came and got me back up again. Oy. That was scary. I didn\u2019t scream, either.\nNot a peep out of me, I wasn\u2019t giving anybody away.",
        "Q: So you were walking for six nights?",
        "A: Mm-hm. And I mean, walking up the mountain is bad, you can\u2019t believe what it is to walk\ndown the mountain. You can\u2019t walk down the mountain, you run, because there\u2019s no way --\nanything to stop you. It\u2019s so steep, you run.",
        "Q: Now one of these guys had a little dog with him, didn\u2019t he?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, tha -- tha -- that\u2019s nice. That -- I-I said to him -- that\u2019s the guy whose\njob I got through -- you know, who did some tricks, but he loved his dog. Okay, fine. A small\nGerman Shepherd, or young German Shepherd. I says, he is totally insane, I couldn\u2019t talk him\nout of it. All right. So the first step, the first night, we\u2019re on the -- off a cliff 1-in a shepherd\u2019s hut,\nyou know, trying to get a little warm, you know, and get a little rest. And it was on a cliff\noverlooking down below. After a little while, whatever it was, we\u2019re walking out of there and\nI\u2019m the last guy out and I happen to look down there. Down there\u2019s a German patrol with a\nShepherd, and the Shepherd is barking to beat the band. Why? He smelled the other dog. Not us\nso much as the dog. Man, did we have to run, and the guy didn\u2019t even have any pepper or\nanything like that he could have sprinkled around on the track. That was a good one.",
        "Q: But the dog he had never barked?",
        "A: No [indecipherable]",
        "Q: That\u2019s quite amazing, right?",
        "A: Look, I don\u2019t analyze things, not at that time. Later on you have time to analyze. While it\u2019s\nhappening there\u2019s no psychoanalysis, you know? So after six days we\u2019re now faced -- oh yeah,\nexcuse me. On the six days we met two more groups. One group was people that were very well\nheeled, with the proper equipment, you know, mountain equipment you know, and -- and the\nshoes with spikes, and then the right kind of rucksack, you know, and the nice warm clothes, you\nknow, filthy rich people. They didn't like it any more either. I don\u2019t know whether they were\nJewish or not, most -- more likely they\u2019re not. And lo and behold I inherit five allied flyboys.\nFour Americans and a British. They have -- have been channeled by the French underground all\nthe way back to where our meeting point was. You know, the French used to hide them at night.\nYou know, maybe they came all the way -- I don\u2019t know from where, but they were shot down\nover, you know, German territory. So for some reason they -- the rich people went their own way\n-- they elected me as their leader. Okay? I\u2019m not a soldier or anything like that, I\u2019m their leader,\nhallelujah. Same way I was the leader of the other dudes. They all were older than me. So we\u2019re\nfacing this glacier there, sheer wall. So the mountain man, he has this pick, you know this -- they\ngot these things, they\u2019re those picks, and he\u2019s hacking a step into the ice, one step at a time. So\nhere -- it\u2019s like a bunch of monkeys, we\u2019re all hanging on for dear life, one hand in this -- in -- in\nthe step and the other one was standing there, and the guy in front of you 1s standing there.\nFinally you make it to the top. And the top is one sheer field of ice, going down like this.\nAnyway you want to look at, sheer ice. Well, we get to the top and guide says to me, well okay,\nthis is th -- that -- this 1s one for the ages. You follow that river, and that will lead you to\ncivilization. I said to him, river? What -- what the heck are you talking about? I don\u2019t see any\nriver. I have 20/20 vision, didn\u2019t see any river. I says, you\u2019re in -- you\u2019re not going to leave me\nhere. You take me where that river allegedly is. Comes with me and it was ice, I\u2019m telling you,\nit\u2019s like I said, it\u2019s a sheer glacier. So -- and underneath, all of a sudden, there\u2019s a slight\ndiscoloration underneath the ice, it\u2019s grayish. He says, you see that? That\u2019s the river. You follow\nthat, okay? That\u2019s how a river starts someplace, I guess. I can vouch for it because it turned into\na river. So like good pedestrians, we walk on the right side of nothing, underneath the ice. And\nslowly, slowly -- if you ha-have ever been to New Hampshire, you see in those rapids over there,\nsplashing over the stone. Scary. Not very deep, but scary when you don\u2019t know that. So all of a\nsudden, we\u2019re on the right side and there\u2019s no place to walk any more because there\u2019s a sheer\ncliff like that, the -- the river must have gouged it out. But the opposite side 1s perfectly nice and\nflat. There\u2019s only one thing wrong. By now that quote, no river, was maybe, let me see, I want to\nkeep it within the framework of reality. Maybe 40 - 50 feet wide. And it\u2019s [indecipherable]. So\nwe took off our shoes and then we looked whether there was a stone to step on, and we made it\nto the other side. Now the other side was mud, but was plenty room to walk, and it was like the\nGrand Canyon. It was completely gouged out like this, yo -- you know? It -- like a cover. And\nwe kept on walking and walking and walking and walking, there\u2019s hours, you know. And the\nonly sound that you heard once in awhile was the axe of a lumberjack, someplace, you know,\nthat carries very far in the -- in an icy neighborhood and in the woods with no other noise, you\nknow? And once in a blue moon we saw a Spaniard. Now, two of the guys were Spanish Civil\nWar veterans, so they spoke Spanish, so [indecipherable] you know, whatever, so a -- ah -- they\nthought we were Spaniards. Here goes. We come around the corner, and we froze. What\u2019s in\nfront of us like -- hard to say accurately, let\u2019s say 500 feet. A platoon of Germans with trucks and\neverything. I says, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. And you know who was the most scared? Hate to tell\nyou. The soldier boys. They were going to hightail it. I says, boys -- I spoke English -- as -- not\nas well as now, but spoke some English enough to get by. I says, hold it. If these are Germans\nthey\u2019re going to shoot you the minute you start running. Let\u2019s take it easy, they don\u2019t seem to be\nall that dangerous. They keep on staring at the Germans there. German helmet, German boots,\nGerman uniforms, German everything. Something -- and all of a sudden I saw what was\ndifferent. The belt and the bandoliers were bright yellow. Well, the Germans are either brown or\nblack. So then I knew they were Germans. So we had no choice but to walk up to them. So the\nallied sold --",
        "Q: The soldiers were not German.",
        "A: Of course not, not with a b -- yellow bandolier, you know, and a yellow belt. With -- the\nGermans have black and -- or brown. You know, that\u2019s what -- that\u2019s what stopped me, I knew\nthere was something different. And so we walk up to them, and the other guys identified\nthemselves as allied soldiers, showed their dogtag, whatnot. They put them on the truck, drove\nthem to the nearby embassy in -- it must be Bilbao or some town there, I don\u2019t remember. Okay?\nThey were home free. Us, we don\u2019t deserve, because we weren\u2019t the only guys that came across,\nwe don\u2019t deserve no trucks. We haven\u2019t walked enough, only six days, or six nights. So we\u2019re\nwalking, and we\u2019re schlepping, we\u2019re schlepping. The next thing we know, they threw us into a\none cell dungeon, the filthiest place I ever seen in my life. Window up there, no place to sleep or\nnothing. So the following day we wind up -- I don\u2019t know whether we got on a truck, I don\u2019t\nremember. I can\u2019t swear, I ga -- what I can\u2019t swear to, I\u2019m not saying. We wind up in Bilbao.\nWhere did they take us? To Spanish Gestapo headquarters. Pure marble everything. I don\u2019t mean\nthe outside, I don\u2019t mean the wall, I don\u2019t mean the floor. I mean the benches you sat on, all\nmarble. This is after Franco [indecipherable], I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- this is 1941 -- \u201944, and the war\nis over in \u201939, and they were poor as church mice, proverbial. So each and every one go -- gets\ninterviewed. Now, obviously we didn\u2019t come along with papers. Now being that I\u2019m as good as\nany Frenchman ever was, all of a sudden I\u2019m French. Took my France -- French name,\nbirthplace, the whole thing. The only thing that I did, I lied. The only time in my life actually --\nyou don\u2019t have to believe me, but it\u2019s true. I fudged my age. All of a sudden I was 17 years old. I\nlooked very young, I was emaciated, haven\u2019t eaten in four years. So, you know, I looked very\nyoung. They bought it. Saved my life.",
        "Q: How\u201d",
        "A: Well, if you were of army age, right? Meaning 18 - 19 - 20 - 21 or older, you wound up in\nMiranda. Miranda was a death camp like Andersonville from the Civil War. Just as bad as the\nGerman concentration camps. Just as bad. So I wound up with the old people and the children.\nFantastic. Wound up in a little rest -- no, first in town they put us up in a real nice restaurant, the\nfirst decent meal I had had in five years -- four years, okay? Of course I was with the French, you\nknow, I was French. No paper, but I was French. And nobody was going to say I\u2019m not French.\nNobody would believe me if I would have told them, which at one time I did, and nobody\nbelieved me anyway. Couldn\u2019t be. Couldn\u2019t be that I\u2019m not French. Okay, fine. So the following\nday they take us and we wind up in a small -- let\u2019s say town, way up in the mountain and in a\nnice, little hotel. Now I\u2019m living, together with older people, you know. I don\u2019t know how many,\nlet\u2019s say 15 -17 or so. And we were plenty of food. The Spaniard for some reason had food, and I\nwant to tell you how that came about. The -- they -- they tho -- spanic -- spa -- Spain is very arid\nand poor, and all they grew was olive and o-oranges. Well, how come they had food? Well, for\nevery allied prisoner that they turned in to the allies, the United States gave them a 75 kilo bag of\ngrain, or 175 pound bag of grain. Wheat. And they paid them X amount of dollars per prisoner.\nSo they had a marvelous business to -- even though they were leaning towards Hitler -- you\nknow, Franco, well, you can\u2019t pass up a good deal like that. The allies were smart. So they\nbought all of their prisoners and th-that\u2019s how come the Spaniards had food. And at for -- they\ngot strangest eating ours, but that\u2019s not here nor there. At four or five o\u2019clock in the afternoon\nthey made chocolate, you know, hot chocolate? But they don\u2019t make it like powder, they take\nchocolate bars, and you know when the chocolate is finished, you can put a spoon in and it stays\nupright, that\u2019s how thick that chocolate is. But we had a lot of nice food there. That didn't last too\nlong. Then they threw me again in another camp with hundreds upon hundreds of hundreds and\nhundreds of French people, young people, also refugees from France, also in the mountains, and\nthey put us 1n a -- well, that must have been the spa in peacetime, you know, like a big hotel, and\nwith plenty of rooms, and -- and -- and dining room and things like that. So we stayed there for a\nlittle while and then they transferred us to another one that was actually even nicer, but by that\ntime it\u2019s already going on towards spring. Now anybody that tells you that Spain is warm 1s\nmistaken, he has never hang -- hung around northern Spain, it is freezing. It 1s freezing. And we\nalways had to get out there for the colors, you know, like -- you know, when they raise the flag\nand things like? One night we -- we had to stand there. One of their things, what can I tell you?\nAnd then we wound up -- oh yeah, and I -- I was under the misconception that oh, Pll get out of\nhere in no time flat, you know, wound up in North Africa. So I never bothered learning Spanish.\nSo one month goes by, I\u2019m still there. Two months goes by, I\u2019m still there. After three months a\nlight goes on, I says, fella, you were vastly mistaken, you\u2019re net gotten -- you\u2019re not getting out\nof here so fast, better learn Spanish. Not bragging, stating facts. I learned perfect Spanish in three\nweeks. I was so good in Spanish that I used to write love letters for the -- for the fellas to write --\nto send to the girls.",
        "Q: Before you learned Spanish, where did you think you would go? Why did you --",
        "A: North Africa, of course.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: That\u2019s where the French were, free French.",
        "Q: I see, so you thought the Spanish would send you there?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: What [indecipherable]",
        "A: Not the Spanish, the Spanish hand me over to the free French who\u2019d take care of me.",
        "Q: No, that\u2019s what I meant, that\u2019s what you expected them to do.",
        "A: Yeah, and they eventually did. The only problem was the French had the marvelous system.\nYou could tell them any kind of fairy tale like I found out in the Foreign Legion, not for myself,\nbut for other people, and by the time they had you screened, which took a few weeks, you gotta\nreme -- realize that French was occupied territory, they knew exactly who you were. They knew\nyour police record if you had one. They knew where you were born, you knew -- they knew your\nreal name. That -- they let you tell them anything you wanted, but they wanted to investigate and\nthey could find out. So naturally I didn\u2019t have any papers, I have to come clean. So what was my\nchoice? The Foreign Legion. I wanted the French army, right? Couldn\u2019t do it. I wasn\u2019t French,\nyou know, and they didn\u2019t -- you know. So I wound up in the Foreign Legion. And the Foreign\nLegion, eventually we were sent to Casablanca, you know, from[indecipherable] which is\nGibraltar, to Casablanca, you know, these -- take the ship there. It\u2019s across the Straights, it\u2019s very\n-- you know, the two oceans collide, the Mediterranean and the Pacific -- and the -- and the\nAtlantic, and let me tell you, it\u2019s not a peaceful meeting.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Whew, my God, unbelievable. That was my second sea storm, but anyway -- well that one\nwas the first one, anyway. And so we wound up in a big army base in Casablanca and they\ninterrogate me and the British were there that were doing the interrogation and they were very\nthrilled with all the information I could give them about the Atlantic Wall. You see, what, where,\nhow much, how fast, how big, how deep, what was the weaponry, what -- I had all that\ninformation and [indecipherable] to get a guy firsthand information, okay? So we were together\nwith French Colonial troops and there also were Americans on the base. Now I said to myself,\nthe Foreign Legion, I\u2019m not that crazy about it. From what I hear, it\u2019s not a place to be. So I saw\ntwo army officers, American, coming by. Being that I spoke a little English, I went up to them, I\nsays, \u201cGentlemen, excuse me, I would really like to join the American army.\u201d Oh, obviously they\nwere from the quartermaster depot. They were uninterested, you know? That was my chance of\nserving in the American Army. I knew that the Foreign Legion was going to be the absolute pits\nof the world, which it was, but that\u2019s a -- you know. So -- and I saw the strangest things there.\nThe Moroccans were the nicest of all Arabs, I tell you. The further east you go, the worst they\nget. The Moroccans are the nicest. The Algerians already, forget it. The Tunisian, no good.\nLibya, after that, forget, it\u2019s the end of the world. But the Moroccans aren\u2019t bad. They were real\nnice. That\u2019s the first time I saw pot. I didn't know what it was.",
        "Q: Saw what?",
        "A: Pot. Marijuana. And [indecipherable] in the bags just sitting outside, and there\u2019s this\nMoroccan dude, some older gent. He pulls a tiny little s -- white ceramic pipe, with a thimble\ntype bowl. And he\u2019s stuffing the thing. And I said to him, in French obviously, I says, what\u2019s\nthat? He said, kief. You want a shot? Do you want to try it? I said, oh, no thank you. So kief is\nthe first time I met with marijuana. He was smoking kief.",
        "Q: Right. You -- you were fighting, am I -- am I correct?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: You were -- you were actually fighting at some point, at the end of the war?",
        "A: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: In France and Germany?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. You know, after they screened us and blah, blah, blah, and I was attached to this\nFrench legion division, and to that one and this, that, eventually we wound up in the desert as an\nassembly point, then we took the LST\u2019s, you know, the big landing craft, you put the doors open\nin the front? And we went from [indecipherable] to Marseille. Marseille was a French port, we\ncould -- right into the town, you know, because the -- like, what they call the [indecipherable]. It\nwas like the -- a wall, you know, a -- what you would call a seawall, you know, you could -- and\nyou just dropped the doors and it went over, it was very -- actually it was be -- between me and\nmy lieutenant we were the first one off the ship, you know? And so --",
        "Q: Let -- I think I have to stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape Seven\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "Q: Okay. So you\u2019re on a -- some sort of a vessel, right, that goes into Marseille and --",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. We\u2019re landing in Marseille, and then we follow up the Rhone river valley,\nbecause it had been clear already by previous troops, Americans possibly, you know, I don\u2019t\nknow. And what amazed me the most and what most people don\u2019t realize was how rich a country\nFrance was. The Germans had to abandon all the cars that they took from the French trying to get\nhome with them. On each side of the road -- this is hard to believe -- for, let\u2019s say a minimum of\nthree - 400 miles, were abandoned cars, three rows of abandoned cars. Now, can you picture how\nwell the French were doing?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s for hundreds of miles, three beside. Anyway, we went -- we wound up at the triangle --\nthe triangle of [indecipherable], Vivier, and I forget the other town, and there we have a little\nstopped, and then we hit -- oh what\u2019s -- what\u2019s the town called there? Belfort. And you know,\nthat\u2019s -- you know, little fighting, little this and we are stuck in mud again. The halftracks are\nstuck, the trucks are stuck. I mean, it\u2019s unbelievable the mud, and it\u2019s like where the Ardennes\nare, the Vosges come together, you know, the mountains where all the World War I battles were\nfought. S-Same story all over the world, never changes. And then we slowly, when it really gets\ncold, we advance into Germany. Actually, we stayed in Alsace-Lorraine near Strasbourg for a\nlittle bit, and then, sometime later, must have been April or something, we crossed the Rhine at --\nI don\u2019t know, a -- a -- a -- where. The Americans had built a pontoon bridge, you know, and one\ncami -- one -- one truck at a time, you know, boom, boom, and then we\u2019re rolling into Germany,\nand things like that. And then we went from one village to the next, from one town to the next.\nAnd then eventually we wound up in this lovely, lovely little town, shortly before the end of the\nwar, and the people were very nice. Got myself a girlfriend obviously, and that\u2019s first thing I did.\nHad p -- I had plenty of freedom, I was -- I don\u2019t know whether -- I didn\u2019t mention it, I won\u2019t\nthink so. As a private first class, that\u2019s as h -- far as I got, I was running the motor pool. Can you\nimagine that, all by myself? No stripes, no nothing. I had more clout than any officer ever had. I\nran the whole motor pool. Jeep, GMC trucks, Dodge trucks, halftracks. You name it, I ran it all. I\nordered the parts, wa -- I used to be -- I-I told you, I spoke some English. So all the orders have\nto be written or filled out in English, because requisitions were in English.",
        "Q: Why were they in English?",
        "A: Well, the Americans were supplying us.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: We got supplied by the Americans. Food, weapons, uniforms. Everything was American, you\nknow? And that was great because -- as long as the war lasted. After that it wasn\u2019t so good. So\nanyway --",
        "Q: So at this point, how much do you know about what the Nazis have done in --",
        "A: At that time we weren\u2019t talking Nazis any more, we were just talking fighting the Germans.",
        "Q: I know you -- I know you weren\u2019t necessarily talking about it, I want to know what you knew.\nDid you know anything?",
        "A: Wa --",
        "Q: Did you know [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- I knew from before, I knew that there were Auschwitz, and that people didn\u2019t come out of\nit. That\u2019s what I knew from --",
        "Q: Did you know there were gas chambers? Did you know that people were being gassed?",
        "A: [ -- I -- I -- I -- I might have known, I can\u2019t swear to you -- to it, because this was very\nremoved from the stress of hour to hour living. We\u2019re not talking day to day, you know? Even\nwhile I was in Castelnot, it was never a relaxing thing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Either I was totally exhausted from work. There was -- for weeks I couldn\u2019t straighten out my\nhands after six weeks of hoeing the vineyards.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They were cramped like that.",
        "Q: No, the only reason I\u2019m asking you Kurt, is not to be critical or anything, it\u2019s a question of\ntrying to figure out what people knew when, and what difference did it make, that\u2019s all.",
        "A: For -- for -- for -- for -- \u00b042, it was a -- was a known fact. In \u201942 --",
        "Q: But you really didn\u2019t know what it meant at that point. But that\u2019s --",
        "A: No, it just meant death. That\u2019s the only thing that we knew, that the German were killing the\nJews in Auschwitz, you know.",
        "Q: Did you know there were other camps?",
        "A: In terez -- yeah, Theresienstadt, whatever, you know? Bergen-Belsen and d-d -- Dachau was\nwell known because that\u2019s in Germany. You know, Dachau and the -- and a couple of more there\nwhich escape me right now. So that we knew, because we knew that they didn\u2019t treat the Jews\nnicely when they picked them up.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They were very, very cruel and gruesome. I mean, they did it to their own people. Hitler used\nto hang his own bodies from meathooks, you know, when he was unhappy with them, so you can\nimagine how well they treated the Jews.",
        "Q: Did your mother and father lose family?",
        "A: Yeah. My mother lost a sister.",
        "Q: Is that the sister who stayed with her grandmother?",
        "A: No. No, no.",
        "Q: I mean, the grandfather.",
        "A: The oldest one, the oldest one.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The oldest one that didn\u2019t want to send my namesake boy --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- to live with my aunt in France. They stayed there, they died. That\u2019s her side of the family.\nMy father\u2019s family, everybody, his father, 85, his two brothers, his sister that married a Catholic,\nand the nuns hid her and her daughter, because you see, because you\u2019re married to a Catholic,\nand Jewish, doesn\u2019t count. It even makes the guy that married you a prime target for retribution,\nyou know? So she swore that if she ever got out of that alive, that shell convert to Christianism -\n- or Christianity or whatever. So -- and then her two children were obviously -- well, not\nobviously, they were born Jewish. You know what I\u2019m saying? But, you know, they were half\nand half, so it\u2019s very hard to say. So my father was the most people, because he had -- my -- my\ng -- grandfather died before. My grandm-mother died before him on my mother\u2019s side. My\nmother got out, my aunt in France got out, my aunt in England got out. It\u2019s only the sister that\ninsisted, oh, they\u2019re not going to touch us.",
        "Q: One of the sisters stayed with your grandfather.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s the youngest one.",
        "Q: And did she get out?",
        "A: Yeah --",
        "Q: She got out, uh-huh.",
        "A: -- in 39 she got out to England, it only cost everything.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The house, the store, every kind of last nickel that she had.",
        "Q: When you met up with your parents after you -- I know you were very sick at the end of the\nwar, you had amoebic dysentery, yeah?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And you came back to be with your parents and you were still quite ill. Did you -- did your\nparents then know what had happened to other members of the family, by then, or not? You\ndon\u2019t -- or you don\u2019t know. Maybe you were too sick.",
        "A: Well, I can tell you, the business of living and staying alive was unbelievable. Let me tell you\nhow sick I was. There was nothing to eat in France, so my mother went around, she was very\ngood friends with the baker lady. She went over to the baker lady, trying v -- v -- everybody was\non ration, I mean the French, everybody, so -- trying to get a slice of bread for me or something\nlike that. Now, couldn\u2019t get a slice of bread, couldn\u2019t get nothing. Vegetables, yes. There were\nvegetables, you could get some eggs, chicken once in a blue moon, but no meat. Once in a blue\nmoon you got a -- a -- on your ration cards you got like a pound of meat for the month, or\nsomething like that. Maybe. Not sure yet. I rem -- I don\u2019t remember. I know one [indecipherable]\nwas over, you know. Or anyway. So she\u2019s sitting there with the baker lady, goes to show you\nwhat shape I was in, says, Monsieur Claude -- and my name was Claude in France, not Kurt.\nKurt and the French and the Germans, so Claude was a little safer. Ah, Monsieur Claude is such\na nice young man. What a shame he has to die. That\u2019s the shape I was in.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: See, the farmers, this was a farm community, are far more at ease with life and death than city\npeople.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: All right, we\u2019re not talking now, but you know, in [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So how long were you sick?",
        "A: God almighty. I'd sa -- I got back to North Africa from Germany, must have been June 1945.\nI must -- must have taken -- yeah, that was the second time I had maybe dysentery when we left\nfor France, you know, for the invasion. But that was the first time and that was quite -- quite a\nlong time, and the -- when I went back to France and I got some decent food, at midnight I used\nto go over to the farm ladies and says, could you maybe bake me a little apple pie or something?\nSo they did and I took care of myself, all right? I mean, the Americans supplied us too, but you\nknow, k-rations and such, it\u2019s not -- you know. But anyway, so I beat it eventually.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The second time, being that I had still the germ in me, obviously, it took two weeks before I\nwas flat on my back again. But being a soldier you have no choice. The Foreign Legion is not\ntoo much into people. The Foreign Legion is much more into equipment. They would sacrifice\n20 men to save a truck, easy, no problem. Oh, we\u2019ll get 20 more tomorrow, no problem.",
        "Q: When you went back to s -- when you went f --",
        "A: So anyway, just to answer the question --",
        "Q: Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.",
        "A: -- from July, all the way to the end of November.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a long time.",
        "A: Augu -- July, August, September, October, November, five months. And I looked it, I have\npictures to prove it.",
        "Q: Did your parents think you were alive? Did they -- did they have any idea where you were?\nSo when -- how did -- did you write to them first, or did you just walk up to the door, sick as you\nwere?",
        "A: But at that time -- at that time, from North Africa, which was French, I was able to\ncommunicate with my aunt and uncle.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I really didn\u2019t know at that time where my --",
        "Q: Where your parents were, right.",
        "A: -- parents were, but my aunt and uncle, or my aunt at least, was in touch with my parents, so\nhenceforth they knew I was okay.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But for quite a few years my parents didn\u2019t know --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- where I was, or whether I was alive, you know, that --",
        "Q: Right. And where were your parents when you finally saw them?",
        "A: In Castelnot Rivierbas, yeah.",
        "Q: They -- oh, they went there again, I see.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know what -- well, that\u2019s the place that they knew --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and they were well known there, and by that time they must have had some remorse, you\nknow, the police department and they treated them rather well, you -- 1f you know what I mean.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, right.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: Did you and your brother go to Grenoble?",
        "A: Yeah, my brother, from Castelnot -- I stayed a long time, I wasn\u2019t well, I couldn\u2019t walk let\u2019s\nsay from that end to that end. I mean, I couldn\u2019t, I was so weak. Anyway, my father got the\ndoctor. We had one doctor in the village, and he was very good diagnostician, and he prescribed\nlittle ampules. You know what ampules are? Glass vials and they\u2019re filled with cultures. So my\nfather t-take the train to the big city, have the prescription filled, come back with the prescription\nand then IJ a -- I drank this twice a day in some water. And eventually -- the doctor had it right on\nthe money, slowly, slowly, slowly. But the strength was slow in coming because there was no\nfood for me --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- to get strong on, or with. So --",
        "Q: So Harry goes first?",
        "A: Harry knew that in Castelnot there\u2019s only farm work, that\u2019s no future. So Grenoble was a\nwonderful college city -- university city actually, and in the house actually, little bit, you know.\nVery pretty, beautiful buildings. And he start -- he found a job there. And then, when I was\nstrong enough, well, I couldn\u2019t stay in Castelnot, again there was nothing there for me, so I went,\nand we both lived in the same sm-small room, furnished room that I had rented, and in the small,\nitsy-bitsy s -- bed with the sagging mattress until I started working and made a living and could\nafford my own furnished room, in the same place, of course.",
        "Q: Right. Now I understand that your parents and Harry left for the United States in 1947?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And why did they come to the United States if things were starting to go okay in France, do\nyou know?",
        "A: What my father going to do at that age?",
        "Q: He was over 60.",
        "A: He can\u2019t -- he can\u2019t make -- he can\u2019t make a -- in France he can\u2019t make the living, you -- it\u2019s\nnot like the United States, you come, you apply for a job, if the guy likes you, you get it. Uh-uh.\nOver there the papers, you gotta see. I got papers that you wouldn -- you wouldn\u2019t believe what it\ntakes in France to get a job, you know? So my aunt from Germany, the single one that stayed\nwith my grandfather, got to England, was in the United States and had married an American\nfellow, I think, and he had an extended family, wonderful people, and they put up the bail for me\nto come to the United States and for my parents. You know how much you have to put up for me\nwhen I came a year later? 10,000 dollars so I would -- shouldn\u2019t fall, you know, th-that the state\nwould have to take care of me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That\u2019s when you immigrate illegally -- or emigrate. That\u2019s the difference between then and\nnow. And not only that, had to go to the embassy in Paris and the doctor screened me like I was a\n-- a Michelangelo there. You know, checked me for being defect free.",
        "Q: Did you want to come to the United States?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Why not?",
        "A: I was doing very well in France, I had a marvelous job. Had a lot of respect, had 25 people\nworking for me. Imagine, I was a big 24 - 25 years old at the time. And -- and t -- they treated me\nwonderful. The only thing is that my parents and my brothers used to hound me with letters.\nHow can you stay there, you\u2019re all alone, you\u2019re all single, whatev -- first of all, I wasn\u2019t all\nalone. Number two, I had my aunt and my uncle in Vichys that I used to go and visit every once\nin awhile, my second set of parents, you know? And I had a girlfriend that took real good care of\nme.",
        "Q: So why --",
        "A: So what the problem, you know?",
        "Q: So why did you leave?",
        "A: They kept on hounding me to death.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: You can\u2019t stay there, da da da. I came over here -- of course, 1t was an experience, an eye-\nopener, because the United States, even though it was originally populated by white people from\nEurope, 1s so different from Europe, like night and day. There\u2019s no -- there\u2019s not even -- you\ncan\u2019t even compare. The closest you could conceivably come to compare one with the other is\nGermany and the United States. But even that is really a stretch. The attitude, the mentality, the -\n- it\u2019s totally different here. Look, I want to just explains to you how -- let\u2019s forget Hitler which\nwas the worst thing in the world. Happened to the world, not just the Jews. Germany had social\nsecurity under Bismarck, we\u2019re going back to the 19\" century, okay, okay? They were pretty\nadvanced, right? You work in France [indecipherable] twice, doesn\u2019t matter who your boss is,\nyou can change jobs five times a year. As long as you work a four months, you get credit for that\nfour months. For every month you work -- I\u2019m going back to 1948 -- 46 -- \u201947, you get one and\na half days vacation, right? Which means 18 days a year, working days. Plus a bonus, not your\nsalary, but a little extra, so you should actually be able to enjoy a vacation. I think that\u2019s very\nprogressive. You\u2019re not at the mercy of a boss. This is state mandated. You retire at the ripe old\nage of 60 with 80 percent of your earning. Over here you get Social Security, if you make 20\npercent you\u2019re doing real good. You -- you -- you know what I\u2019m saying? So there -- there are\ndifferences, and these are the large difference that you don\u2019t even know when you come here.",
        "Q: But did you like it when you came here?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. Do you like it now?",
        "A: Oh, I -- I -- let me put it to you this way. I just loved and admired the United States okay?",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Now, the way that things were set up and the way I was abused at the beginning, work-wise, I\nwasn\u2019t exactly my cup of tea.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: See, the first job that I had, took a long time to find, the minute they found out I was not an\nAmerican citizen, they cut my salary, that\u2019s for openers. Then they cheated me out of overtime,\nuntil I found out and of course, as much as my English wasn\u2019t as fluent as it is now, I eventually\ngot my overtime. But that\u2019s the attitude -- you know, how can you -- in France I never had to ask\nfor a raise. They came around to ask the supervisor, foreman, management, whatever, and says,\nwho do you have that merits raise this month? You never had to ask for a raise, if you were\nworth it. And we\u2019re working on merit there, not on bullshit. That\u2019s the big difference. So it takes\na little while to get used to this. No, the best thing that ever happened to me here was meeting my\nwife, and obviously I had the good sense and the perseverance to marry her.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I -- I mean, there\u2019s one philosophy I always had. Wherever you are, you marry a girl of this\nparticular country, you know. Like in France I had a French girlfriend. In Germany, I had\nGerman girlfriends, you know. So, no sh -- she was wonderful, it\u2019s -- I miss her big time, but --",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I can see myself, I guess, in some of the people around here. Especially, you go to\ndoctors, I mean, I have to see doctors, whether I\u2019m sick or not, I mean you have to go and see\ndoctors, blah blabber of all stripes. So you see people and you says, oh God almighty. You know,\nthey -- they\u2019re really -- they\u2019re really in a bad way, I mean, and they\u2019re still clinging to life with\neverything they got. I just don\u2019t understand it.",
        "Q: Tell me, when you look at the war years, do you think you missed out on a lot because of it?",
        "A: Oh yes. I never had a youth.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: From the time I was 17 until I was -- well, okay, I had a girlfriend in France, I tried to catch\nup a little bit. But for six years, forget it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I mean, not only was I in horrible places, you know, see I -- we can\u2019t discuss all the horrors in\ndetail, we just have to gloss over the whole thing. But when I think about all the things or places,\nwhatever happened to me, and the only way that I was able to handle it is because I was young.\nYou have no concept of anything. That\u2019s why whoever you send to fight a war is a young person.\nYou don\u2019t see 40 - 50 year old people going in the front line, getting themselves shot up. You\nfind 18 - 20 year old getting -- getting themselves killed. So it\u2019s the same thing with me. I didn't\nknow any better. That\u2019s the way it is, that\u2019s the way it is. But I felt bad when I had time to\nreflect, especially now, I says, gosh, I c -- I -- I couldn\u2019t have survived six months under the\nconditions that I had to live. I mean, we discussed a lot of things but we omitted an awful lot of\nhorror shows, you know. And that\u2019s basically all I can say. But of course my [indecipherable]\nsee, the nice thing is when I married Barbara, I had a ready made family. Her mother, her father,\nher brother, relatives, grandmother, you know, things like that. So then I felt like I sort of like,\nbelonged.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It\u2019s important, that feeling. You know, all by yourself you\u2019re floundering around, I mean,\nokay you\u2019re alive, you eat, you do this, you do that and whatnot. But it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s the feeling --\nbelonging is very important to me, you know. And so sh-she was just plain wonderful, you\nknow. Great. On top of that, she was over nine years younger than me, which was a good thing\nin retrospect, because she died. She was 70 or 71. So think about it, you know? If she wouldn\u2019t\nhave been younger, what -- what kind of a nightmare that would have -- and I could take care of\nher, wha -- you know, I took care of her all the rest of -- ever since the roof started caving in, you\nknow? She had the first open heart surgery in May of 1992, and the second one in December\nseventh, 19 -- yeah, 1993, in Houston by the biggest butcher known to mankind, Dr. Denton\nCooley. Wh-Why do I say that? Because he works on an assembly line, he doesn\u2019t take one\npatient at a time, he\u2019s got five or six or seven scheduled for the day. So, if he has to do a little\nmore that he didn\u2019t si -- foresee, that\u2019s too bad for the patient, sew \u2018em up.",
        "Q: Is there anything that we haven\u2019t talked about that you think we must talk about?",
        "A: Do you remember anything that needs to be said? I don\u2019t know. I mean, I -- what I can talk\nabout is I have the most wonderful daughters and grandchildren. My two daughters, one is 49\nand one is 44. They haven\u2019t given me, not as of late either, one minute of aggravation their\nwhole lives. Now, who has a parent can say something like that? And I was a very straight\nfather.",

I have a granddaughter and a grandson, they think I\nwalk on water. And I -- and my youngest daughter, at the ripe old age of 40 - 41, just after my\nwife died, sh -- fortunately my wife was able, at great, great, great stress, to come to the\nwedding, which I asked my daughter to have here in Florida, you know, at the western country\nclub. Small, because my wife can\u2019t -- you know. And so a -- but sh -- sh -- at least she saw her\ngetting married. She didn't know she was pregnant, you know? I -- I mean, nobody knew at the\ntime, and it\u2019s amazing, the minute she went off the pill, she conceived, and she was 40 years old,\nwhich 1s -- all her friends from college, they all with artificial insemination, this that, whatnot.\nCouldn't have a baby to st -- you know.

I mean bu -- and she didn\u2019t have any problem.\nI said to her, Leslie, if you take anything like money -- Mommy -- after Mommy, you\u2019ll pop the\nkid out like hotcakes out of the stove. Because my wife never had any -- she had a lot of\nproblems, you know, health-wise, due to what her mother did to her when she was a baby. But\ngiving birth she was a champion.

        "A: My father had a business in Cologne, and --",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. At that time -- we\u2019re talking in the 30\u2019s, it was very fashionable that lady used\nto wear lacy jabot and things like that.",
        "A: It\u2019s those --",
        "A: -- those things there that, you know, puffy lace, you know?",
        "A: And then also lace for decoration of various dresses, gowns, whatever. And also buttons in\nmother of pearl, and basically that\u2019s what it was. He had an office acro -- pretty much across the\nstreet in Cologne [indecipherable] where the eau de Cologne, which is called corniche eswassa,\nhave their offices. 4711 is the name of the cologne, which will be on every bottle, so his office\nwas across the street, you know? And a fairly large office with, of course, what you would call\nthe storage area for the product and whatnot. And few employees and a partner. So he was on the\nroad half of the time, selling, and then he switched with his partner and he stayed in the office\nand did the paperwork as it would be, and so on and so forth. And then of course when Hitler\ncame, and it was before Hitler was sworn in, he couldn\u2019t make -- he wasn\u2019t allowed to make a\nliving any more. You see, history has a way of being a little bit mistaken at times. He had to stop\nhis business 1n \u00b032, before Hitler was actually sworn in as the head man there, as it would be.",
        "A: Because Jews weren\u2019t allowed to have a business any more.",
        "A: And so my grandfather, who lived a few -- you know, few miles out in a very lovely town\ncalled Siegburg. And he had the very large house there. And so my father, mother and my\nbrother and I, we went to live there. And I lived there until 1933, August 17\", when I left for\nFrance and I got some French tutoring lessons before I went there, but I had taken French in\nwhat you commonly call in Germany, gymnasium.",

So I was in one of these and their main language was French. And obviously I\nhad the heads up for French, you know?",

        "A: Oh yeah. He was -- he was really strict, but he was perfect, you know? No nonsense, but he\nloved us very much. And he was on the road the whole week and he came home Friday night,\nyou know, for religious purposes, I guess, you know. And Saturday and Sunday and that allowed\nhim to catch up on his accounting for what he did during the week, also. So I saw him Friday,\nSaturday and Sunday, Monday he was gone again. And actually, I would say -- how old was I?\nMaybe seven, eight -- six, seven, eight years old, I don\u2019t know for sure, he got sick and tired of\ntraveling with those big sample cases, so he hired -- he bought a car and he hired a chauffeur,\nbecause he was not very adept at driving. That wasn\u2019t his forte. At that time obvi -- obviously he\nhad to shift, so he had the chauffeur and in the morning it was very nice, the chauffeur took us\naround the block to the school. You know, I was in what you call grade school, you know, it was\nvery nice. And oh, of course, that ceased after a little while, as -- it\u2019s quite obvious.",

It was a small town called Siegburg, which was very, very\npicturesque. I mean, without seeing a picture, you can\u2019t believe it, but -- and so my grandfather\nhad plenty of room there. She had three sisters who were, when I was born, maiden aunts, and I\nguess this is why I loved women, because I was always pampered, I was -- first of all, I was the\nfirst male grandchild around, so you know, it\u2019s -- left an impression on me, I had three lovely\naunts, you know?",

Didn\u2019t have the medications to keep\nyou alive and what not. And so four -- four of them lived. His twin died, he survived. He had two\nbrothers, and one sister. And they lived little bit further away in a beautiful town in the\nmountains, in the Eyffel. It was called Munster Eyffel. Minster is sort of like an abbey, and then\nEyffel is the mountain, you know.",

Children are closer to their mother than\nthey are to the father, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s normal, the father is on the road, he\u2019s working, and then of\ncourse, his family, his father was sort of like I don\u2019t know what, religious in the synagogue,\nsomething or something. And my sister married a Christian man, wonderful fellow who had a\nfurniture factory up in that particular place, refinishing antiques and all that, it was marvelous.\nHe had two children, a daughter and a son. The reason I say daughter first is because she was the\noldest, the son was second.

        "A: Oh, the same way -- we are not talking about oh -- I wouldn\u2019t insult my wife by calling her a\ncook, she was a chef, because what she could do without fat, cooking and baking, was mind\nboggling.",

        "A: Well, they didn\u2019t make a-any differentiation. There wasn\u2019t that much antici -- anti-Semitism\nin Germany in spite of what people will say. We went to school, school had catechism, so I sat in\nwith the Christian children and I got catechism. No big deal. I got my Jewish education after\nschool, you know? Several days a week we went and we had Jewish education in a different\nplace.",
        "A: Well yes, I mean, for the holidays yes, but when I went to my grandfather, very religious,\nFriday night synagogue, Saturday morning synagogue, Saturday afternoon or evening\nsynagogue, right?

        "A: His goons were running everything. And believe me, the terror that they initiated in the\npopulation -- we\u2019re talking Jews, you -- you have to live through it to understand the total feeling\nof terror, with the brownshirts, which was called the SA, sturm abteilung. Forget the SS, the SS\nis something totally different. And they were marching, had parades every Sunday, flags. Of\ncourse, you locked up your place and what not, and hoped that nothing bad would happen. But it\nwas frightening, I\u2019m telling you.",
        "A: Well, as a child you take everything in stride. The one thing that the Germans were fabulous\non, they created those what you would call Hitler type songs with the very marshall type music,\nand that appeals to the masses. You -- you have [indecipherable] every country has their own\ntype of marshall music. The Germans are the best. The French are not bad. The United States is\nso-so, because we\u2019re not really all that marshall. You know, we have a few songs. The Marines,\nyou know. A-And -- and -- and [indecipherable] the Navy, Air Force, but it\u2019s not really -- but the\nGermans, I mean, they have th -- a song for every occasion, or a march. And I\u2019m telling you,\nthere was one song I remember, and it\u2019s [speaks German here]. Translation - when blood -- when\nthe Jewish blood spurts from the knife, then things will be twice as good. So that\u2019s was a -- wa --\none of the lyrics in the songs. I don\u2019t know where people know these things. These are minor\ndetails.",

        "A: And on the radio, and wherever you went that -- and they had more, you know, that\u2019s just\none, that\u2019s the most bloody of them. Hate the Juden [speaks German]. I mean, hang the Jews, kill\nthe bosses, or something like that, I mean like that\u2019s the most marvelous songs. I mean horrible,\nhorrifying. If you were a Jew, and you understood this, the terror was unbelievable. And it didn\u2019t\nmatter, because he appealed -- first of all, the mistake was made in the tret -- Treaty of\nVersailles, where they made Germany pay unbelievable reparations that they couldn\u2019t handle,\nand Germany was really in a bad way. So, lot of people out of work and things like that, people\nwound up in prison, Hitler saw his chance. He took the worst elements out of prison, the people\nout of work, hung a beautiful uniform on them, nice jack boots, nice cap. [indecipherable] and\neverything, had them marching. Tried to get them job, oh, whatever you take away from the\nJews, you know, all right? So, th-th-these weren\u2019t the nicest people in the world that were\nenrolled in those troops, I can\u2019t call them strup -- storm troops, even though it says sturm\nabteilung, right? Sturm means storm, you know, but that\u2019s not the -- the SS is like I said,\nsomething totally apart. But they weren\u2019t nice people. The head man was Mr. Worm, and he was\nalso a very disreputable character, you know, out of prison, and all kinds of quirks shall we say.\nSo, it was horrible.",
        "A: No. Was --",
        "A: You see my father, the last free election, he volunteered for the election board.",
        "A: You know, because there was other people running than Hitler. And already at that time it\nwas a losing proposition because Hitler promised all kinds of things to the masses, which he\nactually implemented eventually, which the other people didn\u2019t have the nerve to come up with\nthings like that. So, you know, that\u2019s why I say, hit -- Hitler ran the show way before he was\nelected.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Well, when I went to my -- wh-when I couldn\u2019t go to Christian school any more, regular\nschool, and my next door neighbor, I used to be friends with the boy, he was a little bit older than\nme. I don\u2019t know whether he stopped being friends with me, I\u2019m -- I really don\u2019t know for sure.\nBut then I associated with all the children that went to the Jewish school that were in my grade,\nboys and girls, and things like that. So I did not associate with Christian children any more.",
        "A: No remarks were made, no.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Remember, in Germany you do what you\u2019re told, okay? As much as you\u2019re being loved, you\nfeel that that is the right thing, if your parents -- if your parents, your father, your mother tell\nyou, look, you\u2019re going to France to Uncle Pierre and Aunt Emma, you know, because things\nhere -- well, I realized how f -- how bad things were. So my father was smart enough, the oldest\nson, he got se -- out of Germany first. It was on my 11\" birthday, basically. And I got on the\nrailroad, on -- my aunt must have picked me up in Paris and we lived in Rennes at the time.",
        "A: Yeah, August 17\", 1933, I left Germany.",
        "A: Was a week after my 11\" birthday. And then I went to live with my aunt and uncle. My -- my\nuncle was a French career officer.",
        "A: He was a doctor, right? And he met my Aunt Emma during the occupation of first -- of the\nfirst World War. After the first World War, he was sent -- French troops were occupying the\nRhineland with the British. And he met my aunt in Germany, in her hometown, and they hit it off\nsomehow. And then of course, an officer 1s called to duty wherever it\u2019s called, so then he went to\nthe Middle East, and he went to the bak -- Balkans, and things like that. So they got married in\n1930 in our -- in our apartment in Cologne, they have a very large house. I mean house, a very\nlarge apartment.",
        "A: Actually, we had -- which was totally unheard of at the time, we had a bathroom like in the\nUnited States where the bath and the toilet and the sinks, everything is in one, and then we had a\nseparate toilet. And we had two entrances, one for the servers and one for the regular people. So\nit was quite large, and I remember the wedding quite well. And they got married by us, you\nknow, was [indecipherable] his family couldn\u2019t be there, was in Germany, his fra -- fa -- parents,\nhis brother lived in France. So anyway, so they got married there, this I remember, henceforth --\nand then she left with him to live wherever he was stationed, which was Rennes. And that\u2019s\nwhere I went.\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: My aunt was two to four years older than my mother. I think two years, maybe.",
        "A: No, no. She -- there -- she -- she looked pretty much -- they looked pretty much alike, my\naunt -- the one that I went to, and my mother. And -- and my uncle was born in \u201989, so by that\ntime it -- no -- yeah, \u201989 -- \u201989, it was \u201933, so what was he? 11 and 33 is 44 years old.",
        "A: No, obviously that --",
        "A: -- helped a lot. And he was like a second father to me, he was wonderful.",
        "A: He just -- they took me to their heart. Now, my aunt of course, that\u2019s family. But he a\nstranger. That\u2019s very -- the most wonderful man I ever met.",
        "A: Oh [indecipherable] fantastic.",
        "A: Fantastic, I mean, you know. And I lived with them for five years.",
        "A: Passed by very quickly.",
        "A: Oh, fantastic.",
        "A: Yeah, there I went through what they call in France this -- are we taping?",
        "A: In France they call it lyc\u00e9e, in Germany it\u2019s gymnasium.",
        "A: Okay? So they put me in this sixth degree. You come s -- like I say again, you start like in\ngrammar school, and you wind up, you know, with your baccalaureate.",
        "A: So they put me back one year due to the language, but within three months I rattled off\nFrench, with the proper accent and things like that. Well, I was only 11, so you catch on real\nquick. And as a matter of fact, even if I didn\u2019t understand everything, I remember one day -- the\neducation is a little different in France than it is here. It\u2019s mainly the arts and history and such,\nnot how to make a dollar. Over here it\u2019s much more sensible. They teach you economics and\nthings like that. In France, no. Ancient history and things like that. Some poetry. So I remember\nAesop\u2019s Fables, they were all translated into French 1n a big book by Mr. LaFountaine and they\nwere pretty strict in school, so we have to learn a fable per session, whatever it was. So I rehearse\nwith my uncle. So I rattled off that whole fable, perfect intonation, stop, go, whatever. My en --\nmy uncle looked at me and he said, do you know what you say? I says no. It was so perfect, but I\ndidn't know what I -- what I really was saying, you know? The thi -- that\u2019s when you\u2019re a child,\nyou mimic anything, and I did fantastic. Of course, later on I have to [indecipherable] same thing\nwith mathematics. They used to throw numbers at you, multipliclati -- multiplication, addition,\nsubstraction, a teacher went like this, like that, picked you and you better be on the ball. There\nwas no missing. That\u2019s how come you didn\u2019t need a calculator at the time. You know what I\u2019m\nsaying?",
        "A: You really knew how to calculate in your head. That -- these are the things that were\nimportant there.",
        "A: After me.",
        "A: But it took that long for my father to get all the permits, and to -- he was still able at the time\nto take all the furniture and everything that they had out of Germany, plus his money.",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t know how he did that, that was a serious piece of change. And then he went to\nParis, but of course, the French had accepted a lot of German Jewish refugees, also Polish for\nthat matter. And -- but the only thing, there were restrictions. You could not start a job in a\nfactory or anything like that. You had to start a business as it would be. So my father opened up a\nmeat cutting -- meat packing business, you know?",
        "A: Absolutely. The thing was, some of my mother\u2019s relative\u2019s children, they were butchers. So\nhe had two or three of them that did the work. My father was a businessman, he knew how to run\na business, and he\u2019s the one with the money, so he bought or rented the building, he bought the\ntrucks, he bought the machinery and he did the advertising. So it was hard -- you got to\nunderstand, France is a very culinary country. So to break in to the -- like what they call\n[indecipherable] which is the wurst, sausage business and ja -- ham and things like that, it\u2019s not\nthe easiest, so you have to really make a good product. But the Germans are fabulous when it\ncomes to sausages and such. So the boys were good, they made inroads, slowly. The only thing\nwrong about the whole situation was there were young boys. In the early 30\u2019s in France, \u00b034 -\n\u00b035 - \u00b036, everybody flocked to Paris. Americans, everybody, British, they loved it.\n[indecipherable]. So the boys discovered the races, they discovered the women, and they\ndiscovered gambling. Now, they were drawing a fairly decent salary, but that wasn\u2019t enough for\nthe lifestyle. So what they did, unbeknownst to my father, obviously, they looked at the delivery\nschedule for the -- today. So they filled the truck with all the stuff, and before the regular\ndelivery boys could start, they went to the customers and sold the stuff at a little discount. So\nwhen the regular discount -- ah, the regular driver came along, sorry, you delivered this morning.\nSo before my father found out, it was a little late. The business was shut there. So who was stuck\nwith everything? My father had to pay off the machinery, had to pay off the trucks, have to pay\noff everything. So whatever money you have goes down the sewer. And the guys, couple of\nthem, disappeared to the hospitality of countries such as Argentina. You know, a lot of these\ncountries have been populated by people that weren't totally clean in their native country, okay?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Only one of them was sort of like a relative.",
        "A: And he had nerve, what they call in Jewish chutzpah, unbelievable. He had his -- he had the\nnerve to come and had his clothes in my parent\u2019s apartment and he used to come and visit\noccasionally, and my father wanted to kill him. And he would have been able to do it, physically.\nSo my mother says, no [indecipherable]. So that\u2019s how come he survived. Now I jump a little bit\nforward. The war is over, the guy is alive, he went back to Paris -- he was hiding in the south of\nFrance, he was -- went back to Paris, opened up the same business, and he had the nerve to use\nmy father\u2019s trade name for his own business. But being that nobody was cheating him, he went\nto be very, very successful. I met him after the war, also.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Ah, well --",
        "A: -- we visited, she -- my mother came, and -- or I visited Paris, I mean.",
        "A: As a matter of fact, I remember I was a young kid, I was 11 - 12 years old, and my father -- I\ntell you, Paris was unbelievable, he used to take me to nightclubs where the White Russians, who\nfled the revolutions were dancing, the Cossacks and things like that, and the -- in France, it\u2019s\nokay. Children 11 - 12 years old, it\u2019s not a problem. So I went to all these places, you know?\nThat\u2019s when my father still was in business, you know?",
        "A: And then after the thing went, shall we say south, I have to use euphemisms, he had a\nmagnificent apartment in Paris. I think it was -- I -- I don\u2019t remember the exact name, it doesn\u2019t\nmatter. Fantastic, maybe seven rooms and things. Concierge, elevators, the whole bit. Couldn\u2019t\ncarry that one any more.",
        "A: So we had to entrench somewhat. Not that it was bad, we still had a concierge, and instead of\nseven rooms, we had now five rooms of -- you know, and things like that. So it wasn\u2019t really all\nthat bad, but then my father had to back to it -- to this -- his original business in Paris, you know.",
        "A: Oh, no [indecipherable]. Things were pretty decent. My father worked very hard, and my\nmother took a little job.",
        "A: You know, as a nanny to chi -- to -- to a child, you know?",
        "A: Very nice people. Jewish, of course. And so they made ends meet. And ma -- my mother,\nfood-wise, was easy to get along with. If you give her a pound of chocolate today, that\u2019s all she\nneeded. Skinny like that.",
        "A: It\u2019s genes. But sh-she knew si -- how to cook. I used to know how to cook, too. I remember\nwhen I went to Paris after, in 1937 to live with them, and my mother was working, my father was\nhome, or came home. My brother was there. I used to make French fries. In French they have\nthese special things, you know, like a container with a screen and the oil --",
        "A: -- and it bub -- and you know exactly when to throw the French fries -- the potatoes in, when\nthey pop up to the surface, I remember, I -- I wasn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t exactly a -- you know\n[indecipherable] as it would be, so I --",
        "A: -- you know. So I -- and later on, as a matter of fact, I was but -- I went to school in Paris, and\nI used to iron. I was the -- I must have been a big 15 at the time, I used to iron my -- when my\nfather came home, you know, we had this -- these two big suitcases where all the samples were\nin.",
        "A: And I used to refresh the -- like I say, the jabot, the lace creations, and I used to iron them. 15\nyears old. Think about that. Amaze.",
        "A: So that\u2019s -- I\u2019m telling you, I -- I was quite talented.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: N-No, he -- he switched over, he went --",
        "A: -- he went with my aunt and uncle. Well, it\u2019s good for them to have a child, you know.",
        "A: Of course you --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, well listen, he wasn\u2019t making the money he was used to.",
        "A: You know, and my mother had to, you know, have a little job, so it was easier for them. Of\ncourse I think they -- they sent some money, minimal amounts, even while I was there, to my\naunt and uncle --",
        "A: -- you know, so that it wasn\u2019t total charity case, you know what I\u2019m saying.",
        "A: No, no, no, it\u2019s totally different, it\u2019s totally different. I mean, my parents went through so\nmuch that they were very staunch and strong people of character. What is needed, has to be done.\nIt\u2019s no beating your breast and -- and -- and -- and -- and running to the shrink or anything like\nthat, uh-uh. They were far stronger than that, you know?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Oh that -- that -- that\u2019s the most amazing thing. I got Bar Mitvahs -- Bar Mitzvahed in\nGermany, my father\u2019s hometown, with the rabbi.",
        "A: We went back -- we went back to Germany, 1935.",
        "A: Honest. We managed. Just things are -- you -- you were still abe -- my aunt, my youngest aunt\nwas still living in Germany. So was my oldest aunt, okay? And my grandfather still had his\nhouse. My aunt sort of like hat -- she had haberdashery, beautiful, you know my -- see, when -- it\nwas customary when your daughters get married, to give them a dowry. Now, three of them were\nmarried. My youngest one -- aunt, was not. So instead of a dowry, he bought her a haberdashery.\nReally fine stuff. Really. And it was in the house, the bottom. Two show windows, central\nentrance, you know, the whole bit. She had decorators come and do the windows and whatnot.\nAnd I remember playing in there when I was a kid, I used to love it, you know, I -- on the\nholidays, you know, Christian holidays, people used to shop for shirts, hats, [indecipherable],\nties. I used to lo -- pla -- love to play with the ties. I used to know how to present a tie, you know,\nwith the knot and things like that. I was a kid, and the people loved to see me around there.",
        "A: So that part was okay. And so I went back, and of course I had to learn my Bar Mitzvah\nreading. I had at least a whole month to learn everything, not a year or two. And I went to the\nrabbi every day in the afternoon, when he had time.",
        "A: Yeah. No, no, no, that was in Germany.",
        "A: We went to Germany a month before so that I could get the teaching to read the Torah. Which\nI had only one month, I mean, I tell you, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not stupid now, but I was pretty\nbright as a young man, or child, you know.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: My mother went with me, sure.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t hang out too much. I went from my grandfather\u2019s place\nto the rabbi\u2019s place and back. And the synagogue was still standing and there was the Jewish\nschool where we eventually went because there was a Jewish center, a magnificent gothic\ncathedral, I mean like -- a -- a synagogue, excuse me. I mean, whoa, fantastic. Of course it was\nConservative with the mab -- women upstairs and the men downstairs, a separation, you know,\nwith the pulpit, this, that, what, the Torah, it was magnificent. Oak -- oak things there for\neverybody who -- who bought a -- a seat there, you know, like put your stuff in, your tallis, your\n-- your -- your tefillis, you know, the whole thing. And the [indecipherable] it was beautiful. And\nthen there was the Jewish center next door, and the bottom floor was the Jewish school where the\nrabbi taught the various grades of Jewish children, from the community, you know? I mean, it\nwasn\u2019t a hundred children, you know what I\u2019m saying, but they were -- ranged in age, let\u2019s say,\nfrom -- from I -- argument-wise, from let\u2019s say seven to 14 -15 maybe? I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I -- this I can\u2019t figure. I don\u2019t know whether she\u2019s -- I think she was still in business. It was\ndifferent. My father had a different kind of business, I think. And they had signs -- I don\u2019t even\nthink that they had signs on the stores that said Juden, meaning Jews. You know, you were s --\nnot supposed to buy there. Of course, the business must have fallen off drastically. But there\nwere some people that weren't so diehard, you know what I\u2019m saying? In a small town\neverybody knows each other. It\u2019s different than in the big city. You know?",
        "A: So henceforth -- the house was still -- my grandfather was still in the house. My grandmother\nhad died in 19 -- no, I don\u2019t know when she died. I want to say in -- I wa -- I think I was in Paris\nwhen my grandmother died. And then my grandfather died later, around \u201939, and my aunt stayed\nwith him, the single one, because she couldn\u2019t abandon him, it -- she felt obligated.",
        "A: And then she managed, at the last minute, to get shipped to England. Of course, whatever she\nhad, went. I mean, she couldn't take a nickel along.",
        "A: The store, the house, they took everything.",
        "A: But sh-she managed to go -- to get to England.",
        "A: From there, eventually she -- during the war actually, she transferred from England to the\nUnited States.",
        "A: Yeah, sort of. You -- a-and then you hear on the radio, when we -- the one thing I remember\nwas [indecipherable] Olympics, you know, with Jesse Owens.",
        "A: \u00b036.",
        "A: And Hitler occupying the Rhineland. And we thought for sure they gonna cut him off at the\npass.",
        "A: The French, they had the --",
        "A: -- they had the biggest army in the world. Two million people [indecipherable] arms. All they\nhad to do is move. They moved out of the Rhineland, they weren't supposed to occupy the\nRhineland, Hitler moved into the Rhine -- this I remember, and my uncle, who was a military\nman, couldn\u2019t understand that the politicians screw everything up, you know. Why they didn\u2019t\nmove? Go figure.",
        "A: No. No, no, no, no, that -- it was a shock, as it would be --",
        "A: -- already.",
        "A: So you know, you get shocked often enough, it doesn\u2019t shock you any more.",
        "A: No, no, that --",
        "A: -- that was anschluss.",
        "A: They\u2019re German speaking people and they did [indecipherable] Austria and then a little bit\ntricky was Czechoslovak -- I think, was Czechoslovakia in 1938?",
        "A: 1938?",
        "A: And that was a bad one. And so by that time, he was getting stronger and stronger and\nstronger. He had Austria on his side, he owned all of Germany, now he had Czechoslovakia, hey,\nhey, hey, hey, we\u2019re becoming a big power. And everybody loves it, nobody does anything to\nhim. So Hitler gotta be the right man, right? If you\u2019re German.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Not with a two million dollar army. The -- the -- there was a big fallacy. Again, the Maginot\nLine was the most beautiful military construction ever conceived. Everything was underground,\nwhole towns and whatnot, with elevators, [indecipherable] blah, blah, blah. What was wrong\nwith the Maginot Line? It was supposed to go from the Swiss border to the ocean. So when they\nhit Belgium, the Belgian got bent out of shape. How can you do this to us? I mean, I don\u2019t invent\nthis, this is fact. How can you do this to us? We fought for you in World War I, and we will fight\nfor you if World War II should happen. Belgium is gonna be -- is gonna be a big problem for the\nPanzer divisions? I don\u2019t think so. So the Germans left the -- the Maginot Line where it was, and\ncame right through Germany like an open gate. You see? So what do you do? And th -- from that\nmoment on things got real bad.",
        "A: No, no, to my parents [indecipherable |",
        "A: 1937, right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, \u201939 the Germans -- you see, from the declaration of war o -- by France and\nEngland was on September -- the ulttmatum was acember -- December the third. That\u2019s *39,\nthat\u2019s when the war was supposed to start in earnest, but nobody was shooting at anybody. The\nFrench mal -- French mobilized, the Germans obviously were mobilized, and they called it the\nfunny war because nobody did anything. The Germans were behind the Siegfried Line, the\nFrench behind the Maginot Line. They figure ah, you know. Figure that goes on forever now.\nThe British sent over Hindu troops to France. I remember, I was there. You know the ones with\nthe turban? The Sikhs, you know and all that? And the French had the colonial troops and\nwhatnot, and -- but didn\u2019t cut the mustard. Once the Germans started rolling, that was it.",
        "A: I didn't think",
        "A: And that\u2019s when we hung up -- hu-hung on to the radio to hear the ultimatum, you know, in\nlater afternoon that either you get out of Poland, or we going to start fighting you.\nBeginning Tape Three",

        "A: Then -- now I\u2019m back and I had two real good friends who we went to school together, we\nwere inseparable, right? So I used to meet them every evening, you know. One of them worked\nfor a newspaper. The other one decided to become a salesman in a very high fashion female or\nladies\u2019 shoe store.",
        "A: He was handsome, bi -- was tall, very handsome guy. He just was in the right business, if you\nknow what I mean. And so we met every evening after they were finished working. We had a\ngay old time, I mean, the th -- the three of us together like nothing happened.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s not occupied yet.",
        "A: Thirt -- no, no, si -- the Germans started running through the [indecipherable] countries in\nMay 1940.",
        "A: And they hit France big time in -- you know, I\u2019m not dead on the dates, but I would say\naround June 20\" or so, the French signed the armistice. By that time the Germans had rolled up\nwhatever was left of the French army, horse and buggy types. You know what I\u2019m saying?",
        "A: They -- they -- they nailed me when the Germans started invading [indecipherable] countries\nin 1940, in May -- May 20-something or other. Towards the end of May, I think. And they\nrounded up everybody of German origin. Now, I was a German origin.",
        "A: Jewish didn\u2019t come into consideration. They didn\u2019t know. You know what I mean?",
        "A: The French don\u2019t make you wear a star. That\u2019s Germans, you know. So --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: You were ec -- you\u2019re in France, you speak French like a Frenchman, you act like a\nFrenchman, you expected to be Catholic in a 99 percent Catholic country. Very simple. You\nknow what I\u2019m saying? So, they rounded us up, together with what I would call the real\nGermans, Aryans that were caught. It\u2019s called the fifth column. You heard about the fifth column\nin the Spanish civil war, where they put civilians to infiltrate a place, and then they take over the\nplace. You know, so they had the same thing in France and the French actually did make German\nprisoners.",
        "A: And they happened to be -- we happened to be concentrated, or quartered in a military base in\nLe Mans. So we -- there we are, the Germans in the German uniform. The German Nazi type\ncivilians, plus a whole bunch of Jews, too. So we\u2019re all together. I mean, the masses --",
        "A: -- soon found out we were Jewish, but the soldiers weren\u2019t up -- you see, there\u2019s a big\ndifference between the Nazis and the German army. The German army isn\u2019t as bad as the Nazis.",
        "A: Listen, nothing stays secret for long, okay?",
        "A: Who knows? I have no idea. I don\u2019t even know. I -- I assume they found out we were Jewish.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Who knows? It\u2019s hard to tell. The German soldiers in German uniform, there were a lot of\nflyboys there, in German uniform, they were hanging out by themselves, with possibly the fifth\ncolumn types, and the Jews were hanging out with themselves. They were all going to associate\nwith shall we call it the enemy, right? So obviously there must have been a shift, or a sh-schism,\nwhatever you call it. And --",
        "A: Well, I told you, we were s-stationed in a military base. The place was okay, we have beds\nand things like that, or cots.",
        "A: No, no, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a military camp. And then what happened, across the street there was the\nBritish military camp, and you know, [indecipherable] had a lot of British soldiers in France, you\nknow. And of course, we didn\u2019t know that. So one night, they told us to get up, pack our things\nand marched us out. That\u2019s how come we found out a little bit up the road was the British camp.\nBut the British were -- might have been gone by that time. And they marched us, and we were\nbasically running away from the oncoming German army, surrounded by French soldiers. You\nknow, and there was a lot of people [indecipherable] like the Germans, and the German Jews,\nand everybody. It was a column of people walking. How many? Don\u2019t ask me. Hundreds, maybe\nmore, 200, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Surrounded by French soldiers.",
        "A: French soldiers, yeah.",
        "A: Well, then we\u2019re walking down one of the main roads, and we\u2019re not alone, the French were\nrunning away, too, and the French army was running the same way with horse, carriages, and\nthings like that, dragging maybe some cannons or something, I don\u2019t know for sure. And all of a\nsudden, aft -- I -- I\u2019m talking this been going on, it\u2019s very hard walking, but few hours, you\nknow, later, it\u2019s now daytime, we started at night. All of a sudden we get a visit from German\nfighter planes that come over and they start strafing us, you know, with bullets and things like\nthat. And well, we scattered sideways and whatnot, and then when they\u2019re gone, we start all over\nagain. Keep on marching, and then every once in a blue moon, we have a rest, you know, by the\nside of the road, you collapse on the grass over there for, you know. And didn\u2019t have really much\nfood, or anything. I had the -- I had two suitcases, my aunt took good care of me. Two large\nsuitcases, one with food, one with clothing. Well, that lasted about a mile or two, because 30 - 40\npounds on each side, I -- I couldn\u2019t walk like that for long. So I took a few things out of there, a\ncouple of cans of food, took a pajama, turned it, tied a knot, inside out, put it over my shoulder.\nAnd I put that in front of a house we were passing by around midnight or two in the morning, I\ndon\u2019t know, that was -- that was the end of my possessions.",
        "A: Ev-Every -- everybody was running away because they knew the Germans were coming and\nthey were getting away from the Germans.",
        "A: Now, the most amazing thing of it all, it was like the stranger than fiction. All of a sudden I\nhear my name being called, and I turned around. And who the heck is on the main drag, we were\non the side? My aunt, my brother, my friend and his parents, they were all leaving at the same\ntime. I meet them in the middle of nowhere, 12 hours after we left the camp. Do you believe\nthat? Of course, I didn\u2019t have much of a chance to say hello and hug them --",
        "A: -- whatnot because the Germans, the French soldier says, that-a-way fellow, none of this.",
        "A: You know, they were afraid I was going to get lost in the masses.",
        "A: So, but that\u2019s the most amazing thing that -- think about it, the odds. There\u2019s hundreds of\nthousands of people and all of a sudden I\u2019m at the same heights as my -- my aunt, my brother\nand my friends from the --",
        "A: -- they were -- they were leaving together, you know?",
        "A: Yeah, they were going south, yeah.",
        "A: Tell you the truth, I really don\u2019t know what. I don\u2019t think they have a car. Well, they -- they\nmust have had something, you know.",
        "A: Because they mo-moving faster than we were, so they must have had something, okay?",
        "A: Oh, but -- we marched for -- for several days. We marched approximately, I would say, a\ngood -- I -- I mean 20 miles a day, at least.",
        "A: Yeah, at least. So we walked for three days, must have been about 60 miles. Of course, at\nnight we stayed someplace, you know, whatever horror place they could drum up. They couldn\u2019t\nthrow us in a prison, no prison was big enough, you know. So they put us in a schoolyard, or a\nrestaurant, or you know, whatever was handy, could accommodate us cramped together. I\nremember the worst part was one day -- one night, found some what yo -- I would call a beds --\nbedstand. The frame, and wires strung across, you know, like a -- this. And I laid on that. I mean,\nlike wasn\u2019t very comfortable, you know? Can you imagine how hard it is to lay? But you\u2019re\nyoung. Well the next thing I know, I wake up. Somebody is urinating on my feet. Wonderful,\nI\u2019m telling you, the I-life was great. There wasn\u2019t -- he coul -- he couldn\u2019t even get out because\nwe were so jammed together, so he stood up and he urinate on my feet, hey.",
        "A: Oh, I -- I gave a -- I -- I gave him a piece of my mind, but too late, I was wet. Of course, urine\nisn\u2019t the worst thing.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: My feet hurt, are you kidding? The whole sole of my foot was a callus. Then fortunately, after\nthree days of walking, they found a truck and they put us on a truck. A --",
        "A: Oh, I tell you, and the countryside was beautiful. That doesn\u2019t change. I remember once we\nwere resting, and I was against the wall, like about at least that high there, you know, sitting,\nresting against the wall. You know, I had a little lunch or something, a bite to eat, whatever. And\nthe Germans were shelling us. And all of a sudden I hear this big explosion. And man, I don\u2019t\nknow how I did it. In one flash I was over the wall, on the other side of the wall.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah --",
        "A: -- yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I -- I jumped over that like it was -- 1t wasn\u2019t even there.",
        "A: Scares s -- does a wonderful thing for you. And of course I was young, and I had -- I hadn\u2019t\nsuffered yet, you understand?",
        "A: And so -- it gave me a good scare though, but th-that told me that things weren\u2019t exactly\ngoing well. So anyway, then, eventually we got the truck and the truck brought us to a railroad\nstation, and then we got put into cattle cars, you know? Eight horses, 40 men, that\u2019s what\u2019s\nmarked on the cattle cars. [speaks foreign language here]. That\u2019s what they did in World War I.",
        "A: Or eight horses, right. And that\u2019s where they put us in these cattle cars, and of course we had\na French -- two -- two French soldiers per car to guard us, you know. And being that things\nweren\u2019t going exactly a hundred percent, 1t was stop and go and stop and go. So we went from --\nwell, what would I call it? Brittany, sort of like France, Normandy, all the way down to southern\nFrance in -- in the train, and then they turned around and shunted the car, and the next thing we\nknew, we\u2019re in central France in the plateau region. You know, there\u2019s the mountainous region\nlike 3,000 feet up. And that\u2019s -- we have to walk some more from the main town which was\ncalled Marvejols, to a little place in the mountains, which was a sh-sheep ranch. It was called\nMalavillers. And that\u2019s where we stopped, and that\u2019s where we were going to stay. And we had\nthe greatest accommodation in the world. We were staying in a sheep barn, and we were sleeping\non a small layer of straw over the sheep dung. It was just wonderful.",
        "A: Over the sheep dung. They didn\u2019t take the sh --",
        "A: -- the sh -- the dung out, they left it there.",
        "A: They just put some straw over it, so that\u2019s where we stayed.",
        "A: Wonderful accommodations.",
        "A: Ah, who knows? Who knows? I can\u2019t remember that any more.",
        "A: No, that\u2019s the fr --",
        "A: -- that\u2019s still the French, oh yeah. And we got f-fed very well. We had quite a bit of freedom.\nWe were in the mountains, how far can you run? You see, even if you were -- if you were of a\nmind to run away, it was -- it wasn\u2019t going to work. Here\u2019s why.",
        "A: Yeah, w-w-way up in the mountains. And once in a blue moon on a Sunday, we went down to\nthe nearest village, see what you could get, little something or something. Human contact, you\nknow, French people. Strangest village I ever saw. All the houses were built without windows.\nYou never saw a soul. A dog occasionally, and a nice little brook run -- river, small brook,\nwhatever, run alongside, really picturesque. And the houses -- w-we went inside a few times\nbecause made friends with the locals. And they were heated like -- there\u2019s places like that I think\nin England, too, there\u2019s hot springs that run underneath the houses. It\u2019s the most amazing thing\nwhat you can learn. I mean, not because you\u2019re looking for it, because the circumstances bring it\nout. And the people were quite ugly. Must have been a lot of intermingling, you know?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t delve into this too much.",
        "A: You know, but the -- did -- nobody did nothing to us, so then we saw so -- went to some\nfarms, the people were quite nice. Well, you see, we all spoke perfect French, no accent, no\nnothing. So obviously, some stranger comes, speaks in French, ah -- ah, the people up there in\nthe mountain, you know. You know, we didn't look like dangerous criminals, so wha -- what?\nThey treated us pretty good.",
        "A: Of course we went back. See, we\u2019re -- ex -- e -- allow me, where were you going to go\nwithout papers?",
        "A: Right. As a young man, you were supposed to be in the French army of sorts, or y -- if you\nwere German, you were supposed to be in the German army. You had no business ha-hanging\naround at a young age gallivanting in the country, you see? That\u2019s -- that\u2019s why. And the French\nwould nail everybody because you need papers. I have the papers yet. I mean, it\u2019s like an\naccordion, those papers, it\u2019s not like a nice little card like this, you know? I mean, even in\nGermany.",
        "A: So they had everything nailed down to a science, there was no place to go.",
        "A: Malavillers --",
        "A: -- I would say, okay, the war was over, it was June, right? July, August, yeah, maybe two\nmonths. Oh, by the way, at very -- at the very beginning, being that the German Germans, you\nknow, soldiers and whatnot were with us --",
        "A: -- the German armistice commission, meaning colonels, majors, generals, SS, government\npeople, came to check out who was in the camp. So immediately the Germans, like have a\ndogtag, whatever it 1s, they were put aside and sent back to the Fatherlands to fight another day\nor whatever, you know? And then all of a sudden we weren\u2019t German any more, now we were\nJews. Now we were officially Jews. You gotta understand that. We were not with Germans any\nmore, German nationals that fought for the Germans, we were Germans of German origin. So\nnow that they took the Christian people away, all of a sudden I wasn\u2019t German any more, now I\nwas a Jew, officially. So that the Germans made the French nail the Jews. That\u2019s how come we\nnever got out from under. See, the French nailed us because we were of German origin. And they\nwere eventually gonna screen us, and then they was -- was gonna let us go. Never got to this, the\nGermans got there first.",
        "A: No, that came later. That was all the way at the beginning. They\u2019re talking 1940, they -- --\nthey -- they barely have time to get themselves organized. You know, the Germans took over the\ne -- the end of June, a-and this was right then and there, so what, you know?",
        "A: No --yeah -- well, we are now under French rule, doing what the Germans tell them to do,\nkeep the Jews, you know, locked up. So, after a little while, for some reason, they send us to a\ndifferent camp. You know, again train, but this time we -- we picked up people from all over. We\nwere hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of people. And they\u2019re winding up in the south of\nFrance, the eastern coast by the Mediterranean and we\u2019re walking from the railroad station\nthrough the town -- I don\u2019t know how far it was. And then we wind up on a camp that is built on\nthe boards on the sand of the beach. Was a very large, long beach. And there were dozen upon\ndozens of barracks. And things were pretty primitive at the time. There was no running water, no\ndrinking water. They hadn\u2019t set up the food situation yet, and that wasn\u2019t very nice. That\u2019s the\nonly time that I really fell apart, I collapsed. I went -- couldn\u2019t move any more, so I fell asleep.\nAnd when I woke up, I was alright again, you know, and I dealt with the situation, because I\ncouldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t handle it any more. That was too much. I went catatonic. S --",
        "A: Oh, the other people have their own tsoris, you know. Enough problems of their own. So, then\nlater on we get assigned to barracks. Now that was the final insult. The barracks are just built on\nthe beach sand. Which, that in itself, sleeping on the beach is not the worst thing in the world.\nWhat made it so bad is that just before us, they had stationed a regiment of Senegalese soldiers,\nwhich is the black African contingent of the French army, in those barracks. Now they were not\ntoo keen on what you would call hygiene. They used --",
        "A: -- they used every area where you would sleep as a toilet. And you found bowel movements.\nAnd that\u2019s where they made you sleep. That really cuts it. Of course, on top of that, being to --\ndue to that situation, there were -- I -- of course, I have to say millions of fleas there, because I\nmyself got bitten up so badly, it\u2019s frightening. From the upper thighs to the groin, my stomach,\nup to the hips, thousands of bites. I mean you can\u2019t just believe this, it was unbelievable. The\nmost beautiful setting in the world, which was hell. Dante\u2019s Inferno doesn\u2019t even come close.\nAnd then, to make matters worse -- eventually we got food there, the French brought you know -",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: This is called San Cyprian, which is right next to the town of Erne, on the Mediterranean,\nclose to the Spanish border. And the reason that the camp was there was that the French had to\naccommodate all the Spaniards that ran away from Franco when the war was over, the Spanish\nCivil war was over in 1939, so the French, they came over by the hundreds of thousands, so they\nhave to put them up someplace, so that they had to build barracks in a hurry. Now when I say\nbarracks, which goes for any time that I mention a barrack, this is something like a wa -- one\ninch thick, you know, which 1s like three-quarters thick woods, and one layer, and covered with\nblack tar paper, which is wonderful in the summertime, because the black reverberates the sun,\nand takes it in. So if it\u2019s 80 degrees inside, it\u2019s a hundred deg -- 0-outside, it\u2019s a hundred degrees\ninside, it\u2019s wonderful. In the winter it doesn\u2019t do anything for you, it doesn\u2019t protect you from\nanything. So --",
        "A: Y-Yeah, yeah. We still, even there, we still had quite a bit of freedom. If you asked for a pass,\nthey gave you a pass to go to the near town, you know, and things like that. But the unfortunate\nthing is that being we were in such unsanitary condition, there was a epidemic of typhoid,\ndiphtheria, and so on and so forth.",
        "A: And we fortunately -- this was at the beginning, the French still had stuff, we got vaccinated\nfor these miseries. They da -- it took care of three shots, you know, we -- a week apart. The\ntrouble was that they were administered by German trained doctors and I don\u2019t know what\npossessed the Germans, they put the vaccination in your pectoral, whether you\u2019re male or\nfemale, okay? Not nice. Hurts a lot. So the first one, I took it. At that time I might also say that\nthe needles were approximately a good five to 10 times larger than what they are now. And of\ncourse, there was no such thing as AIDS, so everybody got stuck with the same needle. So\nanyway, the first shot in, fine. A week later, second shot in. It hurts. And the third time, they --\nthe doctor was like this and I go like that, I jerk back. So the needle being half in, it zigzagged a\nlot. The doctor didn\u2019t bat an eyelash, pulls the needle out. Straightens it out with his hand and\nthen he sticks me again. End of discussion. Of course, I didn\u2019t get any of the sicknesses.",
        "A: Well, the French are very nice people. They are ha -- they are not at all like the Germans,\nthey\u2019re not out to kill you. They\u2019re forced into a situation that was abhorrent to them. You see\nthat -- that\u2019s what people don\u2019t understand. They didn\u2019t like to do that. There was anti-Semitism\nin France, too, mind you, 99 percent Catholic country, you know, that you gotta understand that\nthe -- the Jews did all ba -- kinds of bad thing to Christ, which wasn\u2019t true, but that\u2019s the\npreaching as it went, you know? One of the popes in 796 says, hey, forget about that, but at that\ntime it was still running. But the French really are not vicious.",
        "A: We were -- we were -- we were -- we were so worried about ourselves that, you know, and\ntrying to -- to make a life for ourselves -- I mean some guys even went swimming in the ocean. I\nmean, you could swim in the ocean over there, you know?",
        "A: No, nothing, no.",
        "A: As a matter of fact, come to think of that, I was friends with two -- I -- what I would call --\nwhat I called at that time, elderly gentleman, around 50.",
        "A: Now when you\u2019re 17, 50 is like getting there, right? So they decided, let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t get\na little bit better treatment, let\u2019s volunteer to work in the office --",
        "A: -- French office, you know, do clerical work. There -- that was their profession. So he says,\nwhy don\u2019t you come with us, oh lo -- they liked me. Don\u2019t want to go into the reason why. But\nanyway -- So I tried it for a little bit, but I felt so lousy and it\u2019s so hot, and the offices weren\u2019t air\nconditioned any better than anything else. I says, so what am I doing here? I\u2019m getting treated\nthe same, I eat the same stuff. Why? So I stopped doing that, too, you know? But da -- that\u2019s the\nonly kind that -- that was voluntary.",
        "A: I seen people die there, I remember one young, strapping fellow about 17, six foot, 180\npounds, got dysentery over there, right? He was dead in a week. That goes to show you what\nkind of fantastic genes I had.",
        "A: Like I said to you, nobody escapes from anyplace. What do you do without papers? And\nthere\u2019s police, civil servants, all over the place. You see, the French, if they didn\u2019t want to go and\nbeing drafted into Germany, they had to go into some sort of French service. Army, police, or\nsome like that. So they had them all over the place. There was nowhere to go. It never even\noccurred to me because I had enough brains to realize a-and where you going? I tried the escape\nbusiness once with my brother in 1942, February 40 -- oh no, wait, you\u2019re not there yet, okay, so\nI won\u2019t -- we\u2019ll keep that for later.",
        "A: About two months.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Give or take, towards winter.",
        "A: Then they decided, oh this is not good for you, the winter. We got to bring you to a better\nplace, more suited for the winter.",
        "A: Okay, so back in the train and we wind up on the other side of France. Now we\u2019re on the\nAtlantic side, but still by the Pyrenees. The [indecipherable] was called Gurs. So we wind up\nthere and they got the same kind of barracks, with barbed wire around it. Sections, they called\nthem, elou. Each section was called an elou, which was an island, all right? So, had maybe 20\nbarracks per, and they had letters, A, B, C, D, you know, and so on, so forth. So I -- I believe my\nmemory serves, I went in number H. Of course, the only trouble was that the barracks were of\nthe same construction, even though we\u2019re facing winter now. Same thing, black tar, once inch\nply -- one inch wood. Now the only thing is, no Senegalese left their deposits there. This was\nokay because who was there before us were the Spanish refugees. And a few Spanish refugees\nwere still left there to do maintenance work, the nicest young men you ever met in your life.\nFriendly, gregarious, helpful, God knows what. Now this time we were together with women.\nNot together, but the camp held half women, half men.",
        "A: In San -- San Cyprian, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember seeing women.",
        "A: Right. So, we\u2019re in this camp, and by that time it\u2019s the winter of 1940 and the Germans were\nvery busy already, plundering France for the homeland, you know, the Fatherland, you know,\nwhatever you had there. So by that time the food situation wasn\u2019t that good. Very, very minimal.\nIt consisted of cabbage at lunchtime, boiled cabbage at lunchtime and boiled cabbage for dinner.",
        "A: In Gurs.",
        "A: Once in a -- in the morning you got a slice of bread. Now, if you excuse the expression bread,\nflour as we know it was in the minority in the mixture. Everything else was in there. Ground\nacorns, whatever you could find. And we got a slice a day. Coffee, nonexistent. Some sort of\nbrew in the morning and that was it. Boiled cabbage at lunch, not the most nourishing food, and\nat dinner the same time. I think once a week we got about -- let me exaggerate, two ounces of\nmeat. I\u2019m exaggerating now, you know.",
        "A: No. No, no, I was okay. I\u2019m basically constipated, so you know. All right? Even as a child.",
        "A: Whatever. So, the problem 1s that the latrines -- we\u2019re not talking bathrooms, we\u2019re talking\nlatrines, you know what latrines are, right? Okay? In bil --",
        "A: Okay. They take those big oil drums, right, and over each oil drum they put -- they build a\nwood frame, all right, they throw a roof over it so that you\u2019re not exposed to the rain from the\ntop. From the s -- the back is covered, the front 1s open, and there\u2019s a walkway, and then you --\nwhatever one of the latrines, there might be 10 spots per, maybe more, I don\u2019t know. I doubt -- I\ndidn't make a business of committing that to memory, it wasn't that pleasant. They weren't close\nby. Why was that bad? In San Cyprian they were God knows how far away on the -- on the\nborder of the ocean. Over here, it started to rain and the soil, which was clay, turned to mud.\nNow we had to be very careful because you sank in up to here, because the mud has a tendency\nto suck your shoes right off your feet. I got pictures to prove all that, too. This is not something\nthat I make up. So it was quite unpleasant. So sometimes -- they had made a little walkway, you\nknow, threw some pieces of wood over there on some runners, you know? So that was already\npretty good, but that wasn\u2019t all over, you know? So anyway, the food was horrible, and they\ndidn\u2019t mistreat us. We never had to wor -- look, we were so damn weak, my stomach growling\nall the time, I was hungry all the time. Whenever I say hungry, I mean not hey, I would like to\neat some, I mean hungry that you were starving, okay? And the stomach is growling, there\u2019s\nnothing in there. So once in a blue moon we scrounged through garbage cans to see whether we\ncould find a piece of beet, or something like that, you know? Oh, it was very nice, very nice.",
        "A: Nah, nah --",
        "A: -- nah, I was one of the few.",
        "A: Yeah. Most of them -- most of them were grown -- grown men. As a matter of fact, at one\ntime, we got the survivor of the Saint Louis, I don\u2019t know whether you know the Saint Louis was\nthat ship that left Germany, where al -- everybody had cub -- Cuban visas and when they hit\nCuba, Batista said, sorry fellows, I got your money, but I don\u2019t want you. So they shipped them\nover to the United States, and the United States said the same thing, so what was left over, they\nsend them right back to Germany, and the Germans said, you see, I told you nobody wants the\nJews. So we happened to wind up with survivors from the Saint Louis. Now these were all top of\nthe line people. I mean, we\u2019re talking the intelligentsia, you know? Lawyers, writers, movie\nproducers, and whatnot. And they showed the stress of the trip there. I remember one movie\nproducer, must have been in his heydays maybe 250 pounds. Well, the reason I can say that 1s\nbecause first of all, those barracks didn\u2019t have any yo -- windows. A door at one each -- a door at\neach end. And we had one bulb hanging from the ceiling in the middle, which went on for one\nhour at night, if it\u2019s a lot, okay? And so we -- at night we stripped to look for lice -- you know,\nlice? And tried to kill whatever you could find in your clothing. So I saw him stripped one day,\nand whatever his stomach was, was now a big flap hanging there. So I know the situation well --\ntoo good. And then it gets to be winter.",
        "A: All 900 of them.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: They sent them back to Germany.",
        "A: Yeah, well, good for them because I only know about the ones that wound up in my barrack.",
        "A: In my barrack maybe -- I\u2019m not just talking my barrack, my --",
        "A: -- there were 20 barracks, I didn't know what was --",
        "A: -- in the next barrack. I would say about 20 of them.",
        "A: I assumed.",
        "A: If -- if nobody wanted to accept them, well, they have to go -- the ship was a German ship,\nhave to go back to Germany.",
        "A: You know. So anyway, they were very nice people, I -- I got friends later on with one of the\nyounger lawyers, and that\u2019s a different story, you have to wait for later. But there were ---",
        "A: Very nice, very good --",
        "A: -- very friendly. Cause they were old, young, didn\u2019t matter, they were nice people. Peop --",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: [ll tell you why, here\u2019s the story. Gets to be winter, right?",
        "A: Now, I discussed the construction of the barracks. Every morning when you woke up -- there\nwere Stalactite hanging from the ceiling, I -- I mean a lot. The condensation of the breath. The\nbreath goes up, form stalactites.",
        "A: Right? And then, after awhile, from southern Germany, the Germans had a shipment of\npeople from part of German -- it\u2019s about maybe 6,000 of them, they shipped them over to Gurs.\nWomen, children, babies, old people. And I remember that because I was involved with them\nlater on. And you know, the wintertime, the icicles from the ceiling, every morning the door\nopened up and one of the French workers came and he yelled, any stiffs? Meaning, anybody\u2019s\ndead, frozen to death? Well, fortunately my barracks, we weren\u2019t that old. But the people from\nGermany, you had the old people, and you saw -- well, maybe -- no, not necessarily, there were\nsome people, older people, because I remember looking at the truck and all you saw sticking out\nf-from the truck were the feet with the socks -- with the socks on. You didn't see the body, they\nwere covered. And we have the cemetery at the end of the camp, was -- the camp was maybe a\nmile long. At the em -- end of the camp was a cemetery and they used to bury them there. And\nit\u2019s a situation -- I\u2019m telling you, if -- if we have no -- no light at all in the barracks, nothing, one\nbulb hanging in the middle, maybe one hour at night, I\u2019m telling you that\u2019s all, and that\u2019s where\nwe quickly stripped, whether winter or summer, didn\u2019t matter, and looked for the lice, and\n[sound effect]",
        "A: Well, they -- at lunchtime they rang the -- you know, the bell or something, and you went\nthere with a whatever it was, and you got the ladle of soup.",
        "A: To the kitchen.",
        "A: Yeah, with the big cauldrons, you know?",
        "A: I once volunteered to work there, too.",
        "A: [indecipherable] my reward was to get up at four in the morning, start the fire, and I could eat\nas much cabbage as I wanted. And that didn\u2019t cut it either.",
        "A: No, no, no, every --",
        "A: -- every section, every --",
        "A: -- island had its own kitchen.",
        "A: Yeah. So that was it.",
        "A: Later on, later on. I dis --",
        "A: N-Not at -- not at the beginning. It ca -- really start to get to me, freezing and whatnot.",
        "A: So the same guys that I mentioned before, volunteered to work in the office.",
        "A: No, one of them was George.",
        "A: I can look it up to get the real name, and Abrams, I think his name was Mr. Abrams, they\nwere bookkeepers.",
        "A: I said ah [indecipherable] let\u2019s go the office, at least 1t was heated. They had the same\nbarracks mind you, but they were much better with doors and things like that, and it was heated.\nSo that was great. The food was the same. We still had to go back --",
        "A: -- and we had to go back to sleep.",
        "A: But during the day at least you got to eat.",
        "A: And you made friends.",
        "A: You know, the police inspectors that were there, they were very nice. They were very nice.\nNobody mistreated you, I tell you. So after a little while, there was one plum job to be had. That\nwas working for the director of the camp in the head barrack. So the guy was one of the Spanish\nCivil War refugees, and he had the [indecipherable]. Very nice fellow, but he got a little greedy.\nHe got into problems, so they dumped him. And I heard about that, I says, that\u2019s my job. So I\nwent and [indecipherable] he didn\u2019t speak French as perfectly as I did. I went there, I impressed\nthem no a -- no end, you know. Was him and the -- his assistant. I was hired on the spot. So now\nI\u2019m living in splendor. There is -- you -- look at the barrack, the -- they have the same barrack.\nThe only difference is, picture a railroad car, and offices to either side with doors. And he has the\nwhole back end of the barrack, the director, right? He lived on camp, as it would be, or on\ncampus, what -- however you want to put it. He had a beautiful house a little away from\neverything else, big villa, you know, with his wife, two kids. And so we had also what you\nwould call a reception room. The reception room had a little window, people ask questions, then\nthe door, and then part of the reception room was partitioned off about -- I\u2019d say about three feet.\nA wall, with a curtain. There was a bed in there. Luxury unlimited as far as I\u2019m concerned. I\ndidn\u2019t have a bed before. Like a regular cot, you know? And I -- whatever I had, th-th-the three\npieces of clothing I could hang up, whatever. Was three feet by maybe eight feet. Luxury\nunlimited, and it was separated from the reception area. And I dealt with the inspectors, I dealt\nwith the radio operator, I dealt with the boss, I del -- I dealt with his assistant. So they made me\ndo jobs, you know, like little jobs and things like that. But it paid off in the end, I tell you, big\ntime. So the most amazing thing 1s that -- of course there was no gasoline to be had in France, so\nthe French invented cars that -- the regular cars were converted to run on charcoal gas. They had\nthose big cylinders mounted in the back of their car, and you threw charcoal in there and you lit\nit and that created gas and that went through a tubing to some sort of fuel indi -- gas injector.\nAnd you weren't ri -- winning any races with it, but you could at least do 25 miles an hour with\nthat, flat of course, you know. So th-the -- th-the Germans were even smarter than that, they\ninvent -- they were so -- so brilliant, they invented something, they had two cylinders on the\ntrucks, one on this side, one on that side. And then they had bags of chopped green wood, mind\nyou. You took a bag of green wood, threw it in that cylinder, that transform it into charcoal, send\nit over to that cylinder, and that\u2019s how the trucks worked. I mean, you -- you gotta give them\ncredit. You don\u2019t have to like them, but you gotta give them credit.",
        "A: Like I said, you were -- y-you won\u2019t win races, okay?",
        "A: Okay. Tell you, I got out of there on April 12\", 1941. I got there maybe October \u00b040.",
        "A: So the first time was what, seven months? No, six months.",
        "A: Yeah. Now, my parents were in Paris, so when situation went bad, the Fr-French rounded\nthem up too, in the [indecipherable], which was a big stadium in Paris. The women were sent to\none camp. My mother happened to be, coincidently be sent to Gurs.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: And my father was sent to another camp, and I don\u2019t remember exactly the name. So, after\nthey get screened, with references and things like that, they saw they were totally harmless, they\nlet them go. But, they were assigned residents, forced residents.",
        "A: And the forced residents was in some minor, small village in southern France, you know? So\nthat\u2019s where my mother and my f-father wound up. And my mother heard on the rumor mill that\nI was coming from San Cyprian, so for weeks she didn\u2019t eat her bread and was keeping it for me,\nso that I should have enough food.",
        "A: Uh-huh. The rumor mill is fabulous.",
        "A: And she was saving the bread for me, you know, the rest, I mean the -- the cabbage she can\u2019t\nsave, you know? My mother didn\u2019t look too heavy, either.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I found out --",
        "A: -- once -- once I joined them in Castelno --",
        "A: -- you know.\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: Right. Well, the same applied for me and my brother. When you are released from the camp\nwith all the proper papers and whatnot, you\u2019re assigned to live in a certain area. Now, first thing\nyou do, you present yourself at the police station, and the police station ho -- tells you at the\npolice, whoever it is, tells you how often they want to see you a week.",
        "A: You have to check in with them to make sure that you\u2019re still there. You see they usually --\nvillages don\u2019t have a -- you know, even -- even in towns doesn\u2019t matter, they cannot be with you\n24 hours a day. They want to make sure that you don\u2019t escape or run away, or do something that\nyou\u2019re not allowed to. So anytime you want to go, or you have to go to let\u2019s say the nearby town,\nyou have to go up to police department and ask them for a pass. So that\u2019s what forced residence\nis, that you check in with them all the time. Can\u2019t move from there.",
        "A: Le Vernai.",
        "A: I think that\u2019s what it was.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Castelnot Rivierbas.",
        "A: Oh yeah, no, no. Somehow my father, who is a very bright man, might have gotten in touch,\nthrough some organization or whatnot, to find out where my mother was.",
        "A: And that\u2019s how they got together and wound up in Castelnot at the same time. I never\nquestioned it because we had other worries at the time --",
        "A: -- you know, how. I know where and when, but not exactly, you know, how they got together.",
        "A: Where? In Castelnot? Oh, when it came time for me to be released -- this was the strangest\nthing, my father, who is an alien resident -- alien resident, actually, whatever you call it, is now\npretty much an unwanted person, right? Went to see the mayor, the governor, whatnot. Got an\naudience and pleaded my release with them. And then they gave him a pass to come and see the\ncommandant of the camp where I was, showed him the goods, and that\u2019s how come I got\nreleased. Can you imagine my father, who -- who -- who had -- who had no standing whatsoever,\nmanaged to do all that? Of course, when they released me, we are to Castelnot Rivierbas. Why?\nMy father, mother lived there, simple.",
        "A: Harry was already in ca -- in Castelnot Rivierbas.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: He was too young.",
        "A: I -- just lucked out, what can I tell you?",
        "A: My aunt came to live, after a little while, came to live with us.",
        "A: Because she couldn\u2019t stay where she was, was the occupied zone, remember?",
        "A: When the Germans decided that they\u2019re going -- I -- I mean, before they decided to take all\nover France, at -- at beginning she -- she got along pretty good with the Germans, because the\nGermans respect each others Army officers, things like that. So being she was the wife was -- of\nan Army officer, you know --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: When the war was over, he was prisoner of war in Germany.",
        "A: No, not the whole time. After -- after about a year or so they released him.",
        "A: You know, this is a little hazy in my mind. I remember my aunt living with us. You gotta\nrealize, my parents had rented a small, little house. It had a kitchen, and two rooms. A living\nroom and a bedroom, so the living room was transformed into a three people bedroom, my -- my\naunt, my brother and me -- when she came. That was -- they were small rooms anyway. And so\neventually my uncle was released and then -- by that time they made him a general because the\njob asked for it. The -- he was in charge of the medical military, I guess, otherwise too, I don\u2019t\nknow, of the hospital, or hospital with an s in Vichy, Vichy, France, you know, where the\ngovernment was?",
        "A: And he managed to -- to do in his position, to do a lot of good to save some French soldiers\nfrom, you know, unpleasantnesses.",
        "A: You know.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Well, originally I couldn\u2019t work. So the only job open was as a farm hand. So, I got a job as a\nfarm hand. But the funniest thing is, for the first -- 1t sounds strange -- 40 days, I couldn\u2019t go to\nwork. Why? The Bible repeated itself, we had 40 days of rain. I\u2019m not kidding you. The only\ndifference was, sometimes it rains heavy, and sometimes it rains slower. Now, how come not\neverything was flooded? Because -- I happen to appreciate the French, very brilliant, they had\nditches alongside the road on either side. That\u2019s where the water went, and then the water went\ninto the big river. Of course, they also have a person with a scythe, you know what a scythe is,\nright, to move this. This was a county job. He was in charge of moving the grass from the -- from\nthe ditches.",
        "A: N-No.",
        "A: It can\u2019t overgrow. They wanted to keep the ditches as drainage.",
        "A: In perfect condition, not to impede the water, with grasses growing all over.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s so funny, 40 days of rain.",
        "A: I was mainly s -- mainly [indecipherable] what I did, I did a lot. I don\u2019t know where I got it\nfrom. I mended my father\u2019s jeans, he would be very fashionable now, had patches all over. I\nmade my mother --",
        "A: Oh, the jeans are invented in France.",
        "A: The Nimes. Da Nimes. Nimes being southern France. That\u2019s where the name comes from.\nAnd these were working pants for -- for when you work. You couldn\u2019t wear a suit. And all the\nway at the beginning too, I did something else. I -- my father got into a deal with some of the\nfarmers, to cut their hedges and some of the trees. So my father was at the time [indecipherable]\n57 years old. And so we went there, and in exchange of what he did, he got half the wood that we\ncut down, because we had the wood stove, and that\u2019s the only thing that worked, my mother\ncooked on the wood stove. So we had heat in the winter. I did that at the beginning, right.",
        "A: Not yet, not yet, I\u2019m only 19.",

        "A: You have to wait four months.",
        "A: Well, farm work from let\u2019s say, yeah it was the summer. June \u00b041 til geez, when did they lock\n-- lock us up again? August \u201942. Yeah, August \u201942, when they round -- they -- they round -- the\npolice rounded us up again, put us on truck and back to Gurs for deportation purposes.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Oh, we -- well, I -- the one that I -- that\u2019s a very strange story. Like again, I said like truth is\nstranger than fiction. Did you hear of Lourdes in your life, Lourdes, holy place, the Virgin, da\nda? Anyway, the train from [indecipherable] Sainte Marie was close by Gurs to my parents, goes\nfrom -- to Pau and then Tarbes. Tarbes is the big center, and the local train from my parent\u2019s\nplace, Castelnot and further up, comes there twice a day, once in the morning and once at night.\nRemember, it\u2019s war time. So I\u2019m sitting in this big -- you -- you know what the European rail\nstation look like? They\u2019re like all glass, you know, tremendous ceilings and whatnot, you know?\nAnd I\u2019m sitting there, you have to wait for my train, I -- I got there li -- let\u2019s say 10 - 11 in the\nmorning, or 12, and my train is at four or five in the afternoon, right? So I\u2019m sitting on the bench,\nwaiting, looking around, nothing is happening. Tr-Train pulls in, and down yonder\n[indecipherable] I see two ladies. I says, oh, it can\u2019t be, it\u2019s my mother and my aunt. I says no,\nyou\u2019re hallucinating. And as they come closer, lo and behold it\u2019s my mother and my aunt. Now\nmy father knew I was going to get released that day, it was a Sunday, Easter Sunday. My mother\nand aunt had left before the message got to them, and they decided [indecipherable] for my\nuncle, who was Christian decided, let\u2019s go to Pau, couldn\u2019t hurt. Everybody else goes there for a\nmiracle. Ah, what else we got to do? So they took the train to Pau, and then to Lourdes. And they\ngot off the train from Lourdes because they had to change it at Tarbes, same that I did, and man\nwas that emotional. Totally -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m telling you, truth is stranger than fiction, there\u2019s my\nmother and my aunt in the same station, the day I got released from the camp. Okay, fine. Now,\nhow did I know -- get to know this little girl? We\u2019re waiting for the train, go into a compartment\nand then three people come in the compartment, a man around 50, woman around 28, and a real\nnice looking young lady around 17 - 18. Looks interesting, okay. The weirdest thing is they get\nup at the -- get off at the same station we did. My mother happened to know them, which she told\nme later, blah, blah, blah. They were Belgian. The f -- the husband must have been very rich\nbecause he bought the local castle, chateau, okay? And they also sold some dairy products. So\nthe following morning my mother says, look, why don\u2019t you go up the road there and see -- try to\nget a few eggs, maybe something else, cottage cheese, whatever. I don\u2019t remember what. So I go\nthere, and there\u2019s a big gate and two Dobermans, black things. No -- was never too fond of dogs,\never since I was bitten at the ripe old age of 11 by a dog to whom I didn\u2019t do anything. So I was\nah -- but fortunately they didn\u2019t do anything to me. So, you know, a castle, big driveway, you\nknow, circular driveway. So I walk on to the side entrance there, and that\u2019s where they used to\nsell stuff from. Th-Th-They were cultivating the farm, they were using the farm. And who 1s\nthere? This magnificent creature. So now, I never lose time beating a dead horse. No, I knew this\nwas going to work. I ask her, would she like to have a date, you know, something like that. So\nshe says, I have to ask my -- whoever it was. Couldn\u2019t have been her mother. At 28 you don\u2019t\nhave an 18 year old kid, I don\u2019t care what age you start. Relative, somebody, [indecipherable]\nbrother-in-law, so [indecipherable] so the lady says, you sure don\u2019t waste any time. You know,\nsays [indecipherable] so I picked her up on Sunday, and we hit it off pretty good, but it didn\u2019t\nlast too long because after awhile the man of the house, who was 50, realized hey, what\u2019s this\nforeigner doing with my whoever it is, shall we say prot\u00e9g\u00e9e? Gets better. And I couldn't see her\nany more. So they locked the door, they locked the gates when I was supposed to pick her up.\nAnd his foreman was a big dude about six three or four. He says to me, you know, I like you, but\nif you know what\u2019s good for you, desist. Cease and desist. So I can take a hint. Funniest thing 1s\none day while I was waiting for my -- let\u2019s say girlfriend to get ready, the lady of the house says,\ngee, would you like to see the place? Now you gotta understand one thing. This is not the United\nStates. The United States I would have been shall we say a little more up to date and not as naive\nas I was, okay? I was -- you know, I was not necessarily shy, but -- I don\u2019t like to discuss things\nlike that, but anyway. So she takes me up to her bed-bedroom. Carpeting that high, white. Now,\nwhat I didn\u2019t realize at the time is I [indecipherable] the spot, her for the little girl. She was going\nto get for -- go for me in a big way. But I was too dumb and young. I was afraid. The husband,\nbig guy, look at the co -- position I\u2019m in, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m like under the gun with the\npolice. All anybody has to say, I\u2019m dead meat. So she got very, shall we say depressed once they\nopenly got together outside, the husband and the young lady. You always saw them together in\nthe carriage, you know. You know, a s -- little horse carriage, you know, for two people. And\nshe, from what the rumor had it, she jumped out of the first floor balcony, you know, trying to\nkill herself. Of course, she was -- she was going to make sure it wasn\u2019t deathly. So that was my\nstory with that sweet thing.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: First of all, I didn\u2019t have -- had sex at my ripe old age because I spent most of my time in\nplaces like Gurs etcetera, etcetera. And the war got in between a lot of things and the reason I\ndidn\u2019t have sex is because A, I didn't have sex. So I said to myself, what if you don\u2019t do it right,\nand the lady isn\u2019t happy with your efforts? You know, that was my thinking. I was always\nthinking about somebody else, never about myself. You know, most people think about\nthemselves, hey, I want to get laid, amen. Sorry about the language, but you know, that wasn\u2019t\nme, I just --",
        "A: -- I did -- I did that twice, like a schmuck, but later on I caught on.",
        "A: I was [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, oh -- only 16 hours a day.",
        "A: They actually want -- wanted me on Sunday too, but I says, uh-uh. I c -- I could barely move.\nThe first thing I did for six weeks, they gave me a hoe and I hoe the vineyard. Now, you know,\nvineyard is not from here to the door. How many rows there are in a vineyard? I was -- my back\nbent to the sun, I had to take shirt off, didn\u2019t have -- I didn't even have money for a hat, wa -- had\nno money. You know what they paid me at -- let -- let\u2019s not exaggerate. I think they paid me at\nthe current exchange rate, 25 cents a day. 1941, okay?",
        "A: Even that wasn\u2019t a lot of money, even in 1941. The only thing is, they fed me. What they feed\nme morning, noon and lunch was, considering my gall bladder, not the right thing. Pure, white\nlard for breakfast. You know what that does to your in-intest -- gall bladder and liver? That was\nmy breakfast, huh? Not bacon, bacon has -- got half -- half meat in there. Pure, white lard. Well,\nthey didn\u2019t have that much to themselves because the Germans took all their cattle out, you\nknow. So the only thing that left was pork and geese, you know, the geese that you fatten? So --",
        "A: Who does?",
        "A: Oh --",
        "A: No, not a word. We knew through the grapevine that there were camps and things like that,\nbut we don\u2019t know exactly what. There was Dachau what -- that was in Germany, Buchenwald is\nGermany, and there was a couple other ones right in Germany.",
        "A: Yeah, I know. Well, Poland --",
        "A: -- we didn't know from yet. It\u2019s when they started trying to de-deport us in Gurs. That\u2019s when\nwe knew it -- Auschwitz.",
        "A: Well, you see, we met with a lot of Jews from various areas --",
        "A: -- and they had good intelligence, you know.",
        "A: Now \u00b042 --",
        "A: -- I got released after months. Being that I was -- I told you I worked for the chief of the camp",
        "A: -- and all his police inspectors were my buddies. So when we came there they were sitting at\nthe table, and they, you know, took your name and everything like that, and my brother. So\nobviously I never showed up on the deportation list.",
        "A: My pals, right, [Il tell -- ve -- Pl tell you, it paid off, that one time I worked. And you\nknow how good the French were, and how good the people were at that time over there? They let\nus keep our pocket knives. They weren\u2019t afraid that they [indecipherable]. Can you imagine you\ngo to -- you put a prisoner in one of the prisons here, and you let him have a nice pocket knife?\nThat\u2019s -- that wa -- just what they\u2019re looking -- I\u2019m telling you, was different times and different\npeople.",
        "A: Well, I wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled.",
        "A: Well ha -- I -- I knew I\u2019m as good as dead if I get on the train, okay?",
        "A: Yeah, that much we knew.",
        "A: No, Auschwitz we knew.",
        "A: We knew Auschwitz, the train was for Auschwitz.",
        "A: The first year was \u00b042 in August.",
        "A: And they needed 5,000 people.",
        "A: And the few Jews they had left, they -- they were so efficient, they collected them all, there\nwere more than 5,000, because there were a few left over, including my brother and me, you\nknow.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Go back to Castelnot --",
        "A: -- go back to work on the farm.",
        "A: Well, okay. We were prepared this time, we said --",
        "A: -- next time we jump out the window, the side window. We had a little suitcase, you know,\neach and every one of us, put some food in there, whatnot, and we\u2019ll try to make it to a different\ntown and get on the railroad and try our luck going that-a-way, which is stupid, but when you\u2019re\nyoung, you\u2019re stupid.",
        "A: Towards central France.",
        "A: Central central. Not just east or west, but halfway between north and south and the massive\ncentrale, we had --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: So we made it through a few fields, the farmers looked at us a little strange, and the next thing\nyou know, who is waiting for us? One of the local cops. On bicycle, as we were crossing the\nroad. So he said to us, how can you do this to me? I says, excuse me? He was insulted that we\nrun away because that puts a bad -- it puts him in a bad light. And that\u2019s when my parents left\nCastelnot because they knew. They\u2019re down on us now, you know? Now, I had that one time, we\nhad some friends by the name of Rothchild, which Rothchild also denotes serious deniros, you\nknow? And they had the son, one and only son. They lived in the nearby village, also residents.\nAnd the son tried to make it to Spain. Well, he paid big money to some of the what do you call it,\nguides, and the guides --",
        "A: Okay, so they had a son, and he paid somebody big bucks to get him out of France over the\nmountains. Well the guy took it from both sides. Took his money, took the German\u2019s money and\nthat was the last time you heard from him. So you know, money isn\u2019t the answer to everything.\nBut, what they did for us, they managed to get authentic, blank false papers. Okay, blank. So like\nI said, I don\u2019t know, I saw in retrospect, I\u2019m amazed at myself how talented I was. I managed to\nforge those papers so efficiently, I forged the mayor of the village\u2019s handwriting that he could\nhave sworn he signed it. Couldn\u2019t do it today any more. So my parents had false paper making\nthem French people, you know. And the right age, right everything, you know they were, you\nknow.",
        "A: From the Rothchilds.",
        "A: See, they had -- they had -- they had more money than God, so they could buy anything they\nwanted, you know.",
        "A: We were friends.",
        "A: My parents and them were friends.",
        "A: My parents had a lot of friends, I mean --",
        "A: -- very likable people, my parents.",
        "A: Mm-hm, and that\u2019s when they pssshhht. After they nailed us the second time.",
        "A: In August \u00b043.",
        "A: Now that time it didn\u2019t go too good because I wasn\u2019t released. Oh, I was released. I was\nreleased in the custody of the German slave labor. Organizatione Tote, working on the Atlantic\nwall. That was a lot of fun.",
        "A: La -- Labenne. Labenne Oceane.",
        "A: Yeah, from Gurs, we di -- we were -- got on a train, and da da da da da, you know?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: In \u201942 I was released, and then --",
        "A: -- re-released again in \u00b043 --",
        "A: -- then we run away, then they put us on the truck in front of the house.",
        "A: And then Gurs. There\u2019s a little side story, very interesting.\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, as -- as long as it took to make a convoy, but they didn\u2019t put me on the convoy again,\nbecause like I said, when you get checked in, my pals were the ones that --",
        "A: Mm-hm. Or didn\u2019t put me on the list.",
        "A: No, that was the second time, in \u201942 they deported them to Auschwitz. In \u201943, they fi -- the\nGermans figured there must be enough Jews left to make another convoy. So that was \u00b043 in\nAugust.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Right. See, he was young yet, still younger.",
        "A: But already of age of --",
        "A: -- something.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, right, right.",
        "A: \u00b043, I\u2019m -- yeah, I -- ?'m 21 right then on my birthday, right.",
        "A: So, what happened, after a little while they segregate us and they pick me and a few other\nguys, and they send them to the Germans on the Atlantic coast for slave labor.",
        "A: Now, we went with a truck from Gurs to Labenne Oceane, which is the name of the site, and\nstrange as it seems, we pass right in front of the Lourdes Cathedral, you know, where all the\nmiracles happen? And the truck stops dead. So we all have to get off the truck and push it up the\nhill until it starts cranking again. That was ver -- very strange things happen in life. And if you --\nyou can add meaning to it if you want to, or just add it to coincidences. So I -- personally I think\nit\u2019s coincidence you know, but whatever. So, but you can make things out of that, you know.\nAnd then I wound up with the Germans, and the first thing I know -- they show us where we\nsleep, and then they march us out to the worksite. Now, 5,000 people swarming around there,\nokay? They weren't Jews. We were the only Jews, eight of us. At that time they didn\u2019t know it,\ntoo -- n-no -- no -- they\u2019ve ra -- okay, let\u2019s put it that way, not everybody knew we were Jews,\nokay? So, they put us to work right there. I\u2019m facing a mountain of gravel a little bit higher than\nthe ceiling, you know, like this is 15 feet, let\u2019s say 20 feet and a good 150 feet long. And they\ngive us shovels, and we have to shovel wa -- I don\u2019t remember where, most likely in\nwheelbarrows. And we have to shovel that throughout the night. And I said to the foreman, in\nGerman -- German foreman, I says, look, I\u2019m exhausted, can\u2019t we get a little sleep? He says, a\nwar -- there\u2019s a war on, nobody sleeps. That took care of my complaint, okay? Later on, being\nthat I spoke German, he made me sort of like in charge of translating from him to the rest of the\nworld, okay? So was pretty good because once in awhile we traded something for some food,\nyou know, e -- they -- they got fed. We -- we got -- the -- the -- it\u2019s not a repeat of Gurs, but it\u2019s\npretty close. Boiled pasta for lunch and supper. Now that don\u2019t do much for your system either,\nyou know, like beriberi?",
        "A: You know? Which happened to hit me after X amount of time. So I go to the nurse, I didn't\nknow what it was. Could be measles, could be rubeola, I don\u2019t know. I says, look I got red spots\nall over myself, I don\u2019t know. Well, the re -- German nurse, of course. She didn\u2019t know what it\nwas either, but just to be on the safe side, she was going to put me in insulation, right? So I don\u2019t\naffect --",
        "A: -- ins -- isolation.",
        "A: Or insulation, isolation --",
        "A: -- same difference. I was in -- isolated from everybody, but insulated too, but okay, fine.",
        "A: So just at that time, our friendly camp commandant comes in, points to me, he says, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s\nthe matter with this bastard?\u201d The nurse tells him, he blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh, he goes to\nhis holster, unstraps the holster, takes off his gun and says, \u201cI\u2019m gonna shoot that bastard right\nhere.\u201d So the nurse said to him, of course in German, \u201cYou are not going to do any such thing\nHerr Commandant, in my office.\u201d Well, he actually didn\u2019t shoot me, but she put me someplace\nand I stayed there for a little while. And I got hold of some real type food, and after a little while\nI got better, and I got back to where I was. Now, after a little while --",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Well, first of all she might not have known I was Jewish. Secondly not all Germans were\n[indecipherable]. She was a nurse, she wasn't there to kill people, she was supposed to heal them.\nSo she didn't want to -- I swear to you [indecipherable]. That\u2019s it.",
        "A: She took the wind out of his sail. Oh, not only that, wait. She said to me, yeah you\u2019re pretty\nsick, let me give you a pass so you can go on leave. Oh, I says, well, I got nobody. She\n[inaudible]. So that\u2019s when she put me in the isolation, you know. Was very funny, she was a -- a\nnice -- a nice human being. I mean, I ge -- that\u2019s all I can say.",
        "A: Labenne Oceane. And you know, I tell you, we were right on the ocean.",
        "A: Actually the bluffs overlooking the ocean, because you can\u2019t dig on the beach, because there\nyou hit water, that\u2019s no good. So we used to dig for the emplacement for the bunkers. Oh, that\u2019s\nall by hand ha -- no machines, everything by shovel. We used to dig a hole that was maybe 30\nfeet deep and 40 feet square and then flaring up to about a hundred feet at the top so that the sand\ndoesn\u2019t run down, you know what I mean? Was all done by shovel, can you imagine how many\npeople it took? Was like the Chinese coolies. And anyway -- and we worked until everything\nwas finished. From -- from -- and we -- what I -- what my specialty was -- I didn\u2019t pick it, you\nknow what rebars are? Rebars are those steel rods that they put in reinforced concrete. So the\nfirst thing before you pour the concrete, and I think we -- the walls must have been about 12 feet\nthick if they were an inch. We built the rebars from the bottom up like this, then straight across\nand then this way. And they gave us a bunch of wire, you know, wire, and we -- when rebars\nmet, we tied them like that and a pair of pliers to -- to cut it off. And we were like -- like frigging\nmonkeys hanging onto those rebars and the gale from the ocean was something unbelievable.\nCold? Oy. And that was already March at the time, or what -- whatever time it was. No, first\ntime was August, this was -- this was February, March.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no, that\u2019s later.",
        "A: That comes after -- after Labenne Oceane.",
        "A: So, anyway, we\u2019re still building the stuff there. Just to tell you how nice the Germans were,\nfirst of all they came by, they took the biggest guys they could find, of course, with the biggest\nGerman Shepherds you ever saw and they pat -- and they patrolled the work area. And s --\nbelieve me, you didn't want to be reminded to work harder by them. They didn't do it kindly. One\nday -- I\u2019m not inventing things -- they found a guy, they says, guy\u2019s not working hard enough,\nlet\u2019s teach him a lesson. They grab him -- do you know what a grease gun is? For -- for\nautomotives or machinery? They took the grease gun, inserted this in his rectum, filled it with\ngrease, and that was the end of that particular episode, and man.",
        "A: No. I was told firsthand, by firsthand. I mean, I didn\u2019t see it.",
        "A: No, Gurs they die -- they -- they died too, in the winter, plenty of people died there.",
        "A: Oh yeah, it\u2019s the first time I saw brutality, yeah. Oh, they were -- th-th-they used to cou -- ther\n-- you see, you\u2019re working 16 hours a day in hard labor, you get a little tired. So once in awhile it\nwould be logical for you to sort of like rest on your shovel a little bit and so on. And if they\ncaught you, they brought you back to life, you know. So anyway. So one day I\u2019m coming back,\nthe food still was horrible, and it\u2019s suppertime, we\u2019re sitting at a table, and the next thing I know,\nour commandant -- there\u2019s a few more episodes in between there. They actually paid you. The\norganization paid you, not -- we happened to fall in there because we happened to be Jews, we\ndon\u2019t really belong there, but we were there, okay? So one day he found out we were Jews, well\nthat was the end of that. He came at night to scream at us while we were sleeping. And he\nhappened to be a gay, and he had a retinue of young men with him, shall we say? And then,\nwhen he came time to get paid, well you know, they sit at the table there, with the paychecks and\nwhatnot, you know? And well, by the time -- by that time he knew who was Jewish -- well, every\ntwo weeks, I guess -- and what he did when he saw us come up, he took his gun, and he put it on\nthe table right next to the pay envelope. And you knew better than to grab for the pay envelope,\nokay? That\u2019s how we managed nicely. So one day he realized [indecipherable] that\u2019s not enough,\nI gotta get those guys. He called the Gestapo and one night when we came home from work, the\neight of us Jews were taken off and put on train, in a compartment that\u2019s enough for eight, with\nthe head Gestapo dude, and a soldier at each end of the train, do you -- the -- the car, you know,\nwhatever it 1s, you know, what you call that, a b -- the unit, a car unit, so that you couldn\u2019t run\nout, whatever. And -- and the guy was very nice, but what he really was, he was trying to con\nthese yi -- they were all young men, into revealing where their relatives and parents were, just in\ncase they were hiding. And they were so stupid, I\u2019m tell -- no, the -- the young guys there, I\u2019m\ntelling you. That\u2019s when I realized the whole world is not exactly what you\u2019re supposed to have\nheard about it. People are mostly stupid. I\u2019m telling you, how c -- you could fall in this trap?\nWrite me a letter, I -- I\u20191] make sure it gets mailed, give me the address. And they did. How\nstupid can you get? I mean honestly, they didn\u2019t have the brains they were born with. And they\nweren't stupid people, but they\u2019re stupid. You gotta be -- you gotta be up to every occasion that\ncomes along.",
        "A: How the heck you going to survive?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Oh, I have -- I have nobody, I\u2019m all alone in this world.",
        "A: Not only that, I spoke German, okay? The other one might have been Polish --",
        "A: Well, to the nearest fortress, which was Bayonne, an old French fortress that the Germans had\ntaken over for a regiment of whatever it was, and they threw us in a prison cell, was very narrow,\nand there was a steel door, with a little flap that you could open to look out. I mean, not from the\ninside, from the outside. So I think only four people fitted in a cell. And I remember the -- the\nGerman officer corps came and looked at what Jews look like. You know, I mean what the heck?\nHe comes in there, hey -- hey Jews, we\u2019ll pick them up tomorrow morning, but I just wanted to\nkeep them overnight. And the place was run by the German army, which wasn\u2019t really bad. And\nI remember in the morning they let us out to go and wash up. And whether it was courage or\nstupidity, so you heard the phrase that you hear a lot in the funny German sitcoms, mach schnell,\nmach schnell, right? That means hurry up. So I had this orderly there, the German orderly was\nwatching us while we were washing, or something. And he saying this mach schnell, mach\nschnell. I got so mad and I start tearing him to pieces in German. I mean, really ripping into him\nin German, you know. Told him, what the heck you think you\u2019re doing? Who the heck do you\nthink you\u2019re dealing with and whatnot. You know, not a peep, not one repurs -- reparcation --\nrepercussion, it was the most amazing thing. I could have gotten shot [indecipherable] on the\nspot. Once in awhile you\u2019re -- you know, it -- it pays to get mad. So anyway, so the fellow --",
        "A: Bayonne.",
        "A: Bayonne. There\u2019s a fortress there.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure it\u2019s still there. Only because it\u2019s 60 years later, doesn\u2019t mean anything. Must have\nbeen built 60 years prior to that too. So anyway, they put us on a train, and up north we go.",
        "A: And we stop at Albi.",
        "A: That\u2019s the name of the railroad station and town. And the Gestapo man must have called\nahead to the militia and said, I want a contingent of militia men, I\u2019m coming with some\ncriminals, whatever he must -- I don\u2019t know what he said, I just saw the result. There\u2019s eight of\nus, we\u2019re coming, get them out of the train, there\u2019s 40 black-clad, helmeted, armed, militia men\nfor eight guys. They didn't know it, that was that -- how many we were. So they send him 40\nmilitias. So -- and they told them -- and they only kept maybe a half a dozen to guard us. Put us\nin the truck and we wound up in this camp. And this camp was not for Jews or foreigners, this\ncamp was for the French resistance fighters that were caught by the Germans, or by the French\nsympathizers. You know, either -- either or, right? And they were going to get deported to\nGermany to do slave labor. The Germans use any kind of slave labor they could get their hands\non, and they were all young people, obviously. But this was a very upscale camp, as far as camps\ngo. Clean, neat, beds. They actually had some decent food. I was shocked. But I know that this\ncouldn\u2019t last, so after a few days -- now, it -- you gotta remember, I lived for five years with my\nuncle who was an officer in the French army, high ranking officer, and I used to hang out with\nall his cronies all the time, you know, the colonels and the majors and their wives, and all the --\nbecause they used to take me over for tea. In France there\u2019s a big thing, you have tea in the\nafternoon, you know, little cake, whatever. So I was young, they used to schlep me, my aunt\nused to schlep me along, all the ladies liked me, you know, I didn't make the nuisance of myself,\nso I knew how to, you know, behave. And I had the nerve, I asked for an audience with the camp\ncommandant. I had -- his name I remember. His name was [indecipherable]. He was a Corsican.\nYeah, I didn\u2019t think he was that bad because after the war they had -- they h-hu-hung him as a --\nas a war criminal, but I didn't think he was that bad [indecipherable]. Not for me, it\u2019s for the\nFrench people that he did in, you know? Anyway, so I said to him in my best military upper class\nvoice, I says, mon commandant, I know we are miscast here, we don\u2019t belong here, and if you\npermit me, I would tell you who to contact to get rid of us. Lo and behold, think that I sound one\nof his kind, picks up the phone, calls the commandant of Gurs. Now I know the guy loved me, I\nworked for him for you know -- and he says, I got this guy here, blah, blah, blah, you know, I\nunderstand you are -- you\u2019re -- you\u2019re in charge, would you take him? Oh, s-sure, send him over.\nSo again, in handcuffs, on the railroad, you know [indecipherable] such a wonderful with the --\nwi-with the regular people, you gotta understand. So they looked at us, man, some criminals, I\ndon\u2019t know. Was very embarrassing, you know -- tell you. And so we got --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah, well I take the ra -- take the eight with me, what are we going to do, just me?",
        "A: When I was young I saved a lot of people, I got a flash for you. I really mean that, not a joke.\nWe'll get to that later, maybe. So, we get there, put us on a truck, drive us to Gurs. Now Gurs\nhad a big gate there, and be -- you know, the gate, 1t says Gurs and blah, blah, blah, big portal\nthat. And you know, the most touching scene I\u2019ve ever seen in my life, the whole administration\nof the camp was there to welcome us, on account of me. Now, that is touching. You know? The\nmost -- the police inspectors that I knew. The boss, his assistant and whoever else, was a whole\nbunch of people. Really very touching. And at that time, the camp that used to hold on the\naverage, 13,000 inmate, male, female or whatever, was down to 16 people. Germans worked\nvery good. From 13,000 to 16, it\u2019s not bad. And the reason that the French were able to save\nthem, they said we need maintenance personnel for the camp. Now, who did they keep is the --\nthe top of the line, of course. The doctors, the dentist, the lawyers, you know. A musician, I\nremember him. His sister was the nurse, and so on, so forth. So they were -- they were there, you\nknow? And then the -- the eight of us. And now all of a sudden we have 24, it was great. We also\n-- we \u00a7 -- still lived in the barracks, but not in the barracks barracks. We lived in the barracks that\nthe police inspector -- oh yeah, they also didn\u2019t need all the police inspectors any more because it\nwas only 24 people, right? They only needed administrative people. So they put us up, again I\nluck out. I got my own room, a real bed, a stove, you know? The only -- the only, the -- oh, 1-1t\ngets better, even. The only drawback 1s, in order to justify us, we all had to become lumberjacks.\nSo they took us out in one of those famous cars. Was a Chevy as a matter of fact, station wagon.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: A 1936 Chevy station wagon. And they drove us up in the woods, you know, like the\nmountains, the beginning of the mountains 1s woods. And the foresters had marked up the trees\nthat needed to be cut. Now, they were all dead oak. Now, oak by itself is very hard. If it\u2019s dead,\nit\u2019s like trying to cut steel. Not only that, you had to clear away the underbrush, you know? So\nfirst you had to clear the underbrush, I had -- well, I had the -- the other guys with me, eight guys\nand me. Teams of two there with the saws. You know those long saws that slightly curve\n[indecipherable]. So I was the hatchet man, the axe man because I have experience in Castelnot\nas a lumberjack. I did that for quite a long time in the winter over there. They send me in the\nwoods, they told me which trees to cut down all by myself. Anyway, so I have plenty experience,\nI was the axe man. So I was the one that had to clear the underbrush. And if you notice, if you\nlook at the tree, the roots grow up like this. The roots don\u2019t grow underneath, they grow outside.\nAnd when they\u2019re oaks and when they\u2019re like a hundred years old, I mean we\u2019re talking. So you\nhad to chop that up before you could get at the basic tree trunk, and the prerequisite was not like\nthe lumberjacks over here with the power saw at arm\u2019s height like this, cutting the thing, no. You\nhad to cut it right flush with the ground. Wonderful, wonderful exercise. And I have to decide\nwhich way the tree would fall, so I had to notch it in various ways, and then the saw team came\nand they went opposite of the notch, and -- and then we had to cut it in three foot lengths, you\nknow, stack the wood, cords of wood, and split it. I mean, can you imagine splitting trees that big\naround? Oh, such fun. And then at night they took us back. The reward was, we ate in the\nnoncommissioned officer\u2019s mess, and we wore civilian clothes. And that saved our life, because\nafter a little while, the Germans in Pau, in the commandanture must have heard that there\u2019s some\nJews around there someplace in Gurs. Will never do. So one night we\u2019re eating in the mess, and\nall of a sudden I see a pair of my favorite black suited militia come in. French. Okay. Get\nnervous already. Then I see another pair coming in. And another pair. So I said to the guys,\nwe're all eating at the same table, I says, look fellows, let\u2019s not make it obvious. Let\u2019s just go out\nhere one or two at a time like we\u2019re finished eating. We weren\u2019t finished eating but that was no\ntime to stick around, right? So we got out and [indecipherable] out and we saw -- see, there\u2019s the\nmain route, what they call route nationale was running alongside the camp. I told you, the camp\nwas like a mile long. Would you believe they had truckloads of these militia men that surrounded\nthe camp every 50 or a hundred feet, so that nobody could escape? So, what to do, you know?\nThe guy\u2019s already in the camp, but I happened to be very good friends with one of the -- it was\none of the older police inspectors in his -- must have been 40\u2019s or some like that. And he was\nmarried and he was still living in the camp, across the street in Quonset huts. Very civilized\nthough, and he had two kids. So I have one guy with me also, big guy, but he was a real baby. He\nsays, what are you gonna do, what are you g -- I says, what, I\u2019m going to try to sneak through the\nwire and run across to in -- 1t was night, and see whether this inspector would put me up\novernight until they have left and done their dirty deed, right? He\u2019s like, please take me along,\ntake me along. I says, hey man, what are you crazy, nobody knows you. Well, he made such a\npest of mys -- of himself, I took him along. So -- you -- you remember, it was the war, so there\u2019s\nblackout, there\u2019s no lights anyplace. Knock on the door and either he or his wife open up the\ndoor, I says, blah, blah, blah --\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: No, not the commandant, one of the inspectors.",
        "A: Yeah. And I says -- explained my situation whether we could come in and you know, I have a\nproblem. Oh, she pulls us in, and explained to them. Oh, she says, sure. Now you gotta\nunderstand how good the French are. I listen to them being torn apart all the time, and I don\u2019t\nlisten to this. She had two children. First thing she did, she took the kids out of bed, where did\nshe put them to sleep, I don\u2019t know. Then, I haven\u2019t slept in a bed in how long, I don\u2019t know how\nlong. She goes ahead and changes the sheet. I said, lady, you don\u2019t have to change the sheet. She\nchanged the sheet. Now, you know why I say that. You couldn\u2019t get soap in France, or stuff you\nuse to do a wash. I mean a -- I\u2019m telling you, it -- it -- 1t was a horror show. So she insisted on\ngiving us fresh sheets. So we spent the night there, we slept together in the bed, of course, and\nthen the following morning we went back and we saw how much damage the German did.\nCouple of guys managed to get lucky, but they got a few, you know. And then that was a signal\nfor me that it\u2019s getting towards the end, you can not hang out here any more. So I took a gamble.\nI was -- I told you, when I was the orderly there at this little room, the recepti -- reception room,\nand next to me was the radio operator, you know, in touch with who knows what. So his name\nwas Otis. So I go and see him, I says, Otis, gotta ask you something. Do you by any chance\nknow anybody on the underground that\u2019s a guy that takes people over the Pyrenees? Took a\ngamble. Could have handed me over to the police, too, right, or the Germans? Says, let me see,\ncome back in a little while. He set up an appointment with me -- for me with some mountain type\nguy, and we met, supposedly some sort of bridge, I -- I could get out, you know. I me -- I worked\nfor the assistant and he -- he had the gate right behind his house, so I knew how to get out of the\nplace without getting through the barbed wire. So I met him, and meanwhile it became known\nfor some reason that I was gonna get out of the camp. And the next think I know, I got four guys\nbugging the bejeebers out of me to take them with m -- with me, along. There was only one\ndrawback. After I saw the guide, he says it\u2019s -- argument-wise, 5,000 whatever it is per person. I\nsays Okay. I had -- I always had some money, I worked. Even in the camp when I was the orderly\nI made money, fine. Always had money. But the other dudes didn\u2019t have any money. So what are\nwe gonna do? I have to rustle up a fortune of money. So in the middle of the night we used to\nsneak out of the camp and sell everything we could get rid of, we didn\u2019t need. So eventually --\nand then I went to some guy I know who had a lot of money, and I says, look, blah, blah, blah,\nI\u2019m shy so much money, how about it? So he gave it to me. So finally I have got all the money\nand when we went out the camp at night, was the winter anyway, it was January the 21, 1944 --\nso I gave him the money and the money wasn\u2019t for him. He -- during the day they had to hide us\nin a farmhouse and the farmer had to feed us. In order to buy food they needed money, that\u2019s\nwhat the money was for. And you know the Pyrenees fooled me a lot. I had no idea, I\u2019m telling\nyou, I\u2019m naive in every re-respect. Only once though, you don\u2019t do it twice with me. But the first\ntime around, anything goes. I saw the mountain, I says, oh, you climb that mountain, on the other\nside is Spain, no big deal. Imagine my disappointment when we get on top of the mountain,\nwhat\u2019s across the s -- from me as far as I can see, another mountain, just as high. Well, there\nwere six of them. I\u2019Il make it short because w-we don\u2019t have a week. The last week -- the last\nday, we hit the glacier, we were that high up already, you know, past the snow line, glacier.\nNow, we weren\u2019t exactly dressed. Remember this is between January 21, and January 27\",\nalright? And in the mountains that\u2019s not exactly summertime weather. And especially without the\nproper equipment. So we hitting this glacier -- oh, by the way, those guides were all volunteer.\nThey walked the whole night, and then they c -- they -- they could walk much better than us,\nthen the following -- well, the following morning, they ran back to the -- their day job. Some of\nthem were e-engineers on a -- on a train. Some did ta -- they -- th-they did that -- they didn't get\nany sleep for 24 hours. They did that without a nickel of remuneration. The money was strictly\nfor the farmers so they could buy food for us. Logical situation, which we didn\u2019t know but we\nfound out. So we climbed during the night. The reason that it took so long -- there\u2019s a perfectly\ngood road that goes along in the valley, the only trouble is that it\u2019s patrolled by Germans,\nbecause that\u2019s the road between Spain and France. So we went over every mountain without any\nroads whatsoever. Was horror show. I once fell down the side of a mountain cliff just like that.\nAnd it\u2019s just like in the movies, th-the only thing that stopped me between heaven and earth,\nthere was this shrub sticking out from that cliff. And I get ahold of it. So now I\u2019m looking up and\nI see the guys on top and I look down below. And the guides came, he was like s -- more of a\nmountaineer, right? You see, there was -- the pass was that wide, there was no light. And it had\neroded, there was a hole like that and I didn\u2019t see, and I stepped right in that hole. The way we\ncould see is -- you know what a musette is? That\u2019s like a bread bag that they have in France for\nthe soldiers or for anything, a -- a bag, and they\u2019re usually in light canvas. So, was flung over the\nback from the guy, so that\u2019s what you were focusing on because him you couldn\u2019t see, you\nknow? Phew. So he came and got me back up again. Oy. That was scary. I didn\u2019t scream, either.\nNot a peep out of me, I wasn\u2019t giving anybody away.",
        "A: Mm-hm. And I mean, walking up the mountain is bad, you can\u2019t believe what it is to walk\ndown the mountain. You can\u2019t walk down the mountain, you run, because there\u2019s no way --\nanything to stop you. It\u2019s so steep, you run.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, tha -- tha -- that\u2019s nice. That -- I-I said to him -- that\u2019s the guy whose\njob I got through -- you know, who did some tricks, but he loved his dog. Okay, fine. A small\nGerman Shepherd, or young German Shepherd. I says, he is totally insane, I couldn\u2019t talk him\nout of it. All right. So the first step, the first night, we\u2019re on the -- off a cliff 1-in a shepherd\u2019s hut,\nyou know, trying to get a little warm, you know, and get a little rest. And it was on a cliff\noverlooking down below. After a little while, whatever it was, we\u2019re walking out of there and\nI\u2019m the last guy out and I happen to look down there. Down there\u2019s a German patrol with a\nShepherd, and the Shepherd is barking to beat the band. Why? He smelled the other dog. Not us\nso much as the dog. Man, did we have to run, and the guy didn\u2019t even have any pepper or\nanything like that he could have sprinkled around on the track. That was a good one.",
        "A: No [indecipherable]",
        "A: Look, I don\u2019t analyze things, not at that time. Later on you have time to analyze. While it\u2019s\nhappening there\u2019s no psychoanalysis, you know? So after six days we\u2019re now faced -- oh yeah,\nexcuse me. On the six days we met two more groups. One group was people that were very well\nheeled, with the proper equipment, you know, mountain equipment you know, and -- and the\nshoes with spikes, and then the right kind of rucksack, you know, and the nice warm clothes, you\nknow, filthy rich people. They didn't like it any more either. I don\u2019t know whether they were\nJewish or not, most -- more likely they\u2019re not. And lo and behold I inherit five allied flyboys.\nFour Americans and a British. They have -- have been channeled by the French underground all\nthe way back to where our meeting point was. You know, the French used to hide them at night.\nYou know, maybe they came all the way -- I don\u2019t know from where, but they were shot down\nover, you know, German territory. So for some reason they -- the rich people went their own way\n-- they elected me as their leader. Okay? I\u2019m not a soldier or anything like that, I\u2019m their leader,\nhallelujah. Same way I was the leader of the other dudes. They all were older than me. So we\u2019re\nfacing this glacier there, sheer wall. So the mountain man, he has this pick, you know this -- they\ngot these things, they\u2019re those picks, and he\u2019s hacking a step into the ice, one step at a time. So\nhere -- it\u2019s like a bunch of monkeys, we\u2019re all hanging on for dear life, one hand in this -- in -- in\nthe step and the other one was standing there, and the guy in front of you 1s standing there.\nFinally you make it to the top. And the top is one sheer field of ice, going down like this.\nAnyway you want to look at, sheer ice. Well, we get to the top and guide says to me, well okay,\nthis is th -- that -- this 1s one for the ages. You follow that river, and that will lead you to\ncivilization. I said to him, river? What -- what the heck are you talking about? I don\u2019t see any\nriver. I have 20/20 vision, didn\u2019t see any river. I says, you\u2019re in -- you\u2019re not going to leave me\nhere. You take me where that river allegedly is. Comes with me and it was ice, I\u2019m telling you,\nit\u2019s like I said, it\u2019s a sheer glacier. So -- and underneath, all of a sudden, there\u2019s a slight\ndiscoloration underneath the ice, it\u2019s grayish. He says, you see that? That\u2019s the river. You follow\nthat, okay? That\u2019s how a river starts someplace, I guess. I can vouch for it because it turned into\na river. So like good pedestrians, we walk on the right side of nothing, underneath the ice. And\nslowly, slowly -- if you ha-have ever been to New Hampshire, you see in those rapids over there,\nsplashing over the stone. Scary. Not very deep, but scary when you don\u2019t know that. So all of a\nsudden, we\u2019re on the right side and there\u2019s no place to walk any more because there\u2019s a sheer\ncliff like that, the -- the river must have gouged it out. But the opposite side 1s perfectly nice and\nflat. There\u2019s only one thing wrong. By now that quote, no river, was maybe, let me see, I want to\nkeep it within the framework of reality. Maybe 40 - 50 feet wide. And it\u2019s [indecipherable]. So\nwe took off our shoes and then we looked whether there was a stone to step on, and we made it\nto the other side. Now the other side was mud, but was plenty room to walk, and it was like the\nGrand Canyon. It was completely gouged out like this, yo -- you know? It -- like a cover. And\nwe kept on walking and walking and walking and walking, there\u2019s hours, you know. And the\nonly sound that you heard once in awhile was the axe of a lumberjack, someplace, you know,\nthat carries very far in the -- in an icy neighborhood and in the woods with no other noise, you\nknow? And once in a blue moon we saw a Spaniard. Now, two of the guys were Spanish Civil\nWar veterans, so they spoke Spanish, so [indecipherable] you know, whatever, so a -- ah -- they\nthought we were Spaniards. Here goes. We come around the corner, and we froze. What\u2019s in\nfront of us like -- hard to say accurately, let\u2019s say 500 feet. A platoon of Germans with trucks and\neverything. I says, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. And you know who was the most scared? Hate to tell\nyou. The soldier boys. They were going to hightail it. I says, boys -- I spoke English -- as -- not\nas well as now, but spoke some English enough to get by. I says, hold it. If these are Germans\nthey\u2019re going to shoot you the minute you start running. Let\u2019s take it easy, they don\u2019t seem to be\nall that dangerous. They keep on staring at the Germans there. German helmet, German boots,\nGerman uniforms, German everything. Something -- and all of a sudden I saw what was\ndifferent. The belt and the bandoliers were bright yellow. Well, the Germans are either brown or\nblack. So then I knew they were Germans. So we had no choice but to walk up to them. So the\nallied sold --",
        "A: Of course not, not with a b -- yellow bandolier, you know, and a yellow belt. With -- the\nGermans have black and -- or brown. You know, that\u2019s what -- that\u2019s what stopped me, I knew\nthere was something different. And so we walk up to them, and the other guys identified\nthemselves as allied soldiers, showed their dogtag, whatnot. They put them on the truck, drove\nthem to the nearby embassy in -- it must be Bilbao or some town there, I don\u2019t remember. Okay?\nThey were home free. Us, we don\u2019t deserve, because we weren\u2019t the only guys that came across,\nwe don\u2019t deserve no trucks. We haven\u2019t walked enough, only six days, or six nights. So we\u2019re\nwalking, and we\u2019re schlepping, we\u2019re schlepping. The next thing we know, they threw us into a\none cell dungeon, the filthiest place I ever seen in my life. Window up there, no place to sleep or\nnothing. So the following day we wind up -- I don\u2019t know whether we got on a truck, I don\u2019t\nremember. I can\u2019t swear, I ga -- what I can\u2019t swear to, I\u2019m not saying. We wind up in Bilbao.\nWhere did they take us? To Spanish Gestapo headquarters. Pure marble everything. I don\u2019t mean\nthe outside, I don\u2019t mean the wall, I don\u2019t mean the floor. I mean the benches you sat on, all\nmarble. This is after Franco [indecipherable], I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- this is 1941 -- \u201944, and the war\nis over in \u201939, and they were poor as church mice, proverbial. So each and every one go -- gets\ninterviewed. Now, obviously we didn\u2019t come along with papers. Now being that I\u2019m as good as\nany Frenchman ever was, all of a sudden I\u2019m French. Took my France -- French name,\nbirthplace, the whole thing. The only thing that I did, I lied. The only time in my life actually --\nyou don\u2019t have to believe me, but it\u2019s true. I fudged my age. All of a sudden I was 17 years old. I\nlooked very young, I was emaciated, haven\u2019t eaten in four years. So, you know, I looked very\nyoung. They bought it. Saved my life.",
        "A: Well, if you were of army age, right? Meaning 18 - 19 - 20 - 21 or older, you wound up in\nMiranda. Miranda was a death camp like Andersonville from the Civil War. Just as bad as the\nGerman concentration camps. Just as bad. So I wound up with the old people and the children.\nFantastic. Wound up in a little rest -- no, first in town they put us up in a real nice restaurant, the\nfirst decent meal I had had in five years -- four years, okay? Of course I was with the French, you\nknow, I was French. No paper, but I was French. And nobody was going to say I\u2019m not French.\nNobody would believe me if I would have told them, which at one time I did, and nobody\nbelieved me anyway. Couldn\u2019t be. Couldn\u2019t be that I\u2019m not French. Okay, fine. So the following\nday they take us and we wind up in a small -- let\u2019s say town, way up in the mountain and in a\nnice, little hotel. Now I\u2019m living, together with older people, you know. I don\u2019t know how many,\nlet\u2019s say 15 -17 or so. And we were plenty of food. The Spaniard for some reason had food, and I\nwant to tell you how that came about. The -- they -- they tho -- spanic -- spa -- Spain is very arid\nand poor, and all they grew was olive and o-oranges. Well, how come they had food? Well, for\nevery allied prisoner that they turned in to the allies, the United States gave them a 75 kilo bag of\ngrain, or 175 pound bag of grain. Wheat. And they paid them X amount of dollars per prisoner.\nSo they had a marvelous business to -- even though they were leaning towards Hitler -- you\nknow, Franco, well, you can\u2019t pass up a good deal like that. The allies were smart. So they\nbought all of their prisoners and th-that\u2019s how come the Spaniards had food. And at for -- they\ngot strangest eating ours, but that\u2019s not here nor there. At four or five o\u2019clock in the afternoon\nthey made chocolate, you know, hot chocolate? But they don\u2019t make it like powder, they take\nchocolate bars, and you know when the chocolate is finished, you can put a spoon in and it stays\nupright, that\u2019s how thick that chocolate is. But we had a lot of nice food there. That didn't last too\nlong. Then they threw me again in another camp with hundreds upon hundreds of hundreds and\nhundreds of French people, young people, also refugees from France, also in the mountains, and\nthey put us 1n a -- well, that must have been the spa in peacetime, you know, like a big hotel, and\nwith plenty of rooms, and -- and -- and dining room and things like that. So we stayed there for a\nlittle while and then they transferred us to another one that was actually even nicer, but by that\ntime it\u2019s already going on towards spring. Now anybody that tells you that Spain is warm 1s\nmistaken, he has never hang -- hung around northern Spain, it is freezing. It 1s freezing. And we\nalways had to get out there for the colors, you know, like -- you know, when they raise the flag\nand things like? One night we -- we had to stand there. One of their things, what can I tell you?\nAnd then we wound up -- oh yeah, and I -- I was under the misconception that oh, Pll get out of\nhere in no time flat, you know, wound up in North Africa. So I never bothered learning Spanish.\nSo one month goes by, I\u2019m still there. Two months goes by, I\u2019m still there. After three months a\nlight goes on, I says, fella, you were vastly mistaken, you\u2019re net gotten -- you\u2019re not getting out\nof here so fast, better learn Spanish. Not bragging, stating facts. I learned perfect Spanish in three\nweeks. I was so good in Spanish that I used to write love letters for the -- for the fellas to write --\nto send to the girls.",
        "A: North Africa, of course.",
        "A: That\u2019s where the French were, free French.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Not the Spanish, the Spanish hand me over to the free French who\u2019d take care of me.",
        "A: Yeah, and they eventually did. The only problem was the French had the marvelous system.\nYou could tell them any kind of fairy tale like I found out in the Foreign Legion, not for myself,\nbut for other people, and by the time they had you screened, which took a few weeks, you gotta\nreme -- realize that French was occupied territory, they knew exactly who you were. They knew\nyour police record if you had one. They knew where you were born, you knew -- they knew your\nreal name. That -- they let you tell them anything you wanted, but they wanted to investigate and\nthey could find out. So naturally I didn\u2019t have any papers, I have to come clean. So what was my\nchoice? The Foreign Legion. I wanted the French army, right? Couldn\u2019t do it. I wasn\u2019t French,\nyou know, and they didn\u2019t -- you know. So I wound up in the Foreign Legion. And the Foreign\nLegion, eventually we were sent to Casablanca, you know, from[indecipherable] which is\nGibraltar, to Casablanca, you know, these -- take the ship there. It\u2019s across the Straights, it\u2019s very\n-- you know, the two oceans collide, the Mediterranean and the Pacific -- and the -- and the\nAtlantic, and let me tell you, it\u2019s not a peaceful meeting.",
        "A: Whew, my God, unbelievable. That was my second sea storm, but anyway -- well that one\nwas the first one, anyway. And so we wound up in a big army base in Casablanca and they\ninterrogate me and the British were there that were doing the interrogation and they were very\nthrilled with all the information I could give them about the Atlantic Wall. You see, what, where,\nhow much, how fast, how big, how deep, what was the weaponry, what -- I had all that\ninformation and [indecipherable] to get a guy firsthand information, okay? So we were together\nwith French Colonial troops and there also were Americans on the base. Now I said to myself,\nthe Foreign Legion, I\u2019m not that crazy about it. From what I hear, it\u2019s not a place to be. So I saw\ntwo army officers, American, coming by. Being that I spoke a little English, I went up to them, I\nsays, \u201cGentlemen, excuse me, I would really like to join the American army.\u201d Oh, obviously they\nwere from the quartermaster depot. They were uninterested, you know? That was my chance of\nserving in the American Army. I knew that the Foreign Legion was going to be the absolute pits\nof the world, which it was, but that\u2019s a -- you know. So -- and I saw the strangest things there.\nThe Moroccans were the nicest of all Arabs, I tell you. The further east you go, the worst they\nget. The Moroccans are the nicest. The Algerians already, forget it. The Tunisian, no good.\nLibya, after that, forget, it\u2019s the end of the world. But the Moroccans aren\u2019t bad. They were real\nnice. That\u2019s the first time I saw pot. I didn't know what it was.",
        "A: Pot. Marijuana. And [indecipherable] in the bags just sitting outside, and there\u2019s this\nMoroccan dude, some older gent. He pulls a tiny little s -- white ceramic pipe, with a thimble\ntype bowl. And he\u2019s stuffing the thing. And I said to him, in French obviously, I says, what\u2019s\nthat? He said, kief. You want a shot? Do you want to try it? I said, oh, no thank you. So kief is\nthe first time I met with marijuana. He was smoking kief.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. You know, after they screened us and blah, blah, blah, and I was attached to this\nFrench legion division, and to that one and this, that, eventually we wound up in the desert as an\nassembly point, then we took the LST\u2019s, you know, the big landing craft, you put the doors open\nin the front? And we went from [indecipherable] to Marseille. Marseille was a French port, we\ncould -- right into the town, you know, because the -- like, what they call the [indecipherable]. It\nwas like the -- a wall, you know, a -- what you would call a seawall, you know, you could -- and\nyou just dropped the doors and it went over, it was very -- actually it was be -- between me and\nmy lieutenant we were the first one off the ship, you know? And so --\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. We\u2019re landing in Marseille, and then we follow up the Rhone river valley,\nbecause it had been clear already by previous troops, Americans possibly, you know, I don\u2019t\nknow. And what amazed me the most and what most people don\u2019t realize was how rich a country\nFrance was. The Germans had to abandon all the cars that they took from the French trying to get\nhome with them. On each side of the road -- this is hard to believe -- for, let\u2019s say a minimum of\nthree - 400 miles, were abandoned cars, three rows of abandoned cars. Now, can you picture how\nwell the French were doing?",
        "A: That\u2019s for hundreds of miles, three beside. Anyway, we went -- we wound up at the triangle --\nthe triangle of [indecipherable], Vivier, and I forget the other town, and there we have a little\nstopped, and then we hit -- oh what\u2019s -- what\u2019s the town called there? Belfort. And you know,\nthat\u2019s -- you know, little fighting, little this and we are stuck in mud again. The halftracks are\nstuck, the trucks are stuck. I mean, it\u2019s unbelievable the mud, and it\u2019s like where the Ardennes\nare, the Vosges come together, you know, the mountains where all the World War I battles were\nfought. S-Same story all over the world, never changes. And then we slowly, when it really gets\ncold, we advance into Germany. Actually, we stayed in Alsace-Lorraine near Strasbourg for a\nlittle bit, and then, sometime later, must have been April or something, we crossed the Rhine at --\nI don\u2019t know, a -- a -- a -- where. The Americans had built a pontoon bridge, you know, and one\ncami -- one -- one truck at a time, you know, boom, boom, and then we\u2019re rolling into Germany,\nand things like that. And then we went from one village to the next, from one town to the next.\nAnd then eventually we wound up in this lovely, lovely little town, shortly before the end of the\nwar, and the people were very nice. Got myself a girlfriend obviously, and that\u2019s first thing I did.\nHad p -- I had plenty of freedom, I was -- I don\u2019t know whether -- I didn\u2019t mention it, I won\u2019t\nthink so. As a private first class, that\u2019s as h -- far as I got, I was running the motor pool. Can you\nimagine that, all by myself? No stripes, no nothing. I had more clout than any officer ever had. I\nran the whole motor pool. Jeep, GMC trucks, Dodge trucks, halftracks. You name it, I ran it all. I\nordered the parts, wa -- I used to be -- I-I told you, I spoke some English. So all the orders have\nto be written or filled out in English, because requisitions were in English.",
        "A: Well, the Americans were supplying us.",
        "A: We got supplied by the Americans. Food, weapons, uniforms. Everything was American, you\nknow? And that was great because -- as long as the war lasted. After that it wasn\u2019t so good. So\nanyway --",
        "A: At that time we weren\u2019t talking Nazis any more, we were just talking fighting the Germans.",
        "A: Wa --",
        "A: -- I knew from before, I knew that there were Auschwitz, and that people didn\u2019t come out of\nit. That\u2019s what I knew from --",
        "A: [ -- I -- I -- I -- I might have known, I can\u2019t swear to you -- to it, because this was very\nremoved from the stress of hour to hour living. We\u2019re not talking day to day, you know? Even\nwhile I was in Castelnot, it was never a relaxing thing.",
        "A: Either I was totally exhausted from work. There was -- for weeks I couldn\u2019t straighten out my\nhands after six weeks of hoeing the vineyards.",
        "A: They were cramped like that.",
        "A: For -- for -- for -- for -- \u00b042, it was a -- was a known fact. In \u201942 --",
        "A: No, it just meant death. That\u2019s the only thing that we knew, that the German were killing the\nJews in Auschwitz, you know.",
        "A: In terez -- yeah, Theresienstadt, whatever, you know? Bergen-Belsen and d-d -- Dachau was\nwell known because that\u2019s in Germany. You know, Dachau and the -- and a couple of more there\nwhich escape me right now. So that we knew, because we knew that they didn\u2019t treat the Jews\nnicely when they picked them up.",
        "A: They were very, very cruel and gruesome. I mean, they did it to their own people. Hitler used\nto hang his own bodies from meathooks, you know, when he was unhappy with them, so you can\nimagine how well they treated the Jews.",
        "A: Yeah. My mother lost a sister.",
        "A: No. No, no.",
        "A: The oldest one, the oldest one.",
        "A: The oldest one that didn\u2019t want to send my namesake boy --",
        "A: -- to live with my aunt in France. They stayed there, they died. That\u2019s her side of the family.\nMy father\u2019s family, everybody, his father, 85, his two brothers, his sister that married a Catholic,\nand the nuns hid her and her daughter, because you see, because you\u2019re married to a Catholic,\nand Jewish, doesn\u2019t count. It even makes the guy that married you a prime target for retribution,\nyou know? So she swore that if she ever got out of that alive, that shell convert to Christianism -\n- or Christianity or whatever. So -- and then her two children were obviously -- well, not\nobviously, they were born Jewish. You know what I\u2019m saying? But, you know, they were half\nand half, so it\u2019s very hard to say. So my father was the most people, because he had -- my -- my\ng -- grandfather died before. My grandm-mother died before him on my mother\u2019s side. My\nmother got out, my aunt in France got out, my aunt in England got out. It\u2019s only the sister that\ninsisted, oh, they\u2019re not going to touch us.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s the youngest one.",
        "A: Yeah --",
        "A: -- in 39 she got out to England, it only cost everything.",
        "A: The house, the store, every kind of last nickel that she had.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Well, I can tell you, the business of living and staying alive was unbelievable. Let me tell you\nhow sick I was. There was nothing to eat in France, so my mother went around, she was very\ngood friends with the baker lady. She went over to the baker lady, trying v -- v -- everybody was\non ration, I mean the French, everybody, so -- trying to get a slice of bread for me or something\nlike that. Now, couldn\u2019t get a slice of bread, couldn\u2019t get nothing. Vegetables, yes. There were\nvegetables, you could get some eggs, chicken once in a blue moon, but no meat. Once in a blue\nmoon you got a -- a -- on your ration cards you got like a pound of meat for the month, or\nsomething like that. Maybe. Not sure yet. I rem -- I don\u2019t remember. I know one [indecipherable]\nwas over, you know. Or anyway. So she\u2019s sitting there with the baker lady, goes to show you\nwhat shape I was in, says, Monsieur Claude -- and my name was Claude in France, not Kurt.\nKurt and the French and the Germans, so Claude was a little safer. Ah, Monsieur Claude is such\na nice young man. What a shame he has to die. That\u2019s the shape I was in.",
        "A: See, the farmers, this was a farm community, are far more at ease with life and death than city\npeople.",
        "A: All right, we\u2019re not talking now, but you know, in [indecipherable]",
        "A: God almighty. I'd sa -- I got back to North Africa from Germany, must have been June 1945.\nI must -- must have taken -- yeah, that was the second time I had maybe dysentery when we left\nfor France, you know, for the invasion. But that was the first time and that was quite -- quite a\nlong time, and the -- when I went back to France and I got some decent food, at midnight I used\nto go over to the farm ladies and says, could you maybe bake me a little apple pie or something?\nSo they did and I took care of myself, all right? I mean, the Americans supplied us too, but you\nknow, k-rations and such, it\u2019s not -- you know. But anyway, so I beat it eventually.",
        "A: The second time, being that I had still the germ in me, obviously, it took two weeks before I\nwas flat on my back again. But being a soldier you have no choice. The Foreign Legion is not\ntoo much into people. The Foreign Legion is much more into equipment. They would sacrifice\n20 men to save a truck, easy, no problem. Oh, we\u2019ll get 20 more tomorrow, no problem.",
        "A: So anyway, just to answer the question --",
        "A: -- from July, all the way to the end of November.",
        "A: Augu -- July, August, September, October, November, five months. And I looked it, I have\npictures to prove it.",
        "A: But at that time -- at that time, from North Africa, which was French, I was able to\ncommunicate with my aunt and uncle.",
        "A: I really didn\u2019t know at that time where my --",
        "A: -- parents were, but my aunt and uncle, or my aunt at least, was in touch with my parents, so\nhenceforth they knew I was okay.",
        "A: But for quite a few years my parents didn\u2019t know --",
        "A: -- where I was, or whether I was alive, you know, that --",
        "A: In Castelnot Rivierbas, yeah.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know what -- well, that\u2019s the place that they knew --",
        "A: -- and they were well known there, and by that time they must have had some remorse, you\nknow, the police department and they treated them rather well, you -- 1f you know what I mean.",
        "A: And --",
        "A: Yeah, my brother, from Castelnot -- I stayed a long time, I wasn\u2019t well, I couldn\u2019t walk let\u2019s\nsay from that end to that end. I mean, I couldn\u2019t, I was so weak. Anyway, my father got the\ndoctor. We had one doctor in the village, and he was very good diagnostician, and he prescribed\nlittle ampules. You know what ampules are? Glass vials and they\u2019re filled with cultures. So my\nfather t-take the train to the big city, have the prescription filled, come back with the prescription\nand then IJ a -- I drank this twice a day in some water. And eventually -- the doctor had it right on\nthe money, slowly, slowly, slowly. But the strength was slow in coming because there was no\nfood for me --",
        "A: -- to get strong on, or with. So --",
        "A: Harry knew that in Castelnot there\u2019s only farm work, that\u2019s no future. So Grenoble was a\nwonderful college city -- university city actually, and in the house actually, little bit, you know.\nVery pretty, beautiful buildings. And he start -- he found a job there. And then, when I was\nstrong enough, well, I couldn\u2019t stay in Castelnot, again there was nothing there for me, so I went,\nand we both lived in the same sm-small room, furnished room that I had rented, and in the small,\nitsy-bitsy s -- bed with the sagging mattress until I started working and made a living and could\nafford my own furnished room, in the same place, of course.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: What my father going to do at that age?",
        "A: He can\u2019t -- he can\u2019t make -- he can\u2019t make a -- in France he can\u2019t make the living, you -- it\u2019s\nnot like the United States, you come, you apply for a job, if the guy likes you, you get it. Uh-uh.\nOver there the papers, you gotta see. I got papers that you wouldn -- you wouldn\u2019t believe what it\ntakes in France to get a job, you know? So my aunt from Germany, the single one that stayed\nwith my grandfather, got to England, was in the United States and had married an American\nfellow, I think, and he had an extended family, wonderful people, and they put up the bail for me\nto come to the United States and for my parents. You know how much you have to put up for me\nwhen I came a year later? 10,000 dollars so I would -- shouldn\u2019t fall, you know, th-that the state\nwould have to take care of me.",
        "A: That\u2019s when you immigrate illegally -- or emigrate. That\u2019s the difference between then and\nnow. And not only that, had to go to the embassy in Paris and the doctor screened me like I was a\n-- a Michelangelo there. You know, checked me for being defect free.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I was doing very well in France, I had a marvelous job. Had a lot of respect, had 25 people\nworking for me. Imagine, I was a big 24 - 25 years old at the time. And -- and t -- they treated me\nwonderful. The only thing is that my parents and my brothers used to hound me with letters.\nHow can you stay there, you\u2019re all alone, you\u2019re all single, whatev -- first of all, I wasn\u2019t all\nalone. Number two, I had my aunt and my uncle in Vichys that I used to go and visit every once\nin awhile, my second set of parents, you know? And I had a girlfriend that took real good care of\nme.",
        "A: So what the problem, you know?",
        "A: They kept on hounding me to death.",
        "A: You can\u2019t stay there, da da da. I came over here -- of course, 1t was an experience, an eye-\nopener, because the United States, even though it was originally populated by white people from\nEurope, 1s so different from Europe, like night and day. There\u2019s no -- there\u2019s not even -- you\ncan\u2019t even compare. The closest you could conceivably come to compare one with the other is\nGermany and the United States. But even that is really a stretch. The attitude, the mentality, the -\n- it\u2019s totally different here. Look, I want to just explains to you how -- let\u2019s forget Hitler which\nwas the worst thing in the world. Happened to the world, not just the Jews. Germany had social\nsecurity under Bismarck, we\u2019re going back to the 19\" century, okay, okay? They were pretty\nadvanced, right? You work in France [indecipherable] twice, doesn\u2019t matter who your boss is,\nyou can change jobs five times a year. As long as you work a four months, you get credit for that\nfour months. For every month you work -- I\u2019m going back to 1948 -- 46 -- \u201947, you get one and\na half days vacation, right? Which means 18 days a year, working days. Plus a bonus, not your\nsalary, but a little extra, so you should actually be able to enjoy a vacation. I think that\u2019s very\nprogressive. You\u2019re not at the mercy of a boss. This is state mandated. You retire at the ripe old\nage of 60 with 80 percent of your earning. Over here you get Social Security, if you make 20\npercent you\u2019re doing real good. You -- you -- you know what I\u2019m saying? So there -- there are\ndifferences, and these are the large difference that you don\u2019t even know when you come here.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Oh, I -- I -- let me put it to you this way. I just loved and admired the United States okay?",
        "A: Now, the way that things were set up and the way I was abused at the beginning, work-wise, I\nwasn\u2019t exactly my cup of tea.",
        "A: See, the first job that I had, took a long time to find, the minute they found out I was not an\nAmerican citizen, they cut my salary, that\u2019s for openers. Then they cheated me out of overtime,\nuntil I found out and of course, as much as my English wasn\u2019t as fluent as it is now, I eventually\ngot my overtime. But that\u2019s the attitude -- you know, how can you -- in France I never had to ask\nfor a raise. They came around to ask the supervisor, foreman, management, whatever, and says,\nwho do you have that merits raise this month? You never had to ask for a raise, if you were\nworth it. And we\u2019re working on merit there, not on bullshit. That\u2019s the big difference. So it takes\na little while to get used to this. No, the best thing that ever happened to me here was meeting my\nwife, and obviously I had the good sense and the perseverance to marry her.",
        "A: Beg pardon?",
        "A: Barbara.",
        "A: I -- I mean, there\u2019s one philosophy I always had. Wherever you are, you marry a girl of this\nparticular country, you know. Like in France I had a French girlfriend. In Germany, I had\nGerman girlfriends, you know. So, no sh -- she was wonderful, it\u2019s -- I miss her big time, but --",
        "A: -- [have to keep on -- my d -- my -- my daughter wants me to keep on living forever. You\nknow, my -- my -- my oldest daughter wants the house, you know, when she retires. So I don\u2019t\nknow how long I can accommodate her. See, as long as I\u2019m self sufficient, it\u2019s not much of a\nproblem.",
        "A: But I can see myself, I guess, in some of the people around here. Especially, you go to\ndoctors, I mean, I have to see doctors, whether I\u2019m sick or not, I mean you have to go and see\ndoctors, blah blabber of all stripes. So you see people and you says, oh God almighty. You know,\nthey -- they\u2019re really -- they\u2019re really in a bad way, I mean, and they\u2019re still clinging to life with\neverything they got. I just don\u2019t understand it.",
        "A: Oh yes. I never had a youth.",
        "A: From the time I was 17 until I was -- well, okay, I had a girlfriend in France, I tried to catch\nup a little bit. But for six years, forget it.",
        "A: I mean, not only was I in horrible places, you know, see I -- we can\u2019t discuss all the horrors in\ndetail, we just have to gloss over the whole thing. But when I think about all the things or places,\nwhatever happened to me, and the only way that I was able to handle it is because I was young.\nYou have no concept of anything. That\u2019s why whoever you send to fight a war is a young person.\nYou don\u2019t see 40 - 50 year old people going in the front line, getting themselves shot up. You\nfind 18 - 20 year old getting -- getting themselves killed. So it\u2019s the same thing with me. I didn't\nknow any better. That\u2019s the way it is, that\u2019s the way it is. But I felt bad when I had time to\nreflect, especially now, I says, gosh, I c -- I -- I couldn\u2019t have survived six months under the\nconditions that I had to live. I mean, we discussed a lot of things but we omitted an awful lot of\nhorror shows, you know. And that\u2019s basically all I can say. But of course my [indecipherable]\nsee, the nice thing is when I married Barbara, I had a ready made family. Her mother, her father,\nher brother, relatives, grandmother, you know, things like that. So then I felt like I sort of like,\nbelonged.",
        "A: It\u2019s important, that feeling. You know, all by yourself you\u2019re floundering around, I mean,\nokay you\u2019re alive, you eat, you do this, you do that and whatnot. But it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s the feeling --\nbelonging is very important to me, you know. And so sh-she was just plain wonderful, you\nknow. Great. On top of that, she was over nine years younger than me, which was a good thing\nin retrospect, because she died. She was 70 or 71. So think about it, you know? If she wouldn\u2019t\nhave been younger, what -- what kind of a nightmare that would have -- and I could take care of\nher, wha -- you know, I took care of her all the rest of -- ever since the roof started caving in, you\nknow? She had the first open heart surgery in May of 1992, and the second one in December\nseventh, 19 -- yeah, 1993, in Houston by the biggest butcher known to mankind, Dr. Denton\nCooley. Wh-Why do I say that? Because he works on an assembly line, he doesn\u2019t take one\npatient at a time, he\u2019s got five or six or seven scheduled for the day. So, if he has to do a little\nmore that he didn\u2019t si -- foresee, that\u2019s too bad for the patient, sew \u2018em up.",
        "A: Do you remember anything that needs to be said? I don\u2019t know. I mean, I -- what I can talk\nabout is I have the most wonderful daughters and grandchildren. My two daughters, one is 49\nand one is 44. They haven\u2019t given me, not as of late either, one minute of aggravation their\nwhole lives. Now, who has a parent can say something like that? And I was a very straight\nfather.",
        "A: You know, what\u2019s that, tough love?",
        "A: Paid -- but the kids love me. And my grandchildren, I walk on water. If Christ wouldn\u2019t have\ninvented it, they would have invented it. I have a granddaughter and a grandson, they think I\nwalk on water. And I -- and my youngest daughter, at the ripe old age of 40 - 41, just after my\nwife died, sh -- fortunately my wife was able, at great, great, great stress, to come to the\nwedding, which I asked my daughter to have here in Florida, you know, at the western country\nclub. Small, because my wife can\u2019t -- you know. And so a -- but sh -- sh -- at least she saw her\ngetting married. She didn't know she was pregnant, you know? I -- I mean, nobody knew at the\ntime, and it\u2019s amazing, the minute she went off the pill, she conceived, and she was 40 years old,\nwhich 1s -- all her friends from college, they all with artificial insemination, this that, whatnot.\nCouldn't have a baby to st -- you know. Most of them anyway. First time she tries -- not only\nthat, she comes up with something real gorgeous. I mean bu -- and she didn\u2019t have any problem.\nI said to her, Leslie, if you take anything like money -- Mommy -- after Mommy, you\u2019ll pop the\nkid out like hotcakes out of the stove. Because my wife never had any -- she had a lot of\nproblems, you know, health-wise, due to what her mother did to her when she was a baby. But\ngiving birth she was a champion. Just like that, both kids. And Leslie did it. Went into the\nhospital at 1:10 at night, 6:10 in the morning, there was that gorgeous baby.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s my pleasure, believe me. I mean, you don\u2019t have to thank me, it should -- basically\nshould be the other way around, that you went to all this trouble with those nice gentleman there,\nand you know. I mean, what the hell 1s left to do?",
