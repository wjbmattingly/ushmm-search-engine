Mr. Elman, please start by telling me your full name and\nyour date and place of birth.",
        "Answer: Yeah. Oh, you ga - now? My name is Joseph Elman, and I was born in 19 -\n- February 5, 1922, in the city of Pruzana.",
        "Q: Did you always use that name, or would you have been known by your Yiddish\nname during those years?",
        "A: This is -- I always used this name.",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to jump ahead now to -- from the -- well, to the time of liberation.\nSo please go ahead and tell me what you remember about being liberated in 1944.",
        "A: When I was liberated, it was in June, I don\u2019t know exact the date, 1944. We f -- I\nremember that when the Russians arrived, they assigned most of the partisans to the\narmy, because the war was still going on. And I and another group and one of the\ncommandeers were assigned to liberate my town and the vicinity of Pruzana. So ra -\n- time when I -- when I came to Pruzana, the most assignments what we were given\nwas to first of all, to s -- look and find most all the collaborators who collaborated\nwith the Germans. This was one of our mission, and then we were sent surrounding\ntowns around Pruzana. I recall one place, it was near -- not far -- 50 kilometers from\nPruzana. We went in a little town, I think it was -- let me [indecipherable] the town.\nThink it was Bielsk, Bielsk. And I remember a farmer came over to me, and he was\ntelling me there is -- this farmer was eding -- hiding out one of the Jewish -- a Jew --\na Jewish boy. And the farmer told me, he says, I been trying to tell him that the war\nis Over, come out from there. He was in the barn, in a hay barn they\u2019re hiding. And\nhe -- he\u2019s heard -- he didn\u2019t believe him because it was still going on, a lot of\nbombardments, the Russians, you know, the airplanes, they bombard at the\nretreating German army. So I remember I went out to him and I says, come out, I\u2019m\na Jew, and I spoke to him Yiddish. Finally he came out. Of course, he was all\nunshaved, dirty and oof -- this 1s -- this is occasion that I can never forget. Then,\nwhile being -- eventually, when I settled in Pruzana, I came to my house and the\nhouse, a lot of houses were destroyed during the war. My house was still existing\nthere. And I came to my house and there was a family with a lot of children, awful\nlot of children. And she nice to be to me, nice to me -- she tried to be an -- a Gentile\nca -- a Gentile [indecipherable] they tried to nice to me. And she tried to, you know,\ngive me food and I saw they haven\u2019t got much for themselves, they were -- I just\nasked her a place to stay and sleep because I was still working, I was still in my\nuniform, was still given a job to look for all those collaborators. And eventually the -\n- another historish -- historic movement -- mo-moment, I would say, after a -- a few\nweeks or a couple mo -- maybe -- maybe six weeks, showed up in sh -- in Pruzana a\ndoctor, her name is Olla Goldfine, and she was a neighbor of mine. And before the\nwar, you know, I was in y -- you know, listening to these -- to these history what is\ngoing on with the Germans, with the Nazis in Germany, and so what I\u2019m\n[indecipherable] I was only 15 years old that time, I was surprised and she told me --\nand she came with a nun, and she told me that she escaped on the second -- this was\nJanuary the -- I -- I think it was the second transport, January the 28\", 1943, at night\nfrom the -- from the cattle car, and she -- sh -- wandered around all night til she\nreached -- in Pruzana we had nuns -- what is the name? A c -- ac -- you know, it\nwas a house of nuns.",
        "Q: A convent?",
        "A: Convent, right. A convent. And she came there, she was very, very known in the\ncity and respected. And sh -- one of -- one of the nuns asked them there, the Mother\nSuperior if she can, you know, that -- to accept her there. But she was afraid and she\nwasn\u2019t, I would say, 1t was a problem for her. So eventually what happened, the nun\ngave her clothes, and put on a big cross on her, and she took off to a town in central\nPoland, and there she spend most of -- most of the time til, in 1944 when the\nRussian moved up to near -- near where she was staying, liberated her, and she came\nback to Pruzana with a nun. Of course, I tried, you know, I was able to do a lot of\nthings that time when I was as-assigned to -- in Pruzana. I helped them very much,\nand eventually, when I left Pruzana, the nun and the doctor followed me and I\nbrought them out to Poland. The war was still going on and we settled wa -- in\nBialystok because Bialystok was already liberated, and Bialystok was assigned the\ntemporary capital of Poland. Coming in Bialystok there were already lot of\norganizations, like different organization from different -- from different\nnationalities, from churches, some from -- and they helped, you know, that time to\nfind housing and to settle down temporarily. So, it happened to be my brother, we\ncall him Shmeril, my brother Louis was already in Bialystok. Now, he was liberated\nalmost the same time that I did, but he was able to get into Bialystok in Poland and I\nwas stuck in Pruzana.",
        "Q: Did he have any interest in going back to Pruzana, to your home?",
        "A: I?",
        "Q: No, your brother.",
        "A: My brother? No, he didn\u2019t want to go back there because he was -- he -- he wa --\na -- he was -- he was lucky that he got out from -- from that -- was -- yeah, this was -\n- our part was the Soviet, you know, Russia, Soviet Union. And in 1944, you\ncouldn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t get out, you couldn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t emigrate, you couldn\u2019t\nget out from -- from the Soviet Union. And I had a big problem getting out, but\nthanks to the doctor and to the nun, they smuggled -- I remember they were -- they\nhad papers to go into Poland. And I got smuggled in somehow, you know, it was a-\nassigned a -- a horse, you know, a horse and wagon, you can put in all your\nbelongings there, and I was going up in the horse and wagon with straw and we\ncrossed the border and that\u2019s the way I arrived, I arrived to Bialystok.",
        "Q: So they would be taking a great risk.",
        "A: Oh -- then I found out that I was -- they charged me as a deserter. You know, I\nleft -- actually I left -- I -- when I was working, assigned to pru -- my town, Pruzana,\nI was in uniform, Russian uniform, and I have a gun, and I have a -- you know, it\u2019s\njust like duty, like a soldier. So --",
        "Q: Mm. What -- what did that uniform look like, the Russian uniform?",
        "A: Well the Russian -- well, we had -- we had -- this is a shirt and pants, khaki. And\nthe shirt was on the outside, and you had a -- you know, over here you had a belt\ncrossing your shirt. And -- and you had a cap, you know. And your -- you had shoes\n[indecipherable] Russian shoes. So I heard afterwards that they were looking for me.",
        "Q: Let me go back to the actual moment of liberation. Wh-What exactly took place\nthen?",
        "A: Well, in the -- actually being in the group, being in partisans in my group in the\nwoods, we already heard couple days ahead when -- before we were liberated, that\nthe Russians already are -- you know, are moving forwards and -- and chasing, you\nknow, and chasing the Germans. Already moving, chasing the Germans. But they\nkept us there for few more days and they told us to mine all the main roads and\nbridges, not to let the German army retreat so easy. And we did that, and I remember\nthat the German army was in disarray. Some of them tried to get around the main\nroads, and they went the side roads, where we caught them near the w -- near our\nterritory, our woods, we caught them that time by the hundreds, and eventually\nthousands. And we had to march and was order, we had to march and -- and deliver\nthem to -- 1t was a camps Ja -- in -- in -- in Rujani, about 50 kilometers from town,\nwhere we had to deliver them, you -- you know, we had the order that you have to\ndeliver them, you cannot kill them or take advantage of them. And that\u2019s what I\nremember before, and after a few days apparen -- after a few days we are, like I\nmentioned before -- of course my brigade consisted about 800 -- 800 fighters, most\nof them were assigned on the front, sent to f -- to fight on the front. And I was\nprivilege enough to be sent with two more Jewish partisans, and Russians, to\nestablish order in the occupied territories.",
        "Q: You mentioned the young Jewish boy hiding. Were there a lot of instances of\nJews who were hiding in the dense forests, who would come to light? Were there\nother -- were there other stories?",
        "A: Well, this 1s already -- this 1s -- already is a -- a farmer, you know, the farmer risk\nhis life. And only -- I don\u2019t know what happened to the rest of the family, but it was\njust one -- some -- it was Jan Vyat, maybe. He kept them -- for a year and a half, he\nkept them, and of course nowadays they call those people the Righteous Gentiles,\nand he is one of them. And the same thing I want to bring out about the doctor, Olla\nGoldfine. Now, the nurse -- the nun who saved her, I\u2019m sure that she is recorded in -\n- in Washington museum as a Righteous. Her name, I have it marked down.",
        "Q: Do you remember what it was? We --",
        "A: I have a name.",
        "Q: Yeah. We\u2019ll come back to it later, if you like, but --",
        "A: DellaRosa, but that\u2019s not her real name, but then maybe she goes on DellaRosa,\nbut her name is [indecipherable]. I have it marked down, because I cannot remember\nthe name.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. We\u2019ll come back to -- to it -- to it later. Please continue to -- to --\nwith your story, what happened next?",
        "A: Well, like I mentioned, when I arrived in Bialystok, and -- with a nun, and with\nthe doctor and I had a cow attached to them, I gave them a cow. And they came --\nwell, nothing else, you couldn\u2019t take a house with you. Well, that time, you figure a\ncow, you'll bring it on the other side to Poland, maybe you can ge -- you know, you\ncan get a few dollars, you can -- you can benefit little bit, have extra money,\nwhatever you need. Because you had to leave everything behind, you couldn\u2019t take\nmuch -- much -- oh, much -- the furniture [indecipherable] house, you know, like a\nmansion I left my house, my house was there, right, and -- and when I came in\nBialystok, I got united with my brother, older brother, and th -- it was -- people were\ncoming in, I remem -- in Bialystok, some survivors f-from different kind of\nexperiences. Some came, you know, some came in from hi-hidden by farmers, some\nwere hidden in the woods. And it was a mishmash, it was, you know -- you figure at\nthat time that you are liberated already, that time will be f-for the better. But actually\nthis wasn\u2019t the case. This wasn\u2019t the case. That time families from ruta -- uprooted\nand destroyed, and everybody was looking for survivors, maybe sometimes you had\na brother, sisters, parents. And a lot of organizations was established already\nBialystok. That time they knew what was still going on. Warsaw, the capital of\nPoland wasn\u2019t taken yet. But a lot of Jewish organizations, and a lot of Christian\norganizations were established in Warsaw -- in -- 1n Bialystok, and they gave a\ntemporary help, housing, food and so forth.",
        "Q: When you saw your brother Louis in Bialystok, how much time had elapsed\nsince you had last seen him?",
        "A: I want him -- I want him -- I -- I want to mention my brother Louis. We escaped\ntogether and when we were in a group together, Hassidic Jewish group, and when\nwe were, you know, assigned in the later round, in the -- in the brigades, Russian\nbrigades, he was assigned in a different place, in a different brigade. And I didn\u2019t\nhear from him since, for a year and a half, since I was in the woods.",
        "Q: Who --",
        "A: But -- but once in awhile, through contact with partisans, I found out that he\u2019s\nthere and he\u2019s still alive. But no communication at all for yea -- for the -- since a\nyear and a half, over year and a half in the woods.",
        "Q: Was that very difficult to lose touch with him? I-I wondered what your\nrelationship was, and if you very much relied on him at the time when you made the\ndecision to flee to the forest?",
        "A: Well, we actually -- it\u2019s a difficult, but I didn\u2019t think about it very much, because\nwe were busy, day and night busy, when we were assigned, you know f -- taken in in\nthe kiro brigade in the -- for the Marine corps unit. We were busy day and night with\nmissions. And so you didn\u2019t think so much about it, about him, but once in awhile\nyou t -- you -- you was thinking about your family.",
        "Q: When did you come to terms with the fact that your family had been lost? Was\nthat when you went back to Pruzana?",
        "A: This happened in Bialystok later on. See, I had been in bial -- bi -- when -- we\nbeen in Bialystok for quite a few months. We arrived, I think, in late 1944, I don\u2019t\nknow exactly the month. And eventually, when the Russian army pushed ahead, and\nliberated Auschwitz, people were coming in -- people from there were coming --\ngoing east to this town, to the cities where they belong. And it happened one time in\nBialystok, I met a girl, sh-she was young, maybe she was only 16 years old or\nsomething, and she survived the Auschwitz, and she came to Bialystok. And then\nshe told me that the Bialystok -- that the Pruzana, the Jews were sent to Auschwitz.\nAnd she mentioned, I think I saw your older sister there, but she wasn\u2019t sure. So at\nleast I know that my older sister wind up in the labor camp to go [indecipherable]\nthe rest, my father and my mother and my sister, they went to the crematoriums,\novens.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Well, your father had committed suicide --",
        "A: Well, it wa --",
        "Q: -- just a little earlier, 1s that right?",
        "A: Yeah, not wa -- I -- no, I want to retract that, retract that. My father, my mother\nand my two sisters, and my grandfather and my aunt and my uncle and two kids,\nthey went together the same -- the s -- the same time -- the s -- when it was, you\nknow, the evacuation, they call it. Took four ti -- four days, four nights, they\ncouldn\u2019t -- they couldn\u2019t transport all the 12,000 people from the ghetto in one night,\nso they -- they broke 1t down in four sections, first, second, third and fourth. See, my\nfather was -- it happened s -- I think was in Oct-October -- October 1992, we were at\nthat time still in the ghetto, I remember we were operating our group and it came an\norder the same that all the Jews for the ghetto h-had to get certain -- certain -- certain\nwarning to get ready ce-certain place, this was, I think be -- by the -- by the market\nin the center of the city, and be ready for transportation the same way as the last\ntime. That time, the Judenrat, all the Judenrat, the Judenrat, this is the -- the\nleadership of the ghetto decided to commit suicide. They thought, you know, it\u2019s\nalready the last minute. And what happened, I remember the doctor, she arranged\nthe [indecipherable] from the Judenrat, and it wasn\u2019t successful, and I think there\nwas only one died. You know, she gave them pills and they -- they s -- they -- they\nlit the stove in order to get the s -- you know, the -- ta -- sa-saphistic, you know, to\nget -- get the --",
        "Q: Carbon monoxide?",
        "A: Carbon monoxide.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: To mix carbon monoxide. This night one of the Judenrat and my father -- my\nfather commi -- didn\u2019t belong to the group. See, my father always said, I remember,\nDad is not going to go and see his family destroyed. And he planned that, and he\nplanned it with a way that he locked himself up, you could never get in, in one of the\nsections in our house, and he hanged himself. Eventually we found it. But we are\nfortunate we were able to get -- bury him. And, you know, with honor tn -- in the\nback of our house in -- in the -- in the yard in back of our house.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s -- and with -- you\u2019re able to give him a religious burial, which I gather\nwas important.",
        "A: Still -- yeah, yeah, and still -- religious burial and still we\u2019re able to -- we\u2019re able\nto have the -- they call it -- this happened eventu -- when we stayed in our -- this was\nwe still stayed in our house, that\u2019s why we were able to bury him in back of -- and\nstill, you know, have -- have a minyan and give him services every day, three times\na day. And what happened is later on -- this was, I think it\u2019s around December 2000\nor two. One of my uncles was -- he was, you know, was s -- they used to take you to\nwork outside the ghetto, and he was, I would say, dogs. They charge dogs to find out\nhow long it take, how long will it take one dog, two dogs, three dogs. And they\nripped them up pieces. And then we moved in, we had to give up our house because\nalready it\u2019s -- the house was up --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Joseph Elman. This is tape number\none, side B.",
        "A: So that time we moved in with -- with my aunt, and we were able yet for couple\nmonths afs -- in her house -- it\u2019s already two widows, my mother and her s -- her\nsister, two widows, that conduct the services in her house.",
        "Q: How did you -- how did all of you take your father\u2019s death? Wh-What impact did\nit have on you and your brother, Louis?",
        "A: Well, this was -- you know, it was rough. It was rough especially, you know,\nespecially for the older family, especially for my mother, and -- because he knew,\nmy father knew that we are involved in underground movement. He knew. But he\nwas a pessimist. Little pe-pes -- I\u2019m saying a pessimist is because I\u2019Il never forget --\nhe was a educated man, but he -- on a piece of paper he described all the countries.\nHe says, boys, you don\u2019t have a single country, a single like independent or neutral\ncountry, which was that time Switzerland and on the other side is Sweden. You\nknow, encircled here you are. You gotta go through all this, all this, Holland, and\nthen France in order to -- in order -- in order to reach Austria, in order to reach, you\nknow, this -- even if you'll get out, you\u2019ll be able to get out, he says it\u2019s a lost cause,\nboys. That\u2019s his opinion, see?",
        "Q: And that also seemed to be the opinion of the Judenrat, who w-were c-\nconsidering suicide.",
        "A: Well, it -- it was -- the Judenrat, because they still believe this was already the\nlast minute -- beca -- the Judenrat was at the responsible job, while -- while you --\nthe ghetto isn\u2019t existing. You know, they had -- they -- they had a -- a responsible\njob, make sure, because the Germans and all the, you know, the branches, they dealt\nwith them. If they needed a hundred people here, and a hun -- a hundred people\nthere, it was -- they went to the Judenrat, in charge of the labor. Minister of Labor,\nMinister of [indecipherable], Minister of -- of -- of -- of -- of Health. You know, it\nwas -- so they were responsible and they were responsible, I mean they did a good\njob til the last minute, even though they were against -- they were against, it has to\nbe sec -- nobody knew about the o-other movement. My parents didn\u2019t know. They\nknew that we gonna -- we think about it, but they didn\u2019t know, the last minute when\nwe went out, we had the bunker, we went out, we had ammunition and all that. So --",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t tell them, to protect them, wha -- and to -- and to protect yo-your\nmovement.",
        "A: Oh, we couldn\u2019t tel -- we -- we couldn\u2019t tell them because they were against that.\nAnd you don\u2019t blame them. Don\u2019t forget you have to -- you know, there 1s -- there 1s\na different, you know, with the Nazis, if they f -- they found one person guilty, or a\ngroup of guilty, the whole community is responsible for that. You know what I\nmean? It\u2019s not, you know, nowadays that you go, you know, children, the brothers\nand parents are not responsible for them. You see what is going on, you know where\nthe -- where the -- where the -- those suicide bombers and -- and so far, they -- you\nknow, they farm the k -- young kids, they are trained, they\u2019re coming out, and they -\n- they blew themself up, they are desperate, you know? Int -- what you call it in --\nthey are in -- they get them -- they teach them. Anyway, so that was -- that was a\nproblem. You know, we were very careful. We could do a lot of things. Don\u2019t\nforget, you know, the Gestapo came out 1n the ghetto, one or two by themselves. We\ncould have killed them easy.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You were taking --",
        "A: But we didn\u2019t do it.",
        "Q: -- enormous risks, yeah.",
        "A: We couldn\u2019t do that because that\u2019s the one thing, you know, they -- they kept a\nwhole ghetto, a whole community responsible for one act of sabotage, or one act of\nkilling or doing something against them.",
        "Q: Mm. And when you and Louis fled to the forest, that was just after --",
        "A: That\u2019s --",
        "Q: -- one day of lit -- what do they call it, liquidating the --",
        "A: One day, ye -- we tried the first day. We -- the first day, it started January 27,\n1943. But we couldn\u2019t do -- go through -- we -- I mean, we could have -- we had the\ngroup already, we had a bunker nearby, and could have went through there, but a\nmob of people followed us. You know, th -- people were sleeping on the street,\npeople were all over and they noticed u -- they noticed us, and a mob -- it\u2019s\nimpossible, we would have been -- we would have been betrayed, and we -- and --\nand discovered. So we decided, we retreated. And the second night -- we went\nthrough the second night, and even the second night, about -- I estimate from 25 and\nover, people who doesn\u2019t belong to our group went through with us. Elderly, even\nelderly couples, but -- and some survived.",
        "Q: When you were -- when you fled to the forest and were with the partisans, what\nwas the age of most of the men? Were you all very young, like you and Louis?",
        "A: Well, most of it -- of course, in our group, 18, there was the commandeer, took\nhis wife. Mostly I would say, when -- young, you know, y-ye -- mostly younger,\nyounger. And I would say some o -- some -- our young didn\u2019t have their chance\neven to serve in the army because you had to be 21 years old. Mostly young.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And mostly men.",
        "Q: Now there was a -- th-th -- the -- your leader took his wife.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And there was one other woman, who 1s she?",
        "A: The leader -- this is a brother-in-law. His brother-in-law. The -- he took his wife\nand a brother and a brother-in-law with his wife. See? So even though -- I mean, I\ncould have taken my older sister, too, but I mean, it shows you, they were -- they\u2019re\nroad ready, and they were in the bunker already and they went through with us.\nThey didn\u2019t belong even in our group.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But then after the war, you know, there was some -- there was some discussions\n[indecipherable]. They didn\u2019t like the idea, but listen, a time like that, everything\ngoes, see?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did -- did the women survive?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: The women had a bigger chance -- see, the women had a bigger chance to\nsurvive because most of the women worked in the kitchens cooking for -- you know,\nfor the whole brigade, and especially the top brass, they got special meals with\nspecial ca -- with special waitr -- with special what you call it, cook, yeah, most. So\nit turned out that they were saved, they were never s -- inside, never sent on any\nmissions. Their job was mostly taking care the kitchen, taking care of the cooking.",
        "Q: And these forests were so -- so big --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and so dense that you were able to have fires, and smoke would not be seen,\nand to --",
        "A: Well, at --",
        "Q: -- sing songs, and have --",
        "A: -- yeah, this -- it happened already -- this is in the later years, 1943, when we\nwere taken in, incorporated in their brigades, I didn\u2019t realize how strong, you know,\nhow strong your brigade. We had that time already, planes at night used to come\ndow -- fly over at night and drop down all kind of ammunition and especially those\nbombs and those what you need, you know, the -- the toob -- you didn\u2019t have to\nworry already about going and building those explosive bombs, they were already\nall ready and there was no problem. Before that, we used to have to go and look for\nshells, and make up, you know, make up those -- those traps and bombs for my -- for\nth-those mines, what you call it, to mine the road. So life that time, it was actually --\nlooks like we controlled through the night especially, you control the whole\nterritories. And the forest were c -- were connected with the other forest, and was\nstretching from eastern Poland, way up to deep in Russia and deep in -- deep in\nBelarus and Ukraine. So there was -- it was established after the war, there were a\nquarter of a million partisan operating in the woods. So 1-1t came to a point that time\nthat we had plenty of food, and of course the food consisted from three meals a day,\nmostly soup and meat. S-Soup and meat. We used to go on for those mission and get\nfood. Those, you know, cows and pigs taken away not from the farmers, but taken\naway from the German warehouses where they take away for the farmers. Came an\norder already not to rob the farmers any more. Go and take it away from the\nwarehouses where the Germans rob the farmers and try and to ship it away to\nGermany.",
        "Q: From the o -- from the enemy.",
        "A: For the enemy.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So was plenty of food.",
        "Q: Yeah. What were your living conditions like? You -- you were a -- a year and a\nhalf --",
        "A: Mm-hm. Well, the living conditions wa -- this 1s 0 -- the only problem we had,\nwas rough, because the what we called the bunkers where we slept was crowded,\nand it was bunks on each side. You know, you had a a-aisle going in, then bunks on\neach side, and it was -- we didn\u2019t have -- we did mostly straw, we didn\u2019t have\nmattresses with straw. The problem was fleas and lice. You couldn\u2019t help it, 1t was\nterrible. But you got so used to it, the only solution that we learned from experience,\nwe used to make a fire, and the smoke -- and even wintertime, take over -- take over\nyou underwear, you clothes, and just hold it over the top, and not on the fire, the\nsmoke, they\u2019ll drop out. But it helped a little. But those people who used to go on\nmissions outside of camps, they were better off. I used to go a lot of missions. The\nreason 1s, we used to reach at night the farmers, and there, sometimes near, getting\ncertain cl-clothes from the farmer, new. Drop out the old one and get a new one. So\nonce you [indecipherable] for awhile, then you liced up, you know, again with fleas,\nwith lice. This is impossible. It was impossible. But later on I think they built, it\nwas, they call it steam. They -- they build a steam room, so you could go in -- you\nknow, there\u2019s no water we had, but you know, you couldn\u2019t take a bath, you\ncouldn\u2019t take a shower, so they build a steam room, and it was enclosed. So used to\ngo in once in awhile in the steam room, and that helped you, you know, clean it up,\nand it helped, you had clean clothes, it helped you f --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- it helped you a lot. But this was there, 1t was a problem.",
        "Q: Could you swim in the summertime, you were -- it was one summer.",
        "A: Well, w -- first when you went on missions, you were able -- sometimes you go\nall night during the night, reach a little river on the way, a little -- those s -- where is\n[indecipherable] the chance, you know what I mean? Even -- even -- even near a -- a\nwater when you had tho -- where you get your water. So you were able to wash\nyourself up.",
        "Q: That was the least of your problems.",
        "A: No, this wasn\u2019t -- no this wasn\u2019t a big problem. As a matter of fact, I gained some\nweight there, even though walking nights, ma -- ma -- a hundred miles or more. The\nfood, because three meals a day and you eat a lot of meat and fat meat you know,\nthey didn\u2019t bother, you know, cut up chunks, and soup. Mostly the soup 1s potatoes.\nThis was most of the time, three times a day.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So it\u2019s plenty, you know what I mean?",
        "Q: Did you feel that you had widespread support from all the farmers in the\nsurrounding areas?",
        "A: We had some support from the farmers, and some -- and some not. You see,\nwhen -- when the war started, when the -- you know, Russian, the Russian-German\nwar, a big army, Russian army in the first days surrendered to the Germans. It was\nGeneral Vlasov -- you\u2019ve her -- you heard of, and there\u2019s another c-co -- another\ngeneral. See, I don\u2019t remember now. And what happened, the Germans used them.\nThey didn\u2019t send them on the front to fight, they used them in the rear, and they\nestablished posts all over around the woods, even all over the territories. And of\ncourse, Germans in charge, and they -- they used to do most of the dirty work. They\nused to -- but as a rule, the farmers got caught in between. I-I -- I feel sorry for, they\ncaught in between. You know, the ch -- the -- the partisan came in and they took\ncertain from them -- from -- a loaf bread, whatever. They were [indecipherable] in\nthe beginnings. And then the Germans retaliated because they supported the\npartisans. Both side. Poor farmers. I feel sorry for them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Let\u2019s go back to Bialystok and your linking up with Sam and by then he\nwas married, is that right?",
        "A: Wa --",
        "Q: You linked up with your brother Louis.",
        "A: Oh well, I want to say but -- yeah, in Bialystok, you know, like I mentioned\nbefore, there was already a lot of organizations established. Joint Distribution\nCommittee, HIAS, and -- and some -- it was [indecipherable] in Israel, some from\nthe Haganah. And they tried, you know, to -- the war was still going on. They figure\nthe war will end, they tried to organized most of those to go to Palestine. And I\nmentioned that I met -- I, you know, she -- the girl from there, she told me that she\nwas in -- in sht -- in -- in Auschwitz. Now another thing I want to mention, first days\nwhen we -- I was in Bialystok, oh, I met there -- you know there was some survivors\nlike from different, all kind different way, hiding in the woods, hiding in -- by\nfarmers, hiding in bunkers. And some came from the wa -- survivors from Warsaw\nghetto. Later on came from Warsaw ghetto, I don\u2019t think Warsaw was taken yet, but\nthey were s -- they came to Bialystok. I met there in Bialystok, you know is very\neas-eas -- in the museum, you know, he\u2019s a hero. Itzhak Perlman and I told him -- he\nsaid, Jossel, you are the man [indecipherable] Palestine. You know, he went to pales\n-- yeah. And see, and I says, well, I says, maybe, but this is my only family, what\u2019s\nleft in Syracuse, and I want to -- they send me papers, I like to go to United State\nfirst. And then, so I -- he didn\u2019t have kind -- he didn\u2019t have any relatives, he didn\u2019t\nhave any relatives. I remember just like that. But I have a big family here. He says,\nyou don\u2019t belong there, you belong to go to Palestine, he says. Itz -- Itzhak Perlman.\nHe a Perlman or Perlmud? Per --",
        "Q: I think Perlman, but I\u2019m not sure, We\u2019ll have to check.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, on -- on -- honestly, yeah.",
        "Q: And of course that was the -- there was a very powerful political push to have the\nJews go to Palestine.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so what happened when it was, but it -- the war was still going\non, it wasn\u2019t finished yet. So then they found out about me and from the -- what they\ncall that? Organization there in Israel. And they say, oh, you\u2019re one of the partisans,\nyou have your -- did you ke -- did you keep a diary? I said, di -- what a diary? Oh,\nyou gotta keep a -- oh, you go ahead and think and study certain things for Yad\nVashem. It was [indecipherable] Yad Vashem, but this was for YIVO. YIVO stands\nfor Jewish Research Organization, e -- I think YIVO. And then, you know, I try -- I\ntry to thinking and they interviewed me, and I told them a lot of things about the int\n-- what did you take part? Especially about you, what day do you remember did you\ntake part? Do you kill any Germans? What happened in this day and this day and\nthis day? So I told him whatever I, you know, I remember, and eventually I know it\nwas -- the write-up is in Israel, and you know, you heard [indecipherable] about\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: Yes",
        "A: Something, yeah, the same thing, my story. What I tell a little bit about here.",
        "Q: Then wha-wha -- when did you move from Bialystok --",
        "A: No, I\u2019m in Bialystok with my brother, and eventually we stayed in Bialystok --\nit\u2019s probably we arrived quite a few -- maybe five, six months we stayed in\nBialystok. And eventually there was a family, a whole family was -- survived and\nthe farmers saved them. And -- and one of -- there was a father and a mother and\nthree daughters and a bo -- and a son, four children. And eventually my brother ca --\nyou know, met one and he married one of the ra -- Rachel -- what was their last\nname? I forget it. My brother passed away, by the way in 19 -- 1998, and she -- the\nmy sister-in-law, she\u2019s alive, she\u2019s in Florida.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So, he get married and then it was already I, my brother and Rachel, and the\ndoctor, and the -- and the nun, and the girl what I met. I t -- I told her -- she wants to\ngo to Pruzana. I says, I\u2019m just coming back from there. You stay here. I says, I can\ntell you who survived, there\u2019s no one there. She was looking for family, see? And so\nwhat happened, this girl -- so we -- from Bialy -- we stayed in Bialystok for awhile,\nand then when -- you know, til Warsaw, the capital, was taken. And then Lodz was\ntaken, big city of Lodz. We came to Lodz with a nun, and with a sister, and I and my\nbrother and my sister-in-law and the girl. In Lodz we stayed for a little while, of\ncourse, til the war ended. In L\u00e9dz -- now I -- I want to mention, I forgot to mention,\nwhen I was liberated, being with my brother in Bialystok, we send a letter in 1944,\nthis was about in June. We send a letter to my -- I knew I have an uncle in Syracuse,\nbecause he used to send letters home, sometime you know, 1n the letter put in a 50\ndollar bill, 20 dollar bill. So I knew there was Uncle Elman of Syracuse, that\u2019s all.\nNo address, nothing. So I wrote a letter, after the liberation, it took til May before\nthe war ended, \u201945, to get the letter from Bialystok. And that\u2019s that, he got the letter,\nand we were moving already [indecipherable] Lodz. And then he writes that -- in\nLodz we got a [indecipherable] of letters, that you boys, you\u2019re moving. I cannot\nsend you papers til you settle down in one place. Settle down in one place and don\u2019t\nmove around from one place to another one, because I got to have the address, I got\nto have the city and so forth and so forth, to make out the papers. So we settled\ndown, we stayed already in Bialystok for a | -- for -- in Bialystok for a little while.\nAnd this same thing. We had -- it came in Bialystok, you know, there was so many\nhomes, Jewish homes, we got settled. The doctor, and -- and the nun\n[indecipherable] gave her apartment, we have an apartment and we get\n[indecipherable] that time was rationing, you know, we got food from the UNRRA\nor from -- we were already Displaced Persons, DP, no par -- you know what I mean",

        "A: -- survivors. No matter wh-what, you can -- you can re-return to -- you are from\nPoland, or you are from -- from France, from Greek, from Hungary, you name it. No\npassport. We registered on the Polish quota, so we had a little problem with the\nPolish quota. So now, from being in Bialystok, eventually we got in contact with\nsome organizations there, and they were pushing people to Palestine. Some wants to\ngo especially to Greece and Italy. I don\u2019t know why, because not to the American\nzone, but before the American zone they tried to -- Italy and Greece. Looks like fr --\nthe kw -- from there there was some connection to go to Palestine. So, eventually we\ngot connected with a group. I don\u2019t know, you know, through the organization, and\nthey ch -- and 50 refugees that time, we were living Lodz. From Lodz we went to\nAustria, Vienna with a tr -- with a train. One group, somebody had papers, you\nknow, follows [indecipherable] this 1s a group of Greeks, or whatever, Greek Jews\ngoing -- So went to -- we went to -- first was in -- in -- just mentioned -- Austria.\nAnd then from Austria we went to Bratislava.

So anyway, it\u2019s a misfortune. Then from\nBratislava we went to Graz, Austria, and there to the English zone first. We tried to\navoid the Russian zone. We didn\u2019t want to go into the Russian zone, so we went to\nthe England zone, because from Poland first 1s the Russian zone. Berlin had the\nRussian zone.

And we saw -- so, five\nchildren. So that time already, when my brother came, so they divided. One uncle\ntook one -- sa -- Elman took my older brother, and I worked -- see, I-I didn\u2019t even\nknow he was a very successful biz -- a rich man, businessman.

And -- so right away they put me to\nwork, you know, I went -- was -- oh, it was, first of all, yeah, I remember it was\noutside on the yard, you know, they call it a scrap yard outside a yard. And he had\nthose -- those years he had those old -- big alligator shears cutting na -- big steel. So\neventually we -- after awhile I [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t complain. Eventually I had\nan accident there. Two men, a helper, had to put in, you know, cutting the steel, the\nbeam, somehow [indecipherable] back and it broke my ankle. So I was that time in a\ncast for almost six months, six months. And of course my aunt was mad because she\nwas ashamed because the son always said, why did they have to put him right away\non the yard there? He could have put him inside [indecipherable]. So she --",
        "Q: Could you walk on your cast?",

But I got compensation, you know, worked for\ncompensation, so worked for -- so then, after this happened, so uncle took me to\nWatertown. And there he told me, I'll -- Pll -- you know, I was learning already\neven in -- even in Syracuse on the yard, with the shear trimmer inside, you know,\ntrimming metal.

Eventually I went, you know, when I\ngot -- my foot got better and all that, he took me to Watertown. It happened to be at\nthat time in 1950, I was introduced to my wife, Edith Rogan. She\u2019s -- comes from\nBrooklyn, a Brooklyn girl, and she had a cousin in Syracuse, a s -- a Holocaust -- he\nwent -- he went through Auschwitz.

And I got acquainted with him, and he says, you know, he\u2019s gonna\ngo see his cousin -- no, it\u2019s an uncle that\u2019s -- that\u2019s a cousin, her parent. Why don\u2019t I\ngo? And we went. I -- I was already couple times in New York because I had\nrelatives, you know, from my side. They were two sisters, my father\u2019s sisters or\nseveral -- you know, lived in New York. And -- but I didn\u2019t -- you know, I didn\u2019t see\nthem too often, I was mostly with, you know, the relatives in Syracuse. So\neventually, you know, we got acquainted, and she was visiting here, and I visit there.\nShe didn't -- sh-she didn\u2019t li -- you know, a -- a New Yorker girl, for her even\nSyracuse 1s lizador -- little town. So that time -- and I was working -- working in\nWatertown, I took her over to Watertown. It was already -- I knew her maybe quite a\nfew months, was a little bit serious, and I introduced you -- you know, to my uncle\n[indecipherable]. They liked her. He says, [indecipherable] in Watertown, he\u2019ll give\nher a job. She didn't want to [indecipherable] in Syracuse that, you know, made a big\nparty for her, thought maybe -- she so -- eventually [indecipherable] Watertown. In\nthe same time, while it goes on, I -- I met -- I wasn\u2019t married yet, I met in Syracuse -\n- he was -- his father, a peddler\u2019s son [indecipherable] he just came on the service in\nthe Jewish Community Center in Syracuse. I got acquainted with him, he says, you\nknow, you know the metal business -- you know, he was probably p-peddled with\nhis father before. I know at that time, you know, the rags, they used to peddle with\nrags that time. Mattresses and stuff like that. And it was a place in Syracuse, those\nyears when I came over, and there was a lot of little scr -- it was necessary to have a\nspecial permit to operate a little junkyard. We call it scrap yard, you call it junkyard.\nLot of -- you know, there was quite a few there, elderly had it, and they was -- they\nretire, they want to sell it, lease it. So he said, there is a place over here, the Lifsin.\nHe retired, he wants to, you know. He\u2019s got -- he\u2019s been here for so many years, 40 -\n50. Let\u2019s rent the place.

Everybody\u2019s got -- working for Cooper, what is he\nlooking for? What does he have? Meshuga, you know what? Meshuga, crazy. So I\ntold him. So he says, you know, Joe, you\u2019ll never be tru -- you\u2019Il never be satisfied\ntil you try it. If you try it, you know at least, and you fail, you\u2019ll come back to me.\nSee? And you --",

And some with wagons, and it was near there. So\nwe did, it was rough. It was rough. See, that time, my wife had a few dollars already.\nYou needed at least, at least a few dollar, at least. I think we started up with 5,000\ndollar, that year was a lot of money.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So we scraped out and we started, and --",
        "Q: She was willing to bet on you.",

        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, she\u2019s willing, yeah, she\u2019s willing. So what happened here,\nwell then it broke out in 1951 the Korean war broke out, gave us a break. You know,\nthe war, everything skyrocketed. And so, just get enough mattresses, get enough\nthis, get enough ca -- metal. Pillows, get the feather pillow. I don\u2019t know, they send\nthem, you know? They were coming in from -- they were coming in from New York\ncalled the [indecipherable] people, oh don\u2019t you -- save the pil -- we used to --\neverything used to go mixed rags. Pillowcases, you na -- sweaters, wool sweaters. It\nwas cold, probably and you needed to process that stuff. Oh, do -- save all the\nsweaters, save all the pure wool, save all the wiper, save all this. So it gave us a\nbreak, and then, you know, it -- it\u2019s a lo -- it\u2019s not finished yet. So after, in 19 -- we\nstayed 1950 - \u201951. In -- I think in 1952, late ni -- we pr -- he sold -- th-the owner\nwho owns that, we didn\u2019t have a lease. He says, boys, I\u2019m gonna give you the first\npreference to purchase the property, the building. And he had -- he had -- it was the\nbuilding in the back, a driveway, and he had houses on both sides, you know, the s --\nolder houses. But it was, I think a few tenants here, few tenants there. I didn\u2019t know\nanything about tenants, you know, income. Somebody bought it, and it\u2019s an income,\nand gave us 30 days to move. It was a [indecipherable] according to the law, 30\ndays. It\u2019s tough. It\u2019s tough, it\u2019s bad. Finally, well we -- we had to s -- ask the -- you\nknow, ask the owner, give us a chance, let us sell out, whatever, clean it out, it\u2019s not\nso easy. You know, we had already a machine, pressing machine, baling machine\nthere. So resolved -- got resolved in 19 -- 1952.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You wouldn\u2019t have had the capital to buy it?",
        "A: No -- well, they say, you know, I did sometimes. I spoke to Uncle Elman in that\ntime, but he figures, he said 52,000 dollars. We didn\u2019t know -- you know, because 1-\nincome from the houses, somebody bought it, I don\u2019t know, he ask you -- for us 52,\nwe couldn\u2019t afford it, we couldn\u2019t [indecipherable] we couldn\u2019t afford it, we lost\nthat. So we lost that. Finally I took that time, I and my brother we got another place\njoint together, with my brother. He was working with Uncle Sam. So he got another\nplace was for rent there. We -- we got another place, and we stayed there til 19 -- til\n1940 -- no, no, wait. F-F -- \u201952 -- in 53 to \u00b057 stayed with them. Eventually, well\nwhat happened is, it was too mu -- it didn\u2019t -- for two people, two families\nsomehow, you know what I mean, it was okay that time, we did a little business for\nthose years. But it\u2019s -- well, it came little friction. It says, I had a chance that time.\nSo we were dealing with somebody and it was -- he was Italian guy. He had a little\nplace too, but it had a good -- good equipment, and we were dealing with him while\nI was with my brother. And eventually I knew he wants to sell it. He said, Joe, find\nme a buyer. [indecipherable]. He was maybe -- this guy, he was little crippled, with\none leg, was operating by himself, he did a goo -- pretty good business for himself,\nbut he had a good machine, good equipment. The first presses, you know, automatic\npresses, what you don\u2019t have to -- it\u2019s in the ground, you just strap it in in the ground\nand press it [indecipherable] side. You know, we had the old fashioned pre -- you\nhad to ho -- he had a -- he had a good press. So eventually I figured well, I'll buy\nhim out. We do business [indecipherable]. He had -- he didn\u2019t have much room\nthere. So I bought him out and he was a nice guy. He even took the mortgage and he\nnever charged me even interest, he was so desperate to sell it. And I build up this\nplace, and stay there 1957 --",

I\u2019m still doing business there, and I\napplied here, rejected here, rejected. Finally the last place, it was where I am now, it\nwas a existing building, commercial building, with lot of land around. I had to go to\ncourt.

In 1990 operated, she was okay for\nthree years, and I think in 1996 she was operate, they discovered.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And eventually, eventually it spread to the brain, and I lost her then.",

I knew her well, nice girl. She wanted to marry me, so -- you\nknow, sometimes you know, those -- they stick together many times, you know. One\n-- one -- once in awhile [indecipherable] marriages, but very rare, I would say, very\nrare. Most of the -- most of the survivors, they married -- they married a -- those --\nthose [indecipherable] a lot of survivors in Germany over here, or -- 1t was\nexceptions, but it\u2019s not too [indecipherable] rare.",
        "Q: Yeah --",
        "A: I know most of them who came to Syracuse, there were some married ones\n[indecipherable] they ma-marry them either before the war, or after the war, you\nknow, they match up.",
        "Q: Yeah. And every survivor\u2019s experience is different. Your --",
        "A: Oh --",
        "Q: -- yours 1s -- was very different because you were a partisan fighter.",
        "A: -- well, well, ev-every -- yes, every survivor 1s -- 1s different. Now, they really\nwent through the hell, those who were in concentration camp. Now when I hear it,\nyou know, what they suffered, what they went through, it\u2019s ha -- it is -- it\u2019s a\nshocking. Then you figure, you know, my family went through like that. To see\nyoung sisters and all the cousins. So I could have been among them, just miss -- you\nmiss a day or two, you wind up -- because fa -- the ghetto, you know, after the\nevacuation, even you -- you were hiding in the ghetto, the dogs [indecipherable]\nmost of them, oh, unless those who -- those who were hiding outside. Was a lot of\nthem [indecipherable] outside, were able to get out.",
        "Q: Yeah, or -- or I think again of the doctor, who is --",
        "A: Well, this is --",
        "Q: -- the narrow escape at the transport station.",
        "A: -- this is -- lost her husband, this is her historical something, you know, can write\na book about it. She was not a youngster, don\u2019t forget. She must have been, you\nknow, in Poland those years, people -- those years, 50 years ago, they didn\u2019t live the\n-- those years, like you live here in United States. 60 - 65 was already, you know,\nyou\u2019re whole person. I don\u2019t know if she could do it, she was 60 probably.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Or 60 [indecipherable] how could she do it? And to walk 10 miles to the -- from\nthe train to the -- to the convent. Made it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But God willing, God want it to be like that.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you feel that the way you raised your children in any way was affected\nby your own experience? Did you want them to understand your story and\nbackground, did you want to bring them up in a s -- ari -- ariru -- with a religious\nback -- observe --",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: -- observances, and so on?",
        "A: -- no. Well, a -- well yo -- my children, actually I wasn\u2019t talking too much. I\ndon\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t think -- my wife, she knew, maybe I told. But I wasn\u2019t talking\ntoo much about back experiences. When they grew -- when they grew up a little I\nmentioned it, you know, I mentioned it, in later years. I didn\u2019t want to talk too much\nabout it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want to real fra -- relive this again, every time you talk, it\u2019s not so easy.\nYou try to forget.",
        "Q: Do you feel that your -- that you were changed because of those experiences?\nBecause you were a survivor? Did it -- did it affect your life in a very deep way\u201d?",
        "A: Well, of course I changed. Of course I changed, that\u2019s why I saw, you know, I\nsaw myself what happened, what happened to a community. You think about --\nabout my uncle. I had an uncle, had a su -- had -- had a f -- had a -- a -- a flour mill\nand a sawmill. Those years -- I don\u2019t know where he got this money, I heard he -- he\nwon a lottery, something like that. But this is supplying -- supplying the -- the whole\ncity and vicinity and all the farmers, you know, farmers surrounding, we talk about\nthousands and thousands of farmers and what -- see what happened? See -- see what\nhappened? I\u2019m -- I -- a lot of people here in United States, you know, even among\nthe Jewish people, and you tell them, says I -- you have to learn a lesson. I mean, it\u2019s\ntoo bad you gotta a -- a price with your -- and a lesson what you went through with\nyour whole family and all that, you know, that be good. Because money doesn\u2019t buy\nnothing. Even you\u2019re rich, I saw rich people. Now, when you tell them, rich people\nwent. Rich or poor, sick or healthy, no matter what. Everybody went the same, the\nsame way, lost everything. So now, you know, I have the experience. Now over here\nsome people, some people some time, they -- to them, when it comes to certain\nthings, donations or something, helping. It\u2019s nothing. [indecipherable]. I mean, you\nlive in a free country, you didn\u2019t went through that. You have, I mean -- you know\nwhat I mean?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It\u2019s different. So, when you pay the price, it\u2019s different, it\u2019s different.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Now did you, with your family, did you observe religious holidays and\ngo to the synagogue regularly?",
        "A: You mean, before?",

        "A: -- I belong to a temple. I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not religious at all. I belong to a\ntemple because you have to belong to a temple. I mean, in this city, in Syracuse if\nyou don\u2019t belong to a temple, you had -- send children to school you gotta belong to\nthe temple, you gots -- you know what I mean? Day school, Hebrew school, you\nhave -- it\u2019s different than the big city. So you have to belong to the temple. And I\nwas -- I was not religious at all, even home. We were not too religious. My father\nwas educated, was a yeshiva bocher, went to yeshiva, but -- but here you have to --\nyou have to belong with the temple. You know, I belong -- I donate a lot of money\nto the Jewish Federation.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And th-the same federation, I\u2019m active. And to me money is nothing. I can\u2019t see.",

        "A: Yeah, money --",
        "Q: -- a deeper lesson.",

        "A: -- that\u2019s what you cannot buy.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But money, if you have, for crying out loud.",
        "Q: Did you have any adverse health effects from the rough times living as a\npartisan?",
        "A: Well I -- well, I -- I had -- I had trouble with my stomach since I came out. And\nwhen I got married, it\u2019s 1950, I went to -- in New York to Mount Sinai hospital. And\nI always complained I had cr-cr -- you know, si -- no headache, but stomach pain,\nstomachs, I thought maybe I -- maybe I have -- I checked in Syracuse when I came\nover 47, all those years and they didn\u2019t find anything. And when I got married, she\ninsisted go and check. I went to Mount Sinai hospital, went through all the x-ray, all\nthe -- all the tests, and they says, we don\u2019t find anything wrong, physically, just --\nwhat he says, they call it something like -- not physically --",
        "Q: Psychosomatic?",
        "A: Psychosomatic. That\u2019s what it is.",
        "Q: Yeah. What about your brother Louis? Was his health good when he came to this\ncountry?",
        "A: Yeah, he was all good, but the -- the same thing, he had a si -- see? He never\ncomplained that -- he had a cerebral helmbridge -- cerebral [indecipherable], and\nsuffered for a year. All over she was -- he was -- she was with him in Florida, she\nwas with him Rochester, all the hospitals. He wasn\u2019t si -- he had the same thing.\nStomach trouble. He had ulcers, and bec -- eventually -- eventually they cut out -- he\nhad half of his colon cut out.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It\u2019s probably that\u2019s all from -- yeah. He -- [indecipherable] affe-affected him,\nyeah. And has to watch his diet. Finally decided, colon operation.",
        "Q: Yeah. You know, when he was -- when he was a very young man, you mentioned\nthat he was thinking he wanted to come to the United States, really when I think he\nwas in his late teens.",
        "A: No, he was, let\u2019s see. In the 19 -- in the 1939, he was 20.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: 1939 he was 20. Before the war [indecipherable] decided, because -- that he\nwants to go to United States. He says --",
        "Q: Why -- why do you think that was?",
        "A: Well, he didn\u2019t want to go to Palestine bec -- I don\u2019t know. He was the type --\nthere was no future there, actually, you know, a young boy of 20, and he went to the\nHebrew school, that gymnasium, and th -- we knew already in 1939, we heard, you\nknow, what was going on with the Nazis, they were -- march of the -- of the Nazis. I\nthink it was, you know, what\u2019s happened to Austria, what happened to\nCzechoslovakia, in 1938 we heard that. And that time, it would have gone if not bro\n-- maybe if the war broke out not in 1939, the Polish -- the second war, maybe \u00b040.\nBut he applied, the uncle would have brung him in, yeah, he brought in everybody.\nSee, my parents could have come here, too. But what happened, he didn\u2019t want to\ncome alone. He was married that time, and had a child. He says, I\u2019m not gonna leave\nmy wife and my child. If you can bring us all over, yes, but not -- but you had to --\nall the kids who were brought over, they were singles, all the sisters, 18 years old, 16\nyears old, so forth. Because first you come and then you settle down somehow, you\nbring your family. That was the si -- that was the papers, sa -- made out like this.\nYou couldn\u2019t bring the whole family out.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And it wasn\u2019t easy to come. I understand there was --",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: -- an enormous amount of paperwork to be done.",
        "A: -- now, let\u2019s -- coming to United States, even for us, from 19 -- we came in -- inf\n-- 1-in Germany, in Feldafing, Neu Freiman in 1945 in June, and we came. Two\nyears later, you see, we registered on the Polish quota. And the Polish quota was\noverfilled, because a lot of -- most survivors mostly -- you know Poland had the\npopula -- three million people before the war. And most of us survived. Most of\nmajorities from Poland, comparison any other country, and of -- from my city alone\nof 200 people, well don\u2019t forget, from a population of 15,000. So the Polish quota\nwas -- it was impossible. Was -- we could have -- wish we\u2019d known, we could have\nregistered [indecipherable] Germans you could have registered you\u2019re from, or\nLithuanians, little countries the quota was better. But we -- when you got registered,\nyou got -- put in your picture, you couldn\u2019t change it. So we have to wait there for\ntwo years. Okay, I mean, we were in the DP camp, we have -- we have no\ncomplaints about food, shelter and medication. It was under UNRRA in the\nAmerican zone, the American government. And the same thing -- those camps are,\nyou know, I want to mention, there was a lot of camps, UNRRA camps, they were\nespecially for Jews. There were camps for Yugoslavs. There was lot of camps for\nPoles. Separate they were, you know what I mean? They had their own sections\nthere. And they had their own, you know -- you know, their own UNRRA, the same\nthing, and -- and the -- those -- it was sometime those who didn\u2019t have relatives --\nyou know the churches, if you had a church sponsor, was quicker to come in, you\nknow what I mean, than to a relatives, because the churches, they didn\u2019t have the big\nquota. A few here, you know, the church sponsor, they took them right in. But the\nchurch are responsible for them. When they come in they gotta give them. So we\nhad a tough time for two years. All the correspondent with the cousins, you know, I\nhave so much I like to say, so much correspondent. You know, it figures, they\nthought, they got money, and they send affidavit, if you got, you know, affidavit,\n150,000 dollars, Pll give you example. Or a quarter of a million dollars. All lot of\nmoney, you got a chance to come in quicker than somebody said affidavit, I got the\njob making 5,000 dollars, and I got a home. But it didn\u2019t work this way. Doesn\u2019t\nwork this way. So we got stuck with it, that\u2019s why it took so long.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",

And -- but I was told, and my brother, the family -- those\nyears in Feldafing and in the other camps, a lot of them you cou -- you were free to\ngo out and you come in in the camp. You got -- you got -- you were getting\nrationing so much. You were getting cigarettes, you were getting beer. I don\u2019t know,\nI didn\u2019t smoke a pack a -- a pack a day, a pack a week, I don\u2019t remember. Cigarettes\nwas very S -- ec -- it was very precious. People used to go out and barter and trade\nwith the Germans. Now, if you get five pack of cigarette a week, or three -- for a\ncigarette, pack of cigarette, you could have gotten a camera. For a pack of cigarette\nyou can sometime a pair of pants or boots or something. So people -- but it -- they\nwere to -- you know, there was a lot of black market going on among those.

I remember him\nwhen I was a kid, because in our city in the 1930\u2019s, a lot of them, those younger\nones went to Palestine. Those, you know, they already dreamed about. There\u2019s no\nfuture, you know, in a [indecipherable] in Poland. Young, they figure they\u2019ll go\nthere. There\u2019s some girls went there, too. Boys and girls went there, and some went\nto Cuba, some went to United States. We heard -- we heard about that, so we know\nwho went -- who went. So she\u2019s -- I think she\u2019s still alive, she 1s in Florida. And I\nheard -- I used to see her si -- see the group from the Pruzana survivors. We used to\nget together every year for the memorial, January whatever, 27\", or 28\", they made\nit January the 30\". And from all over we used to come down to New York. People\neven from all over United States. Some of the people from different countries used\nto come out. So we used to meet each other and it still -- it fall apart couple years\nago. Most of them got old, and you know, mostly -- I\u2019m from the younger ones. And\nit\u2019s got neglected, and the second generation 1s falling apart. You know what I\nmean? There\u2019s no leaders from the second generation. And this used to meet once a\nyear, oh you know, this one from there. So, I heard that she is -- got park -- no, this -\n- not the Parkinson, the -- it\u2019s a little bit forgetful, what do you call that?",
        "Q: Oh, Alzheimer\u2019s.",

        "A: Oh yeah, she -- yeah, she wa -- she was married. She was married, her husband in\nCuba had that store, a business, I think a ladder business, if I can recall.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What was the mood like in Feldafing? Were people -- were people\noptimistic about their future?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s the same -- it\u2019s -- at Feldafing this is already the last stop. So like I\nmentioned before, after the liberation, everything was -- all Europe was in a mess.\nEverything was in a chaos. People were moving from one place in another. People\nwere looking for some relatives, whoever survived, and eventually where they wa --\nyou know what I mean? They were going to here, they\u2019re going to there, maybe --\noh I heard this one had got somebody, a brother survived. But eventually, later on\nwhen you settled in Feldafing, that was already the last -- you know what I mean,\nfinally the last journey. From there you go someplace. That means if you know or --\ndon\u2019t go to United State, you go -- you go -- well, some people stayed there, I don\u2019t\nknow, in the camps, still 19 probably 50 some -- a lot of them went to Israel. And of\ncourse there\u2019s some, not too many, some went back, those survivors\n[indecipherable] just went back to their own countries. Not too many like from\nPoland or France, or -- or Lithuania, Latvia. A few wanted to go back and settle\nthere. Well, now you know that the ca -- now those countries are different, you\nknow, now those countries are trying to absorb as many as they can, the Jewish\npeople.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Have you had any interest in going back in --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- recent years to Pruzana?",
        "A: No, no. I -- the reason is I saw Pruzana after the liberation. I came into Pruzana, I\nsaw what -- what\u2019s the remnants, what it\u2019s left, the few. So what I\u2019m going to do\nthere? It\u2019s no -- you know, it\u2019s different 1f somebody oh, survived they never went\nback. Some of them going back now. Now it\u2019s easy because my town is now\nincorporated in Belarus. And Belarus became a country, independent country. Now\nsome -- this is all part of Poland. Part of Poland was now -- is Ukraine, became a\ncountry, Ukraine, right? Lithuania is a country now. So what happens now, now it\u2019s\neasier to go, but I don\u2019t want to go my age already, it\u2019s too -- no. Haven\u2019t got no\ninterest to go.",
        "Q: What about your children? Do they have much interest in your -- in the Elman\nside of their history?",
        "A: Well, my -- well yes, yes. My son -- especially my son. My son, if not for my\nson, he encouraged me, he says [indecipherable] that he said he\u2019s gonna disown me\nif I\u2019m not gonna come out and tell my story. You have to, he says. You have to tell it\nfor the -- you know for -- for generation to come, you have to tell for those people\nwho cannot tell themselves. So I\u2019m blessed to come out and tell the story.",

        "A: No.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But you\u2019re also -- you\u2019re also being very philanthropic as a community member.\nYou -- it seems to me your -- you\u2019re a -- a good citizen in supporting worthy causes.",
        "A: Well, like I say, well, I ca -- I can -- thank God I can afford, so I can, I\u2019m doing\nthat. Even if I couldn\u2019t afford, I would, so I\u2019m -- I\u2019m doing that. I belong -- you\nknow, I was giving to the Jewish -- United Jewish Appeal since 1958. In 1958 I was\nassigned -- I was in charge of that certain division. I didn\u2019t bring you that -- that I\nhave a -- I have a -- you know, a thank you from the United Jewish -- ni -- 1958. So\nit\u2019s already, I would say, 45 years I\u2019m giving. It\u2019s not, you know, giving to the\nfederation, and the temple. I\u2019m a good member of the temple.",
        "Q: Tell me about the Jewish Memorial Sanctuary in Dewitt.",
        "A: Well -- well, it happens in -- when we were a group yet, you know, coming and\nlater on, the later years -- I think this was in the 19 -- I would say 19 -- beginning\n1990. And we were -- and we had our organization there from the survivors, a group\nfrom the survivors. And used to meet once in awhile, you know, just social. Tell,\nyou know, what -- what\u2019s going on, how you\u2019re doing. And we were discussing\nabout, you know, there is so many different cities like they have memorials,\nsanctuaries you know, where they -- where they memorialize their families. And,\nyou know, they just build -- they moved, the last 15 years, I think this is. And -- and\nof course it was a drive for the ca -- you know, for the building front, I gave them\nmoney. So we thought it would be nice, why not -- why not in Syracuse? We\ndeserve. So they figured well, you got -- cost a lot of money to build it on the\noutside, you know, something. But strange, somehow it\u2019s no -- not too much help\nfrom the outside, they wanted -- they wanted we should pay for the whole expense,\nyou know? And there was not too many people can afford that. You know, we had a\ngroup I would say maybe around 20 couples, it\u2019s fr -- you know, what -- I would say\n40 survivors there, 20 -- some singles. And they were discussing, they would try to\nget some money, but there is no money coming out. You had to -- you had to da --\nyou know, you had to -- many times fight for that. So eventually they decided, okay,\ninside a building, inside the Jewish Community Center. And they decided -- there\nwas three. You\u2019re gonna [indecipherable] the sanctuary is going to be -- have thris --\nthree nominations. The Wall of Remembrance, Contemplation, and Library, three.\nSo I picked the Wall of Remembrance. Yeah. You want to know how much I gave,\nPll tell you how much I gave.",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Temples, you know, they have, but they don\u2019t have that from somehow, I don\u2019t\nknow. So we decided Jewish, the Jewish Community Center. Yeah, so I donated\nthem. I gave them 15,000.",
        "Q: Yeah. Good for you.",

        "Q: -- for a hundred years or more [indecipherable] they were --",
        "A: -- yeah, well, I would say we are actually losing, not getting more. We are losing,\nin general. Not only Jew, in general the city, Syracuse, it is a lot of -- there\u2019s a lot of\nindustry lost, and a lot of --",
        "Q: Oh, as --",
        "A: -- we\u2019re losing -- we\u2019re losing a lot of -- a lot of people, families, because don\u2019t\nforget, we had -- we had a big industry in Syracuse, we had -- we had the cr --\nChrysler -- Chrysler plant. We had -- we had -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s falling apart, you know?\nTake for instance Bristol-Meyers, we have it still. Okay, they moved up, moved a lot\nof them. Then we have Carrier corporation, big, it started in Syracuse, and it -- it\nemployed one time 10,000 that\u2019s left now what is about 15 -- 1500. So you see, a lot\nof those engineers, they -- they going out -- outside.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We lost a lot of industry. General Electric closed.",
        "Q: Oh, of course, loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States.",
        "A: General Electric, big plant in Syracuse. They clo -- I mean, they not gone, they\nclosed the plant. And mention -- could mention a lot more.",
        "Q: Did you ever, in those early years, did you ever feel that there was anti-\nSemitism?",
        "A: Well, actually, I wasn\u2019t -- you know, the people I dealt with, I had, you know,\nmostly Gentiles outside. I didn\u2019t feel, you know, sometime th -- the opposite. You\nknow, they liked me, and I was getting inv -- they like you sometimes, you know,\nyou ca -- you know, they -- you getting business. I ca -- I ran -- I ran it honest, the\none thing is, you gotta be honest and -- and loyal, especially honest business,\nbecause in this business, when you weigh -- you have a scale and you weigh certain\nmaterials, they trust you. If they trust you -- if they don\u2019t trust you, for instance, they\nnot going to come to you. But they find out, you know, you\u2019re honest, at least you\nknow, you -- your -- your word 1s what -- good, and you -- when you give a price on\nthe telephone, or you make a contract, you follow up that. That\u2019s very important I\nlearned, for the business. You gotta be honest and follow the rules, otherwise you\ndon\u2019t last very long.",
        "Q: Yeah. I\u2019m going to jump back now to something that you said earlier. And this is\nwhen you were telling me about the -- one of the reasons for you giving time to\nspeak about your experiences, wa-wanting the world to know of the resistance\nefforts. And you mentioned the -- the Bielski brothers. Tell me about them.",
        "A: The Bielski brothers? Well, they were located not far where -- from my brigade, I\nwould say in the forest connecting. We were in the Michalin forest, and Bielski was\nin Nowogrodek forest. That\u2019s a -- that\u2019s about 50 - 60 kilometer apart. And we heard\nabout the Bielskis. They were there before I was even there. I think the Bielskis,\nthey e -- they escaped there in -- in -- in 1941, right away when the war started,\nbecause they were located right a -- they were -- the father had a windmill\nsomeplace in a little village, was only family there, and they were raised, brought up\nin that village, and not far from this village, there were forests there. And he already,\nI think the -- 1-it was three brothers, but I heard about a first one, what\u2019s his name?\nWhat was -- he was a [indecipherable]. Bielski. Anyway, they were hiding already\nin the forest since the war started. And eventually, of course, after the liquid -- later\non, they saved a lot of Jews around from there, and took them 1n in the forest there.\nAnd a -- and eventually they grew -- they grew, I think they -- they had, I would say\nover a thousand, or 1200 or 15 something, something grew to, and th-they -- among\ntheir group there, they had a lot of those sp -- those professional craftsmen. They\nhave tailors and they have shoemakers. They have blacksmiths, you know, for the\nhorses, and they have -- you name it, they a -- they -- they used to make -- they had -\n- they had -- they established a factory there where they used to make leather from\nthe hides from the -- from the cows, so -- and those Russian -- the top, you know,\nleaders and some, in order to -- used to come in, and they wanted a pair of boots,\nthey wanted -- they wanted clo -- know, make a sheepskin, you know, clothing and\nall that. They -- they got in -- in return they ask for some food, and certain, you\nknow, products. Because they had a lot of -- a lot of families with children, women,\npregnant women, elderly and they had an obligation, you know, to support all those\ngroups, people. And that\u2019s eventually grew, you know, that\u2019s -- it grew to a st -- to\nlike a community, you know, a Jewish community there, on account, because, you\nknow, they were helpful, you know, we need it, we needed those craftsmen, we\nneeded those people. And they accepted, that\u2019s the only -- I remember, they\naccepted escapees who cou -- wouldn\u2019t be accepted in the -- in the fighting brigades,\nbecause elderly, of women and children. So they used to, you know, send it, when\nthey were found in the woods, go to -- deliver them to the Bielski [indecipherable] I\nremember that.",
        "Q: How -- yeah, now the -- they -- they were a Jewish family.",
        "A: Jewish, all Jewish [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And they were -- what age would the brothers be?",
        "A: Oh, they were young that time. One was already -- one was already a soldier in\nthe Polish army. I would say, you know, sometime 21. When you go in the army, 21\ntil 23. They could be in the middle 20\u2019s and 30 you know, from the upper 20\u2019s and\nthe 30\u2019s. You know, because -- because they were already -- he\u2019s a soldier, he was\nth -- you know, he served in the army.",
        "Q: And how was it that they escaped attack? How did they protect the people in their\ncommunity?",
        "A: There?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, they -- they protect communi -- besides, they had a lot of young -- younger --\nbeside the elderly and those, you know, families, they call -- this was a family\nbrigade. And a lot of stuff was brought in to them. You know, that was a -- you\nknow, feed and -- and -- and clothes, 1500 people, you gotta have a lot of -- it\u2019s not -\n- you gotta have a lot of -- a lot of territor -- I mean, lot of help.

Make a part, a machine --\nmachinist -- they had machinist there, and like -- like I sa -- mentioned, and all those\ncraftsmen, shoemaker, blacksmithing. No f -- there were some horses, you know, the\ncommanders were riding horses. A fleet of horses. There were dozens, hundreds of\nhorses around in the territory there.",
        "Q: Now th -- wh-when you think about weaponry, I\u2019m reminded that we haven\u2019t\ntalked about your -- your -- your job with th --",
        "A: Well, I was trained --",
        "Q: -- anti-gun --",
        "A: See [inaudible]",
        "Q: -- equipment.",
        "A: The reason -- is gotta be a reason why I was treated and I was honored in the\ngroup, because it was even -- it was anti-Semitism, even in the g -- in the brigades.\nMostly from the local -- you know what -- local. It means from the local Belarus,\nthat was Belarus, from the local Ukraines, local Poles. There was all kind of\nnationalities. But the -- the east -- the Russians, they would never -- they -- th-they --\nthey -- th-they didn\u2019t -- we never felt -- but sometimes they used to, you know what\nanti-Semitism it means. They tr -- do -- de -- they -- we were treated, you know,\notherwise, but sometime called names. You know, call name. I have a name, so\nokay, call me, you know, I\u2019m Joseph. Jusef in Polish, Jossel in Russia. No, it\u2019s\nMoshka. You know, give you a name Moshka. Jew Moshka. Like the Poles used to\nsometime, anti-Semitism, they used to call -- they used to call --",
        "Q: Is that Moses, Moshka?",
        "A: Yeah, Moses, something mo -- Moshka. So they said, oh Moshka. I got a name.\nWas -- do this. I\u2019m -- oh, yeah. What happened? Now, I was assigned to carry -- we\nhad in our brigade, we had in the beginning one anti-tank gun. And the purpose of\nthe tank at this -- it was a old fashioned one, but it was heavy, and you had to car --\nweighed 150 pounds. And we used to use this gun in order to go and shoot\nlocomotives, stop the train. We didn\u2019t ever stop -- shooting at ta -- we didn\u2019t ever get\ninvolved with Panzer tanks and that [indecipherable] that\u2019s unusual, you know, it\u2019s\nuseless. This was, you know, this was important, because at night you reached that --\nthis destination, you find a place where you lay in ambush. You figure the train, you\nknow, among bushes [indecipherable]. The train is gonna come down. The first\nthing when it comes,, it\u2019s [indecipherable] shoot the locomotive. Now I was\nassigned, I was strong, you know, young, strong. Number two, carrying the ma -- it\nwas a number one, a number two and three. The number one shoots. He doesn\u2019t\nhave to carry nothing, he just -- comes the time, he gotta shoot. The number two has\ngotta carry. And the number two has gotta change and carry. Because when we go\nout on those missions sometime, we -- we walk 50 kilometers during the night and\n[indecipherable]. It happened one time, we lay in ambush, that\u2019s not far, you know,\nin the partisans, we mined the road and two truckloads with soldier -- German\nsoldiers arrived. We mined the -- we mined the roads, we knew they have to go\nthrough this road, because farmers, they don\u2019t have a -- they don\u2019t have trucks at\nnight, usually. So you wait. Either they\u2019ll go through, they\u2019Il come or not, we\u2019ll\nretreat. But actually, they went through, and blew up one truck on the mine, on the --\nyou know, on the main road, blew it up. And scattered. And the next up, that other\ntruck stopped, we opened [indecipherable] you know, with plier. We stopped the\nother one. We killed a lot of them there. But reinforcement came in and they cut us\noff. We tried to retreat, you know, on our side, the road towards -- towards our\ndestination, and they cut us off, and we running. You know, we [indecipherable] a\nlot. See, in 15 minutes, we thought we gonna hide there and the s -- I would say\nawful lot, lot of Germans because fi -- a fi -- 15 - 20 - 25 wouldn\u2019t dare go in in the\nwoods there, maybe couple hundred. Now group was only had -- the most was\n[indecipherable] maybe was 25 or 28. I was carrying that gun, and we running, and\nthey chasing out in the woods. It was dangerous. And I has -- and I asked, you\nknow, the guys, I says, you know, I\u2019m gonna drop it, I cannot run any more, save it,\ntake the gun. Nobody wants to take the gun, nobody. And where was the Germans,\nright in back over, the German. The commander is there. I s -- told the commander, I\nsays, I says -- I asked -- I says, nobody wants to take the gun, I\u2019m gonna drop it, I\nsays save the gun, don\u2019t save me. He took the gun away from me.

        "A: He took it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And what happened eventually, they chased us. He got killed.",
        "Q: Oh.",

        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: I think him and a couple other guys. So see, that\u2019s why, after that, you know, they\nrespected me. So -- so -- I used to go -- eventually I told them -- very seldom used to\nuse the gun, going on this mission, not too often. Because most of the time you\ncarried a -- you carried a bomb made up to, you know, to just lay it on the -- or dig it\nin under the railroad or whatever.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t useful so much, that. And it -- you didn\u2019t have to carry that. So\neventually I ask him, I says, I want to go on missions. I-I want to go on missions\ninstead that, it\u2019s safer and it\u2019s better. Because on missions, when you go they send a\nsmall group. Five or seven with, you know, with -- with this dynamite, with a bomb,\ntell you what to do, either on the bridge or on the road. And that time you find a\nquiet time, you take off, it\u2019s qui -- then you go into the farmer\u2019s house, and you have\n-- you gonna have a picnic. You ca -- sometime you got a little booze. You know,\nthis is all the farmers which you know them. They have connection, you know what\nI -- we knew certain farmers worked with us. So we reached there, and we stayed a\ncouple nights, and it was -- we spend a little time. So it was -- it was -- a more\nconvenient.

And they told us that if we have ammunition, guns,\nor money, then they would take us in. Otherwise -- and they helped us that time.\nThey went with one of the group, and they helped us to get a little food. And they\ntold us to build a home, a bunker.

No, they never said.\nYeah, I don\u2019t know if they knew, because the allies, this was later on, you know\nwhat I mean, when the Russian reached there, to the Auschwitz and before, you had\n-- most of the camps were in the Polish -- in the pa -- in po -- in the Polish territory.\nSo even if they, you know, reached before, it was the first camp al -- what is that\nbelez -- belez -- belez --",

But never --\nnever heard about the camps, you know, about Auschwitz, and -- and Treblinka and\nthe other ones. So that\u2019s why I was just wondering. But the Americans were\nbombarding, see? The Russian were not bombarding those places, they were -- they\nwere tied up in the east there, you know, chasing the Germans. But Americans,\nwhen they started -- the second front started, they already bombarded the territory,\nGermany, right? They bombarded Germany.

Because, see, the Germans, they getting bitten, they were -- they were -- they\nwere knocking the hell out of them, the Russians where they marched. Terrible.

Sometime\nit\u2019s unbelievable, where sh -- ek -- a -- a whole -- a whole unit, a whole army in -- in\nthe back, in the -- you know, in the rear. But they didn\u2019t have enough, they -- they\nwere bleeding. They didn -- they couldn\u2019t do anything because they had to had a\nmillion army to -- you know, in order to -- they never, never went through the\nwoods, the main roads. They were afraid. You know, the -- many times there were\nso many roads, which, you know, trucks or tanks can penetrate through the woods.\nOnce in awhile, since I been in the woods, I remember they decided to cl -- go, a\nclean up operation to get after the partisans. And they came in. They pulled out from\nthe front -- this was in late 1943, three divisions with tanks, and they went through\nthe woods. And what happened with the tanks, we -- we are -- we are -- you know,\nwhen you with -- got tipped off in advance, so we retreated. We didn\u2019t get involved,\nyou know, with -- with the army, with an army di-division, 30\", you know, 90 or\n50,000. So we retreated from -- they found -- they did found. This 1s the only time\nwhere they found on a -- a -- you know, the bunkers when we were -- where we\nwere living. And this was all over t -- the territory. Even -- even the Bielskis, you\nknow, they pulled away, they went in the -- they went in the swamp sometime near -\n- near -- this 1s city near Pinsk, Pinsk [indecipherable]. They went there, retreated.\nSo what they do? They -- they did found -- and that\u2019s -- we came next day when\nthey retreated, next day, they -- they didn\u2019t have the time and they couldn\u2019t afford.\nThis is the only time they tried to clean us out.

        "Q: Up to your waist.",
        "A: Up to here.

So\nwe bit them, we sh -- you know, it was -- it was predictable, they couldn\u2019t win the\nwar with the partisans, actually.",

        "A: I know what you mean. Yeah, when they established the ghetto, this 1s their\nsystem, you know, all over, because if they establish a ghetto, they figure it -- they\ngonna herded in th-the community from the -- and bring some out from different\ntowns and [indecipherable] villages, if -- in the ghetto. Otherwise, the smaller\ncommunities, they killed them right out, you know, with -- they had their system the\nbeginning, with trucks and the mobile --",
        "Q: Mobile kill units and so on.",
        "A: Yeah, you know,",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t have yet -- they didn\u2019t have yet the -- the -- the -- those camps, you\nknow, the mass -- the mass -- mass killing. They didn\u2019t -- weren\u2019t ready yet for the\nmass killing. So when they tr -- they t -- they picked a section in a town. Of course\nthe section is mostly the poor section, dilapidated section and all were mostly --\nthose Jews they were -- lived in the section, 10 blocks, whatever. And they\nsurrounded the section with barbed wire, and they have one gate open from that\nghetto section that -- to come in and to go out. Workers, every time. So the system\nwith the ghetto, it was -- they established a Judenrat, because before they do the\nghetto, establish a ghetto, when they needed work, a certain -- any kind of work,\nthey used to grab -- oh, you had already wearing -- you were wearing it, that time,\nalready, that yellow --",
        "Q: Star.",
        "A: -- oh, star, they knew you are Jewish while you still wasn\u2019t in the ghetto. So you\nmixed with the population. But when the ghetto established, that\u2019s it, you were\n[indecipherable] used for -- herded there. And they used to come in, the SS, and the\n-- the mayor, Burgermeister, and all the other re -- you know, German in the ghetto,\nwhatever they needed at, they asked for. Labor, money, gold. You know, you\ncouldn\u2019t have anything. Cameras, we -- okay, well there 1s no televisions,\ntelephones, that -- it\u2019s not allowed. And they as-assigned, when you were in the\nghetto, they knew how many people are in the ghetto, because if sometimes -- the\nreason I know that, see, my father belonged to the Judenrat, he used to tell us what\u2019s\ngoing on. Somebody died, you have to report it, less your portion, then you get le --\nand you were getting portions for so many -- so many humans, so much every day.\nBread, then they give little sometime, not butter, margarine and sometimes little Jell-\nO. And little those -- make soup, for instance, I don\u2019t know, those are grain -- grain\nfrom the mill. And they supposed to supply this to the ghetto. Now, people were c-\ncoming out and c -- okay, you coming out, it means it\u2019s always was a leader for the\nlabor, or whatever, one man in charge, and you represented the group, whatever, a\nhundred, a thousand. And coming in in the ghetto, you wa -- have to go through the -\n- that gate, they call it in German, schlaband, the gate, and there was a sa -- you\nknow, a soldier [indecipherable] SS, and they watch you and check you and search\nyou every time you come in. Now, besides the barbed wire in the ghetto, they had\npatrols patrolling all the time. And they have posts -- post, let\u2019s see, every couple\nhundred to so -- or 300 feet, a post and there is look -- see in -- hi -- | -- can look, see\nwhat\u2019s going on in the ghetto. That was -- this was the system in the ghetto. So of\ncourse it was every time you ca -- you came in, you were searched. Impossible to\nsmuggle in. You couldn\u2019t -- even they found a piece of bread -- sometimes you\nknow, in you worked for the German, there was some -- they f -- they felt sorry for\nyou, they g -- they\u2019Il give you. You -- you know, they throw it out so much food for\nthe dogs there, for the cat. So they\u2019Il see us, they\u2019Il give you a piece of bread,\nwhatever. She\u2019ll cake -- take it home for your parents or for your sister. And -- but\nyou\u2019re coming in sometimes they find you, they beat you up, they take it away.

        "A: Yeah, Betar. And Beryl Segal was the leader of the pe -- of my -- I belonged to\nBetar, my brother -- Betar. He was the leader. Now, he was able to get out the ghetto\nbefore the ghetto was liquidated. Months before, and he went with a group of nine\npeople that\u2019s all belong to our group, and they went in the woods. And they got\ncontact with some peop -- you know, partisans, Russians and Polish in the woods.\nBut they were still working independently, you know, they were -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s before\nwe got incorporated there. Now, this group used, once in awhile, used to come in in\nthe ghetto, and find out and told us what is going on. You stay or you had to get --\ntry and get some more ammunition, try and get some. And a way -- and they used to\ncome in the -- later, before the liquidation, they used to come in in the Judenrat and\nthey knew already when it was. We knew it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a matter of time, because the\nfirst -- the first c -- what they tr -- when they gave the order to assemble, and it wa --\nand it was [indecipherable], I mentioned to my father this was in October, so this --\nthey [indecipherable] all of a sudden. I don\u2019t know, nobody knows the reason, it was\njust the same. And so they used to come in and tell us what was going on. But we\nnever -- we had a problem when we came to the woods, remember I said, the worst\ntime of all? We couldn\u2019t find them. We couldn\u2019t find them. And what happened,\nlater on when we found a c-couple, you know, a few of those Russians, partisans,\nthey helped us and they told us about them. Eventually, later on, we -- they steal --\nthey were already hooked up with a group Russians there, but we were still\nindependent. That\u2019s when we had some contact. We -- we knew what\u2019s going --\nwhat contact on the outside, and they were coming in and we were telling them, you\nknow, what\u2019s going on, that you know, we c -- we -- we got some medication, cert --\n109\nyou know, like pills, or -- or -- and --wh-which was needed, and bandages, and --\nand all, you know, for first aid, certain for first aid, in case they needed.

Even when you\nsmuggle in sometime, maybe they barter, it was a way. We only had 12,000.

A-After that, they still --\nshows you there 1s still lots of anger, and [indecipherable] anger -- bigotry, anger,\nanti-Semitism. And in this world, after the lessons, since we learned since the\nHolocaust. Look at what\u2019s going on even now in some countries, there 1s genocide\ngoing in in different countries in -- in Africa. They killing each other, for what? The\nsame thing -- see what\u2019s going on here in this with the -- with the terrorists attack in\nthis country. Those are -- they are betraying, I don\u2019t know, those are worse -- the\nsame thing as Nazis, worse maybe than Nazis, because even those people who\ncommit those crime, they betraying their own religion. Their own religion, because I\ndon\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t think there is a justification for all those killing and bombing in\nthis world.

        "Answer: Yeah. Oh, you ga - now? My name is Joseph Elman, and I was born in 19 -\n- February 5, 1922, in the city of Pruzana.",
        "A: This is -- I always used this name.",
        "A: When I was liberated, it was in June, I don\u2019t know exact the date, 1944. We f -- I\nremember that when the Russians arrived, they assigned most of the partisans to the\narmy, because the war was still going on. And I and another group and one of the\ncommandeers were assigned to liberate my town and the vicinity of Pruzana. So ra -\n- time when I -- when I came to Pruzana, the most assignments what we were given\nwas to first of all, to s -- look and find most all the collaborators who collaborated\nwith the Germans. This was one of our mission, and then we were sent surrounding\ntowns around Pruzana. I recall one place, it was near -- not far -- 50 kilometers from\nPruzana. We went in a little town, I think it was -- let me [indecipherable] the town.\nThink it was Bielsk, Bielsk. And I remember a farmer came over to me, and he was\ntelling me there is -- this farmer was eding -- hiding out one of the Jewish -- a Jew --\na Jewish boy. And the farmer told me, he says, I been trying to tell him that the war\nis Over, come out from there. He was in the barn, in a hay barn they\u2019re hiding. And\nhe -- he\u2019s heard -- he didn\u2019t believe him because it was still going on, a lot of\nbombardments, the Russians, you know, the airplanes, they bombard at the\nretreating German army. So I remember I went out to him and I says, come out, I\u2019m\na Jew, and I spoke to him Yiddish. Finally he came out. Of course, he was all\nunshaved, dirty and oof -- this 1s -- this is occasion that I can never forget. Then,\nwhile being -- eventually, when I settled in Pruzana, I came to my house and the\nhouse, a lot of houses were destroyed during the war. My house was still existing\nthere. And I came to my house and there was a family with a lot of children, awful\nlot of children. And she nice to be to me, nice to me -- she tried to be an -- a Gentile\nca -- a Gentile [indecipherable] they tried to nice to me. And she tried to, you know,\ngive me food and I saw they haven\u2019t got much for themselves, they were -- I just\nasked her a place to stay and sleep because I was still working, I was still in my\nuniform, was still given a job to look for all those collaborators. And eventually the -\n- another historish -- historic movement -- mo-moment, I would say, after a -- a few\nweeks or a couple mo -- maybe -- maybe six weeks, showed up in sh -- in Pruzana a\ndoctor, her name is Olla Goldfine, and she was a neighbor of mine. And before the\nwar, you know, I was in y -- you know, listening to these -- to these history what is\ngoing on with the Germans, with the Nazis in Germany, and so what I\u2019m\n[indecipherable] I was only 15 years old that time, I was surprised and she told me --\nand she came with a nun, and she told me that she escaped on the second -- this was\nJanuary the -- I -- I think it was the second transport, January the 28\", 1943, at night\nfrom the -- from the cattle car, and she -- sh -- wandered around all night til she\nreached -- in Pruzana we had nuns -- what is the name? A c -- ac -- you know, it\nwas a house of nuns.",
        "A: Convent, right. A convent. And she came there, she was very, very known in the\ncity and respected. And sh -- one of -- one of the nuns asked them there, the Mother\nSuperior if she can, you know, that -- to accept her there. But she was afraid and she\nwasn\u2019t, I would say, 1t was a problem for her. So eventually what happened, the nun\ngave her clothes, and put on a big cross on her, and she took off to a town in central\nPoland, and there she spend most of -- most of the time til, in 1944 when the\nRussian moved up to near -- near where she was staying, liberated her, and she came\nback to Pruzana with a nun. Of course, I tried, you know, I was able to do a lot of\nthings that time when I was as-assigned to -- in Pruzana. I helped them very much,\nand eventually, when I left Pruzana, the nun and the doctor followed me and I\nbrought them out to Poland. The war was still going on and we settled wa -- in\nBialystok because Bialystok was already liberated, and Bialystok was assigned the\ntemporary capital of Poland. Coming in Bialystok there were already lot of\norganizations, like different organization from different -- from different\nnationalities, from churches, some from -- and they helped, you know, that time to\nfind housing and to settle down temporarily. So, it happened to be my brother, we\ncall him Shmeril, my brother Louis was already in Bialystok. Now, he was liberated\nalmost the same time that I did, but he was able to get into Bialystok in Poland and I\nwas stuck in Pruzana.",
        "A: I?",
        "A: My brother? No, he didn\u2019t want to go back there because he was -- he -- he wa --\na -- he was -- he was lucky that he got out from -- from that -- was -- yeah, this was -\n- our part was the Soviet, you know, Russia, Soviet Union. And in 1944, you\ncouldn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t get out, you couldn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t emigrate, you couldn\u2019t\nget out from -- from the Soviet Union. And I had a big problem getting out, but\nthanks to the doctor and to the nun, they smuggled -- I remember they were -- they\nhad papers to go into Poland. And I got smuggled in somehow, you know, it was a-\nassigned a -- a horse, you know, a horse and wagon, you can put in all your\nbelongings there, and I was going up in the horse and wagon with straw and we\ncrossed the border and that\u2019s the way I arrived, I arrived to Bialystok.",
        "A: Oh -- then I found out that I was -- they charged me as a deserter. You know, I\nleft -- actually I left -- I -- when I was working, assigned to pru -- my town, Pruzana,\nI was in uniform, Russian uniform, and I have a gun, and I have a -- you know, it\u2019s\njust like duty, like a soldier. So --",
        "A: Well the Russian -- well, we had -- we had -- this is a shirt and pants, khaki. And\nthe shirt was on the outside, and you had a -- you know, over here you had a belt\ncrossing your shirt. And -- and you had a cap, you know. And your -- you had shoes\n[indecipherable] Russian shoes. So I heard afterwards that they were looking for me.",
        "A: Well, in the -- actually being in the group, being in partisans in my group in the\nwoods, we already heard couple days ahead when -- before we were liberated, that\nthe Russians already are -- you know, are moving forwards and -- and chasing, you\nknow, and chasing the Germans. Already moving, chasing the Germans. But they\nkept us there for few more days and they told us to mine all the main roads and\nbridges, not to let the German army retreat so easy. And we did that, and I remember\nthat the German army was in disarray. Some of them tried to get around the main\nroads, and they went the side roads, where we caught them near the w -- near our\nterritory, our woods, we caught them that time by the hundreds, and eventually\nthousands. And we had to march and was order, we had to march and -- and deliver\nthem to -- 1t was a camps Ja -- in -- in -- in Rujani, about 50 kilometers from town,\nwhere we had to deliver them, you -- you know, we had the order that you have to\ndeliver them, you cannot kill them or take advantage of them. And that\u2019s what I\nremember before, and after a few days apparen -- after a few days we are, like I\nmentioned before -- of course my brigade consisted about 800 -- 800 fighters, most\nof them were assigned on the front, sent to f -- to fight on the front. And I was\nprivilege enough to be sent with two more Jewish partisans, and Russians, to\nestablish order in the occupied territories.",
        "A: Well, this 1s already -- this 1s -- already is a -- a farmer, you know, the farmer risk\nhis life. And only -- I don\u2019t know what happened to the rest of the family, but it was\njust one -- some -- it was Jan Vyat, maybe. He kept them -- for a year and a half, he\nkept them, and of course nowadays they call those people the Righteous Gentiles,\nand he is one of them. And the same thing I want to bring out about the doctor, Olla\nGoldfine. Now, the nurse -- the nun who saved her, I\u2019m sure that she is recorded in -\n- in Washington museum as a Righteous. Her name, I have it marked down.",
        "A: I have a name.",
        "A: DellaRosa, but that\u2019s not her real name, but then maybe she goes on DellaRosa,\nbut her name is [indecipherable]. I have it marked down, because I cannot remember\nthe name.",
        "A: Well, like I mentioned, when I arrived in Bialystok, and -- with a nun, and with\nthe doctor and I had a cow attached to them, I gave them a cow. And they came --\nwell, nothing else, you couldn\u2019t take a house with you. Well, that time, you figure a\ncow, you'll bring it on the other side to Poland, maybe you can ge -- you know, you\ncan get a few dollars, you can -- you can benefit little bit, have extra money,\nwhatever you need. Because you had to leave everything behind, you couldn\u2019t take\nmuch -- much -- oh, much -- the furniture [indecipherable] house, you know, like a\nmansion I left my house, my house was there, right, and -- and when I came in\nBialystok, I got united with my brother, older brother, and th -- it was -- people were\ncoming in, I remem -- in Bialystok, some survivors f-from different kind of\nexperiences. Some came, you know, some came in from hi-hidden by farmers, some\nwere hidden in the woods. And it was a mishmash, it was, you know -- you figure at\nthat time that you are liberated already, that time will be f-for the better. But actually\nthis wasn\u2019t the case. This wasn\u2019t the case. That time families from ruta -- uprooted\nand destroyed, and everybody was looking for survivors, maybe sometimes you had\na brother, sisters, parents. And a lot of organizations was established already\nBialystok. That time they knew what was still going on. Warsaw, the capital of\nPoland wasn\u2019t taken yet. But a lot of Jewish organizations, and a lot of Christian\norganizations were established in Warsaw -- in -- 1n Bialystok, and they gave a\ntemporary help, housing, food and so forth.",
        "A: I want him -- I want him -- I -- I want to mention my brother Louis. We escaped\ntogether and when we were in a group together, Hassidic Jewish group, and when\nwe were, you know, assigned in the later round, in the -- in the brigades, Russian\nbrigades, he was assigned in a different place, in a different brigade. And I didn\u2019t\nhear from him since, for a year and a half, since I was in the woods.",
        "A: But -- but once in awhile, through contact with partisans, I found out that he\u2019s\nthere and he\u2019s still alive. But no communication at all for yea -- for the -- since a\nyear and a half, over year and a half in the woods.",
        "A: Well, we actually -- it\u2019s a difficult, but I didn\u2019t think about it very much, because\nwe were busy, day and night busy, when we were assigned, you know f -- taken in in\nthe kiro brigade in the -- for the Marine corps unit. We were busy day and night with\nmissions. And so you didn\u2019t think so much about it, about him, but once in awhile\nyou t -- you -- you was thinking about your family.",
        "A: This happened in Bialystok later on. See, I had been in bial -- bi -- when -- we\nbeen in Bialystok for quite a few months. We arrived, I think, in late 1944, I don\u2019t\nknow exactly the month. And eventually, when the Russian army pushed ahead, and\nliberated Auschwitz, people were coming in -- people from there were coming --\ngoing east to this town, to the cities where they belong. And it happened one time in\nBialystok, I met a girl, sh-she was young, maybe she was only 16 years old or\nsomething, and she survived the Auschwitz, and she came to Bialystok. And then\nshe told me that the Bialystok -- that the Pruzana, the Jews were sent to Auschwitz.\nAnd she mentioned, I think I saw your older sister there, but she wasn\u2019t sure. So at\nleast I know that my older sister wind up in the labor camp to go [indecipherable]\nthe rest, my father and my mother and my sister, they went to the crematoriums,\novens.",
        "A: Well, it wa --",
        "A: Yeah, not wa -- I -- no, I want to retract that, retract that. My father, my mother\nand my two sisters, and my grandfather and my aunt and my uncle and two kids,\nthey went together the same -- the s -- the same time -- the s -- when it was, you\nknow, the evacuation, they call it. Took four ti -- four days, four nights, they\ncouldn\u2019t -- they couldn\u2019t transport all the 12,000 people from the ghetto in one night,\nso they -- they broke 1t down in four sections, first, second, third and fourth. See, my\nfather was -- it happened s -- I think was in Oct-October -- October 1992, we were at\nthat time still in the ghetto, I remember we were operating our group and it came an\norder the same that all the Jews for the ghetto h-had to get certain -- certain -- certain\nwarning to get ready ce-certain place, this was, I think be -- by the -- by the market\nin the center of the city, and be ready for transportation the same way as the last\ntime. That time, the Judenrat, all the Judenrat, the Judenrat, this is the -- the\nleadership of the ghetto decided to commit suicide. They thought, you know, it\u2019s\nalready the last minute. And what happened, I remember the doctor, she arranged\nthe [indecipherable] from the Judenrat, and it wasn\u2019t successful, and I think there\nwas only one died. You know, she gave them pills and they -- they s -- they -- they\nlit the stove in order to get the s -- you know, the -- ta -- sa-saphistic, you know, to\nget -- get the --",
        "A: Carbon monoxide.",
        "A: To mix carbon monoxide. This night one of the Judenrat and my father -- my\nfather commi -- didn\u2019t belong to the group. See, my father always said, I remember,\nDad is not going to go and see his family destroyed. And he planned that, and he\nplanned it with a way that he locked himself up, you could never get in, in one of the\nsections in our house, and he hanged himself. Eventually we found it. But we are\nfortunate we were able to get -- bury him. And, you know, with honor tn -- in the\nback of our house in -- in the -- in the yard in back of our house.",
        "A: Still -- yeah, yeah, and still -- religious burial and still we\u2019re able to -- we\u2019re able\nto have the -- they call it -- this happened eventu -- when we stayed in our -- this was\nwe still stayed in our house, that\u2019s why we were able to bury him in back of -- and\nstill, you know, have -- have a minyan and give him services every day, three times\na day. And what happened is later on -- this was, I think it\u2019s around December 2000\nor two. One of my uncles was -- he was, you know, was s -- they used to take you to\nwork outside the ghetto, and he was, I would say, dogs. They charge dogs to find out\nhow long it take, how long will it take one dog, two dogs, three dogs. And they\nripped them up pieces. And then we moved in, we had to give up our house because\nalready it\u2019s -- the house was up --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: So that time we moved in with -- with my aunt, and we were able yet for couple\nmonths afs -- in her house -- it\u2019s already two widows, my mother and her s -- her\nsister, two widows, that conduct the services in her house.",
        "A: Well, this was -- you know, it was rough. It was rough especially, you know,\nespecially for the older family, especially for my mother, and -- because he knew,\nmy father knew that we are involved in underground movement. He knew. But he\nwas a pessimist. Little pe-pes -- I\u2019m saying a pessimist is because I\u2019Il never forget --\nhe was a educated man, but he -- on a piece of paper he described all the countries.\nHe says, boys, you don\u2019t have a single country, a single like independent or neutral\ncountry, which was that time Switzerland and on the other side is Sweden. You\nknow, encircled here you are. You gotta go through all this, all this, Holland, and\nthen France in order to -- in order -- in order to reach Austria, in order to reach, you\nknow, this -- even if you'll get out, you\u2019ll be able to get out, he says it\u2019s a lost cause,\nboys. That\u2019s his opinion, see?",
        "A: Well, it -- it was -- the Judenrat, because they still believe this was already the\nlast minute -- beca -- the Judenrat was at the responsible job, while -- while you --\nthe ghetto isn\u2019t existing. You know, they had -- they -- they had a -- a responsible\njob, make sure, because the Germans and all the, you know, the branches, they dealt\nwith them. If they needed a hundred people here, and a hun -- a hundred people\nthere, it was -- they went to the Judenrat, in charge of the labor. Minister of Labor,\nMinister of [indecipherable], Minister of -- of -- of -- of -- of Health. You know, it\nwas -- so they were responsible and they were responsible, I mean they did a good\njob til the last minute, even though they were against -- they were against, it has to\nbe sec -- nobody knew about the o-other movement. My parents didn\u2019t know. They\nknew that we gonna -- we think about it, but they didn\u2019t know, the last minute when\nwe went out, we had the bunker, we went out, we had ammunition and all that. So --",
        "A: Oh, we couldn\u2019t tel -- we -- we couldn\u2019t tell them because they were against that.\nAnd you don\u2019t blame them. Don\u2019t forget you have to -- you know, there 1s -- there 1s\na different, you know, with the Nazis, if they f -- they found one person guilty, or a\ngroup of guilty, the whole community is responsible for that. You know what I\nmean? It\u2019s not, you know, nowadays that you go, you know, children, the brothers\nand parents are not responsible for them. You see what is going on, you know where\nthe -- where the -- where the -- those suicide bombers and -- and so far, they -- you\nknow, they farm the k -- young kids, they are trained, they\u2019re coming out, and they -\n- they blew themself up, they are desperate, you know? Int -- what you call it in --\nthey are in -- they get them -- they teach them. Anyway, so that was -- that was a\nproblem. You know, we were very careful. We could do a lot of things. Don\u2019t\nforget, you know, the Gestapo came out 1n the ghetto, one or two by themselves. We\ncould have killed them easy.",
        "A: But we didn\u2019t do it.",
        "A: We couldn\u2019t do that because that\u2019s the one thing, you know, they -- they kept a\nwhole ghetto, a whole community responsible for one act of sabotage, or one act of\nkilling or doing something against them.",
        "A: That\u2019s --",
        "A: One day, ye -- we tried the first day. We -- the first day, it started January 27,\n1943. But we couldn\u2019t do -- go through -- we -- I mean, we could have -- we had the\ngroup already, we had a bunker nearby, and could have went through there, but a\nmob of people followed us. You know, th -- people were sleeping on the street,\npeople were all over and they noticed u -- they noticed us, and a mob -- it\u2019s\nimpossible, we would have been -- we would have been betrayed, and we -- and --\nand discovered. So we decided, we retreated. And the second night -- we went\nthrough the second night, and even the second night, about -- I estimate from 25 and\nover, people who doesn\u2019t belong to our group went through with us. Elderly, even\nelderly couples, but -- and some survived.",
        "A: Well, most of it -- of course, in our group, 18, there was the commandeer, took\nhis wife. Mostly I would say, when -- young, you know, y-ye -- mostly younger,\nyounger. And I would say some o -- some -- our young didn\u2019t have their chance\neven to serve in the army because you had to be 21 years old. Mostly young.",
        "A: And mostly men.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The leader -- this is a brother-in-law. His brother-in-law. The -- he took his wife\nand a brother and a brother-in-law with his wife. See? So even though -- I mean, I\ncould have taken my older sister, too, but I mean, it shows you, they were -- they\u2019re\nroad ready, and they were in the bunker already and they went through with us.\nThey didn\u2019t belong even in our group.",
        "A: But then after the war, you know, there was some -- there was some discussions\n[indecipherable]. They didn\u2019t like the idea, but listen, a time like that, everything\ngoes, see?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The women had a bigger chance -- see, the women had a bigger chance to\nsurvive because most of the women worked in the kitchens cooking for -- you know,\nfor the whole brigade, and especially the top brass, they got special meals with\nspecial ca -- with special waitr -- with special what you call it, cook, yeah, most. So\nit turned out that they were saved, they were never s -- inside, never sent on any\nmissions. Their job was mostly taking care the kitchen, taking care of the cooking.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, at --",
        "A: -- yeah, this -- it happened already -- this is in the later years, 1943, when we\nwere taken in, incorporated in their brigades, I didn\u2019t realize how strong, you know,\nhow strong your brigade. We had that time already, planes at night used to come\ndow -- fly over at night and drop down all kind of ammunition and especially those\nbombs and those what you need, you know, the -- the toob -- you didn\u2019t have to\nworry already about going and building those explosive bombs, they were already\nall ready and there was no problem. Before that, we used to have to go and look for\nshells, and make up, you know, make up those -- those traps and bombs for my -- for\nth-those mines, what you call it, to mine the road. So life that time, it was actually --\nlooks like we controlled through the night especially, you control the whole\nterritories. And the forest were c -- were connected with the other forest, and was\nstretching from eastern Poland, way up to deep in Russia and deep in -- deep in\nBelarus and Ukraine. So there was -- it was established after the war, there were a\nquarter of a million partisan operating in the woods. So 1-1t came to a point that time\nthat we had plenty of food, and of course the food consisted from three meals a day,\nmostly soup and meat. S-Soup and meat. We used to go on for those mission and get\nfood. Those, you know, cows and pigs taken away not from the farmers, but taken\naway from the German warehouses where they take away for the farmers. Came an\norder already not to rob the farmers any more. Go and take it away from the\nwarehouses where the Germans rob the farmers and try and to ship it away to\nGermany.",
        "A: For the enemy.",
        "A: So was plenty of food.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Well, the living conditions wa -- this 1s 0 -- the only problem we had,\nwas rough, because the what we called the bunkers where we slept was crowded,\nand it was bunks on each side. You know, you had a a-aisle going in, then bunks on\neach side, and it was -- we didn\u2019t have -- we did mostly straw, we didn\u2019t have\nmattresses with straw. The problem was fleas and lice. You couldn\u2019t help it, 1t was\nterrible. But you got so used to it, the only solution that we learned from experience,\nwe used to make a fire, and the smoke -- and even wintertime, take over -- take over\nyou underwear, you clothes, and just hold it over the top, and not on the fire, the\nsmoke, they\u2019ll drop out. But it helped a little. But those people who used to go on\nmissions outside of camps, they were better off. I used to go a lot of missions. The\nreason 1s, we used to reach at night the farmers, and there, sometimes near, getting\ncertain cl-clothes from the farmer, new. Drop out the old one and get a new one. So\nonce you [indecipherable] for awhile, then you liced up, you know, again with fleas,\nwith lice. This is impossible. It was impossible. But later on I think they built, it\nwas, they call it steam. They -- they build a steam room, so you could go in -- you\nknow, there\u2019s no water we had, but you know, you couldn\u2019t take a bath, you\ncouldn\u2019t take a shower, so they build a steam room, and it was enclosed. So used to\ngo in once in awhile in the steam room, and that helped you, you know, clean it up,\nand it helped, you had clean clothes, it helped you f --",
        "A: -- it helped you a lot. But this was there, 1t was a problem.",
        "A: Well, w -- first when you went on missions, you were able -- sometimes you go\nall night during the night, reach a little river on the way, a little -- those s -- where is\n[indecipherable] the chance, you know what I mean? Even -- even -- even near a -- a\nwater when you had tho -- where you get your water. So you were able to wash\nyourself up.",
        "A: No, this wasn\u2019t -- no this wasn\u2019t a big problem. As a matter of fact, I gained some\nweight there, even though walking nights, ma -- ma -- a hundred miles or more. The\nfood, because three meals a day and you eat a lot of meat and fat meat you know,\nthey didn\u2019t bother, you know, cut up chunks, and soup. Mostly the soup 1s potatoes.\nThis was most of the time, three times a day.",
        "A: So it\u2019s plenty, you know what I mean?",
        "A: We had some support from the farmers, and some -- and some not. You see,\nwhen -- when the war started, when the -- you know, Russian, the Russian-German\nwar, a big army, Russian army in the first days surrendered to the Germans. It was\nGeneral Vlasov -- you\u2019ve her -- you heard of, and there\u2019s another c-co -- another\ngeneral. See, I don\u2019t remember now. And what happened, the Germans used them.\nThey didn\u2019t send them on the front to fight, they used them in the rear, and they\nestablished posts all over around the woods, even all over the territories. And of\ncourse, Germans in charge, and they -- they used to do most of the dirty work. They\nused to -- but as a rule, the farmers got caught in between. I-I -- I feel sorry for, they\ncaught in between. You know, the ch -- the -- the partisan came in and they took\ncertain from them -- from -- a loaf bread, whatever. They were [indecipherable] in\nthe beginnings. And then the Germans retaliated because they supported the\npartisans. Both side. Poor farmers. I feel sorry for them.",
        "A: Wa --",
        "A: Oh well, I want to say but -- yeah, in Bialystok, you know, like I mentioned\nbefore, there was already a lot of organizations established. Joint Distribution\nCommittee, HIAS, and -- and some -- it was [indecipherable] in Israel, some from\nthe Haganah. And they tried, you know, to -- the war was still going on. They figure\nthe war will end, they tried to organized most of those to go to Palestine. And I\nmentioned that I met -- I, you know, she -- the girl from there, she told me that she\nwas in -- in sht -- in -- in Auschwitz. Now another thing I want to mention, first days\nwhen we -- I was in Bialystok, oh, I met there -- you know there was some survivors\nlike from different, all kind different way, hiding in the woods, hiding in -- by\nfarmers, hiding in bunkers. And some came from the wa -- survivors from Warsaw\nghetto. Later on came from Warsaw ghetto, I don\u2019t think Warsaw was taken yet, but\nthey were s -- they came to Bialystok. I met there in Bialystok, you know is very\neas-eas -- in the museum, you know, he\u2019s a hero. Itzhak Perlman and I told him -- he\nsaid, Jossel, you are the man [indecipherable] Palestine. You know, he went to pales\n-- yeah. And see, and I says, well, I says, maybe, but this is my only family, what\u2019s\nleft in Syracuse, and I want to -- they send me papers, I like to go to United State\nfirst. And then, so I -- he didn\u2019t have kind -- he didn\u2019t have any relatives, he didn\u2019t\nhave any relatives. I remember just like that. But I have a big family here. He says,\nyou don\u2019t belong there, you belong to go to Palestine, he says. Itz -- Itzhak Perlman.\nHe a Perlman or Perlmud? Per --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, on -- on -- honestly, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so what happened when it was, but it -- the war was still going\non, it wasn\u2019t finished yet. So then they found out about me and from the -- what they\ncall that? Organization there in Israel. And they say, oh, you\u2019re one of the partisans,\nyou have your -- did you ke -- did you keep a diary? I said, di -- what a diary? Oh,\nyou gotta keep a -- oh, you go ahead and think and study certain things for Yad\nVashem. It was [indecipherable] Yad Vashem, but this was for YIVO. YIVO stands\nfor Jewish Research Organization, e -- I think YIVO. And then, you know, I try -- I\ntry to thinking and they interviewed me, and I told them a lot of things about the int\n-- what did you take part? Especially about you, what day do you remember did you\ntake part? Do you kill any Germans? What happened in this day and this day and\nthis day? So I told him whatever I, you know, I remember, and eventually I know it\nwas -- the write-up is in Israel, and you know, you heard [indecipherable] about\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Something, yeah, the same thing, my story. What I tell a little bit about here.",
        "A: No, I\u2019m in Bialystok with my brother, and eventually we stayed in Bialystok --\nit\u2019s probably we arrived quite a few -- maybe five, six months we stayed in\nBialystok. And eventually there was a family, a whole family was -- survived and\nthe farmers saved them. And -- and one of -- there was a father and a mother and\nthree daughters and a bo -- and a son, four children. And eventually my brother ca --\nyou know, met one and he married one of the ra -- Rachel -- what was their last\nname? I forget it. My brother passed away, by the way in 19 -- 1998, and she -- the\nmy sister-in-law, she\u2019s alive, she\u2019s in Florida.",
        "A: So, he get married and then it was already I, my brother and Rachel, and the\ndoctor, and the -- and the nun, and the girl what I met. I t -- I told her -- she wants to\ngo to Pruzana. I says, I\u2019m just coming back from there. You stay here. I says, I can\ntell you who survived, there\u2019s no one there. She was looking for family, see? And so\nwhat happened, this girl -- so we -- from Bialy -- we stayed in Bialystok for awhile,\nand then when -- you know, til Warsaw, the capital, was taken. And then Lodz was\ntaken, big city of Lodz. We came to Lodz with a nun, and with a sister, and I and my\nbrother and my sister-in-law and the girl. In Lodz we stayed for a little while, of\ncourse, til the war ended. In L\u00e9dz -- now I -- I want to mention, I forgot to mention,\nwhen I was liberated, being with my brother in Bialystok, we send a letter in 1944,\nthis was about in June. We send a letter to my -- I knew I have an uncle in Syracuse,\nbecause he used to send letters home, sometime you know, 1n the letter put in a 50\ndollar bill, 20 dollar bill. So I knew there was Uncle Elman of Syracuse, that\u2019s all.\nNo address, nothing. So I wrote a letter, after the liberation, it took til May before\nthe war ended, \u201945, to get the letter from Bialystok. And that\u2019s that, he got the letter,\nand we were moving already [indecipherable] Lodz. And then he writes that -- in\nLodz we got a [indecipherable] of letters, that you boys, you\u2019re moving. I cannot\nsend you papers til you settle down in one place. Settle down in one place and don\u2019t\nmove around from one place to another one, because I got to have the address, I got\nto have the city and so forth and so forth, to make out the papers. So we settled\ndown, we stayed already in Bialystok for a | -- for -- in Bialystok for a little while.\nAnd this same thing. We had -- it came in Bialystok, you know, there was so many\nhomes, Jewish homes, we got settled. The doctor, and -- and the nun\n[indecipherable] gave her apartment, we have an apartment and we get\n[indecipherable] that time was rationing, you know, we got food from the UNRRA\nor from -- we were already Displaced Persons, DP, no par -- you know what I mean",
        "A: -- survivors. No matter wh-what, you can -- you can re-return to -- you are from\nPoland, or you are from -- from France, from Greek, from Hungary, you name it. No\npassport. We registered on the Polish quota, so we had a little problem with the\nPolish quota. So now, from being in Bialystok, eventually we got in contact with\nsome organizations there, and they were pushing people to Palestine. Some wants to\ngo especially to Greece and Italy. I don\u2019t know why, because not to the American\nzone, but before the American zone they tried to -- Italy and Greece. Looks like fr --\nthe kw -- from there there was some connection to go to Palestine. So, eventually we\ngot connected with a group. I don\u2019t know, you know, through the organization, and\nthey ch -- and 50 refugees that time, we were living Lodz. From Lodz we went to\nAustria, Vienna with a tr -- with a train. One group, somebody had papers, you\nknow, follows [indecipherable] this 1s a group of Greeks, or whatever, Greek Jews\ngoing -- So went to -- we went to -- first was in -- in -- just mentioned -- Austria.\nAnd then from Austria we went to Bratislava.

And the first time -- I\nnever, never been in ins -- and a -- on a inside swimming pool. They had a inside\nswimming pool there. And we were slipping on the floor, of course, in the hostel\nthere.

I took them, you know, I -- I took them off and they took\nthe boots aw -- they stole my boots, and a briefcase. I had some, you know, stamps, I\nwas stamp collector all this times. So anyway, it\u2019s a misfortune. Then from\nBratislava we went to Graz, Austria, and there to the English zone first. We tried to\navoid the Russian zone. We didn\u2019t want to go into the Russian zone, so we went to\nthe England zone, because from Poland first 1s the Russian zone. Berlin had the\nRussian zone. So we went -- in Graz, eventually there was a camp there, near Graz,\nTrofaiach. And we settle -- 1t was run by th -- by the British and it was u -- UNRRA\nsup -- supported by the united --",

And some -- some\nwhat we left a group of 50 -- some other ones, and we settled in this camp. This\ncamp was in the al -- Alps, in the mountains. It was surrounded with barbed wire,\nbut of course we had -- of course, we had bunks already there. We had enough food,\nbut on the walls, and on the ceiling, names from the Russian who got killed there.

I think we started up with 5,000\ndollar, that year was a lot of money.",

        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, she\u2019s willing, yeah, she\u2019s willing. So what happened here,\nwell then it broke out in 1951 the Korean war broke out, gave us a break. You know,\nthe war, everything skyrocketed. And so, just get enough mattresses, get enough\nthis, get enough ca -- metal. Pillows, get the feather pillow. I don\u2019t know, they send\nthem, you know? They were coming in from -- they were coming in from New York\ncalled the [indecipherable] people, oh don\u2019t you -- save the pil -- we used to --\neverything used to go mixed rags. Pillowcases, you na -- sweaters, wool sweaters. It\nwas cold, probably and you needed to process that stuff. Oh, do -- save all the\nsweaters, save all the pure wool, save all the wiper, save all this. So it gave us a\nbreak, and then, you know, it -- it\u2019s a lo -- it\u2019s not finished yet. So after, in 19 -- we\nstayed 1950 - \u201951. In -- I think in 1952, late ni -- we pr -- he sold -- th-the owner\nwho owns that, we didn\u2019t have a lease.

I didn\u2019t know\nanything about tenants, you know, income. Somebody bought it, and it\u2019s an income,\nand gave us 30 days to move. It was a [indecipherable] according to the law, 30\ndays. It\u2019s tough. It\u2019s tough, it\u2019s bad. Finally, well we -- we had to s -- ask the -- you\nknow, ask the owner, give us a chance, let us sell out, whatever, clean it out, it\u2019s not\nso easy. You know, we had already a machine, pressing machine, baling machine\nthere. So resolved -- got resolved in 19 -- 1952.",
        "A: No -- well, they say, you know, I did sometimes. I spoke to Uncle Elman in that\ntime, but he figures, he said 52,000 dollars.

We -- we got another place, and we stayed there til 19 -- til\n1940 -- no, no, wait. F-F -- \u201952 -- in 53 to \u00b057 stayed with them. Eventually, well\nwhat happened is, it was too mu -- it didn\u2019t -- for two people, two families\nsomehow, you know what I mean, it was okay that time, we did a little business for\nthose years. But it\u2019s -- well, it came little friction. It says, I had a chance that time.\nSo we were dealing with somebody and it was -- he was Italian guy. He had a little\nplace too, but it had a good -- good equipment, and we were dealing with him while\nI was with my brother. And eventually I knew he wants to sell it. He said, Joe, find\nme a buyer. [indecipherable]. He was maybe -- this guy, he was little crippled, with\none leg, was operating by himself, he did a goo -- pretty good business for himself,\nbut he had a good machine, good equipment. The first presses, you know, automatic\npresses, what you don\u2019t have to -- it\u2019s in the ground, you just strap it in in the ground\nand press it [indecipherable] side. You know, we had the old fashioned pre -- you\nhad to ho -- he had a -- he had a good press. So eventually I figured well, I'll buy\nhim out. We do business [indecipherable]. He had -- he didn\u2019t have much room\nthere. So I bought him out and he was a nice guy. He even took the mortgage and he\nnever charged me even interest, he was so desperate to sell it.

In 1990 operated, she was okay for\nthree years, and I think in 1996 she was operate, they discovered.",
        "A: And eventually, eventually it spread to the brain, and I lost her then.",
        "A: Never smoked in her life.",
        "A: Never smoked. Her father smoked.",
        "A: The father smoked.",
        "A: Well, who knows the -- who knows the risk, yeah. We had a good life.",
        "A: Finally I remarried in -- in -- this 1s 2000, or one. You know, a neighbor, not far,\nshe lost her husband. We both belong -- her husband belonged to the Mason, the\nsame organization. I knew her well, nice girl. She wanted to marry me, so -- you\nknow, sometimes you know, those -- they stick together many times, you know. One\n-- one -- once in awhile [indecipherable] marriages, but very rare, I would say, very\nrare. Most of the -- most of the survivors, they married -- they married a -- those --\nthose [indecipherable] a lot of survivors in Germany over here, or -- 1t was\nexceptions, but it\u2019s not too [indecipherable] rare.",
        "A: I know most of them who came to Syracuse, there were some married ones\n[indecipherable] they ma-marry them either before the war, or after the war, you\nknow, they match up.",
        "A: Oh --",
        "A: -- well, well, ev-every -- yes, every survivor 1s -- 1s different. Now, they really\nwent through the hell, those who were in concentration camp. Now when I hear it,\nyou know, what they suffered, what they went through, it\u2019s ha -- it is -- it\u2019s a\nshocking. Then you figure, you know, my family went through like that. To see\nyoung sisters and all the cousins. So I could have been among them, just miss -- you\nmiss a day or two, you wind up -- because fa -- the ghetto, you know, after the\nevacuation, even you -- you were hiding in the ghetto, the dogs [indecipherable]\nmost of them, oh, unless those who -- those who were hiding outside. Was a lot of\nthem [indecipherable] outside, were able to get out.",
        "A: Well, this is --",
        "A: -- this is -- lost her husband, this is her historical something, you know, can write\na book about it. She was not a youngster, don\u2019t forget. She must have been, you\nknow, in Poland those years, people -- those years, 50 years ago, they didn\u2019t live the\n-- those years, like you live here in United States. 60 - 65 was already, you know,\nyou\u2019re whole person. I don\u2019t know if she could do it, she was 60 probably.",
        "A: Or 60 [indecipherable] how could she do it? And to walk 10 miles to the -- from\nthe train to the -- to the convent. Made it.",
        "A: But God willing, God want it to be like that.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: -- no. Well, a -- well yo -- my children, actually I wasn\u2019t talking too much. I\ndon\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t think -- my wife, she knew, maybe I told. But I wasn\u2019t talking\ntoo much about back experiences. When they grew -- when they grew up a little I\nmentioned it, you know, I mentioned it, in later years. I didn\u2019t want to talk too much\nabout it.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want to real fra -- relive this again, every time you talk, it\u2019s not so easy.\nYou try to forget.",
        "A: Well, of course I changed. Of course I changed, that\u2019s why I saw, you know, I\nsaw myself what happened, what happened to a community. You think about --\nabout my uncle. I had an uncle, had a su -- had -- had a f -- had a -- a -- a flour mill\nand a sawmill. Those years -- I don\u2019t know where he got this money, I heard he -- he\nwon a lottery, something like that. But this is supplying -- supplying the -- the whole\ncity and vicinity and all the farmers, you know, farmers surrounding, we talk about\nthousands and thousands of farmers and what -- see what happened? See -- see what\nhappened? I\u2019m -- I -- a lot of people here in United States, you know, even among\nthe Jewish people, and you tell them, says I -- you have to learn a lesson. I mean, it\u2019s\ntoo bad you gotta a -- a price with your -- and a lesson what you went through with\nyour whole family and all that, you know, that be good. Because money doesn\u2019t buy\nnothing. Even you\u2019re rich, I saw rich people. Now, when you tell them, rich people\nwent. Rich or poor, sick or healthy, no matter what. Everybody went the same, the\nsame way, lost everything. So now, you know, I have the experience. Now over here\nsome people, some people some time, they -- to them, when it comes to certain\nthings, donations or something, helping. It\u2019s nothing. [indecipherable]. I mean, you\nlive in a free country, you didn\u2019t went through that. You have, I mean -- you know\nwhat I mean?",
        "A: It\u2019s different. So, when you pay the price, it\u2019s different, it\u2019s different.",
        "A: You mean, before?",
        "A: Well, no -- no --",
        "A: -- I belong to a temple. I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not religious at all. I belong to a\ntemple because you have to belong to a temple.

Day school, Hebrew school, you\nhave -- it\u2019s different than the big city. So you have to belong to the temple. And I\nwas -- I was not religious at all, even home. We were not too religious. My father\nwas educated, was a yeshiva bocher, went to yeshiva, but -- but here you have to --\nyou have to belong with the temple. You know, I belong -- I donate a lot of money\nto the Jewish Federation.",
        "A: And th-the same federation, I\u2019m active. And to me money is nothing. I can\u2019t see.",

And\nI always complained I had cr-cr -- you know, si -- no headache, but stomach pain,\nstomachs, I thought maybe I -- maybe I have -- I checked in Syracuse when I came\nover 47, all those years and they didn\u2019t find anything. And when I got married, she\ninsisted go and check.

All over she was -- he was -- she was with him in Florida, she\nwas with him Rochester, all the hospitals. He wasn\u2019t si -- he had the same thing.\nStomach trouble.

        "A: No, he was, let\u2019s see. In the 19 -- in the 1939, he was 20.",
        "A: 1939 he was 20. Before the war [indecipherable] decided, because -- that he\nwants to go to United States. He says --",
        "A: Well, he didn\u2019t want to go to Palestine bec -- I don\u2019t know. He was the type --\nthere was no future there, actually, you know, a young boy of 20, and he went to the\nHebrew school, that gymnasium, and th -- we knew already in 1939, we heard, you\nknow, what was going on with the Nazis, they were -- march of the -- of the Nazis. I\nthink it was, you know, what\u2019s happened to Austria, what happened to\nCzechoslovakia, in 1938 we heard that. And that time, it would have gone if not bro\n-- maybe if the war broke out not in 1939, the Polish -- the second war, maybe \u00b040.\nBut he applied, the uncle would have brung him in, yeah, he brought in everybody.\nSee, my parents could have come here, too. But what happened, he didn\u2019t want to\ncome alone. He was married that time, and had a child. He says, I\u2019m not gonna leave\nmy wife and my child. If you can bring us all over, yes, but not -- but you had to --\nall the kids who were brought over, they were singles, all the sisters, 18 years old, 16\nyears old, so forth. Because first you come and then you settle down somehow, you\nbring your family. That was the si -- that was the papers, sa -- made out like this.\nYou couldn\u2019t bring the whole family out.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: -- now, let\u2019s -- coming to United States, even for us, from 19 -- we came in -- inf\n-- 1-in Germany, in Feldafing, Neu Freiman in 1945 in June, and we came. Two\nyears later, you see, we registered on the Polish quota. And the Polish quota was\noverfilled, because a lot of -- most survivors mostly -- you know Poland had the\npopula -- three million people before the war. And most of us survived. Most of\nmajorities from Poland, comparison any other country, and of -- from my city alone\nof 200 people, well don\u2019t forget, from a population of 15,000. So the Polish quota\nwas -- it was impossible. Was -- we could have -- wish we\u2019d known, we could have\nregistered [indecipherable] Germans you could have registered you\u2019re from, or\nLithuanians, little countries the quota was better. But we -- when you got registered,\nyou got -- put in your picture, you couldn\u2019t change it. So we have to wait there for\ntwo years. Okay, I mean, we were in the DP camp, we have -- we have no\ncomplaints about food, shelter and medication. It was under UNRRA in the\nAmerican zone, the American government. And the same thing -- those camps are,\nyou know, I want to mention, there was a lot of camps, UNRRA camps, they were\nespecially for Jews. There were camps for Yugoslavs. There was lot of camps for\nPoles. Separate they were, you know what I mean? They had their own sections\nthere. And they had their own, you know -- you know, their own UNRRA, the same\nthing, and -- and the -- those -- it was sometime those who didn\u2019t have relatives --\nyou know the churches, if you had a church sponsor, was quicker to come in, you\nknow what I mean, than to a relatives, because the churches, they didn\u2019t have the big\nquota. A few here, you know, the church sponsor, they took them right in. But the\nchurch are responsible for them. When they come in they gotta give them. So we\nhad a tough time for two years. All the correspondent with the cousins, you know, I\nhave so much I like to say, so much correspondent. You know, it figures, they\nthought, they got money, and they send affidavit, if you got, you know, affidavit,\n150,000 dollars, Pll give you example. Or a quarter of a million dollars. All lot of\nmoney, you got a chance to come in quicker than somebody said affidavit, I got the\njob making 5,000 dollars, and I got a home. But it didn\u2019t work this way. Doesn\u2019t\nwork this way. So we got stuck with it, that\u2019s why it took so long.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",

And -- but I was told, and my brother, the family -- those\nyears in Feldafing and in the other camps, a lot of them you cou -- you were free to\ngo out and you come in in the camp. You got -- you got -- you were getting\nrationing so much. You were getting cigarettes, you were getting beer. I don\u2019t know,\nI didn\u2019t smoke a pack a -- a pack a day, a pack a week, I don\u2019t remember. Cigarettes\nwas very S -- ec -- it was very precious. People used to go out and barter and trade\nwith the Germans. Now, if you get five pack of cigarette a week, or three -- for a\ncigarette, pack of cigarette, you could have gotten a camera. For a pack of cigarette\nyou can sometime a pair of pants or boots or something. So people -- but it -- they\nwere to -- you know, there was a lot of black market going on among those. And\nwhat happened, you had to take currency. Now, the Germans, there wasn\u2019t a\ncurrency if you want to trade in the American zone, some had -- some had dollars.\nEven among the -- even a-among the camp [indecipherable] in camp, you know. Oh,\nyou got a camera, how much you want? 50 dollars. Oh, you got that, you want --\nyou know, it\u2019s little -- but we were told that -- don\u2019t -- you have to -- maybe they\nheard don\u2019t get involved with any black market, or any, because this is gonna affect\nyour visa.",

Okay, we\ngot the invitation to go in, but I don\u2019t know how they figure those years -- they did\ncheck you, they figured now if they find -- if they find a dollar, or a few dollars, oh\nwhere do you get the dollar? Black market. Then you got already a stamp, you\nknow. They take you and sometime they arrest you. Oh, I got these dollars, I got this\ndollar my -- oh -- when you say if you got -- if you got a father or somebody\nsurvive, brother from Poland, you got to explain that, where did you get it.

        "A: So that\u2019s the -- tha -- that\u2019s --",
        "A: Well, she married in Cuba. She married somebody who made -- who went to\nCuba before the war. He\u2019s a elderly -- you know, she was young. I remember him\nwhen I was a kid, because in our city in the 1930\u2019s, a lot of them, those younger\nones went to Palestine. Those, you know, they already dreamed about. There\u2019s no\nfuture, you know, in a [indecipherable] in Poland. Young, they figure they\u2019ll go\nthere. There\u2019s some girls went there, too. Boys and girls went there, and some went\nto Cuba, some went to United States. We heard -- we heard about that, so we know\nwho went -- who went. So she\u2019s -- I think she\u2019s still alive, she 1s in Florida. And I\nheard -- I used to see her si -- see the group from the Pruzana survivors. We used to\nget together every year for the memorial, January whatever, 27\", or 28\", they made\nit January the 30\". And from all over we used to come down to New York. People\neven from all over United States. Some of the people from different countries used\nto come out. So we used to meet each other and it still -- it fall apart couple years\nago. Most of them got old, and you know, mostly -- I\u2019m from the younger ones. And\nit\u2019s got neglected, and the second generation 1s falling apart. You know what I\nmean? There\u2019s no leaders from the second generation. And this used to meet once a\nyear, oh you know, this one from there. So, I heard that she is -- got park -- no, this -\n- not the Parkinson, the -- it\u2019s a little bit forgetful, what do you call that?",
        "A: Alzheimer\u2019s --",

        "A: Well, that\u2019s the same -- it\u2019s -- at Feldafing this is already the last stop. So like I\nmentioned before, after the liberation, everything was -- all Europe was in a mess.\nEverything was in a chaos. People were moving from one place in another. People\nwere looking for some relatives, whoever survived, and eventually where they wa --\nyou know what I mean? They were going to here, they\u2019re going to there, maybe --\noh I heard this one had got somebody, a brother survived. But eventually, later on\nwhen you settled in Feldafing, that was already the last -- you know what I mean,\nfinally the last journey. From there you go someplace. That means if you know or --\ndon\u2019t go to United State, you go -- you go -- well, some people stayed there, I don\u2019t\nknow, in the camps, still 19 probably 50 some -- a lot of them went to Israel. And of\ncourse there\u2019s some, not too many, some went back, those survivors\n[indecipherable] just went back to their own countries. Not too many like from\nPoland or France, or -- or Lithuania, Latvia. A few wanted to go back and settle\nthere.

        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no. I -- the reason is I saw Pruzana after the liberation. I came into Pruzana, I\nsaw what -- what\u2019s the remnants, what it\u2019s left, the few. So what I\u2019m going to do\nthere? It\u2019s no -- you know, it\u2019s different 1f somebody oh, survived they never went\nback. Some of them going back now. Now it\u2019s easy because my town is now\nincorporated in Belarus. And Belarus became a country, independent country. Now\nsome -- this is all part of Poland. Part of Poland was now -- is Ukraine, became a\ncountry, Ukraine, right? Lithuania is a country now. So what happens now, now it\u2019s\neasier to go, but I don\u2019t want to go my age already, it\u2019s too -- no. Haven\u2019t got no\ninterest to go.",
        "A: Well, my -- well yes, yes. My son -- especially my son.

        "A: Well -- well, it happens in -- when we were a group yet, you know, coming and\nlater on, the later years -- I think this was in the 19 -- I would say 19 -- beginning\n1990. And we were -- and we had our organization there from the survivors, a group\nfrom the survivors. And used to meet once in awhile, you know, just social. Tell,\nyou know, what -- what\u2019s going on, how you\u2019re doing. And we were discussing\nabout, you know, there is so many different cities like they have memorials,\nsanctuaries you know, where they -- where they memorialize their families. And,\nyou know, they just build -- they moved, the last 15 years, I think this is. And -- and\nof course it was a drive for the ca -- you know, for the building front, I gave them\nmoney. So we thought it would be nice, why not -- why not in Syracuse? We\ndeserve. So they figured well, you got -- cost a lot of money to build it on the\noutside, you know, something.

And they\nsurrounded the section with barbed wire, and they have one gate open from that\nghetto section that -- to come in and to go out. Workers, every time. So the system\nwith the ghetto, it was -- they established a Judenrat, because before they do the\nghetto, establish a ghetto, when they needed work, a certain -- any kind of work,\nthey used to grab -- oh, you had already wearing -- you were wearing it, that time,\nalready, that yellow --",

And they as-assigned, when you were in the\nghetto, they knew how many people are in the ghetto, because if sometimes -- the\nreason I know that, see, my father belonged to the Judenrat, he used to tell us what\u2019s\ngoing on. Somebody died, you have to report it, less your portion, then you get le --\nand you were getting portions for so many -- so many humans, so much every day.\nBread, then they give little sometime, not butter, margarine and sometimes little Jell-\nO. And little those -- make soup, for instance, I don\u2019t know, those are grain -- grain\nfrom the mill. And they supposed to supply this to the ghetto. Now, people were c-\ncoming out and c -- okay, you coming out, it means it\u2019s always was a leader for the\nlabor, or whatever, one man in charge, and you represented the group, whatever, a\nhundred, a thousand. And coming in in the ghetto, you wa -- have to go through the -\n- that gate, they call it in German, schlaband, the gate, and there was a sa -- you\nknow, a soldier [indecipherable] SS, and they watch you and check you and search\nyou every time you come in. Now, besides the barbed wire in the ghetto, they had\npatrols patrolling all the time. And they have posts -- post, let\u2019s see, every couple\nhundred to so -- or 300 feet, a post and there is look -- see in -- hi -- | -- can look, see\nwhat\u2019s going on in the ghetto. That was -- this was the system in the ghetto. So of\ncourse it was every time you ca -- you came in, you were searched. Impossible to\nsmuggle in. You couldn\u2019t -- even they found a piece of bread -- sometimes you\nknow, in you worked for the German, there was some -- they f -- they felt sorry for\nyou, they g -- they\u2019Il give you.

And they got\ncontact with some peop -- you know, partisans, Russians and Polish in the woods.\nBut they were still working independently, you know, they were -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s before\nwe got incorporated there. Now, this group used, once in awhile, used to come in in\nthe ghetto, and find out and told us what is going on. You stay or you had to get --\ntry and get some more ammunition, try and get some. And a way -- and they used to\ncome in the -- later, before the liquidation, they used to come in in the Judenrat and\nthey knew already when it was.

Eventually, later on, we -- they steal --\nthey were already hooked up with a group Russians there, but we were still\nindependent. That\u2019s when we had some contact. We -- we knew what\u2019s going --\nwhat contact on the outside, and they were coming in and we were telling them, you\nknow, what\u2019s going on, that you know, we c -- we -- we got some medication, cert --\n109\nyou know, like pills, or -- or -- and --wh-which was needed, and bandages, and --\nand all, you know, for first aid, certain for first aid, in case they needed.

The\nsame thing -- see what\u2019s going on here in this with the -- with the terrorists attack in\nthis country.
