And the house was packed, nobody can sit. The house\nwas very little. Now, when -- when I remember, that was really very, very small village\nhouse. She was baker, so she lived over there by herself. But again, because she was my\ngrandmother\u2019s friend, I was privileged.

        "A: I will tell you something. When I have to go to school -- we lived in village. When we\ncame with my mother, we came to Kiev because I wanted to -- I wanted to study in the\nsame school which my father did for [indecipherable] like this family. And I came to\nKiev, and in fren -- y -- this was not the si -- subways train outsti -- outside train. I saw\nJewish faces, I decided that I want to live here, because I was so afraid about -- o-of big\ncities after Leningrad, being outcasted so much, that when I saw here Jewish faces, and\nKiev was a f -- the fa -- city of the -- a lot of Jewish people lived because still before the\nrevolution, and everybody who survived bu -- came back to Kiev and in Kiev somehow\nyou can -- it was difficult anyway, being Jewish [indecipherable] was very difficult. But\nanyways, better than Leningrad, for example. And for -- I stay in Kiev, and I don\u2019t know\nfor which reason, but my memory, I was befriending only Jewish boys and girls. I -- for\nsome reason -- by the way my sister didn\u2019t -- did not, she married a Gentile, she married\nthat Russian, I was -- very -- very possible because I suffered from an -- anti-Semitism all\nmy life, being o-only one in school, and being one in school in Leningrad, and being so\noutcasted, that I want to be among my -- among my own.",
        "Q: But you were clear that people looked Jewish, to you?",
        "A: Looked Jewish, when they looked Jewish to me.",
        "Q: Were you correct most of the time?",

And my lane -- landlady was Jewish, and I was very\nanxious to bring everybody whom I meet, and whom I befriend to -- for -- for her to see\nthem, because she has to know whom I am with, because you know, that she -- very\npossible she\u2019s -- you know, t-the -- I want to -- her to know that I -- that everything 1s\nokay.",
        "Q: Right.",

I\nbelieved every word right away. I didn\u2019t know about it. But in my home sometimes, my\nfather mentioned something.

        "Q: You were ready to go.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, can you explain to people what it meant to be a refusnik?",
        "A: Again, I was [indecipherable] a refusnik. Because first of all we get the job, because of us\ntrying very hard. My husband had very bad job. He had to change the job to be a\nrefusnik, and he was -- like my father refused to ta -- tell me look at this, what she made\nof that -- of this guy, he was a man, a mensch [indecipherable] and now he be -- he\nbecame a frightened man because he -- he used to bring his is d -- you know, these\ngloves, this -- you know, the fa -- because he, who very -- very often he -- he had to, you\nknow, to load the truck and unload the truck. And it was really very difficult. Besides, we\nwere -- because of my husband had to change a job, his salary was half of the salary here\nhe used to have. And because of everybody\u2019s salary was from -- just fr-from salary to\nsalary, we suffered a lot. And only because of again, my mother was a very -- you know,\nfu -- very frugal cook, this is how you can survive. We did -- didn\u2019t -- we never had any\nsavings on us, ne-never had. And at work I never talk to anybody about America, about\nmy intention to leave. Everybody knew because they had to take paper, and they\nsupposed to, you know, condemn me in voice. The -- the lot of people who just supported\nme, but they suppose -- what they supposed to. And I remember even this old man who is\n-- who fa -- who didn\u2019t want me to write that I was on occupieded territory, he was the\none who supposed to condemn me. And he didn\u2019t know how to do it. He said, \u201cLook at\nthis, I work fo -- with you for such a long time. I never knew that you wanted,\u201d he didn\u2019t\nknow what to -- v -- what -- what else bad to s -- to tell. He didn\u2019t know. I was like\neverybody else, I was coming to work, I was a consciousness at work, I was doing -- I\nlove my work always. And you know, I was brought up as -- you know, I have -- if I\ncome -- if they gave me work, I have to --",
        "Q: Do it.",
        "A: -- | -- | have to do it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And -- and actually it was -- actually it was difficult to complain about me. And I wanted\nto tell one story, because this story was significant enough. When there was, you know,\nthe -- su-supposed to be meetings to condemn me, to tell bad thing about me, that -- to --\nthat I am a traitor, I want to leave my country, my cuze -- you know, my Fatherland --\nFatherland for some kind of America, a-and supposed to be like this. And somebody\nsupposed to represent me. There was this foo -- of general -- retired general who was a\nhead of personnel department, who was very nice, because he was -- he -- he -- he grew\nup among Jewish boys and girls who help hi -- him before the war, be -- became a man sh\n-- and they decided -- in my division, they decided that head of division would not go\nbecause they will re -- 1 -- j -- remind him of all the mistakes we made. You know, he --\nhead of department, e-everybody. So he decide -- decided that his assistant will go, that\u2019s\nme. And his assis -- assistant was Jewish. He was very nice, very handsome man.\nHandsome and to -- could -- you know, everybody in the -- in this -- in my cu -- company\nwas talking about h-how nice, and how handsome he 1s. He is now here. His name is\nWeiss. I --I would like to have his -- his name, because I never forget what he had done\nfor me. And he was s -- s -- charming, and he was the one, if there was some problem, he\nwas sent to -- to -- to sol -- to solve this problem because he was very charming,\neverybody was -- you know, was -- was charmed by him, was the -- because he was the --\nhe -- he was the one. And he f -- everybody, they decided that he will represent me. Like\nwhen we came, there was a committee. There was a -- a chief engineer, who was -- he wa\n-- who was a Schwarz, he was a anti-Semite. I didn\u2019t know before, because I -- you\nknow, on my position, then his position, we were very far from each other. I didn\u2019t know.\nThere was this Barbara, which I told you, who -- who was assistant of this h-head of\npersonnel department, who was a cou -- who was undercover KGB, everybody knew that\ns-she is undercover to KGB, but what can we do? And a lot of other people, among them\nare Jewish people, too. Was a secretary [indecipherable] of party secretary, who was anti-\nSemite number one. But he was drunk, I remember where f -- my friends who was\nworking, they said, \u201cOh, you know, we had to make a picture of him, how sometimes he\nwill -- he is coming from work, he could not walk, he went to -- to -- to the train\n[indecipherable] and this pi -- picture will -- will make him tell about you the bad thing.\u201d\nBut then nobody made this picture, and -- and there was few other people. And to keep\nme at work, which I ask them to keep me at work, do not fire me because I knew that we\nwill be refusniks, and we have to survive somehow. This, you know, assistant is Yuri\nWizer, this what I thought, he who represents me, said about me good things. And he\nsigned up the punishment for him. And now everybody said, \u201cHow can you tell about a\ntraitor, about the person who want to leave he -- her Fatherland, good things? She\u2019s the\nworst person we can di -- how can you?\u201d And everybody forgot about me.",
        "Q: And started --",
        "A: -- for the moment, and started with him. And it was like for two hours. I will tell you, I\nwas so tense. I didn\u2019t know how will I come tomorrow to work and look in his eyes, if he\nwill still here after everything they told about him, and this Barbara, who happened to be\n-- you know, she -- of course she liked him, but he was -- he was very respectable man,\nthat was far for her. She was -- she was the one who was -- her -- her language was the\nmost -- the most -- the most powerful against him. And after two hours, we walked out in\nsilent. We didn\u2019t talk to each other. Everybody came. He went to his office, he had the\nprivate office, and I came to my -- and -- to my room where I work, and nobody from co-\nworkers ask me how it -- everybody saw. And was so silent, nobody was talking,\neverybody understood that there\u2019s something to -- something terrible happened. And I\ndidn\u2019t know if they will keep him at work. I -- I didn\u2019t think about myself already\nbecause I felt so bad about him being so brave to -- to -- to represent me. Well they made\nan -- in the end of their working day, he came to my he -- to the room, looks at every --\nevery group, every [indecipherable] had the room, separate room. He came to my\n[indecipherable] room, and he ask everybody to leave, just me to -- to stay. And he\napproach me, he said, \u201cClaudia, don\u2019t worry. Nothing happened. If you would need more\nm-my help, I will go.\u201d I never forget. It 1s so -- sorry -- and believe me, because of this\nanti-Semitism, I was -- I didn\u2019t tell anybody this. I wanted everybody know how brave he\nis, but I could not tell, because he made such a -- you know, tha -- such a -- and I didn\u2019t\ntell about this to anybody before I found out that he 1s here.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: When I found out about this, he got -- he is older than me, and he came later, and it was\nvery difficult for him -- him to got a job. And this is -- okay, and he -- and I got an offer\nfrom a guy who knew me before, a young guy, he became vice-president of the company.\nAnd he insisted on me to get a job for -- in his company. But I had my job, and I didn\u2019t\nfeel like leave my boss. Y-You -- we have very good relationship, it\u2019s very small\ncompany actually, and I didn\u2019t feel like, and I decided I will try to offer to Yuri this job. I\nwill tell Yuri that there is a job. And I call him, and I told him that -- I -- I found his\ntelephone number. I told -- I called him and I told him, do you remember this story? I\nnever forget it, and only now I want everybody to know. And everybody who used to\nwork with us, and who is here, and I t -- I telling the story everybody. Because I never\nfor-forget. You -- you should know who he was. He was, you know, like a symbol of --\nof -- of engineering mind, and being so handsome, and you know, it becau -- even that he\nwas a Jewish didn\u2019t -- you know, it didn\u2019t bother -- bother everybody be -- because he\nwas so respectable. And he had the -- you know, he had -- had guts, like American say, to\n-- to stand next to me, and to protect me. This 1s -- this was -- but he did not get the job, it\nwas difficult for him with language ver-very much. And he was, you know, he was\nretired already, he -- he was 65, he said, you know, \u201cI got my social security, and I -- I\nam happy with that. My son 1s okay, I -- he -- thank you so much.\u201d",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we were talking for a long time. He told me about company, how it\u2019s a ta -- ta --\nhow it became. It actually fell apart when I left. Not because of me of course, it\u2019s Soviet\nUnion who fell apart, and nobody had money to -- to support such a -- such a big cor --\ncor -- company, which designed paper, which needs for of -- they need it for propa -- for\npropaganda, paper for the -- the -- after -- after weapon, it was next --",
        "Q: Next thing, right.",

        "Q: Claudia, how would you define a refusnik?",
        "A: A refusnik actually, what does it mean? It means when you apply to leave the country.\nYou apply to special organization -- organization for special permission, which actually\nbelonged to KGB. It is -- 1t is a division --",
        "Q: A division? Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s division of KGB. They put you on the list. They -- they do not -- they denied\nyour application, they would not let you to go, but they put you on the list of people who\nwant to leave -- who want to leave their Fatherland.",
        "Q: So they refuse, and you become a refusnik?",
        "A: Sure, sure.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s where it comes from?",
        "A: Yeah, they refuse it, and we became refusniks.",
        "Q: Refusniks.",
        "A: Yeah. And being on this special list, you have a special treatment, according to it. It\nmeans that actually -- well better -- you better do not apply for another job, for different\njob, because not only -- you know, if -- or very possible, people who give you the job\ndon\u2019t know about that you\u2019re a refusnik, and you don\u2019t o-offer it, you don\u2019t talk on it to\nthem.

And eventually this information will come.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And not only you who will suffer for -- but the people who want you to hi -- who want\nyou to work for them, will suffer from the -- fro -- from this. They can\u2019t have food,\ndifferent co -- different co -- diffi -- difficulties at work, with -- especially with different\nparty organization which were very powerful.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: In the -- in government they didn\u2019t do anything technically, but government the people,\nand through condition and position and salary, especially salary. And everything was\nunder their control, and they -- when they find out that you are refusnik. If a -- besides,\njust have -- talking with Grigory, we were under control of this -- of -- of local police --\npolice -- the, you know, f -- and we had our local policeman coming to check on us every\nmonth. It means that he was checking if there are group of people gathering together, and\nmaybe were talking about something. Th -- maybe we read some books which we not\nsupposed to read.

        "Q: [inaudible]",
        "A: -- that you tell them from the state. That why you have to be very careful when you talk\non the phone, what you talking about. And there were -- some got -- not with us, but there\nwere sha -- a few times when they come to refusnik\u2019s apartment, to the place where the\npeople who were refusniks live, and blame them in having drugs. How -- they put some\nkind of like baking soda on the refrigerator. Don\u2019t -- for -- you know, the -- the powder,\nwhite powder. And they say that this a drug. They put themself.

And what I remember, you ma -- from time to time the Germans\nwere coming to the -- to ghetto, and everybody was so afraid because you know, German\nal -- always brought the death with them.

He didn\u2019t want to ask to go there because of me,\nbecause I was very little that he was afraid that I will cry, and Germans will hear -- wo-\nwould hear us. And I remember, my memory, why he think that I will cry? I am afraid\nthe same s -- the same way, I would not cry, but I will not express it because my mom say\nto me do not open my mouth, and I didn\u2019t open my mouth.

        "A: Dawn it was, dawn, sorry. And it was light already, almost when we went out, it means\nall night long we were just staying in the cellar. And few more time it was very, you\nknow, [indecipherable] it was the brightest part of my memory when Germans used to\ncome because it 1s -- it\u2019s really, you know, it\u2019s really was the most dangerous t-time. And\nonce --",

And beso -- because of -- I don\u2019t\nremember her in the gray dress, it means she was not part of this camp. Maybe sh -- they\nwould not -- not make her working, I remember, but she lived in Zhmerinka after the war.",

I didn\u2019t know for which reason absolutely,\nyou know, it was not nice talk about it, because I remember that -- maybe -- maybe my\nfather was jealous about this, I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember, but it was not -- not mentioned\nat home.",

And the house was packed, nobody can sit. The house\nwas very little. Now, when -- when I remember, that was really very, very small village\nhouse. She was baker, so she lived over there by herself. But again, because she was my\ngrandmother\u2019s friend, I was privileged. I was put on them -- you know, this fireplace they\nhave like in -- in the village, where they used to bake bread, cook in the same, and if --\nthere was like a p -- piece like they can sleep when -- in wintertime, when\n[indecipherable] was cold, they were sleeping over there.

And she put me on this -- and to -- to make me\nbreathe she was -- sh-she was pu -- she put a paper and sugar on fire, and this way she\ntold she will clean up some air for me.

Nobody need, the plant wasn\u2019t not such big, nobody\nneed assistant, but he was assigned it\u2019s assistant. All Jew were kicked out of this plant\nduring the next week. And these people were staying out of the apartments like we used\nto stay, and my father found out before. He went to Vinnitsa, and he found another job,\nand we moved out, we were not kicked out. This time we were not kicked out. But the\nold people, I remember my friend, her name was Claudia, too. She was my girlfriend. Her\n-- her grandmother was paralyzed, and they were dragging her out, there was no -- no --\nout on the street. This I remem -- it was after the war. I was afraid of everything. There\nwas [indecipherable] there were -- th-there was --",
        "A: -- difficult life.",
        "A: It was -- it was horrible life after the war.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: This -- you know, I am proud now. I was very conscious to be Jewish, and I never -- you\nknow, never hiding this. Besides, I always fe -- I felt that I am Jewish. Only place where\nwas good for me, it was this -- this -- before this Swigun came, because there were -- I --\nother Jewish boys and girls, only -- only -- but it was very -- for very short time.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it was very difficult. It was der -- very difficult, for one reason. I was taken\nby my very far aunt to Leningrad.",
        "A: I was like from -- from -- from fifth grade to eighth grade I stayed in Leningrad. This was\nthe worst -- worst time in my life, because there I was identified as a Jew, and nobody\nwanted to speak. I didn\u2019t have friends. Absolutely I didn\u2019t have friends, I will -- I was by\nmyself. I remember very well always listening to the rad -- to the radio. I knew all operas\nfor -- which were translated by -- by radio, by heart. Because I didn\u2019t ha -- only school\nand home.",
        "A: And my aunt, she was lonely woman, and she was deaf, and she was -- she was not very\nnice. I believe now she was -- she had this -- some kind of mental sickness. Not if I was\nafraid with her, but I was aggravated with her. She was t -- she was telling me bad stories\nabout my grandmother, which I didn\u2019t believe, of course I didn\u2019t believe, my\ngrandmother was entire world for me. And she was telling me bad -- bad stories about\nher, I didn\u2019t like her, and I e-eventually one summer, and during the break, I didn\u2019t go\nback to Leningrad, I stayed in the village. And -- but to this time, before of my father has\na but -- had the position in -- on the plant, being I was one Jewish, and another Jewish\nwas my sister. And I had a friend who was half Jewish, her father was Jewish. And for\nhim it was very difficult to get a job.

        "A: He could not get a job. And my father would not be able to get -- give him a job, besides\nhe g -- he got the position. It was -- you know, there was a choice, or you working, or you\ngiving the job to -- to another Jew, and you will both be kicked out of the plant. It was\nvery difficult time, horrible time, we were -- we -- I -- I remember my mom, who\u2019s -- she\nwas -- she was very skilled cook. She was making potato soup, and some kind of stuffed\npotato skin for the second course. And there wa -- there was only meal. And eventually\nwe got a cow, and my mom, who was actually a city girl -- a shtetl girl, she didn\u2019t know -\n- she was taking care about this cow, and we had the milk. And I remember people are\ncoming with glasses to our house, asking for a glass of milk.",

        "A: I -- I will say they hated -- I hate people in Leningr -- and beside my sister used to live in\nLeningrad, because she diyako -- she made it to a b -- a boy who was student in\nLeningrad, and they used to visit her. And I tried to see beauty around, it was difficult for\nme. You know, I saw these people, and these people who had a gray faces, believe me,\nthis -- they had a -- I don\u2019t know from lack of vitamins, they had gray faces, very severe\nlook. And this -- this what I remember about Leningrad, I didn\u2019t like it. And when Stalin\ndied, I was crying like everybody else, I was a girl, you know, everybody was crying, and\nI thought that di -- you know, the end the world. Everybody was crying. And I came to\nschool crying, and this girls was staying like this, \u201cAre you crying? Because you Jew\nkilled Stalin.\u201d Because there was a story with Jewish doctors --",

And I came to\nKiev, and in fren -- y -- this was not the si -- subways train outsti -- outside train. I saw\nJewish faces, I decided that I want to live here, because I was so afraid about -- o-of big\ncities after Leningrad, being outcasted so much, that when I saw here Jewish faces, and\nKiev was a f -- the fa -- city of the -- a lot of Jewish people lived because still before the\nrevolution, and everybody who survived bu -- came back to Kiev and in Kiev somehow\nyou can -- it was difficult anyway, being Jewish [indecipherable] was very difficult.

        "A: And this way I use [indecipherable] Jews, and I thought that if they are Jewish, they are\nokay. I don\u2019t know, I was like a [indecipherable] running to the [indecipherable]",

I\nbelieved every word right away. I didn\u2019t know about it. But in my home sometimes, my\nfather mentioned something.

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Again, I was [indecipherable] a refusnik. Because first of all we get the job, because of us\ntrying very hard. My husband had very bad job. He had to change the job to be a\nrefusnik, and he was -- like my father refused to ta -- tell me look at this, what she made\nof that -- of this guy, he was a man, a mensch [indecipherable] and now he be -- he\nbecame a frightened man because he -- he used to bring his is d -- you know, these\ngloves, this -- you know, the fa -- because he, who very -- very often he -- he had to, you\nknow, to load the truck and unload the truck. And it was really very difficult. Besides, we\nwere -- because of my husband had to change a job, his salary was half of the salary here\nhe used to have. And because of everybody\u2019s salary was from -- just fr-from salary to\nsalary, we suffered a lot. And only because of again, my mother was a very -- you know,\nfu -- very frugal cook, this is how you can survive. We did -- didn\u2019t -- we never had any\nsavings on us, ne-never had. And at work I never talk to anybody about America, about\nmy intention to leave. Everybody knew because they had to take paper, and they\nsupposed to, you know, condemn me in voice. The -- the lot of people who just supported\nme, but they suppose -- what they supposed to.

        "A: -- | -- | have to do it.",
        "A: And -- and actually it was -- actually it was difficult to complain about me. And I wanted\nto tell one story, because this story was significant enough. When there was, you know,\nthe -- su-supposed to be meetings to condemn me, to tell bad thing about me, that -- to --\nthat I am a traitor, I want to leave my country, my cuze -- you know, my Fatherland --\nFatherland for some kind of America, a-and supposed to be like this. And somebody\nsupposed to represent me. There was this foo -- of general -- retired general who was a\nhead of personnel department, who was very nice, because he was -- he -- he -- he grew\nup among Jewish boys and girls who help hi -- him before the war, be -- became a man sh\n-- and they decided -- in my division, they decided that head of division would not go\nbecause they will re -- 1 -- j -- remind him of all the mistakes we made. You know, he --\nhead of department, e-everybody. So he decide -- decided that his assistant will go, that\u2019s\nme. And his assis -- assistant was Jewish. He was very nice, very handsome man.\nHandsome and to -- could -- you know, everybody in the -- in this -- in my cu -- company\nwas talking about h-how nice, and how handsome he 1s. He is now here. His name is\nWeiss. I --I would like to have his -- his name, because I never forget what he had done\nfor me. And he was s -- s -- charming, and he was the one, if there was some problem, he\nwas sent to -- to -- to sol -- to solve this problem because he was very charming,\neverybody was -- you know, was -- was charmed by him, was the -- because he was the --\nhe -- he was the one. And he f -- everybody, they decided that he will represent me. Like\nwhen we came, there was a committee. There was a -- a chief engineer, who was -- he wa\n-- who was a Schwarz, he was a anti-Semite. I didn\u2019t know before, because I -- you\nknow, on my position, then his position, we were very far from each other. I didn\u2019t know.\nThere was this Barbara, which I told you, who -- who was assistant of this h-head of\npersonnel department, who was a cou -- who was undercover KGB, everybody knew that\ns-she is undercover to KGB, but what can we do? And a lot of other people, among them\nare Jewish people, too. Was a secretary [indecipherable] of party secretary, who was anti-\nSemite number one. But he was drunk, I remember where f -- my friends who was\nworking, they said, \u201cOh, you know, we had to make a picture of him, how sometimes he\nwill -- he is coming from work, he could not walk, he went to -- to -- to the train\n[indecipherable] and this pi -- picture will -- will make him tell about you the bad thing.\u201d\nBut then nobody made this picture, and -- and there was few other people. And to keep\nme at work, which I ask them to keep me at work, do not fire me because I knew that we\nwill be refusniks, and we have to survive somehow. This, you know, assistant is Yuri\nWizer, this what I thought, he who represents me, said about me good things. And he\nsigned up the punishment for him. And now everybody said, \u201cHow can you tell about a\ntraitor, about the person who want to leave he -- her Fatherland, good things? She\u2019s the\nworst person we can di -- how can you?\u201d And everybody forgot about me.",
        "A: -- for the moment, and started with him. And it was like for two hours. I will tell you, I\nwas so tense. I didn\u2019t know how will I come tomorrow to work and look in his eyes, if he\nwill still here after everything they told about him, and this Barbara, who happened to be\n-- you know, she -- of course she liked him, but he was -- he was very respectable man,\nthat was far for her. She was -- she was the one who was -- her -- her language was the\nmost -- the most -- the most powerful against him. And after two hours, we walked out in\nsilent. We didn\u2019t talk to each other. Everybody came. He went to his office, he had the\nprivate office, and I came to my -- and -- to my room where I work, and nobody from co-\nworkers ask me how it -- everybody saw. And was so silent, nobody was talking,\neverybody understood that there\u2019s something to -- something terrible happened. And I\ndidn\u2019t know if they will keep him at work. I -- I didn\u2019t think about myself already\nbecause I felt so bad about him being so brave to -- to -- to represent me. Well they made\nan -- in the end of their working day, he came to my he -- to the room, looks at every --\nevery group, every [indecipherable] had the room, separate room. He came to my\n[indecipherable] room, and he ask everybody to leave, just me to -- to stay. And he\napproach me, he said, \u201cClaudia, don\u2019t worry. Nothing happened. If you would need more\nm-my help, I will go.\u201d I never forget. It 1s so -- sorry -- and believe me, because of this\nanti-Semitism, I was -- I didn\u2019t tell anybody this. I wanted everybody know how brave he\nis, but I could not tell, because he made such a -- you know, tha -- such a -- and I didn\u2019t\ntell about this to anybody before I found out that he 1s here.",
        "A: When I found out about this, he got -- he is older than me, and he came later, and it was\nvery difficult for him -- him to got a job. And this is -- okay, and he -- and I got an offer\nfrom a guy who knew me before, a young guy, he became vice-president of the company.\nAnd he insisted on me to get a job for -- in his company. But I had my job, and I didn\u2019t\nfeel like leave my boss. Y-You -- we have very good relationship, it\u2019s very small\ncompany actually, and I didn\u2019t feel like, and I decided I will try to offer to Yuri this job. I\nwill tell Yuri that there is a job. And I call him, and I told him that -- I -- I found his\ntelephone number. I told -- I called him and I told him, do you remember this story? I\nnever forget it, and only now I want everybody to know. And everybody who used to\nwork with us, and who is here, and I t -- I telling the story everybody. Because I never\nfor-forget. You -- you should know who he was. He was, you know, like a symbol of --\nof -- of engineering mind, and being so handsome, and you know, it becau -- even that he\nwas a Jewish didn\u2019t -- you know, it didn\u2019t bother -- bother everybody be -- because he\nwas so respectable. And he had the -- you know, he had -- had guts, like American say, to\n-- to stand next to me, and to protect me.

        "A: And it was possible that he can come back to Kiev, it -- 1t was possible because he was a\n[indecipherable] student, he had -- he had the privilege of his hi-high -- high marks in --\nin college.

        "A: No, and we were trying to move, and we actually found an apartment not far from\nMoscow, it was not in Moscow, it is one of -- one of the small towns around Moscow.\nBut was such thing we could not move, because of prescription to this particular place.\nBut this is not only refusniks, this was in -- in Russia there was a rule, you prescribed to\nthis apartment.
