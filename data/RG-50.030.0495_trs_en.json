        "Question: Good morning, Michael.",
        "Answer: Good morning.",
        "Q: It\u2019s very nice to meet you and have you here.",
        "A: I\u2019m glad to be here.",
        "Q: Good. Michael, what was your name when you were born?",
        "A: It was Catz, is family name, Catz you pronounce it, C-a-t-z, Moise1 M-o-1-s-e-1, which was\nMoishe in terms of a Jewish name, but they -- it was a lucified name of -- the variational form of\nMoishe or Moisei. In fact, by -- by the book, my name is Moisei Catz. Moisei bar Mordechai\nCatz a coyen, of course.",
        "Q: So when did you become Michael Cernea?",
        "A: That happened about 20 some years later. I change my name. It came first as a kind of prank,\nwhich we did as high school kids, a -- a bunch of us were -- you want the story?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That happened in -- I believe in 1940 -- \u201948 - \u00b049.",
        "Q: This is after the war?",
        "A: After the war, yes, when -- a b-bunch of friends from our class was walking and we were\nwalking town, and having a good time and we noticed there was an announcement about -- for a\ncompetition for sportswriters. The sport newspaper of Bucharest was trying to recruit -- hire,\nidentify sportswriters and opened a competition. So a few of us said why not, let\u2019s try. We were\nreally kind of -- sensed that it\u2019s not the best chance to give our names -- in addition to real\nnames, and additionally didn\u2019t know what the repercussion that have at school. So I invented the\nname and I took Cernea. And that kind of -- that was destiny kind of, I w -- I won the\ncompetition for the writing, then the -- the oral competition, I was offered the job. That changed\na lot of things in my life, including the name. So this how --",
        "Q: So that\u2019s how the name changed.",
        "A: -- I stayed with the name for a number of years until after I married, we decided to change it\nin the documents as well, because I married under the real name, but there was a lot of conflicts\nin -- in documents between the people calling me one way, the documents being different,\nhaving to explain everything [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- so this is how it changed.",
        "Q: So your recollection as yourself as a child, especially during the war period is as Moishe, or\nMose -- Moise -- Moisei --",
        "A: Well the diminutive name which my mother and everybody in the family used was Musi.",
        "Q: Musi.",
        "A: Musi, which is M-u-s-i, written in Romanian. The name 1s not very frequent for men, but it\u2019s\nquite frequent for girls, whose variant, you know, feminine variant of Musi 1s Musia.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So we can find a lot of women called Musia.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But I was Musi and my good old friends, since high school and before, who are still alive,\nthose are -- call me Musi today.",
        "Q: Not Michael.",
        "A: Not Michael, no, no.",
        "Q: No Michaels. And what was your date of birth?",
        "A: It was October 14, \u201831",
        "Q: 1931.",
        "A: 1931.",
        "Q: And you -- where were you born?",
        "A: In Balti. This is a famous town of the -- of the -- even more famous Yiddish song, Mein\nshtaitila Balti.",
        "Q: Right, it\u2019s a great song.",
        "A: If you recall Mein shtaitila Balti, da, la, la, la, la, la, la, that song. It\u2019s a beautiful song. It is\nspelled, if you need to know, B-a-l-t-1. It is in Bessarabia which at that time belonged to\nRomania. Then it passed. That is a territory between the rivers Prut and Dniester. And it changed\nstate allegiance or ownership or belongingness al-along the centuries. When I was born it was\npart of Romania; in 1940 it was shifted back to Russia. And the Russian pronunciation of the\ntown is Balti. Until 1917 - 1918, I think, the Russian revolution, it was part of Russia. So\npopulation there spoke Russian and the Jews spoke Yiddish, too, so my mother, who was born\nthere and her family spoke Russian and -- and Yiddish. So they were all fluent in Russian and I\nlearned the Russian, a bit of Russian from my mother, too so --",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Now why were you born in Balti since your mother and father were living 1n Iasi?",
        "A: Well Joan, you should know better how young mothers feel and behave. When my mother\nwas pregnant, my father and mother lived in Iasi, which was a big city, apparently the second\ncity of Romania at that time, over a hundred thousand people in the northeastern part of\nRomania, close to the border with Bessarabia. So Bessarabia was then part of Romania, and she\ndecided to go to deliver in her mother\u2019s house and be with the care of her mother, which was\nsupposed to be even better than in the big hospital in Iasi. This is how I was born in Balti, yes.",
        "Q: And did you go back and forth to Balti a great deal to see your grandparents, or other\nrelatives?",
        "A: As a matter of fact, not. I believe I have one recollection, I don\u2019t know whether I was four\nyears old or so, that I was in Balti and I remember being on my grandfather\u2019s lap on the f -- front\npart of his house. That I remember very clearly, and was confirmed by my mother, and some guy\nwho was selling pickled apples, which was a specialty there, was passing by, and he -- I wanted\nand my grandfather stopped him and bought me the apple, which was very tasteful. I believe was\nthe first time in my life, and the last time.",
        "Q: And the last --",
        "A: And the last time. I never heard again about pickled apples.",
        "Q: No, I\u2019ve never heard [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, in Romanian they\u2019re called mere murate, mere murate. And I still have the plan to\nidentify whether somebody knows how to do such things now.",
        "Q: So you can try it again, yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk --",
        "A: Yeah, but then I was again in Balti --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- that is the fullest ans -- fuller answer to your question.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: After the collapse of the Soviet Union, when that part, which in the meantime became the\nSoviet Republic of Muldavia, during Soviet exis -- Soviet Union existence, became now the\nindependent country of the republic of Moldova. And I -- with the help of an assignment from\nthe World Bank, where I was working [indecipherable] in the 90\u2019s, I made my way back to that\nplace. I took a few days off from my formal mission to go back to Balti. And this is when I\nvisited Balti, I believe it was \u201994 or \u201995. And so th-the place of my birth again, of course, totally\nchanged and course the city was destroyed, the -- ravaged during the war. But I was there, and\nthe part which was not fully destroyed, still existed, was a cemetery which I visited. So yes, I re -\n- retrieved my place of birth.",
        "Q: And you were able to see the grave of your great-grandfather, is that right?",
        "A: When I was -- that was one of ma -- my purposes, to see the grave of my grandfather. And\nthat time, one of my cousin and his family were still living in Balti in \u201994, they lived there. They\nwent during the war, we kind of skipped over time, but anyway, they were, during the war put in\ncamps, persecuted, some of -- many people in my family died in that period, in camps, of -- were\nkilled, or died of typhus and other diseases, and -- in the camps. He was among those who\nsurvived. And after the war he went into the Russian army, when the army -- Russian army freed\nthe people in the camp, and then even visited us in Romania. So we kept in touch with them\nduring the war, and after the war, and now I had the chance, I went to see him and talked him\ninto speaking up his own thoughts of leaving and moving to Israel. And indeed, two or three\nyears later, they did move to Israel, and he passed away in Israel. But when I was in 794, in Balti,\nhe took me -- he and his wife Tiupa, who 1s still alive -- his name 1s Zioma Faerstein. Both of\nthem took me to the grave of my grandfather. And I saw the grave, yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about your family. What was your father\u2019s name?",
        "A: Marcu.",
        "Q: Marcu.",
        "A: Marcu, in fact, Marcu Leib Catz.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s Leib, L-e-1-b.",
        "A: L-e-1-b, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. And --",
        "A: And Marcu you spell with a C.",
        "Q: C, right. And what did he do?",
        "A: He was trained as an engineer. His training was electrical engineering 1n Romania of course,\nbut he was also -- got for a specialization and went to France for a few months. But that -- the\nconditions were not very good in Romania for that specialty. Romania was an agrarian country,\nbasically. So he shifted his work to the textile industry and worked as a engineer in textile\nindustry, first for electrical engineering, but then he learned the master -- the engineering of\ntextile work. So that was basically his profession as long as he was allowed to exercise it as a\nprofessional, after which he was eliminated. No, from among the profession, he was fired, sorry,\nnot eliminated, but had to become a -- a merchant of textiles.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: You know, the Jews were allowed to be merchants but not to be employed as professionals.",
        "Q: So was he employed in Iasi?",
        "A: Yes, in Iasi, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Until 1939 or 1940.",
        "Q: I was going to ask, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, when all the professional Jews were -- were, by law, fired from all places, so all of a\nsudden he became unemployed, as in fact I did, more or less the same time, although I was only\nwhat, eight, nine years old, because all the Jewish kids, by another law at the same time, were\nexpelled from all the state schools.",
        "Q: Yeah --",
        "A: SO --",
        "Q: -- so you would -- you [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- we shared -- we shared fates, yes.",
        "Q: T-Tell me what you remember about life in your home before the war. What -- what do you\nremember about your father, do you -- were you close with your father, did he spend time with\nyou, or was that not typical at that time?",
        "A: No, no, my father was a very warm person, loved me very much. I was his first born, so he\ninvested himself a lot in me. And I loved him, and course he was a constant presence in my life,\nso to say th -- spiritual presence too, he gave me my religious education when I was a child, and\nmy intellectual education he contributed very much because he was an intellectual, too. And --\nand my mother was also an intellectual, she was trained as a pharmacist.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. They both, in fact, met in the university in Iasi, where they got to know -- came to know\neach other, then got married. And my mother was a pharmacist, she was well educated also in\nliterature, which she loved, and was multilingual. Very bright woman, an extraordinarily strong\npresence in my life. And when I was unfortunate to lose my father in the late 60\u2019s, after illness,\nwhich is due largely to the to the pogrom in Iasi, my mother lived until her -- close to her 90\u2019s\nand she came to the States. I brought her to the States, in fact, and we had a very good time here.\nAnd therefore, she -- her presence in my life lasted until just 14 years ago.",
        "Q: Wow, that\u2019s fabulous.",
        "A: And it was a very presence -- a very strong presence. I owe -- I owe a very great deal to my\nmother for all I have done and for the way I am.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: For my values, so it was a very tight family life. I have a brother, is -- that 1s part also of your\nquestion?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: His name is Zolly, Zolly Catz. His name 1s -- the Jewish name is Zollman. And he 1s -- carries\nthe name of my grandfather of my mother\u2019s side. Be -- I -- my name Moiseti 1s -- Moiset is the\nname of my great-grandfather, also my mother\u2019s side.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So as you see, my mother ruled the --",
        "Q: It\u2019s very --",
        "A: -- the name giving in the family. And she told me all -- all the stories I -- she remembered\nabout her great -- her -- her grandfather was my grand --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, your great-grandfather.",
        "A: -- greatfather, yes, Moisei Baraz. So that was my mother, and I was very fortunate to have in\nour home, in addition to my brother and my parents, my grandmothers, on both sides.",
        "Q: Both sides?",
        "A: On both sides, until late. I mean, my grandmother on my father\u2019s side, named Eva -- Chava\nwas a s-strongest religious presence in the house, lived with us until the 1944.",
        "Q: Really.",
        "A: I knew also my grandfather on my father\u2019s sti -- side. His name is Itic -- Itic. And he passed\naway when I was a child, but I remember him when they visited us, in a kind of cart with horses.\nI remember his very imposing -- both my grandfathers were very imposing Jews, tall, both tall,\nwith gray beards, with payas --",
        "Q: Payas.",
        "A: -- yes. So they hard to forget. And then my parents spoke very often with great reverence\nabout their parents, so I know a lot about that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was a tight family, close family, and -- and you know, I inherited the -- the -- the devotion\nto the idea of family from -- from my own parents\u2019.",
        "Q: So you must have had a fairly large home if you also had your two grandmothers there, or am\nI wrong?",
        "A: Well, we had a large home by Romanian standards. It would be a -- a -- a [indecipherable] or\na tight home by American standards --",
        "Q: American stan --",
        "A: -- yes. You know, is -- I slept with my brother in a room, or otherwise he sl -- I slept in the --\nor he slept in the so-called living room which doubled o -- [indecipherable] living room, and in a\ncorner had a bed for my -- one of my grandmothers, so that --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: -- I don\u2019t complain, it was a good family life, yeah.",
        "Q: It was a good family life.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t say that my family was among the poorest families, Jewish families, no, because\nthey were middle class.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Middle class.",
        "Q: So you felt comfortable, not -- not deprived?",
        "A: No, until -- on a -- only after -- until my father was employed --",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: -- then we had periods, long periods when my father did not make, you know, a salary.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Had to improvise, and to expose himself to very risky activities to -- to bring something on\nthe table --",
        "Q: Home.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was your mother\u2019s name?",
        "A: Seindel.",
        "Q: It was her first name, Seindel?",
        "A: Sein -- Seindel, yes, Seindel, and her name 1s in Jewish, yeah Seindel -- Shinya -- no, sorry,\nher Jewish name 1s Seindel, her -- the name by which everybody knew her and called her was the\nRussian diminutive of Seindel, which was Shanya.",
        "Q: Shanya.",
        "A: Shanya, yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s very nice.",
        "A: Shanya.",
        "Q: Was it an --",
        "A: She -- she was pr -- very proud of her family name as a girl, which was half a century before\nmodern feminist bent. And she always liked to call herself Shanya Faerstein Catz.",
        "Q: Catz.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interest --",
        "A: And this is what she wanted to be written on her gravestone and this is how I wrote on her\ngravestone.",
        "Q: Was it unusual for a woman to be so educated in Romania?",
        "A: Yes, it was unusual, it was not frequent. But she was bright, she wanted to get educated. Her\nfather was really enamored by her, her mother. She was his only child of her mother, who was\nthe second wife of my grandfather. My grandfather had six children for his first marriage, and\nthen his wife died, Chava died, and -- and he married my grandmother, Brana, who came from a\n-- a -- another little shtetl, Briceva, also there. Brana Baraz. And their only child was my mother,\nso it was a child, at old age you can imagine --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- how dear -- in fact, I have a -- a picture of my grandfather, imposing as he was, my -- my\ngrandmother and my mother at the age of one year, where she looks like a doll, you know.",
        "Q: Right. And we\u2019ll see that picture later, yes?",
        "A: As you wish, yes.",
        "Q: And in -- wh-when you remember back, in terms of your household.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was it a happy household, was there a lot of discussion, were you involved with your parents\nand your grandparents? I mean how do you -- h-how do you picture it when you think --",
        "A: Well, it was a --",
        "Q: -- now I\u2019m talking before the war, of course.",
        "A: -- yeah, it was a happy household obviously, but it was not -- 1t was a Jewish household\nwhere you would have a fight and you would have some people screaming, and you have\narguments. Was a whole hullabaloo, you know? I do remember arguments, too. I do remember\nmy father getting upset and angry and you know, using strong words. He was a coyen and you\nknow, the Kohanim are -- are traditionally seen as people who are easily irritable.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: You know, they have a short fuse.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2019ma coyen, too.",
        "Q: So 1s that true of you, too? Yes?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve -- you know, going through so many cultures, I try to temper it -- that\ncharacteristic, but I wouldn\u2019t say that I am alien to my heritage. So I inherited that too. But -- so\nit was a normal household, Joan, nothing very special, but an educated household where, you\nknow, discussions were very often about politics, about broader issues and the daily life values.\nSometimes philosophy, you know --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- issues, political issues, tyranism, anti-Semitism, a lot of discussion the situation in\nRomania, the situation in Russia, whether Jews are doing better in Russia -- this was before the\nwar --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- and during the war what -- you know, a lot of discussion. My mother was involved early in\nthe Zionist movement. And she had connection there, so the matter came up and she -- I recall\nthat she would go to reunions of the Zionist women of Iasi at that time, and she came back and\nbrought and spoke to me about oranges who grow in Palestine. Yeah. And then sh -- they were\nalso involved on the left of center activities, like many other Jews at that time were in Romania,\nbut particularly my mother, coming from Russia had friends who were really enrolled in anti-\nFascist, an-and communist underground, and they, in fact, used the friendship with my mother to\nask her to give them shelter when they were pursued by the police. And -- and some of them\nslept and came and hid in our house and then disappeared as silently as they came. Only for us to\nrecognize them -- and my mother, of course, she knew, but then sh -- after the war, when they\nemerged as political leaders.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And one of them even became a minister in gr -- Romania\u2019s government, who was in hiding\nin my mother\u2019s -- father\u2019s home, brought by that -- the people. So it was -- to come back to your\nquestion, 1t was a house where political issues were discussed, and I -- I listened as a child.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I can -- I was not a participant in those discussions.",
        "Q: Right, but clearly around the table --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- y-you were not told to leave --",
        "A: No, no, no, I don\u2019t re --",
        "Q: -- you -- you certainly heard this.",
        "A: -- no, I don\u2019t ever recall that I was sent to my toys, no.",
        "Q: Sent, yeah, to your room.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When you said your f -- your father taught you religion --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- or religious traditions, religious values, how did he do that, what did he do?",
        "A: Well, he was re -- a rel-religious person himself, he got the --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- very strong religious education for his father -- from his father. Went to the synagogue\npretty often, not every day, but when he wouldn\u2019t go to synagogue he will put tefillin in the\nmorning and do the prayers at home every single morning.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: For years, yes. So on the holidays we go to the synagogue, all of us, I remember -- like 1t was\none year -- you know, holiday I could play with the other kids for the entire day in the big\ncourtyard of the synagogue. Coming in, when the Kohanim gave their blessing of -- for the\ncongregation, something which doesn\u2019t happen here unfortunately. It\u2019s the only thing I am\ndisappointed because the Kohanim here are not -- except for very Orthodox synagogues are not\ncalled on high holidays to give their blessing you know, for the -- for the congregation. So at that\nmoment th-the prayer, even when I was small child, five, six, seven I was called in and I s-\nstrained to hear and recognize my father\u2019s voice because if you saw sometime the scene, the\nKohanim are the front, then they say to the back, to the congregation which is behind them, and\nat a certain point they all turn around but they have their heads covered by the big talit -- talitim.\nAnd their hands, which are -- are covered.",
        "Q: Yes, expla -- explain that because some people who are watching this may not understand\nwhat you\u2019ve just done with your hands.",
        "A: Well, the Kohanim are supposed to give a blessing on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur on\nthe congregation. They -- there is a special text which is the blessing and which they have to\npronounce when they give the blessing. The -- they have to keep their hands in a blessing\nmovement, and the -- the way the hand have to be kept is to keep two fingers together on each\nhand, tight, and separated the two, and you keep your hand this way, yes.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] I see.",
        "A: Which is not very easy.",
        "Q: No --",
        "A: Not everybody can do it. But the Kohanim are trained to do that. Pll -- I can tell you how I\nwas trained to do that. And he would then say the blessing and the long prayers, stay with the\nback of the congregation and when they have to say Ivareh\u2019ha adonai ve\u2019ishmereha and so on,\nthey turn around to the congregation and say that in loud voice. And this is when I was trained --",
        "Q: Hear it.",
        "A: -- straining to recognize the voice of my father, and to tell you frankly, honestly, it still rings\nin my ears when I think of that.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, is really -- he was really yelling, and I was able to recognize, among the chorus of the\nvoices.",
        "Q: So did he teach you things at home?",
        "A: So, as a child before Bar Mitzvah you are not supposed to do that, but after Bar Mitzvah you\nare [indecipherable] you have to po -- so, as part of the -- when it came time to be prepare for the\nBat Mitzvah, there were terrible times already in Romania, the war started, the -- there was a\nmassacre, the pogrom of Iasi to -- in \u00b041, and I was to be Bar Mitzvah\u2019d in \u00b044. So from \u00b042, in\nfact, they took -- he took -- and my mother [indecipherable] for me a Melamed to teach me at\nhome because -- I believe we are jumping history, you know, again, but after the pogrom I\ncouldn\u2019t go to the school so I stayed at home for a full year. The Melamed would come and teach\nme, and will teach me Hebrew and other things, but one of the things of those teaching was to\nkeep my hand this way. And this was done very simple, anything body can do. Take a string and\ntie those two fingers together and those two fingers together --",
        "Q: And you separate --",
        "A: -- and then separate them. And do that several times and you\u2019ll end up able to --",
        "Q: Able to do it.",
        "A: -- to do it. And most people when they try, they do it this way, and they cannot, th-they\ntremble, and -- try it, you'll s --",
        "Q: Right, it\u2019s not so easy.",
        "A: It\u2019s not easy, so --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- you -- you tend to think that you cannot do it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But you can.",
        "Q: But you can.",
        "A: If you [indecipherable]",
        "Q: I\u2019m afraid we have to stop and to change the tape.",
        "A: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Michael.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: What sort of friends did you have when you were a ki -- and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m really trying to\ndistinguish if we can, before the war. Did you have Jewish and non-Jewish friends, did you live\nin a Jewish neighborhood? How do -- would you de-describe it?",
        "A: Yeah, wi -- we live in several houses, my parents never owned a house, so we had to move\nevery two, three years for rent purpose and for other things, so I remember some of our houses,\nand you know, you ca -- friendships depend on geographical location and on space patterns, so I\n-- [remember I had a very good friend, his name was Marcu Grunberg, in one house, which I\nterribly missed when we moved in another house and I kept looking for him years, and I found\nhim again when I was in my 20\u2019s or so -- looked for him. So there were some friends th -- this\nway then, in the last house we lived in the year before we went on refu -- or became refugees, I\nhad some kids in the same courtyard, which was basically a Jewish courtyard with one Romanian\nfamily, and I befriended -- befriended also the girl in that family, who was about my age. So\nbasically I had a mixed group of friends, I think. Most of them were Jewish, and then when I was\nthrown out of school and I resumed ler -- schooling after a year in a community, Jewish\ncommunity school, of course all my friends were Jews, yeah. That was my childhood, right.",
        "Q: All right, e-explain something to me, because yo-you -- you used a nomenclature that seems\nvery typical in Europe, but not necessarily here. You said there were Romanians, and there were\nJews.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But you are Romanian, so why the nomenclature -- do you think this way?",
        "A: Because in Romanian -- rom -- in Romania we were identified as Jews.",
        "Q: Not as Romanians.",
        "A: Not as Romanian, Romanian was a second kind -- of course we were -- my father was\nRomanian citizens, we all were Romanian citizens, but we were the Jews of Romania. Here in\nthe States, and you know, the American culture, you say always both, you know, Romanian\nAmericans, or Jewish Americans, or --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So -- but over there it was very distinct. So when I say Romanian, I mean non-Jews. They\ncould be Romanian or even Hungarian people, and others, all kinds of national -- it didn\u2019t matter\nto me at that time, the exact ethnic identification, but we knew who was Jewish and who was not\nJewish.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. In fact, we were reminded very often that we are Jewish by those who were not.",
        "Q: Did -- did you experience anti-Semitism as a kid before the war?",
        "A: Yes, of course --",
        "Q: You did.",
        "A: -- yes, yes.",
        "Q: And -- and how did it manifest itself?",
        "A: In all kinds of ways. In school you are known and remembered. We had the very clear\nidentifier, the name. So being named Catz was from the very beginning a clear identifier to\neverybody, first the teachers, who knew that we are Jewish, and I\u2019m Jewish, and many of the\nkids, who heard a lot of things about Jews and non-Jews in their families. It was -- no, yo-you\nneed to understand also the background. Moldova, that part of Romania was heavily populated\nby Jews, and by the turn of the century, many townships in Romania and some bigger towns too,\nhad -- a majority of their population was Jewish. So the presence was massive, there was always\nan issue, and in Romania when I lived, it was the second town of Romania, and by that time it\nwas almost half -- a little bit less than half of the population was Jewish. I read documents which\nsaid at a certain point in time, the beginning, turn of the century or [indecipherable] before, the\nJewish population exceeded a little bit, 50 percent.",
        "Q: This is in Iasi?",
        "A: In Iasi, yes. So that made everybody conscious and clear who it is and who isn\u2019t. The heavily\npopulated Jewish areas are almost homogeneously Jewish. Ours was not, we were a bit farther\naway from the massive Jewish concentration of Iasi. But our courtyard had still a majority of\nJewish people, even though our house was very close to the most important chur -- cathedral in --\nin Iasi, the Mitropolea, Mitropolea, which was a very important, the most important religious\nplace, Christian religious place. So this explains my reference, Joan.",
        "Q: [inaudible].",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But it must have been more comfortable in Iasi because there was such a complement of\nJewish people, where it\u2019s almost 50 percent, if not more at certain times.",
        "A: Well, you can reason this way --",
        "Q: Or maybe not?",
        "A: -- the question wa -- the question is whether that was real what happened. In fact, the presence\nof many Jews made it easier for the ideologically anti-Semites to build their entire propaganda\nand advocacy ag -- against Jews, that here is a population which 1s a parasitic population, which\nis Oppressing us -- which was not true because they just didn\u2019t have the political power -- which\nabsorbs our economic resources. Which again was false because the Jews being in economic\nactivities were the -- in fact the engine of -- of many activities and facilitating. They were not\nland owners, or maybe large land owners never Jewish. But they facilitated the trade between\nagricultural sector and the urban consumers. And so -- so the number made it easy to mount a\nvery strong chauvinistic, anti-Semite attitude for those who wanted to exploit that. Not\neverybody bought that on the Romanian side. Some did not buy. Not every single Romanian was\nanti-Semite, but there was a long tradition of anti-Semitism in Romania. The literature is replete\nwith description of Jews in a very negative way. You know, the Jidan was the equivalent of\nKike, and this was thrown very liberally to everybody. Not liberally in the positive sense, but\nvery easily to everybody as an insult.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Is -- you know, go to Palestine. I mean, I know that -- the existence of Palestine I learned\nfrom the curses which were thrown at me as a child. When I came home and asked my mother,\nwhat is Palestine? So in that time there were boys who knew that and say you don\u2019t have a place\nhere, and use that. So this accounts for the distinction.",
        "Q: Was this hard on you as a kid?",
        "A: I-It was something which was intended as a humiliation. And when you are a child and you\nare cursed, everything which is accepted as a curse 1s -- becomes a curse. So yes, you were -- you\nwere -- you felt very bad, and insulted and all of a sudden kind of sad that\u2019s you are -- you are\nsomething totally different and base. That was, again, in the context of literature which described\nJews often as -- as evil. There is now a book, a very interesting book, written by a -- somebody\nin Romania, a Sociologist who is Jewish [indecipherable], \u201cThe Image of the Jew in the\nRomanian Culture.\u201d The book is that thick.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Because there is a lot to write about the image of the Jew in the literature, in poetry, in -- in\npaintings, in design, in -- in all -- all the means of arts. The -- very unfortunately, the main poet\nof Romania, Mihail Eminescu was really a very great, romantic poet. In his political philosophy\nhe was very reactionary on various grounds, including being an anti-Semit -- Semite. And he\nwrote -- well, his poetry is beautiful and everybody can enjoy it, and -- and really feel the\nemotion and identify with the poetry. His article, because he was also a] -- a journalist, were\nreplete with base, evil reasoning, which are a shame. In fact for him, now as you look at him in\nretrospect, and for -- very unpleasant and uncomfortable for Romanian culture, but it\u2019s a fact.\nThis is how -- so however the reputation of his poetry somehow gave more weight to -- to the\nevil political reasoning, and that captured too, a lot of minds. So anti-Semitism has been a -- a\nbig problem in Romania, and Romania is not -- has not expurged even today, yet.",
        "Q: When you were a -- when you before --",
        "A: Despite all the changes which Romania has gone --",
        "Q: Gone through.",
        "A: -- and all the progress --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and now moving to a totally different pass, a democratic pass, anti-Semitism, paradoxically,\ndespite the small number of Jews who are still there, is still visible, yes. Not so widespread,\ncertainly not as of -- official pol -- policy or ideology, definitely not so, but still present.",
        "Q: Okay. When -- when you were a kid, di -- there were special things in school that you liked.\nDo you remember?",
        "A: You have to ask me what school, because --",
        "Q: Okay, which school?",
        "A: -- yes. I started school in 1938.",
        "Q: Right. And you were seven then? Six?",
        "A: Yeah, seven.",
        "Q: Seven, yeah.",
        "A: Seven, yes, seven, exactly seven. But two years later, in 1940, by decree of government, all\nJewish children were expelled from state schools. And therefore I had to go to a Jewish school.\nThe community had to create in a hurry, school for all this mass -- big mass of children who\nwere suddenly all expelled. I -- so my first recollections are from the school where I went\ntogether with other children.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: All kind of children, like any school in my district. From that school I have very good\nmemories too, about little kids. I felt good, I didn\u2019t feel bad in the school, on the contrary. But I\nhave one scene. We had the most beloved teacher we had -- we had two teachers. In elementary\nschool you don\u2019t have many teachers. One was particularly loved by everybody. And we didn\u2019t\nknow why, but in a -- one good day, a gang of people with green shirts, leather bands, and came\nand simply pulled him out of the classroom, beat him in front of us, and turned and pull him\naway and we are left without our teacher. It was -- this was Iron Guard, as I learned afterwards.\nHe apparently was a democrat. I don\u2019t know what his political -- I didn\u2019t know what that political\nal-allegiance. And they knew of that. And he was a very good teacher, that\u2019s the only thing I\nknew, but they did not hesitate to come and pull him and beat him in front of the children and\ntook him away. And I never saw him --",
        "Q: They beat him in the classroom?",
        "A: In the classroom, in front of the children. This was the Iron Guard, thugs.",
        "Q: That must have been really scary.",
        "A: Oh, I -- I don\u2019t forget it, I cannot forget it to this day. I -- I know the name of the teacher was\nMotas, Constantin Motas. I mean, that moment seared him in my memory forever, more than\neven his being a beloved teacher -- beloved teacher. Could have remembered him anyway, or\nforgotten him, but that made him unforgettable to me. And the Iron Guard persecuted a lot of\nRomanian intellectuals. In fact, the Iron Guard, which was the Fascist party, the Nazi party of\nRomania, even killed the -- the most -- the highest reputed scholars of Romania, the -- a scholar\nof international reputation, who was an historian, Byzantineologist, history of Byzanthe --\nByzantine Empire. And he was a democrat, a liberal, western oriented, French oriented, not\nGerman and Nazi oriented. They knew of that. He was also a politician. They simply pulled him\nout, and -- one night from his house when they were fighting for power, took him in a forest near\nBucharest and shot him to death. It was a uproar in the entire country and in -- in the world,\nbecause he was highly respected scholar internationally. So the fact that they pulled an\nelementary school teacher was not -- as I learned more, was not an isolated event. They were\nfighting the democrats in the -- in Romania. And not only the Jews.",
        "Q: Right. And what was his name, that scholar?",
        "A: That scholar was Nikolai Iorga, Iorga.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I-o-r-g-a.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When you went home after seeing your teacher beaten, did you talk to your parents about\nthat?",
        "A: Yes, of course.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I was scared --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- tha -- everybody ask what happened, and I told them, and the mother didn\u2019t know at first\nwhat happened, but then she understood, and a few days we didn\u2019t go to school, we didn\u2019t have a\nteacher. And when -- and then we had somebody, but I never saw him again. I don\u2019t know what\nhappened to him. I really don\u2019t know. I tried asking --",
        "Q: But you have ne -- never found out?",
        "A: Never found out. And that\u2019s all I knew about his name, but [indecipherable] hear laters on,\nbut no, I didn\u2019t. He did not reappear to the school, and next year I -- I went to another school,\ncloser to home. As a matter of fact, the other school I was registered for my second class was the\nschool of a monastery which was close to us. They had a school, and their name was Trei Ierarhi,\nwhich exists still in Miaj. Beautiful church, nicely painted. And they also had the school, 1t was\nnot a confessional school, it was a, you know, secular school, but it was on the grounds of that\nand because it was close, I was given there, registered there, and I learned there. My mother --\nmy parents were not, you know, how to say, so closed [indecipherable] oriented to give me only\n-- and to register me only on -- on a Jewish school. But I -- I was there part of the year and then I\nwas expelled. So --",
        "Q: And you were expelled in 1940, or 1939?",
        "A: 1940 --",
        "Q: 1940.",
        "A: 1940, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So, after the attack on Poland?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u00b039.",
        "A: That was in \u201939, yes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The -- when the law came, I don\u2019t recall exactly when the law for expelling the children came\nback, it was a state law.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The good thing about that, because it was a good thing in -- in -- which I didn\u2019t realize at that\ntime, of course, the community mobilized itself to create schools, and created schools in\nsynagogues. And when I resumed school, which was one year later because it was also the -- the\npogrom and the massacres started, the war started, and I lost a si -- a year, I went on the last to\nthe improvised school to finish my education. And what was a good thing is that not only the\nchildren who are expelled, but all the Jewish teachers were expelled from all the state schools.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: So the community had a good supply of very good teachers, and they were very good teacher,\nmaybe among the best. So we -- we had, all of a sudden, a very good complement of teachers in\nthose improvised schools in synagogues. So th -- they were not only the only good teachers. As I\nsaid, my teacher, the Motas was not Jewish, clearly was a good teacher himself, very good, I\nloved him. But then we had, and I realized later on how good my teachers were, because I\ncontinued in -- you know, beyond elementary school. And I realized they were all one and one.\nAs a matter of fact, when things changed in Romania after the war, some of those people who\ntaught elementary school or high school kids, turned out to be, in fact, scholars of high capacity\nin Romania, mathematicians who were recognized immediately and made into university\nprofessors. Yes, yes, immediately after the war.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Including Minyash, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember your parents talking about Nazis, talking about Iron Guards? Because Iasi\nbecomes, when Antonescu takes power, Iasi is considered the capital of the Iron Guard, which\nsounds really ominous.",
        "A: Yeah, it was -- of course a topic of discussion. We didn\u2019t call them all the time the Iron\nGuard, in Romania this is Garda de Fier. But they called -- called them the Legionari,\nlegionnaires. And it was a full -- how to -- how to protect ourselves from them, how to avoid\nthem. I -- we knew where there was the building where they had their headquarters. It was, as a\nmatter of fact, not far from our house, on a major street of Iasi, which was called Stefan cel\nMare, which is, you know, the name of a Romanian king. And this is where they had their\nheadquarters, and of course called cuibue, the nest of legionnaires. And I tried always to not\nwalk on that side of the street.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: To walk on the other side. Other times, later, when they were defeated by Antonescu, it still\nremained a building with all kind of political -- with -- and there was a flag hanging on there,\nincluding this flag with a swastika. I -- anyway. This -- yes, of course. So the answer to your\nquestion is the discussion we were aware of the [indecipherable] were aware of their campaign.\nIt was a matter of parents training children to not go on that street, to pass away, to avoid them,\nto not look into their eyes, to -- when you see, if you can turn around, go turn around. If you\ncannot go on the other side of the sidewalk and avoid them because they can hit you again. As it\nhappened, I mean it happened to me, I was beaten -- beaten up, but you know, the -- the\ndiscussion was constant. We were aware, it was -- as we came closer and closer to the war, and\nas I became more and more conscious, that was a per -- constant concern.",
        "Q: Were you conscious in 1939 of the attack on Poland at the time, or was it --",
        "A: My father was talking politics all the time --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- So we knew that the war started. When I really became conscious of that was when the\nstream of Jewish refugees from Poland came down south and went through -- came through\nRomania, and some of them tried to move further to the seaside to leave for Palestine. But some\nstayed in Iasi, and -- and created synagogues and Hassidim or Hassidim, and my father -- and a\nlot of them, I mean we knew it was convoys of refugees coming from Poland. Romania was not\nyet in war at that time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That was \u201939. And my father took me to one of those Hassidim\u2019s synagogue [indecipherable]\nthe rabbi and -- and I remember that visit because they prayed and then afterward they sang, and\nthey started to dance. It was probably holiday, with a tune which I remember for years. I will not\nproduce it now to you, but I remember the tune, I think I still remember it.",
        "Q: Can you try?",
        "A: I probably can, but it\u2019s on video, so anyway -- but it was with -- was oh, you know, ta, ta ron,\nton, ton-ton. It was a real nice tune, and at certain time it has -- it turn around and you start it\nagain and start it again, and every time faster. And it was nice.",
        "Q: And you liked that.",
        "A: Yeah. I did like it, yes, I liked it.",
        "Q: Do you think -- I know you -- you probably didn\u2019t know it at the time but maybe your mother\ntold you after the war, did they talk about leaving, or was that not a possibility?",
        "A: Yes, they did. The -- as I told you, the my -- my mother was Russian -- well, I mean, not\nRussian, w-was educated in -- her childhood in Russia, so she knew Russian literature very well.\nAs a matter of fact, later on in life, she had to make a living out of her knowledge of Russian and\nof Russian literature and Russian language, so she took a second degree in -- in the 50\u2019s in\nRomania and became a teacher before my father ma -- was already in and didn\u2019t have a job and\nshe had to sustain the family. And wi -- she went back to -- to school at the university and\nstudied for four years. I mean part time, but took all the exams, because she already had a -- a\ndiploma, university diploma, and became a qualified teacher of Russian, and knew a li -- Russian\nliterature. So her friends -- there were a number of friends who were, you know, who thought\nthat everything in Russia 1s fine, and considered living in Russia. Some considered leaving for\nPalestine, other for Russia. So discussion about -- some, in fact, left for Russia, unfortunately. In\n1940 when -- when Russia took that part back, with Hitler\u2019s support, the people who were born\nin Russia had permission by law from Romanian authorities to emigrate in Russia. And some of\nmy parent\u2019s friend did, and lost their life soon thereafter, and after everything. So they discussed,\nI mean, other friends of my family, the family Gluckman, also the lady was a classmate of my\nmother, and a good friend. They also considered, but they decided to leave for Palestine. And\nthey did, and they were so smart. They left, they escaped the life, and my good friend, childhood\nfriend Irma left with them, and grew in Palestine, then in Israel, was trained there. Then went to\ntea -- to study at Berkley, and became an economist. And years later, when both her parents,\nwhom my mother retrieved by correspondence after the war, they reestablished contact, but both\ndied and my mother lost contact again. In 1970, by -- absolute by miracle, when I was, for the\nfirst time invited to the United State, to that think tank at Stanford for my -- because I wa -- the\n[indecipherable] Romania arriving there the first day, the second day, I was told there is a\nRomanian lady scholar, an American -- sorry, an American scholar who was born in Romania,\nwho is also the same roster of fellows. And do you want to meet her? Why not? So she came, she\nintroduce her, she told me her name Irma Adelman, I told her my name, we started to discuss,\nand she said she is from Romania, childhood and so on. And that started triggering my memory.\nI said, \u201cAr -- Irma, you said Irma, right?\u201d \u201cYes, Irma.\u201d \u201cBy any chance, could it be possible that\nyour maiden name was Gluckman?\u201d I mean, she was dumbfounded. It was like stricken by -- it\nwas my actual first day in the Center for Behavioral -- Advanced Studies and Behavioral\nSciences. The highest reputed think tank for social scientists in the U.S., she was there a fellow. I\narrived much later because the Romanian government would not allow me to go in time, and it\u2019s\nanother story. But in the first time -- day of meeting -- telling her, she said, \u201c[indecipherable]\nhow do you guess that?\u201d \u201cSo I said, if you are that, I am your childhood playmate. Do you\nremember the name of Musi? Musi Catz?\u201d She looked, \u201cYes, of course I remember.\u201d And -- and\nthis 1s how I [indecipherable]",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah. And -- and she is one of the foremost economists of the United States, I mean, is\nextraordinarily accomplished in her field, yes.",
        "Q: Right, right. We\u2019re going to have to change the tape.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: Okay. Michael, what was the statistical possibility here of the two --",
        "A: Well, you know, the -- Irma\u2019s husband was a ph -- ma -- physicist, and -- who took the year\noff to accompany her to the think tank, to the center. And everybody was so stunned. And he\nthought to calculate the statistical chance, likelihood, in fact for us to meet after so many years,\nwith names changed, and factor in also the fact that it\u2019s different country, different profession,\nshe\u2019s an economist, I\u2019m a sociologist, and that that think tank has a pattern of one year roster, so\nwe could have been on two different years and just go like the stars in the night and never met --\nmeet again. And he calculated statistical probability of that to actually happen, and he came up\nwith a number like that, and show it to everybody, so all -- there are a lot of scholars there, and\neverybody was amazed on that. So all of a sudden from my second day I became a -- a cause\ncelebrity.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: All -- but it was also good because I was coming at that time from Romania, the -- the\nmanagers of the center knew me. Some of the people who knew my work and invited me knew,\nbut all the others didn\u2019t know anything and -- and knew that I\u2019m coming from Romania, who am\nI?",

        "A: -- who -- who vouched for my family, for who -- Iam where I\u2019m coming from, so I felt all of\na sudden so well in that center. That year in the center was a marvelous year, and influenced the -\n- the rest of my life, Joan, for all my work subsequently in the States, yes.",
        "Q: Well let\u2019s go back now.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: 1940 is a very pivotal year in -- in Romania, and I don\u2019t -- Antonescu takes over, he signs an\nagreement with the Germans and by 1941 he\u2019s going to be part -- Romania will be part --",
        "A: Yes, right, yes, yeah.",
        "Q: -- of the attack on Russia. Do you feel this as a kid? As -- 1940 is there -- is there a big\nchange as you see it, or not?",
        "A: I -- what I recall from 1940 is that shift from the -- the fact that I was expelled from the\nschool, and that my father lost his job suddenly, and he wouldn\u2019t go any more to -- he -- he was\nan engineer in a textile factory. And all of a sudden he would be at home, and not go to his work.\nSo --",
        "Q: And was that because of the anti-Semitic legislation that came up in 1940?",
        "A: Yeah, that was, yes, exactly.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. The other thing, not immediately after, but the end of \u201940 - \u201941, they were\nclearly more military in tone. So this what I remember. That was -- he was very grim, kind of\nheavy, and we were increasingly worried about what might happen, what might happen. In\nRomania there is a, I would say [indecipherable] fear really, it was a -- the epitome of worrying,\nwhat can the future bring us. And this what I recall. Nothing else, but this 1s --",

        "A: -- describes to you the atmosphere.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- speculate, but I -- I have no recollection of that, and I don\u2019t think anybody at that time was\naware or -- or could anticipate what was likely to happen.",
        "Q: Now, when your father\u2019s off of work, 1s your mother still working?",
        "A: My mother wasn\u2019t working, she was a -- she was a pharmacist by training, but she worked\nvery little in the beginning of her -- after 1 -- after the marriage, her marriage [indecipherable] but\nthen she didn\u2019t practice pharmacy.",
        "Q: I see, I see.",
        "A: So she was, you know, keeping the house and my father was making an income. When --\nwhen he lost the job, there was no context in which she could found -- find work. Had she been\nemployed she would have been eliminated as well, so no. And my father quickly had to make\nsome living and what they did was to transform the front room of our house with the exit -- with\nthe entrance, into a store. And to have a number of shelves built. And my father bought a few\npieces of textiles, you know, to sell. But that was an improvisation because our home was not in\na commercial district, nobody would come there. In addition our home was somewhere in the\nmiddle of a courtyard, it was not at the street. So nobody could see it, all passersby on the street\nwouldn\u2019t no -- see nothing, just a big gate and the entrance to a big courtyard. So we had that in\nthe front and he will go in the -- the commercial center, talk to one merchant, to another and then\npossibly from time to time bring somebody, pull somebody to our home. And that was always an\nevent. So what happened, would he buy anything? And he became an intermediary in a way\nbetween people who had various textiles. He was a specialist engineer, he had more knowledge\nabout those fabrics than the usual merchants of them, and how they are produced. And he would\nintermediate buying and selling because the commercial quarter still was alive, those people\nwere not expelled, they were their own shops, and Iasi was a big city and there were a lot of\npeople coming and buying their textiles, their, you know, clothes. By that time they were not\nready made clothes, and they would buy everything from cotton for shirts to -- to fabric for -- for\ntrousers, to heavy coats and so on. So that was a very lively area. I know it because when I\nstarted to go through to school, I had always to cross that street, that long street, which was\ncalled Colonel Langa. So I know, and even before that, my father would take me sometimes and\nkeep me by hand and we go from shop to shop and he will ask, do you need that, do you need\nthat, you know? There is somebody who has such a thing, would you like to buy? He carried\nsome kind of briefcase with samples, simply to make a living, because by having a small\ncommission from mediating a sale, he would get a small commission, and that was a livelihood.",
        "Q: And were you okay, I mean can you -- could your parents afford the rent?",
        "A: No, there was -- th-th-there -- there was strain at that time, there was [indecipherable] you\nknow, the -- there\u2019s a concept in Yiddish, parnasa, which means making a livelihood, you know.\nTh-There I learned that term, and that is a cen -- there was, at least at that time, a center concept\nin -- in the effis of -- of Jews, and whether they were able to make a living or not, because it was\na matter of -- of making a living. So, do you have a parnasa, what\u2019s your parnasa, you know.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Good parnasa, and it\u2019s like that.",

        "Q: So that added a burden in a way, I would --",
        "A: It -- very much.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The moment was not the best choosing by my parents, but it happened, yes, yes. In \u201938 the\nsituation was different in Romania. So, he was born in \u201939, and you know, was not aware of what\nwas around him except he does remember, I -- I checked to him, as it happens he is visiting with\nus this very week, so I checked him and he has this -- th -- the -- even at two years, he\nremembers the pogrom and what happened to him at that time. But nothing else. However, I -- I\nknow that he didn\u2019t have good years 1n his childhood. The war, the first years were --",
        "Q: His is the whole childhood, I suppose.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. But the whole, he was -- you know, the end of the war was in \u00b045, and then the\nsituation started to improve. And he was -- at that time he was six, so it was better times. But the\nfirst six year were really bad, really bad. So.",
        "Q: Do you remember the attack on Russia? Was there an announcement that the Romanian army\nis going to --",
        "A: Yes, there was an announcement, yes, yes, yeah, yeah, there was a big announcement, very\ndramatic announcement of Marshall -- Marshall Antonescu, was broadcast all over when it\nhappened, on the radio, on the, you know, public speakers and so on, everybody heard it, and the\nwar started, the -- before that, the town was already full of military, 1t was obvious to everybody,\nimminent that something will start sooner or later because the city of Iasi was at 19 kilometers,\nwhich is equivalent of about 11 miles from the border with Bessarabia, which by now was\nRussia already. And when you have so much might, army in town, the Romanian and German,\nyou don\u2019t have to be too smart to -- to know that something will happen. So then he said the\nfamous four words, \u201cVa ordon treceti Prutul!\u201d Which means, you are or -- I order you, cross the\nPrutul, the river, which is the border. That remained in -- in the Romanian folklore, almost as a --\nas a prototype of a dramatic order. It\u2019s -- that I remember, that I remember.",
        "Q: Do you remember his signing the agreement with Italy and Germany, bef -- before this, this is\na -- I don\u2019t think -- I think it\u2019s November of 1940.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Was there as big an --",
        "A: There was -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember knowing at the time how things happened.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That there was an agreement between Germany, and imposed in Romania because Romania,\nalthough was gravitating to the Germans, moving away from the traditional allegiances to the --\nto France and to England, to the western Europe, and moving to the Germans, it was a process.\nBut I was not aware of the politics or the process, but I was aware when that big thing happened\nat Bessarabia was moving back to [indecipherable] then when Transylvania was lost, also by\nHitler\u2019s dictate, everybody talked about that. You know, the Romanian map became so distorted\nby that, totally different from -- from a round piece to something which looked like a big\nparenthesis.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Shaved on the east, shorn of a big piece all the way to the heart of the country, given away to\nanother country, to Hungary, so -- so everybody -- it was a national trauma at that time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So I knew that something very bad happened. I didn\u2019t know the mechanics, the politics of it.",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: But now, very few days after the attack on Russia --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- there\u2019s something that\u2019s going to start in Iasi which is extremely shocking.",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "Q: So tal-talk about what it is you remember as a kid.",
        "A: Iremember there was -- the Iasi -- the ci -- the city was f -- the city was full -- [phone ringing]",
        "Q: Is that you?",
        "A: Yes, I have right here.",
        "Q: All right, we were going to -- you were going to start to talk about what you remember about\nthe pogrom, which happened days after the attack on Russia.",
        "A: Yes, well we were in our home, I mean all of us at home, the war started and everybody was\nfrightened to death. There was some bombing on -- on the town in the first week of the war. N-\nNo big damage, I mean no damage at all in our area. They might have fallen some other places,\nbut as I recall, the newspapers didn\u2019t report any major damage from those bombing done by the\nRussians. However, those bombing were used as one of the pretexts to justify what became the --\nthat -- the pogrom, the massacre of the Jews of Iasi. Just one week after the war started, it was a\nSunday, it was -- the war started on June 22\", that was June 29\", we were on the house and we\nsaw that there are columns of people moving on the street. We saw -- we had a view through the\ngate of the courtyard into the street, and you could see a narrow corner. We saw they were\nmoving, we didn\u2019t know were [indecipherable] but they recognize there were Jewish people in\nthose columns, so we understood that something bad happened, and we\u2019re all kind of huddled.\nAnd sure enough, very soon, a group of individuals came in. There\u2019s some military, some police,\nsome civilians, started knocking this first -- go -- a couple of them, two, three, went to each one\nof the houses in the courtyard, and they started knocking the door, came to us, entered the house,\nopened -- pulled the door, entered the house and said, \u201cOut, out, all Jews out, all Jews out.\u201d And\nviolently pulling everybody from -- from the house away. This is when -- a moment which is\nremembered even by my brother, happened, as I mentioned before, in our house lived both\ngrandmother\u2019s. My grandmother on my mother\u2019s side, was a short woman, rather heavy woman,\nand very religious, if I said that, really she was a -- a bearer of religion, she imposed on my\nmother to be very kosher for her, nothing was kosher enough, nothing, nothing. And she had\nspeaking [indecipherable] she would berate my mother often for -- for -- this is relevant, [Il tell\nyou why it is relevant, for not being kosher enough. So she was heavy, she was ill, and she was\nlaying in bed, really laying in bed. And they were pull -- and they saw that woman is laying 1n --\nin bed. So they say, \u201cOut, come out.\u201d She barely spoke Romanian, but she wasn\u2019t able to move.\nSo -- so one of them, very angry, went and -- and caught her by the hair and pulled. And there\nthe hair came off. Because she was wearing a wig as a very, very Orthodox woman. And the guy\nwa -- and the guy said -- and -- and this is what my -- my brother remembered because he was\ntwo years, and sh -- he told me, down in there, he was so scared, saying that he -- he pulled all\nher hair. And -- and you know, my father was begging and praying, she\u2019s ill, she\u2019s very heavy,\nshe\u2019s very old, please, please forgive her, let her be there, she cannot move. They tried to pull\nher, but she was too heavy. And they realize that she will be unable to move into the column, so\nthey left her in the bed, and pulled us, all of us. Fortunately they didn\u2019t shoot her on the spot, but\nthis is why it was relevant that she was very Orthodox, and -- and we were pulled, put in the\ncolumns, and then the column started moving, slowly, slowly, because it was s-s-stopping at\nevery next courtyard, and waiting for the Jews of that courtyard to be pulled. And the next\ncourtyard was -- a friend of mine was living, a very good friend, Nuni Steinberg, who -- his\nfamily was pulled and -- and brought in our back, and put into the column. And so it was until\nthe -- our entire street, that was street Colonel Langa, on which we lived, came to the main street.\nThe main street had been already combed by prior groups, so once we got to the main street, we\nsimply marched, were marched further, we didn\u2019t have to stop because from the main street on,\nthe place were already judenrein.",
        "Q: They had already shot Jews?",
        "A: No, they sh -- cha --",
        "Q: Oh, they just moved them?",
        "A: Shot, or -- or moved them. Not all shot on the -- they -- so we moved. But with us was my\nbrother. We had all to -- to go with hands up when we moved. When we stayed, they allowed us\nto keep the hands down, but when we moved, we had to -- and my brother was two years old, so\nhe couldn\u2019t move, a child of two years, so my father put him on his shoulders. And my father\nwas supposed to keep I -- hi -- hands up, and they little boy keep -- kept. And I remember him, I\n-- that image I see him, and he remembers, si -- was staying on his father\u2019s shoulders with his\nhands up, like everybody else in the column.",
        "Q: So he was sitting on his shoulders with the legs down on --",
        "A: Legs, right, right, yes --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The legs here, and --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] and with his little --",
        "Q: With his hands up.",
        "A: -- little hands up. And this is how we were marched. Then as we were marched, they saw\ncorpses on the street, and we --",
        "Q: You did see corpses?",
        "A: Yeah, we did see corpses on the street here and there, kind of people who obviously didn\u2019t\nmove, dead or -- or mortally wounded, who knew, were -- we -- er -- people in the column were\nbeaten, I mean they were forcibly marched, screamed at. People screamed from the sidewalks\nwho were not in the columns, [indecipherable] the inhabitants, insults and so on, and were\nmoved there, and whoever was old was pushed, and you know, there -- the rifle, the butt of the\nrifle pushed and -- and hurried to advance faster. As a -- and we were shepherded toward the\nheadquarters of the police in Iasi. As we approached that -- that place, we noticed there were\ncolumns coming from different other directions, cause you had to pass a -- a square, a big square\nand that was on the other side of the square. So we -- really that happened from all parts, and\nthere were -- so the streets were full with columns. There was a -- a -- a lot of people, a crowd\nwas on front of the big gate of the -- which was a big metal gate, a wooden gate, but closed, you\ncouldn\u2019t see inside the courtyard, but part of the gate was opened. So when we were brought in,\nour turn came, then they will be the triage, the selection. They kept all the men and the grown up\nboys, and sent women back with children. And as we arrived there, they pulled my father in, and\nthey waved us all back. I was at that time, in \u00b041, was -- was I --",
        "Q: 10.",
        "A: -- nine and a half -- yes 10, almost 10, but I was a small kid at that time. Now I am taller, but I\nstarted to gr -- grow after 13, I had a tonsils operate and started to grow fast, but as a child I was\na very small child, so at 10 I was still small. Other children, I mean boys of 13 - 14 - 15, some\nwere sent back, some were kept. Then my father disappeared through the gate. I -- we didn\u2019t see\nwhat happened to him. Later -- later I -- I learned what happened to him, and we were sent back.\nAt that time my father passed my brother to my mother, and we were hurrying back. The coming\nback, in small groups not in column, was a real scare, enormous scare, and hellish because we\nwere not in a column, only a small group. Everybody who was not Jewish knew what happened,\nand so, and there were people beating my mother, and my grandmother, who was with us. And\nmy mother would -- would embrace Zolly, my brothers, and screaming all the time, copilul,\ncopilul, please, we\u2019re all c-copilul, protecting him. And I started to protect him too. And my\nhands was -- were beaten by, you know, the -- you -- sticks, and --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and -- and we are running and my poor grandmother was running with us. So we made it\nalmost -- so this was really -- there -- by that time there were more corpses, I remember seeing\nmore corpses laying on the streets, and blood here and there. And as we came close to our home,\nanother gang of people stopped us all and collected us again, and said, \u201cWo -- how do you go?\nWhere do you go, home? No, no, no, you should go to the police.\u201d And -- and stopped and\nstarted to collect all the people who were coming back, who were only women and children, or\nelderly people, not men, including some other people from our courtyard. A family called\nZilberman, with two girls older than I, Lidia and Mia, whom I knew very well, but they also\nstopped there [indecipherable]. And then the women started to beg and to pray, say, \u201cWe were at\nthe police, please allow us to go home. They released us from the police.\u201d \u201cNo, no, no, you are\nlying, you are escape. We\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d So they -- they made like they were about to shoot\npeople, say, \u201cYou stand to the wall.\u2019 And then somebody came and say, \u201cLeave them, let them\ngo.\u201d And all of a sudden they were let go. We were already close to home, so we ran home. And\nthat happened to the family, that Zilberman family, and that other, but with all the men. In our\nhouse, in our courtyard there was another family, Barad, who was also a -- a merchant, and with\na family lived there, and they had three sons. And it was only the lady who was released, and the\ntwo smaller sons, children. The father and the elderly son was retained, like my father. Well,\nwhat happened -- and I learned later, to my father, to everybody who was pulled there, was that\nthey had to move through a -- I would say the gauntlet of people, you know, two rows of people,\nsoldiers, policemens, [indecipherable] people with iron bars, with rubber truncheons, simply beat\nthem with rifles, beat them bloody, then stepped on them. And they were forced to -- to pass\nthrough that, and to run, and move, move, move, while beating. Some fell, were trampled, others\nwere hit. My father were -- was badly hit, and they ran, and in the back of the courtyard,\nthousands of people were already gathered. So they gathered the crowd. That I learned later. At\nhome my mother was scared and concerned to death and said, \u201cWhat will happen to Tata?\u201d And\nwhat they believed, they are still very naive, is that they are rounding up the Jews to send them to\nlabor camp as labor. And she said, \u201cBut he left with nothing, I mean, with the clothes on him. Let\nme make something and see what I,\u201d -- she was, as I told you, she was extraordinarily -- very\ncourageous. She got in front of the mirror, dress herself with her best clothes [indecipherable |\neverything, put lipstick -- she was very pretty woman -- to look as elegant as possible, not Jewish\nat all. Made the bundle, a little -- with a -- with shirt, with a -- some -- some towels, soap, some\nmedication, maybe a little package, to take and get to the police to be able to pass on to her\nhusband so he has something where he is deported to a labor camp, because he didn\u2019t have a\nshirt, nothing. And prepare them, you know, we are afraid and my grandmother say don\u2019t go, her\nmother say don\u2019t go, don\u2019t go. She would say, \u201cNo, I have to go, I have to go. Nobody will\nrecognize me, I will try to do, you know, and if then they will beat me, they will send me back,\nthey retain only -- but I have to go, I cannot leave him.\u201d And she was just about to go when my\nfather appeared to the door. Bloodied, beaten, but appeared at the door of the house. What\nhappened there?",
        "Q: Well, I think we have -- let\u2019s wait til the next tape, and you\u2019ll tell us what happened.",
        "A: Yeah, okay, yeah.",
        "Q: Cause we\u2019re right at the end of this tape.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: Michael, I\u2019m sorry about the interruption.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: We were -- we ended where your f -- your mother was going to try and go see your father and\ngive him something.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: But sh -- he came back.",
        "A: Yeah, she was ready with a little package, and bundle to -- to take, and he came back and --\nbeaten, full of blood here and limping. And he make -- and he kind of fell into the house and\npush her back, and say, \u201cStay, stay, don\u2019t go.\u201d \u201cWh-What is happening?\u201d He was shocked to see\nher so elegantly dressed, but she -- what happened at the police, the police had a big courtyard,\nbut as time passed, I mean, they start in effect the rounding up of Jews not only the 29\", but on\nthe 28\" in the evening, as I learned later -- we had no way of knowing, but later I learned that in\nfact on the 28\" of th-the -- the -- of June, they also killed a lot of people in their homes and in\ntheir houses. In the 29\" in the morning they were surrounding, and also killing, but 0 --\noccasionally killing, mostly bringing them to the police. So as they brought column after column\nand -- and selected only the men, even the men were too many for the courtyard. So the\ncourtyard became full brim -- full to the brim, they couldn\u2019t push any more people in that. So\npeople -- the column kept going -- they accumulated in front of the -- so something happened\nthat they brought -- my father described that exactly. They pushed some -- brought a table, two\nchairs and two Romanians officers, with a paper and a stamp, and making a list, and s -- started\nto call people come. And whoever was in the front row started to move one by one. Say name,\naddress and giving them a piece of paper, take it, with a stamp, that say he can go. Lieber, it was\nwritten in that. And that gave them the permission to go out of the -- so, going out was another\ndifficult moment, they had to run because again were the beaters there. And people started to be\nfreed from the -- the police to create room for others to enter. And that apparently lasted for\nsome time. My father saw that, he tried to be in the front, push himself, ran [indecipherable] and\nwas beaten down and got up and got -- he was on the side come -- as I said, you know, and\nfinally he got the line to go and got the thing and came out. This is very relevant because as we\nalso learned later from other people and the survivors, after awhile of giving those tickets to\nmany people, not just to a few, to many, creating room, some German officers appeared there.\nThey had a discussion with the Romanian officer, and they stopped giving out those things. From\nthat moment they wouldn\u2019t give any more. Those who got it, got it. That accredited idea, that\nthose who got the ticket and gave the address were kind of hereby enlisted for the future\ncollection for labor camp, or maybe they thought of deporting them, who knows? But -- but the\nothers who are -- in the meantime, the day was over, s -- dark started to -- to come down, and the\ncolumns stopped too. And that -- that I haven\u2019t seen, but I know from the stories. And my father\nwas home, this is how my father was home. I am telling my family story, not what happened, but\nI explain how he got home. So when he got home, my mother told him and they understood\nimmediately, they said, \u201cYou have to hide. Yo -- they have your name, address, they can come\nafter you. You have to hide.\u201d My mother remained -- undressed, dressed again normally. And\nnext to our ho-house in that big courtyard was a kind of -- the land, I cannot say the word in\nEnglish. In Romanian it\u2019s a Ripa. It\u2019s a kind of little valley with some stream and a little small\nlake, I mean [indecipherable] in the bottom. And that little valley had kind of this undulation\ngoing down, with a -- we used always in winter that valley this way to put our -- how do you call\nthat? Sleighs.",
        "Q: Sleighs?",
        "A: Sleighs, yes. And to go down, and every time we go here, jump, and they caught, you know,\nlots of speed and it was fun and the whole thing was to get down in high speed and to avoid the\nlittle water, the little lake where the -- otherwise you fall on your face.",
        "Q: [inaudible]",
        "A: And it was -- this is what I -- I learned my mastery 1n conducting the sleighs. And it was very\nfun, and in the winter there was nothing but this -- this tops from the corn which was growing. In\nsummer, however, that was all cultivated, it was fertile land, with corn. So the corn in June was\nalready tall. So where could my father fall -- the -- my mother made some food for him, a piece\nof clothes to lay on the ground, and he immediately disappeared into the corn, because the corn\ntall, you know, and big and -- and have a -- and disappeared and didn\u2019t see anything, and stayed\nthere, hidden. And we were in the house. Indeed the nay -- night came, my father didn\u2019t come\nback, he was hidden there, and sure enough during the night, we hear again beatings. I don\u2019t\nknow whether my mother slept or not, I sure did. And we heard heavy beatings, and then\nscreams, th-the door was already kind of barricaded and strong, but we were afraid, we couldn\u2019t\nresist, so immediately my mother called us. We were dressed. We were asleep, but I was dressed,\nand my brother was dressed. And again my -- my grandmother was in bed, but the other was\nmobile. And while they were beating in the front door, we exited through the back door.",
        "Q: Oh, when you say beating, you mean they were hitting the front --",
        "A: Hitting, yes, sorry.",
        "Q: -- hitting the front door, uh-huh.",
        "A: La -- ra -- yeah, beating the door.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Beating the door at that time.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Trying to enter, and we heard immediately there were a big noise and they were beating the\ndoor, hitting the door and screaming, open, open, open. So we immediately -- what is? And we\nwent down to the back of the house, which also had a door, looked [indecipherable] looked,\nnobody was there out of the group of the front, so we ran away through the back. And we ran to\nthe back of the yard where there was that single Romanian family in the -- in the courtyard, who\nwas Mihaescu, Mihaescu -- Mihaescu something. When I had my playmate, that girl, Coca. They\nwere not very friendly with my mother and my father, generally speaking, not very pleasant, but\nthey sheltered us. So they were a bit -- you know, now they\u2019d be really rewarded for that. But\nthey received us and we hid there. And we wouldn\u2019t know what happened in the house. We were\nsure that my father hears the noise, because if -- he was in the corn, but not far, and hope he will\nnot come out and they will not find him. And we stayed the whole morning, and in the morning\nmy mother went first -- sent the neighbor and then went first, and found indeed the house -- the\nhouse -- the -- the front door was badly damaged, but they didn\u2019t break in.",
        "Q: Oh, they didn\u2019t?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t break in and the -- they found the house. And then, slowly, we came back, and\nthen my mother went onto the corn with more food to find my father. And she found him, with\nMarcu, Marcu, you know, s-slowly, she [indecipherable] found him, he heard all -- sh -- he was\nvery happy hearing that everybody is fine. He kind of understood because those people could be\noverheard as they spoke, and -- and cursed, you know, that they didn\u2019t catch us. He imagine what\nhad happened. In short, he stayed there for three days and three nights. And my mother would go\nand bring him food and water and come back, and he would not come back into the house for the\nfear that they will come again and -- and pick up the men, or the people, whatever. So he slept on\n-- on the -- the ground because of cour -- and on the fourth day he first came o -- in the meantime\nwe started to learn through voices and people that a lot of people didn\u2019t come back. In our\ncourtyard some came back, but others didn\u2019t. In the family Barad, which I believe I mentioned,\nonly the woman with two children came back, the man was -- and he didn\u2019t ex -- ec -- access the\n-- the point to where they got the ticket. And I learned that a lot of people were killed in the\ncourtyard of the police, and that others were taken to -- to the train station. Again, I didn\u2019t know\nwhat happened, train station made it plausible that they were taken to some labor camp\nsomewhere, to be -- as it turned out later, it was not a labor camp, but the -- the -- the si-situation\na bit calmed in the sense that there were not gangs of people roaming the s -- the town to pull out\nthe Jews. There were other things on their agenda because the war was already in the 10\u2019s or\n12\u2019s or 13 days, you know, and the army broke through the Russian row -- armies -- and\nadvanced, and all the news were very happy. The newspapers said, you know, the victory of that,\nand -- and it appeared that the interest in the Romanian Jews faded for the moment, it was felt.\nMy father came, stayed in the house, didn\u2019t go out for months, weeks, I don\u2019t know. Kept me in\nthe house, everybody stay, we -- the -- they exchanged food between neighbors. It was very, very\nlittle food; water we had. And this is how we passed the time after the thing. Then, only later on,\nwe started news to percolate, or at least for me to learn that in the -- what happened, that people\nwere put in the trains. And these were the famous death trains of Iasi, which became, you know,\nthe equivalent of Nazi chambers on the wheels. There were box cars stuffed with Jews to the\nbrim, cars which normally couldn\u2019t take anything else but -- but, you know, bags and sacks and -\n- and freight. People were like sardines in a box, 150 - 200, I don\u2019t know, but it was full. And all\nthe boxcars were filled, and then they sealed the boxcars so the doors cannot be opened, and\nthere is no air, and the train started to move and to go in a direction nobody was told. But in fact,\nthey didn\u2019t go anywhere. It was moving between stations. If you ask me why it was moving, I\ndon\u2019t know whether they didn\u2019t know where to go or whether one pulled -- I mean the -- the --\nth-the -- there were soldiers on the train guarding those things, or whether they intentionally did\nthat back and forth to kill the people in the [indecipherable]. But with no food, with no water,\npeople started to scream and -- and die, in fact, and -- and were horrible scenes which were told\nby the survivors after several days, six or seven days, one of the trains reached a far away point,\nafter shuttling far away, but a point which could have re -- be reached in several normal hours of\ntrain, and only a few of the people still were alive and were taken out. Another, second train, was\nin fact never moved farther away, they were shuttling between very close places. No, because it\nwas -- people were screaming all the time, and they were stopping in stations, the soldiers\nwanted to stop to do their things, they also realized that people dead -- there were dead people,\nan-and they opened the door, and asked the people from the boxcar to throw out people who\nwere dead. And they brought and throw them on the pavement. And they -- the -- those who\nwere all right were not allowed to -- to come out, wa -- and they left on the pavement, sealed the\ndoors again and the train left. Those who were there -- in some places there were some Jews in\nthose little towns. Not in all, because before the war, the Jews from the smallest places were\nforcibly relocated in the bigger towns. Was a political design in -- in fact. But this what\nhappened, nobody knew at that time why. But 1n some smallest towns there were some Jews who\nwere not on the trains and who were summoned to collect those people, and to bring them in the\ncemetery. In other places, they were simply loaded on horse drawn carts and dumped in the\ncemetery. Were some interesting scenes because as a train like that, screaming, comes and stays,\nand people hear of that, and some of the locals came too. Some cursed, some others tried to help.\nAnd there are -- there are records made by the survivors who testified that some of those who\ncame really wanted to help, and to give them water. Some traded the water and the people in the\nboxcar gave them rings, and gold, and whatever they had on them. Others simply grabbed and\ngive them. One -- I remember that one of those who was reported doing so was recognized by\nYad Vashem as among the Righteous of the People. And her name is there, and he\u2019s -- she\u2019s very\nmuch revered -- revered. Victoria Agarici is her name. She is being described by the survivors by\nsetting the gendarme aside. \u201cI don\u2019t care about you, I need to give water and bread to those\npeople. Beat me if you want.\u201d And she broke through the rows and approached the train and\ngave people water. I mean, it\u2019s a very emotional, but this is the story, and she saved probably the\nlives of some of those people who were -- you know, people drank the urine of other people.\nThere was a hole in the wooden -- in the board, they would struggle among themselves who\ncould put his mouth on that hole to breathe some fresh air from outside. So horrible Dant\u00e9-esque\nscenes inside. And here was a good, honest woman, was willing to fight the police to do what\nshe felt was right, and to give the food and to save other people. So this is what happened. This is\nhow so -- the m -- the majority of the people who were put on the trains died on the tra -- either\ndied on the train, or came out at the arrival point of the first train and died in the next several\nhours. And their numbers, which probably the Holocaust Museum has, about how many exactly\nsurvived, and how many died, because statistics were kept, all -- all those by -- by the killers, and\nthey reported so many corpses, which were [indecipherable] in fact, there is a report which was\ndiscovered in the archives of the -- the special service, security service of Romania, who\napparently organized the massacre of the Jews, about the total number of Jews who were killed.\nThat was a report th-the pride, accomplishment and was reported by numbers, and the document\nexist which reports a -- a -- you know, a scary figure. If you can imagine that 13,100 or 200\npeople in total were killed in those days. And this was a report sent by the local unit of that\nspecial service to their superiors, as an accomplishment. I couldn\u2019t give you my own opinion, I\ndon\u2019t have a number, but I know how many I saw myself. But this is a total number, so they kept\nnumbers also on the people who survived from the trains, and people who were unloaded. But I\ncan again say that I saw in this -- in the 90\u2019s, when I was able again to travel to Romania, and I\ndid travel. I got married in the meantime, here in the States, and I took my wife, who is\nAmerican, and we went through the route of the Moldova, and stopped in all these little t-towns\nuntil we went to Iasi, where I was born and showed her, and then went further. She\u2019s also an\nanthropologist, Ruth Cernea, very interested in the story of my family, and the story of the Jews\nin -- in Romania. She\u2019s -- her field of study is Jewish culture, and the Passover Seder, which --\nshe wrote books on that. No -- well -- very well known anthropologist. And of course was\ninterested herself in seeing what happened. And in those little towns, coming close to Iasi, where\nthe train stopped, we visit cemeteries, and you can see huge graves, collective graves, in which\nthose bodies were dumped, without any identification, nobody knows who was buried where.\nShortly thereafter, the war, those common graves covered, you know, by soil and -- and branches\ngot, you know, stone covers, and immediate after the war, the community, the town put huge\nslabs of concrete. It\u2019s not normal gravestone, but they are -- they are enormously impressive\nbecause you see slabs of concrete covering the collective graves of those killed in the trains,\nwhich are stretching from here all the way to the wall there, one after the other, one after the\nother.",
        "Q: So 20 or 30 feet of --",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: 20 or 30 feet of concrete.",
        "A: There were about even more, seven, eight meters I would say, which yes, exactly 25 feet\nlength. All standard cement, you know, some -- but those are the collective graves, which were\nset immediately after the war -- I mean, the -- the -- the slabs. And historical -- historical paradox\nand irony, and the sociological paradox is that those -- the graves of those killed in those -- in the\nmassacres, are in several cemeteries not far from another corner of the cemetery, which co-\ncontained the graves of people who were killed during the first World War, and in some prior\nwar, which was called the War of Independence, when some Jews were allowed to fight for -- in\nthe army. Still distinguished as Jews, but they\u2019re very willing to fight and proud to fight for the\nindependence of Romania. And then they were buried in the Jewish cemetery, where their\nremains were brought because they were Jews, in -- but the Jewish communities were very proud\nthat part of their community gave their lives in the fight and in the war for Romania\u2019s\nindependence. It was a matter of honor, and the desire to make their contribution to the country\nand identify with the right cause of independence of the country they were living. And that\ncorner of cemetery, the heroes of the independence war, and of the first war is always treasured,\nand kind of honored specifically. And next to it you can see the -- the Jews killed in Romania in\na massacre, in a pogrom which was the -- the premonition of what was to happen in the next year\non a even larger scale to so many other hundreds and thousands of Jews.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So this 1s -- it was -- later when we -- some of the people who remained alive, send messages\nwhere they are, and their families went and contacted, and tried to find out whether their own\nrelatives were among the survivors. One arrived in some wha -- Calarasi. And another, which\nwas farther away, another was in Portleroi which was closer and easier from Iasi to travel there.\nAnd you know, there was an unending waiting, and when people came back, family members,\nand were -- got the news that their father, or their brother, or their son didn\u2019t make it, was killed,\nand others was all right, no, you know, that -- you know, Sroul Abramovitch died. I know for\nsure because he died in front of me. And the other died, and I know when his body was -- was\nthrown down. So they found -- they got the certainty of having lost those people forever. So it\nwas a continuous awareness of that pogrom.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] in some way, because --",
        "A: No, no, I mean the -- the -- the climate the people who disappeared were first deemed alive\nand hopefully will return, because as I said, not only my parents, but others thought that\neventually they are being transpor -- transported to some labor camps. The country was in war,\nthe need for labor was obvious. It was a plausible -- maybe it was wishful thinking, but nobody\ncould imagine that they -- people, live people are being put in train and shuffled from one place\nto the other, without food and wa -- to be killed, or be killed in -- s -- but this happened, so\nawareness seeped in more and more, and the tragedy, and the crying and th-the suffering and the\nfear was -- were prevailing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So it was very hard months and years, and my parents kept me the entire year, inside the -- the\nhouse and would not allow me to go except in the courtyard under supervision, to know all the\ntime what happened to me. No going out on the street. And I was not the only child treated this\nway by their families. So, it was a time of hard oppression, of fear for the -- in the entire\ncommunity. And the awareness of -- of the loss, and of the massacre, which nobody would have\nconceived that. You know, there -- that was not actually the first in Romania, there were\npogroms before, in \u201997 -- 1907, some Jews were killed, there were riots in Romania\n[indecipherable] killed. There was a small pogrom in 1940, apparently done by the military,\nwhich some people learned about it. I did not know about that at that time, I was a kid, but it was\nin Dorohoi. A number of Jews, two or 300 were killed. I read about it later. My parents could\nhave known that it happened in 1940. We all knew, however -- I also knew tha -- about what\nhappened in January in \u201941 before Romania entered the war, when there was the -- not the riot\nbut the attempt to a coup -- coup d\u2019etat that -- the coup by the Iron Guard to grab power, and\nAntonescu was the leader, use the army to -- to squelch that -- that attempt to grab the power, an-\nand defeated the Iron Guard. But during the Iron Guard upraising and attempt, they killed Jews,\nand they killed also Romanian police or Romanian soldiers who fought them. When they took\nthe Romanian soldiers, which were Romanian, they would still kill them. But for the Jews, there\nwas a special treatment. They took the Jews whom they caught, brought them to the town\nslaughterhouse, killed them, and hang their bodies. And the newspapers carried pictures of that.\nThe reason the newspapers carried pictures was bay -- because the newspapers of Antonescu,\nwho fought the Iron Guard, was interested to show what the Iron Guard was doing, killing\nRomanians, and also those jidan, you know, th-the Jews. And look what they did, they were\nsavages and --",
        "Q: I'm afraid we have to stop. Sorry.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: Michael, can you give us some sense of what that year of being in the house pretty much -- I\nmean, I know you went into the courtyard, but you were not a free kid any more.",
        "A: No, no, well it was a very hard year. It was a general year of -- of -- a sense of impending\ndoom. After all we heard that ha-happened, the fear was pervasive in our bones, it could re-\nhappen again every -- every day in fact. We were seeing that the presence of the army was less,\nand there was apparent quiet, but the rumor mill and the fears, the -- the -- the sense that, you\nknow, we have no -- no -- no protection whatever, you can -- absolutely -- are absolutely at the\nmercy of anything anybody wanted to do. And there was now and then, news coming about\nsomebody was beaten, somebody was -- you know, in the open day, everything was stolen from\nhim, and beaten and left there in full day -- full daylight. And police didn\u2019t say anything. So, the\nsense was that you were under siege all the time.",
        "Q: Were you conscious of this as a 10 year old?",
        "A: Yeah, I wasn\u2019t -- I was, beca -- you know, I did have at that time, 10 - 11 years, but those\nevents make you more mature than your age, and your fear makes you sensitive. No, th -- and\nreal things happened, it was not simply a -- an anonymous or kind of general unexplained fear.\nMy father for instance, and other Jews, received a paper which was called Call Order. Was a\nmilitary paper from the military service saying -- and this was tha -- six months we -- after the --\nthe massacre, in beginning of \u201942. They say, hereby you are informed that you are to deliver to --\nto work as labor -- forced labor. You are part of a team number 38, or some number, under the\nteam leader is so and so. This is the place where you have to be present when called. The calls\nwill be made publicly, by public speakers and other ways, and you immediately have to present\nyourself at that place, under severe penalties. Signed, the military circle of Iasi. So we received\nthat, and that document I -- I remember was the -- the scariest of all. So finally they said they are\ncoming now around to put out all the Jews, to round them up and to send, and this is even\nofficial, and not unan -- announced. And with -- make -- happen all the day because there 1s no\ntoday. And so you lived in fear that that order would be executed any time, and would not know\nwhat would happen to -- to him, or to us. And sure enough, shortly thereafter that order came\nanother one asking him to -- to come to be present for forced labor at the place, which was the\naddress of the train station. Now this was a train station from where the -- the death trains were\nsent out. And here is a paper asking him to come there and -- and work, so you can imagine what\nhe thought. Will he ever come back, or are they all rounding them up there under some kind of\norder, pretext, whatever. They will load them on the train and here it will happen again, they will\nbe killed, taken away, you will never see them. On the other hand, he couldn\u2019t not go. How could\nhe not go, because it was obvious they had his name and his address and in full. So, with all the\nfear in your heart, and other people also received, so it was a collective -- and the rumor mill k-\nkept going, did you receive, did you receive, I did receive, I didn\u2019t receive, why didn\u2019t that\nreceive, what will happen. So on the appointed day, he was all dressed, equipped with heavier\nbecause it was a cold winter, with a package, you know, to last him, and he was summoned and\nhe had to go to the train station. At the train station they were all put to shovel snow, and clean\nthat and clean that, and we were waiting, waiting. And it was the explosion of joy when at the\nend of the day we saw him back. We didn\u2019t know whether he will come back. And he worked\nthere for I don\u2019t know how many, a -- a week, or [indecipherable] and he came back every day,\nand others came back. They did not send those -- them again or kill them. Was hard work, forced\nlabor, but they all came back. But with the indication that they can be called again any time. So if\n-- we all lived in expectation of another call, so the -- the sense of fear, the terror, the impending\nrisks or -- were there. And he was called indeed, but he came back. Interesting enough, the par --\nthe bureaucracy works in all system. He received a document that he did present himself to that\nplace, and he did the days of labor. And I have the documents of, you know, the call order, and\nthe confirmation that he was present and did the hard labor, signed by the military, you know,\ndepartment, with the dates exactly what it is. So that was the year -- oh, yes, I was saying about\nall the Jews, there was, at the end of spring, the -- the -- the news came that all the Jews will have\nto be submitted to a census, the entire Jewish population. And that should be done through the\nJewish community, the Jewish community was responsible that -- that all the Jews be recorded.\nNow, we knew that the Jewish community knew who the Jews are and where they are, so why is\nthere all of a sudden need to do again such a thing? Again, th -- all the inferences and the fears. It\nwas just short of a year from the pogrom, from the massacre in May, June. And it was announced\nand we lived in fear and then there were cards sent for each to fill in, because it was a census to\nbe filled in. Indeed, the community was asked to do, to submit to the government. We didn\u2019t hear\nthe community, we fer -- we feared what was going to happen, and everybody had to receive,\nold, young, child, no matter, so we fe -- I -- I filled the card of that census myself, as the original\ndocument, which was titled, you know, census of all inhabitants with Jewish blood.\nRecensamintul locuitor cu ringelvreese.

So you may realize from those moments which I try to reconstruct,\nthe -- the climate in which we lived, and how everything like that was like a -- a jolt of fear and\nyou know, shaking us up and throwing us back into fear and uncertainty and th-the sense of\nconstant siege, and a risk of life. You know, I told you when I came -- I was near execution on\nthe way back from the police quarters when they caught us, stopped us and put us with the face\nto the wall. And they said, you escaped, you will -- going to be killed, until that voice sounded,\nlet them go.

        "A: I -- well, I think that whatever food there was came first to me and to my brother, in the\nhouse, yes.",
        "Q: And then your parents last, right.",
        "A: Because we were very loved as children --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and I know that my mother ate very little. My father ate a bit more, but no, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t\nrecall being hungry, I don\u2019t recall being hungry. Oh, my parents did something. They realized --\nyes, this 1s significant, they realized how lonely I am, and how bad it is for a child to not have\nanybody. So they reach an understanding with another family who had many children, to take\none boy of my age to live with us.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, his name was Haim, Haimala. Simply to give me -- to create a companion for me.\nThere was no payment exchanged. Those -- but they promised to share the food with him. For\nthat family, where there were about six children, that was a good relief. They knew my parents as\nvery respectable, and they allow that child to come. And this was Haimala, and my father, who\nwas an engineer, was a good chess player, taught us both chess. And that was very fortunate\nbecause to learn chess you have to have a partner of more or less the same caliber to be play --\nyes. And we learned at the same time, and it was match each other and the other, and we played\nfor hours. For hours we played chess, and he lived with us for a few months and I had a -- a\nfriend in the house, in the house. Some times we go in the field, and -- I don\u2019t remember his\nfamily name, but his first name, Haim, Haimala.",
        "Q: Haim. And you got along?",
        "A: Yes, we got along very well.",
        "Q: And this went on for a few months?",
        "A: For a few months in -- in \u201942.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: In \u201942. A period after the massacre, not beyond the -- the summer of \u201942, because in the fall of\n\"42 I -- I start to go into school.",
        "Q: School, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. But -- so this was the period then --",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting that your parents would come up with an idea like that.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah [indecipherable] yes, yes, yes, they did, and that -- I wish I can name that person,\nthough.",
        "Q: Yes. Did you play with your brother also, cause here it is, your tiny, little brother.",
        "A: Well, not chess [indecipherable]",
        "Q: No, I understand.",
        "A: But yes, I played, but he was really small.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I mean, he was -- in \u201942 he was three years old, \u201944, so [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- I was already 11 years old.",
        "Q: Right, you\u2019re a big guy.",
        "A: Yeah, so he claims that I wasn\u2019t very nice to him always, but -- but so I loved him.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I mean, he was my -- I protected him when people were beating my mother with him in her\narms.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So I love him, and he was my brother, but I don\u2019t think we played a lot together.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Yeah. At that time it was a big age difference.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I mean later, you know, the age didn\u2019t count so much.",
        "Q: Now, some time in \u201942, you\u2019re able to go to a Jewish community synagogue school.",
        "A: Yes, and --",
        "Q: Does that -- so that you leave the house?",
        "A: Yes, I leave the house, as I said, things slowly, slowly --",
        "Q: Got a little better.",
        "A: Yeah, we had the -- the census of the Jewish community done by the Jewish community. We\nare afraid that something will happen. A month passed, two months passed. People from the\ncommunity said no, we gave the data over here, but we don\u2019t think s -- the danger is -- send your\nchildren to school, we\u2019ll do the best to protect, so they encouraged, and then they send me to\nschool indeed. Indeed we saw -- we saw that although the census was made, and my card bears\nthe date of the census, which was June, I believe, \u201942, and one month, two months later, nothing\nhappened. There was evidence of who are the Jews, but nothing happened. At the same time,\nwhich was a very important factor, the Romanian army was victorious. It was far away, deep into\nthe Soviet Union, and -- and there was a -- a -- a sense of triumph in the Romanian community\nand clearly they were -- there were a lot of things being stolen from Russia and coming in, it was\nknown there 1s a -- trains of items were brought and officers came with cars loaded, military cars\nwith their own build -- I mean, their items stolen and -- so somehow the concern with the Jews\ndecreased a bit, and we felt that. So it was a bit more relaxed and they send me to school. They\nwanted to -- me to learn something. I told you that during the same year, I was -- a Melamed\ncame to our home. Again my father asked somebody who was younger than him\n[indecipherable] to come and teach me. And again, the payment was in -- in things. And he came\nand taught both me and Haimala the -- the Hebrew alphabet, and this is when I actually started. I\nknow -- I remember we weren\u2019t too good students and he was not a very tough teacher and ri --\nwe didn\u2019t do our schoolwork and so on, it wasn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t learn too much. But he came -- he\ncame and he tried, so I was a bit prepared. And my mother would talk to me about literature, so\nsome kind of home schooling, and my father did with me, math. Math, mathematics, you know,\narithmetics, to -- to teach me the f -- the things, because he was an engineer. And then Haimala,\ntoo. So we had some kind of improvised schooling at home. And then they said, you know, the\nchild grows, he has to go to school. And they send me to school, and first I was accompanied,\nthen finally I would go by myself. They advised -- the parents want for us to come in groups, so\nsay if something happens, you run and tell whoever you can what happened, so we\u2019ll come to\nhelp. And I was crossing the Jewish quarter in fact, all the way to school, and the school, what\nwas the school? The school was a big synagogue with a shtender, you know the shtender, it was\nindivid --",
        "Q: What is a shtender?",
        "A: The shtender 1s the -- the piece of furniture on which you keep your -- your Sidur, to read\nwhen there is an individual bench. Otherwise there is a full bench. A lot of times there is, you\nknow, a chair, and the shtender at a chair. Here we were given the shtenders to be able to use the\nboxes to put our copy books -- prayer books. It wasn\u2019t proper equipment for children, that was\nmade for ad-adults, but I remember very well how we learned. We had teachers and we went to\nschool. We had breaks, you know, we played in the breaks and a bit of normalcy seeped in. And\nthis was end of \u201942 - \u201943, and then Stalingrad happened, and then we became happy, and the\nRomanians, and the others people there started to understand that the war is turning. And since\n[indecipherable] and casualties were on the Romanian side pretty severe -- very severe in fact,\nbecause the Germans put always the Romanian troops and regiments in the -- in the fire, you\nknow, in the most dangerous, and there were many casualties and losses. So the situation turned\ngenerally grim, but we were able to -- to learn about what is happening, and some hope started to\n-- to come up, that the Germans are going to be defeated, and the war is going to be turned\naround. So that gave us a bit of hope, our hope grew. The situation generally didn\u2019t worsen, and\nit didn\u2019t worsen for Jews as it was -- became apparent much later, I did not have any way myself\nto learn that, but for the overall picture it appeared that the politicians, including the government,\nAntonescu, realized sooner than we did that the war is turning and then the risk of being --\nkilling the Jews is 10 times as high because they may be a -- become accountable. So the -- the\nstate\u2019s anti-Semite activities did not grow, or did not expand their -- I am not aware of any other\nmassacre or pogrom, or further very severe -- I don\u2019t recall my father being called again in \u201943 to\n-- to do forced labor and now I understand, I mean there are documents which show that the --\nthe government wanted to -- to change course. They send also representatives on the sly to\ncontact the allies, without Germany knowing. And that was \u201943, in \u00b044 Romania turned sides\nalready. So for us the situation was better on that. Still fear, still Jews. We had an episode of\nwearing the yellow star in the period of \u201941, I don\u2019t recall in -- exactly how long, but I still have\nthe yellow star and -- two yellow stars, in fact. One was also exhibited in New York, and --\nwhich were mine, my -- my mother kept that too, which were sewn on garments when we had to\ngo out of the house, and stayed on the garments except that if we had to change the garments, we\nhad to move those things. So there was -- that situation of living between how do you I say it,\none fear and the other, and one hope and another hope. Until -- but then, you know, the -- the\nsense of hope and the sense of possible escape started to soon -- rather s-soon to disappear again\nbecause the Russians were successful in pushing the Germans and the Romanian armies back.\nAnd that increased the -- for us, th-the sense of fear that if they are defeated, and if they are\ngoing to retreat, we can be again in great jeopardy, and another massacre may occur when the\narmies will be here. That was one -- one thing. The other thing which happened in that - those\nyears, 1S news percolated to us that our relatives were deported, or -- but some of them may be in\ncamps. Not -- not specifically was about our relatives, but news about the Jews in Bessarabia.\nMy mother was desperate all the time, knowing that so many of her cousins and brothers -- my\nmother had four brothers -- half brothers of course, but brothers very good, and two sisters,\nbecause from her --",
        "Q: Mm, it\u2019s a big family.",
        "A: Yeah, her -- her -- her father in the first marriage had six children. She was the youngest but\nshe was very close to the youngest because she was from the second wife. But very close to the\nyoungest child from the first wife because my grandfather, when he lost his wife, and a man with\nsix children, tried to marry soon again and he did marry and his wife bore him a child, my\nmother, who was very close in age to the smallest child he had from the --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So that particular child became the friend of my mother, a boy about three years older than\nmy mother. What his name was? Not shu -- I remember. I knew his name. I know the name of\nhis son. And as she was extremely energetic, hoping that some of those people, of her brothers\nand cousins and aunts, and then there was a family on her mother\u2019s side. All these brothers and\nsister I mentioned were on her father\u2019s side. But her mother had also three sisters, who got\nmarried there, and those sisters had children who were her cousins and so on. So she wanted to\nfind out who is where and if anybody was alive. You couldn\u2019t write, there was no post. But\nsomething happened. Romania got short of medical personnel. There are a good number of\nJewish doctors and Jewish paramedics, and so on, of course, health personnel, who was fired\nfrom all positions when my father was fired in \u201994, they weren\u2019t allowed to practice, and they\npracticed then for the community, Jewish community [indecipherable]. And then they -- some\nkind of decision was made to re-allow, to bring back some of the Jewish doctors in the military\nto tend to the wounded, because there were enormous amount of wounded people and they\nneeded to be treated and the Romanian doctors were not enough. So the Jews -- the Jews were --\nphysicians were brought back, given a military uniform, with a distinctive sign that they are not -\n- they are military doctors and they are not the regular army, and which identified them with\nJews. But they were put to practice. That was [indecipherable] that was permanent. My father as\nengineer was put to forced labor, unqualified labor, but they were put to qualified labor. And\nthey were sent to the front, going to the front back and forth by train, they stopped here and\nthere. And some of them became couriers in trying to give messages and visit camps. My mother\nfound one of such doctors, gave her -- him the name of our people, the Faerstein family, Zioma\nand Uca and Monea and other names and told him, begged him, please whenever you have a\nchance, ask who has ever heard of the Faerstein family from Balti.",
        "Q: We had to stop here, so we can stop the tape.",
        "A: How do you know --\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "Q: Michael, you were talking about your mother giving information --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- to these doctors so they could find --",
        "A: Yeah, so it was more than one, two, three, whomever she could catch. As I said, my mother\nwas extremely energetic. You can see that I loved my mother very much from the way I speak\nabout her, but she is -- truly was, truly extremely energetic she was. And she, being the first\nuniversity educated person in her family in all -- among all her brothers and uncles and so on,\nnobody had [indecipherable]. And moving to the big city, she became the center, the -- the -- the\nanchor point, not the center, the anchor point. When everybody needed something, they would\ncontact Shanya, before the war, already, and she was there. And she kind of assumed\nresponsibility for them. Somebody ill would be sent from Balti to Iasi, that was in the years\nbefore the war. And she would take care, go with them in the ho-hospital and so on, so on. So --\nand she loved them, she grew up there, she was very much concerned. She tried to identify them\nand -- and lo and behold, one of those doctors -- ambassadors, ambassadors to the camps, this 1s\nwhat they were, one comes back one good day and says, \u201cI found it, I found your family.\u201d You\nknow, I remember that moment, I mean that was extraordinary. Whom did you find? She found,\nin -- in -- not she, he found, in a camp farther away from Balti, the family of one of her brother --\nbrothers, Yosl, with two of his children and his wife. The two children were Zioma and Uca.\nAnd as, you know, the -- then I learned that from my mother, the details, because it\u2019s -- it\u2019s such\nan extraordinary story, and how did he found -- he was going from camp to camp, and asked do\nyou know somebody from -- and no, no. And then somebody told him, in that camp may be\nsomebody with that name. And he went, apparently towards Marculesti, or -- I have to remember\n-- one of th-the camps was Marculesti, and the other was Cecilnica. I don\u2019t recall which one was\nthat, but -- and then somebody else, we have got your family here, and they pointed there and he\ngoes and he found one -- one of the two younger brother, and not -- not my mother\u2019s fa --\nbrother, and the mother of the two boys. And indeed it was her family, and she said, \u201cYou know,\nI am the doctor, I was sent by Shanya Catz, and she\u2019s your relative.\u201d And then they told him the\nwhole story and what happened to them, and they came, and the address. And my -- those people\nare my cousins. There were four brothers. So the story was that one of the four got sepa -- when\nthey were marched -- th-the -- the whole thing 1s that the Jews of Balti were marched, walking by\n-- by soldier of the Romanian army on horses. Put in column and marched for tens of kilometers\nto be evacuated out of Balti. When the army entered they were first put in a prison, in the Balti\nprison. They were kept there a couple of weeks or some shorter time, and there they were started\nto march. If you look -- to march them to the east --",
        "Q: East, right.",
        "A: -- to the east. And they stayed in a place, and then moved further and pushed further and\npushed further. All the time no transportation offered, no -- no help to people who are old or sick\nor incapable of doing. Lots of them perished on those marches, you know, they weren\u2019t given\nhorses, the soldiers have the horses. And until they stayed in a place for awhile, they had to beg\ntheir food, they are receiving very little, beg their food from the peasants around them, steal the\nfood from the field, eat whatever they could find on the field, potatoes, raw potatoes and any\nother thing. And he found them -- and then were stayed in houses emptied by people who went\nwhen the Russian army retreated, they -- many people evacuated with -- together with the\nRussian army. And those camps were not in the system of the German camps, you know, the\nbarracks were well organized German style, were simply improvised, the same way like the --\nyou know, the -- the -- the killing of the Jews in the pogrom, which I already told you, was a very\nartisanal killing.",
        "Q: It was a very\u201d?",
        "A: Artisanal killing.",
        "Q: Artisanal, right.",
        "A: I mean, in death trains, you know, hacking them to death, it was not the gas chambers, the\ntype of thing, the horrible. And maybe the fact that, you know, the gas chambers are so well\nknown is not due only to the huge numbers but to the industrialized manner of killing Jews. Here\nit was more the traditional manner was used, you know, kill directly, or the innovation was\nputting them on trains. But 1-in the camps were -- do the same thing. They were herded to a\nplace, compelled to work, or left abandoned there, fell on the ground, found someplace to sit\ndown. And then in a week or two days or three days or maybe two months, when the new order\ncame, or when the soldiers rested, they were shepherded further. So he came back and told us\nthat my uncle Yosl died of starvation and -- and illness. He was not shot, but he caught typhus\nand -- and he died in the arms of his sons. That the -- his wife is alive, Surka, Aunt Surka. Who\nwas, as it happened in a Jewish family, she was also the youngest sister of my grandmother. So\nthe grandmother, my grandmother married as a second wife, her husband, who had sons from the\nfirst wife. Some of the sons were much older than [indecipherable] young people. So one of them\nat the -- some point, married the youngest sister of my grandmother. So the son married the sister\nof his father\u2019s wife, second wife. But it was perfectly [indecipherable]. And she became -- and\nshe gave birth to four sons, who are my direct first cousins. And the story came that one of them,\nin that terrible evacuation being herded, separated from the family and was lost. As it turned out,\nhe didn\u2019t separate by chance. He wanted to -- to run away and to run away with the Russians and\nto reach the Russians and to fight. And he did succeeded, went east on his own, crossed the front\nline, reached the Russians line, and became a soldier. And for the entire war in the Russian army,\nall the way to Germany, survived. Was crippled, unfortunately, and remained cripple -- shorter\nleg for -- but came back alive. And we are very proud of him because he wanted to fight and he\nfought the Nazis to -- to the end. And -- and then another one, who lived not with his father in\nBalti was caught in an -- another thing, and also apparently left and was on the Russian side. So\nto escape that war and the camps, the father died, the boys survived, and the mother survived.\nAnd the doctor brought us the information only about those who he fou -- he found in the camp,\nwe -- at that time we didn\u2019t know about those who fought in the army. And then next time when\nhe went, my mother gave him money, gave him a blanket, gave him medication. Not too much,\nbecause he couldn\u2019t carry. He went back to the same camp, found them and gave them the\nblanket. Now imagine what it means in that condition to receive something like from heaven,\nyou -- you get, and it was -- and they never forget. I met th-the cousin Zioma, one of them I\nmentioned, I believe before, that I met him in Balti years later and then he went to Israel. The\nyoungest one, Uca, is fortunately still a-alive. He left the Russia earlier than his older brother, he\ncame to Canada. And he\u2019s still alive in Canada, and I talked to him on the phone a few days ago.\nAnd he -- he -- you should interview him because he was in camp. I was not directly in camp, I\nwas with the massacres, but his story is extraordinary, how he -- they were moved from camp to\ncamp, marched in -- in the worst conditions, not fed. How he had to go and steal and bring home\nsome food for people, how his father died in his hand, sick and no-not medicated by anybody.\nThe stories are horrible, but he is alive. He is almost 80 or more. And he has his daughter and\nson and they live in Toronto. If you want I will give him your --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It\u2019s Uca Faerstein, you keep the name and so -- so th-this -- that was again a hor -- a typical\nevent for our family, typical Holocaust event which marked our lives because we were able --\nmy mother was able once to send those things. But then she co -- started to collect things and\nprepare, in the hope that she will be able to send again and again and again. And collected from\nwhoever she could, that and the other thing. There was no other option to send. But at least we\nknew that they were alive. And they kept hope that they will survive. So this is how we moved\nthrough \u00b043. And then 44 came, and the front was coming closer to -- closer. This is when the\npanic started in the Jewish community again, that as the army would retreat, they were already\nvisible retreating and convoys of people, very poorly looking, came through Iasi. You know, in\nthe early years we saw Russian prisoners brought through Iasi. In the later years we didn\u2019t see\nRussian prisoners brought through Iasi any more. We saw convoys of the Romanian army, or of\nthe Germans coming in a very ragtag shape. They were visible in \u201943, I remember, not \u201942, but in\n\"43 I remember. And the stories was, you know, between people, telling whoever saw,\ncommunicated to the other, you know, I saw another convoy, it doesn\u2019t go good for them.\n[indecipherable] So --",
        "Q: Oh, Michael, ha-have -- are you hearing anything about all the killings in Poland?",
        "A: No, no, I --",
        "Q: You hear nothing about killing centers?",
        "A: No, that\u2019s -- I -- lask myself the same thing --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] uh-huh.",
        "A: -- and for instance there were the killing of the Jews in -- in Kiev, which was -- that time I -- I\ndon\u2019t recall, I cannot say that my father and mother knew nothing, but I am inclined to believe\nthey didn\u2019t learn about such things. There were some things I believe about Odessa because\nshortly after the beginning of the war, the Romanian army moved fast, they arrived in Odessa\nand then they did a bloody massacre of the Jews in Odessa, which were very close to Romania\nand the news came. But never did the news tell of the proportion.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But I am frankly not surprised about that, Joan, to tell you the truth, because I -- I know how\nthe massacre in Iasi happened, that was the largest pogrom, I mean 13,000 people in one\ncommunity is huge, is a huge -- men -- mostly men, maybe a few children and some women, so -\n- but th-there was a veil of silence afterward, nobody talked. At that time no newspaper reported.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: How would people know? Nobody discussed, that was buried under silence [indecipherable]\nthing. Th-Th-The west didn\u2019t know. Later on, you know, if you read those things, you find out\nthat apparently some news percolated to the U.S. embassy in Romania, of course still an embassy\nthen in \u00b041, and some allusion -- you should ask your expert in the museum, some reference was\nvague in a -- some dispatch from the U.S. consul or embassy in Romania about some events in\nIasi. But without proper description, nobody realized. And then the system kept it all the way\nsecret until the war. In the war there was a process of them s -- at the end of the war.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Some of the people who are caught with very little full evidence, and then when the\ncommunist system took over in Romania, they put another veil of silence because they didn\u2019t\nwant to -- Romania to be blamed for doing such things, such a massacre. In fact, however that\nmassacre was o-of a magnitude unprecedented in Europe. Even at Kristallnacht in Germany,\nthere were no 13,000 Jews killed. A lot of destruction, and a number of victims, but not 13,000\nJews. So that was th-the first big event on the European scale of killing Jews en masse. Maybe in\nPoland it happened too, in \u201939 or \u201940, I don\u2019t know. But then it was repeated in Odessa, it was\nrepeated in Kiev. Babi Yar was a clear copycat of that, these people brought and killed in front of\ntheir trenches and [indecipherable] there. But there are description from the pogrom in Iasi that\npeople -- corpses were loaded on trucks and when trucks came to a grave, first they -- they\ncarried body by body, then they become too cumbersome, and they say, you know, let\u2019s shovel\nall of them at once, to fall straight into the grave. This was how it was treated. And the -- the -- in\nshort, there was -- what happened in Romania was huge, and yet little known. So therefore I\u2019m\nnot surprised that we didn\u2019t receive the news from all the things which happened under the\noccupation in the Russian territory. We only realized through that doctor who came, when we\ngot the story how they were pushed from place to place, that they were pushed to the east to be\nbeyond any line which could presumably still remain under Russia. That that territory had to be\nclean of all the Jews, which that territory which was expected to become Romanian in the event\nof the war ending with a German victory, should be clean of Jews. This is why they -- they\nmoved them, they killed some of them, but whoever stayed alive should be on the other side to\nRussia. Which was -- which -- that is what today we call th-the proper concept, ethnic cleanstick\n-- cleansing. That preceded with decades the ethnic cleansing in -- by Serbia\u2019s -- or -- or by the\nMuslims in Croatia, and in what happened in Yugoslavia very recently. But 1t was ethnic\ncleansing. This throwing an ethnic group, either by direct killing, or by starvation, or by hunger,\nor allowing them to be killed by epidemics. And pushing the -- the remainders o-out beyond the\nborder. So this is --",
        "Q: When was it clear to you how big the pogrom was in Iasi? Because your own experience of\nthe pogrom was limited. The fear was enormous, but you clearly wouldn\u2019t have known at the end\nof the four days --",

Then the news percolated that a lot of people were\nkilled then -- I mean, the people who saved the life, s -- told and communicated home that we are\nalive, but we saw that that and that was killed. The Iasi families [indecipherable] through\nmessages, through friends, including Romanian friends, to contact those whom we ler -- who\nthey learned are in Calarasi, I mean far away, to -- what happened to, you know, Avram\nRoitembaum, and so on and so forth. And the news we -- I saw him dead.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So this -- the -- the realization of the -- of the magnitude seeped in gradually.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we s -- we realized it was bigger and bigger and bigger than we could realize then. We\nhad it firsthand because in my courtyard, two people did not return, the -- Mr. Barad and his\nolder son. And the family was -- stayed Shiva when they learned about that thing. So we realized\ncontinuously th-the inc -- increasingly realized the size of the -- the numbers we only found out\nand learned after the war, the total numbers. And as I mentioned to you during the communist\nsystem, there were no reports and le -- except the -- the trial of some of the criminals who were\ninvolved, no publicity was made. The Jewish community would have a commemoration of the\nmassacre each year and they would say there were so many people killed, the -- 11,000 was the\nnumber at a certain time, which they believed it was, just huge. Then the documents were\ndiscovered that there were -- in the special services reported more then 11,000 killed. And\ngradually we\u2019d realize the size, but not when I was a child. From a child my -- my direct\nexperience was about the reality of that happening to me, to my family, to the neighbors in the\nimmediate --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- in the most indisputable and tangible way. The proportions I learned later, yeah.",
        "Q: So y-y -- from what I can tell, you would describe the years following the m -- the massacre,\nthe pogrom, as being sort of up and down. There are times when it\u2019s ha --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- when your fear is heightened, and there are times when the fear seems to be less but it\nnever goes away --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- because you\u2019re never sure --",
        "A: Yes, exactly.",
        "Q: -- until the war is completely over.",
        "A: Like a sword hanging.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: All the time.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then really happening, I mean my father receiving the piece of paper that he had to -- to\nshow up.",
        "Q: Show up.",
        "A: And then having to show up and then us being on edge the whole day whether he comes back\nor not. Then with the census, with all our data, and our mind was this 1s a list for them to come\nand systematically pick up and make sure that nobody is -- is -- is omitted from the pick-up. So,\nof course we had very strong indication that things can happen any day. Wh- When things\nworsened on the front, we -- we started having hopes that who knows, maybe we\u2019ll be lucky\nenough to survive that ordeal.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That -- that was -- but we were, you know, fearing disappearance and death every time, yeah,\nyeah.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] time. Do you think it changed you a lot? Of course it\u2019s very difficult to know\nwhat you would have been if you --",
        "A: Exactly, how could [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- hadn\u2019t had the experience.",
        "A: -- but it\u2019s un-unforgettable. It shaped my mind at that time because all my [indecipherable]\nwhen I came out from the war and when I started to go to school, and when the first years of\nfreedom, everything was fresh in my mind and you know, I joined a group of more consciously\nthinking kids in our school, and even politically oriented kids, too, and engage in discussion, you\nknow, what -- so what will happen? Will that happen again, what -- are they [indecipherable] are\n-- the Jewish problem, that was a [indecipherable] problem nationale which we discussed\nendlessly and shaped our aspiration, political conviction, desire to do something to create a\ndifferent type of society. And that 1s a very clear chapter in -- in my life. After the war, as a\nresult, a conscious result of the extraordinary sense of oppression and injustice which I had,\nwhich was imprinted in my cells and my genes, and I came out with that. And that, you know,\nsuch oppression, such injustice shouldn\u2019t happen, I mean, again. So in that respect, it -- it\nchanged me. Without that experience I -- definitely I would have been a different person.",
        "Q: Person.",
        "A: But otherwise it did change me, and it\u2019s -- it -- 1t\u2019s rooted in my mind, certain aspirations and\nvalues which I believe I still carry.",
        "Q: [inaudible] Did you leave Iasi in \u201944, or you stayed?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what th -- worry we -- we reached the point --",
        "Q: Well --",
        "A: -- as the --",
        "Q: -- as the Russians --",
        "A: -- the Russian was approaching, we fear -- the fear thermometer, I\u2019d say. The fear\nthermometer, or barometer went up again, and say well, they\u2019re coming, they\u2019re going to destroy\nus when -- if the Russians are victorious and pushing them, when they retreat through Iasi, they\nwill kill again all the Jews.",
        "Q: Ah, the romane -- when -- when the arm -- Romanian army retreats --",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s what they fear --",
        "Q: -- it\u2019s they -- uh-huh.",
        "A: -- Romanians and German --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- because the front was coming.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We are going to be decimated, and destroyed, and -- because even the first time they took\nrevenge, Romanian army took revenge on the Jews in Iasi and in other places, also on account\nthat the Jews of Bessarabia, when the Romanian army retreated from Bessarabia in 1940, kind of\nrejoiced in that retreat.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And then they had to pay -- to payback, and they paid back by killing. So with a -- they\u2019re\ngoing to retreat, that will be the end of us. We -- we survived until now, but that, no. And then\neverybody who could, say we have to run. We have to run, we have -- how to run? And this is\nwhen my parents, and other people started to -- to think how they can ran -- run away from --\nwhere to run? There was no -- nothing, no place to run, but they said, if we can run to Bucharest,\nwhich 1s a big city with a much smaller proportion of Jews, we\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll disappear in the mix,\nperhaps we\u2019ll get lost ra -- in -- in Bucharest, a pogrom like that did not happen. So we -- that\u2019s\nwas -- was the reasoning. And th-this -- my parents started to prepare themselves, and to do\nwhatever they could to run away.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that prepared their -- their running away and becoming refugees and running away from\nIasi at the end of the month of March, 1944. Which we, at that time, you know, they identified a\ntaxi driver, in fact, who was -- or somebody who owned a car, I don\u2019t know whether he was a\ntaxi driver, but owned a car, and reached a deal with him to pay him to transport us from -- from\nIasi to Bucharest. And that\u2019s the entire story, I have to tell you [indecipherable] the trip, because\nwe didn\u2019t have enough money, there was no cars, and we had to fit ourself in that car, all my\nfamily and the Barad family, who lost the head of the family and one of the sons. So we were\nfive of us, I tell you about my other grandmother, and three of them to fit in one car, one small\ncar. My father kind of took charge of the Barad family who remained without a man in the hou --\nwithout a head of the family. And they were very close friends. And indeed, we were all loaded\nin that car, and that was an ordeal, but they made it to Bucharest.",
        "Q: Hm. We have to stop the tape.",
        "A: Okay. All right.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "Q: Michael, before you get to tell us about your trip to Bucharest, were there other relatives\nkilled in other camps?",
        "A: Yes, unfortunately there were, there were. And the one other uncle of mine, my mother\u2019s\nelder brother, half elder brother, whose name is Moise Leib was in a totally different camp, also\ncoming from Balti, but they were driven, chased to another camp, and he died in Obadovka, this\nwas the name of the camp. It was already in Ukraine, that Obadovka, like Cecilnica, which I said\nbefore, as they were pushed, and they arrived there, but died in the camp, and that camp, also his\nson, my cousin, if I recall correctly the name, I was -- it was also Yosl.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But he was still a small child, or a child of eight, 10 - 12 was -- who also was killed. Only his\nwife escaped, the wife of Moise Leib. That was again his second wife, of that uncle of mine\nwhose son was killed. She survived, her husband and her son was killed. My uncle and my\ncousin were killed, she survived. But my uncle had two other sons from his first marriage, and\nthey also either disappeared or were killed, I cannot tell you for sure about each one and all of\nthem, but there were much more losses. Those which I mentioned I know for sure, and I know\ntheir names and I recall the instances we discussed. But my mother, who kept a very sober count,\nand a very loving count of them, in fact dedicated a number of trees in Israel, growing trees, to\ntheir memory and altogether it must be a big forest in -- in Israel only for them. And she also\ncreated the plaque with their names, the names of all who died from the family Al Kidush\nHashem, and made a plaque which I have, a plaque at home, I have it, you can see it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: If you want to put it on record with this. What is meaningful is that in fact, she did that plaque\nearly on enough that she arrived here, in the States, and [indecipherable] you know. But then we\nfound out about the others, who also were killed in the camps, and for whom -- my mother\nthought that they were disappeared in the war, or in the evacuation with the Russians, and they\nwere war casualties rather than Holocaust direct massacred or killed people. But they were --\nthey didn\u2019t fit yet in -- in the -- in that table, in that plaque. So there are more than in the plaque.\nThe answer yes, in Romania we -- you have very many casualties on that side. Everybody had\ncasualties, I mean on -- on my grandmother\u2019s side, there were her sisters who were there, and\nwho had their children and grandchildren, some of them were killed, some of them escaped,\nsome of them were killed. There was no family which was left unscathed by that, that losses. I\nmentioned to you Uca, the one who is now in Toronto. He married, when he came after the war,\nsurviving and came back to Balti, he married a woman in Balti. That woman was the only\nsurvivor of her family. Yanya is her name, and she\u2019s alive and his wife now. But she was a\nsurvivor in her family.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So the casualties were terrible, and many, many [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So more -- more than half of the Jewish population were killed in Romania.",
        "A: Yes, I mean, the statistics show that altogether, the Romanian Jewry was one of the most\nnumerous Jewish population in -- in Europe. Before the war about 850,000 Jews lived in\nRomanian territory. By -- after the war only four -- 400,000 were alive. Half or more on the\neastern side, a good number on the Romanian territory, as happened in Iasi, and in Dorohoi and\nin other places which I mentioned. Bucharest and so on. And a good part in the western part of\nRomania, which was taken away from Romania before the war, and was under Hungarian\nregime, and under Nazi control, and the Germans and the Hungarians deported the Romanian --\nthe Jews from that part, from Transylvania. So it was not the Romanian government which killed\nthem, but they were part of the Romanian Jewry who were killed in the west, as opposed to in\nthe east.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Some of them we -- went to Auschwitz and to other big camps, and never returned.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s not --",
        "A: So it was how --",
        "Q: -- exactly how you count --",
        "A: -- yes, yeah.",
        "Q: -- but the counting is difficult.",
        "A: -- the -- the fact is --",
        "Q: But still, it\u2019s a huge number.",
        "A: -- it doesn\u2019t matter on -- so much on whose account -- I mean on whose count of murders they\n-- their names are, what matters is a murder took place, mass murder, mass killing.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re in this car, eight people in a small car --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- I can only imagine.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you have any luggage, is there anything, or it\u2019s just people?",
        "A: No, no, we couldn\u2019t like -- take any luggage, very, very few things, but those few things were\nsome of the things, the documents, and some of the Jewish heirlooms which my mother saved. In\nother words, the whole house was left un -- untouched, as you know, we left and\n[indecipherable] they tried to -- to run away for life, and escape with their lives. So the entire\nhouse we don\u2019t what happened to the house, to the furniture, to whatever was left in the house,\ndepleted enough as it was for th-the -- the exchange of --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- house item for goods and food. But there was still a household. The car -- I mean, what I\nremember is something which you d -- understand that a boy of that age would remember, I\nremember the -- the brand of the car.",
        "Q: Oh, what was it?",
        "A: At that time, oh I -- you know, it was a Plymouth.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: P-l-y-m-o-u-t. And at that time I didn\u2019t know English, and so for years I -- I kept 1t in mind, in\nthe Romanian reading, Plymouth. But now I can tell you. And it was a spacious Plymouth\nbecause in addition to the normal seats it has those banquettes, you know, the seats which -- so\nthis is how we fit, but it still was an ordeal. So I don\u2019t know exactly how everybody was divided,\nbut first of all we had a very heartbreaking situation with my grandmother on the mother\u2019s side.\nWe were preparing to leave and it was absolutely obvious that she cannot make the trip. She was\nvery heavy, still ill, everybody catered to her. She was more -- more lying than standing.\nAdvanced in age.",
        "Q: This [indecipherable] for years.",
        "A: Yes, and -- for years, but as -- with every year, worse. So -- and -- and she said, \u201cLeave me\nhere, leave me here.\u201d And my father said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to, how can we take you, what should we\ndo?\u201d And he wa -- we were desperate. But it -- it was impossible to -- to take her, and eventually\nthey found a solution. The solution was they went to the same family where the child Haim\ncame, who was a family with children. They did not contemplate to -- to leave, or they didn\u2019t\nhave the means, I don\u2019t exactly know. But they were s-saying we are staying here and if you\nwant, we can take Chava as a family member, and we will take enormous care of her, whatever\nwe can do for -- for us, we\u2019ll do for her. So this is what happened. Chava moved to the family of\nHaimala, and stayed there, and lived a little bit longer and then passed away indeed, because she\nwas close to that moment. I believe she survived a few months, and passed away. I never saw her\nagain. But we knew, and they took good care, because she got ill, and she was hospitalized, too.\nThere was a former Jewish hospital owned by the Jewish community, which -- it was a very\npowerful community there, but then it was taken by the state. But we -- we learned that she was\ntaken to the hospital for good care and that she died in the hospital, so at least we know that she\ndidn\u2019t die abandoned and -- and [indecipherable] --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- but she -- it was a -- you know, she was very old, too. And --",
        "Q: But it must be very difficult for everybody.",
        "A: It was very -- it was heartbreaking, and worse [indecipherable] my parents were in touch with\nIasi by that -- those time the phone was terrible, but they were in touch even after we arrived in\nBucharest. But I, in the 90\u2019s, when I was in Romania again, before I left, I couldn\u2019t track her\ndown. But when I came back from the States after that, I did everything to find her out, and we\nwent to the cemetery in Iasi and tracked down who passed out in that years in the Jewish\ncommunity, and we found the record. And I went to the cemetery in Iasi, and we found the place,\nbut everything was, you know, weeds and soil and debris and so on, with a lady -- caretaking\nwoman and the man at the cemetery, we started to dig and clean at the place where the numbers\ncoincided, and lo and behold, the -- the grave appeared.",
        "Q: You found it.",
        "A: Yes, and we found the name there. So I know where my grandmother is buried. So this was\nthe -- one thing about departure. And then the other grandmother was in much better shape\nphysically. And indeed, she survived until \u201966 or something.",
        "Q: She did, really?",
        "A: Yeah, another 20 years after that. And we got all loaded, there was no room, and I was the\nsmallest -- not the smallest one, there\u2019s Zolly, but I was the smallest adult, so to say. So they\ncombined me with the youngest boy from the Barad family, took up only one seat. So he was a\nbit older than me, his name was Eugene, and again I can tell you some of a little story how I\nrediscovered him later. But I was on his knees the entire trip.",
        "Q: Now this is a trip of what, 500 miles or something [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, this was about 500 kilometers -- 400 --",
        "Q: Aha, so it\u2019s a little less.",
        "A: -- four -- four --",
        "Q: Four -- okay.",
        "A: But it was not the distance, it was the duration which was killing us. A distance is a distance,\nbut it was the -- the highways were not highways, or -- you know, roads as they were \u201944, and\nthey were clogged with refugees on carts, on -- on cars, trucks, military people coming from the\nwar, ambulances, checkpoints which slowed the tr -- down the traffic, everything. Y -- military\nunits going to the front, and military units retreating from the front. So the -- the trip was I don\u2019t\nknow, almost 24 hours, leave one day and arrive the next day in Bucharest. The poor driver\ndrived all the time. He secured some piece of paper for him to prove, and really that was a --\nlifesaving, because we were stopped.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He was showing the paper, and my mother was pushing the bribe. That was a pattern because\nalone the paper justified, but they wouldn\u2019t let it. And my mother had, you know, one thing and\nanother thing, precious thing, some jewelry went. And we -- one after the other went through all\nthe -- the checkpoints.",
        "Q: So she was the really imaginative one in terms of this.",
        "A: Sh-She -- she was, yeah, she was the real --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: My father, as I told you, came wounded and ba -- and he suffered for rest of the life for the\nconsequences of those --",
        "Q: The beatings.",
        "A: -- thing, which became more psychologically damaging than physically damaging. He\nrecovered physically from what he had, but psychologically it was really bad. So he had good\ntimes, but he was out of kilter for many. And then had strokes and -- a series of strokes, you\ndon\u2019t -- cannot say for sure that the -- that 1s a direct relationship, but -- so we arrived in\nBucharest. I remember I was not able to stand, and every time we stopped I wasn\u2019t able to stand,\nthis is how numb --",
        "Q: [inaudible]",
        "A: -- my -- my legs were from sitting on his knees and being bent, because the car was low and --\nand the room was extraordinary tiny. So, but we made it eventually to Bucharest and we arrived\nat the friend of my father, whose name was Lupu Catz, the same name, but they were no relative.\nThere was also a Catz from the town of my father, and they were friend in -- in childhood, and\nthey remained friends through the lifetime, and in time of need they had the house, and we all\ndecamped to their house. And we stayed there for awhile and I remember he had one daughter, a\nbit -- one year younger of me, so my age, practically. And she was -- she had a cold at that time,\nso she was bedridden. So here I see a -- a girl who became my friend and she\u2019s still alive and\nfine, and we are friends. But I remember the moment when I see -- saw her first time. Jenica is\nher name. And we stayed in their house [indecipherable] it was totally different for me, it was a\nbig city, bigger indeed, it was close to the Jewish quarters of Bucharest, but a bit out. And\nindeed, the Jewish community was kind of smaller and lost in the total population of Bucharest.\nAnd nothing bad happened since then directly about Jews. The bad thing which happened 1s the -\n- the -- the allies started to bomb Bucharest. The front was coming up.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: So we -- we arrived at Bucharest virtually -- less than one week from the biggest ever\nbombing of Bucharest. And the fourth of April, 1944, that was the biggest bombing of Bucharest\nby the British planes, based somewhere I don\u2019t know. In the Mediterranean, the Greece, and they\nwere coming to bomb the Romanian gas hills, Romania had the gas, and those were within 40\nmiles of Bucharest, so they drop part of the bombs there, on the gas field, and come with the rest.\nThat was putting pressure on the population of the government to -- to --",
        "Q: Stop.",
        "A: -- to stop the war and to come out, preparing them to -- softening them for -- for the political\nnegotiation to get Romania out of the war, and against the Germans. Because the Russians were\npressing from the east, and here was the government, and -- who had to be bombed into\nsubmission, and bombed to -- to accept the -- the ca --",
        "Q: That\u2019s quite an entrance after you\u2019re trying to escape from --",
        "A: Yes, and we escape the war only to -- to fall here, and mind you, what happened after that\nfirst bombing, the raids continued to the point that they came every single day to bomb\nBucharest.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And to increase the political pressure, they came every day at the same hour. Ele -- 11 of the\nmorning, we knew that this is the -- and [indecipherable] away I -- all the -- always the -- the -- it\nwas deliberate, it was not -- so, I guess -- I didn\u2019t have any contact with the British headquarters\nto know, but why would they send the planes every day the same hour, except to demonstrate\nsomething, they are able to do it, and this is not --",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: -- and you -- you -- you still fear, and you know that the next day they to -- come again. And\nthen you cannot [indecipherable] so when will this stop, I mean how long? The -- then -- you\nknow, the sirens would start screaming wildly, everybody would run away, everybody --\nBucharest wasn\u2019t bombed during the war, it was far from -- from theater of war. In the beginning\nmaybe some, but I wasn\u2019t there, but during the -- the -- the height of the war it wasn\u2019t. But when\nthe war came to the end, the pressure was put on Bucharest. It wasn\u2019t Dresden.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yes, but it was a lot of pressure.",
        "Q: It was bad enough for you.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So we knew that every day. And then we had to -- to hide ourselves now in the basement of\nthe building, eventually move from my friends and my father\u2019s -- my mother found a small\napartment in a building in which another family from Iasi, also going as refugee escaping, which\nis a family of -- Rosenhaupt family. And in fact, it was the parents of the famous Israeli lawyer\nand politician, Meier Rosenne. Our parents were friends in -- in bu -- in Iasi, so hum -- somehow\nthey got together, found the same building, and they moved into an -- one apartment. It was a\nsmall building with several apartments. And they were in another apartment in the same\nbuilding. They knew -- th-the parents knew th -- I knew Meier from -- from his childhood, but\nthen we really became close because we\u2019d be together, we\u2019d play together, and we would run to\nthe -- to the basement together at 11 o\u2019clock when the sirens will -- will start. And that happened\nfor weeks. A number of houses were destroyed, and unfortunately the Barad family found an\napartment in another place, the one I talked to you. And unfortunately that was -- that place was\nclose to the Bucharest railway station. And the railway station was a part of the -- the bombing\ntarget in the fourth of April. There was blanket bombing there by the British. A lot was\ndestroyed, the station was almost un -- disabled, I don\u2019t know was completely. But their house\nwas bombed, and she was killed. The -- the baby was -- was with us one week before in the car\nand escaped the war in Iasi, was killed, and the -- the two boys were buried in the rubble of the\nhouse, which we learned later, when the youngest boy found ou -- us, after having been buried\nunder the rubble for three days and three nights. And he came out, they were pulled out from the\nrubble by rescue teams when they found him in the rubble, and they found there was some\nplaque hanging there by his mother saying, if this boy is found somewheres, you know, alone,\nbring him either at that address, her address, or to the fa -- Catz family, who is on the street\nMogos Vornicu five, where we are [indecipherable]. Or not Mogos Vornicu five, it was Kolono\nMoraro, one of the addresses. But this is how he could found us -- find us. He was -- his face and\nhead were swollen from being hit by the bombing and debris and being on no food and no water\n[indecipherable] the air for under the debris until he was rescued. He could move, but his head\nwas very swollen, I remember his swollen head, and he found us and told what happened. And in\nthe process, you know, she had the -- the -- her purse with all her -- their fortune was lost. She --\nthey had money and, you know, gold coins, whatever they had they lost, and they were poor like\n[indecipherable] so we had to help them, too, in that situation. But -- and they were victimized a\nsecond time, that family Barad, a really unlucky case. And then the -- then, you know, we went\nthrough the spring with so many bombings. Yes, my -- given the risk, I -- there were the same\ntreatment. I had to carry here --",
        "Q: In case something happened.",
        "A: Yes, with a name and who I am and where I should be brought. And my mother sewed some\nthings which they still had, some gold coins in my -- in my pants, yeah, and tell me always keep\nthat pants, don\u2019t -- don\u2019t give it away and you know, know that in the need, that\u2019s what -- how\nyou can pay for your food. Fortunately, our house was not bombed, and we lived 1n it throughout\nthe bombing, until the middle of August, 23\" of August when Romania shifted sides.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And two, three days later, the Russian tanks came into Bucharest, because the -- Romania\ncame out of the war by -- by political maneuver with the king, and the -- Antonescu was arrested,\nand the Romania shifted sides. Then the Romanian army stopped fighting, and the Russian army\nwas already in the east and with no opposition, advanced very quickly and tanks came into\nBucharest, and I remember the Russian tanks coming, and me waving them, and my mother\nwaving them, and finally the liberators.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: You know, you hear -- s -- hear so many things about American liberating people in Dachau\nand then all the camps. We were not in a physical camp like that, but I -- I surely recognize the\nfeeling of people who are in a -- in that state, and are liberated by -- by the army who comes\nthere, so --",
        "Q: And a smile on your face, that\u2019s how you felt.",
        "A: Oh, it was terrific --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- you know, yes. And in addition, you know, my mother was able to talk to the Russian\nsoldier who are [indecipherable] --",

        "A: -- she speaks Russian, yeah, I knew a few words.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I even had an adventure with them because then, you know, I was there and next two or three,\nfour or five days the Russians all came, and they -- a few of them camped in a little square. And I\ncame to them, I said, you know, \u201cDobry Deni,\u201d and they were really surprised --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- so all very happy, all of them were missing their own children, gave me bread, gave me\nother thing. And then they said, \u201cDo you want to come in the -- in -- in the truck?\u201d We are going\nhere, they say. I understood something that they g-go to fetch something, and will come back.\nAnd I say yes, and I got into the car. And they started driving and driving and driving and I mean\nI don\u2019t know whether the story is of any interest, so let me stop here. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: The place -- they were taking you someplace?",
        "A: They were taking me -- well, in short, they took me to a forest where they have an\nammunition depot, and loaded the truck with ammunition. That was still when the Germans were\nbombing Bucharest.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And that took a few hours and in the meantime, my mother --",
        "Q: Was hysterical.",
        "A: -- absolutely mad, hysterical, and I couldn\u2019t do anything, I was with them, and they could\nhave taken me. They brought me back, late, after six hours of -- my mother was on the street,\nsaw me, and I don\u2019t want to put on video, but I got my pants down and I got a spanking.",
        "Q: Spanking.",
        "A: You know?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: A spanking in the street, I will never forget that.",
        "Q: Did she ever spank you before?",
        "A: Not quite, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Not this way. I mean, she said never, never [indecipherable]. No, she didn\u2019t -- she didn\u2019t\nspank me, but sometime it happens, you get -- and you got that.",
        "Q: Right. But this was real, this was --",
        "A: This was real, yeah, oh I mean she -- she was out of her mind, she was -- that\u2019s the end of me,\nthat I was kidnapped, I was killed --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- I was something, I will never return.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the benefit of a cell phone, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Ah. Yeah. So.",
        "Q: All right, we have to stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape Seven\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "Q: Michael, I know that the -- that we have a -- a -- many, many years we could still cover, but\nfor today I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to do that, and so --",
        "A: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s late, it\u2019s --",
        "Q: It\u2019s late. So that if you can give a kind of summary of -- a sort of outline of what happened to\nyou, and then we can close it off and -- and start on another day.",
        "A: Yes, well, I believe we reached the -- virtually the end, almost the end of the war, when\nRomania shifted sides, and then what happened, relevant to the past, that th -- we mean the past\nis, that we -- we really tied ti -- tried to find out what happened to everybody else in our family.\nAs I mentioned, we had a large family on the other side --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- where they were in camps. And my mother had a very, very intensive way to do the search,\nand wiv -- she found some of the people, found out about others who died. My cousin, Zioma,\nwho was in the camp, as I mentioned, in Marculesti, and hi -- another camp he was, I remember\nhe and Uca were first in Rawoutsel, a camp, and then in Marculesti, and then in Cecilnica. As\nthey came back to Balti, my cousin Zioma went into the army after a little while, because the war\nstill went on, and lo and behold, he appears in Bucharest in the uniform of the army which freed,\nyou know, so you can imagine our -- because the last we knew was -- of him was when that\ndoctor found them and brought them the -- the blanket.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And he reported to us with a letter from them that the blanket was delivered, which was a\nlifesaver for them in that time. So he came and we were happy, in fact, I have a picture with him\ncoming, and I don\u2019t have it here with me if you ask for it, but it\u2019s at home if you need it. So we\nwere very happy. The other cousin of mine, Monea, who fought all the way to Berlin, and we are\nvery proud, and was decorated, and was wounded, and became a cripple for the rest of the life\nhis [indecipherable] came twice to Bucharest. And so we were very rejoicing 1n those -- and also,\nyou know, mourning those whom we learned were lost. So it was a f-family stock-taking of what\nhappened to all of us, and how we -- we went through. And that again, before -- beyond the stock\ntaking, helped cultivate in me the sense of family and what -- how important, I mean the\nsolidarity and the family solidarity is a very big, important value for me throughout my life and I\nbelieve those hard times instilled that value, and my mother deliberately instilled it. And -- to the\npoint, in fact, that even after my mother\u2019s death, I felt the need to go to -- as I -- I think I\nmentioned, to the place of my birth, to Balti and to find out the place, and I found that\n[indecipherable] the synagogue didn\u2019t exist, but I found there another si -- very relative moment\nof Holocaust. In that synagogue, you know, people who came back to town -- it was also my\nfamily, my town. And they said Kaddish, and I -- I was given by the Jewish community from\nBalti, some Kaddish cardboards, and where the Kaddish words were written in Slavic le --\nletters, for people to be able to pronounce the -- the Hebrew word, you know, [speaks Hebrew\nhere] . But all thing with Russian letters because, as I was explained, the people in\nBalti, many of them didn\u2019t know the torit Hebrew. And I got that cardboard, one of them is in the\nHolocaust Museum, but not in yours, in the Holocaust Museum in --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] in New York",
        "A: -- in New York. I have another one, which 1s a -- a historic document, Kaddish, and -- and --\nwl --",
        "Q: And we\u2019ll show that in a little bit.",
        "A: Fine, fine, 1f you want to --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] yes.",
        "A: -- you\u2019re welcome. So then, you know, the life fell back into normal except that we are -- w-\nwe were bearing memory --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and the consciousnesses we gained. I went back to school, I went to a Jewish school, my\nparents kept me to a Jewish school as long as Jewish schools were around in Romania, until 48\nwhen the education system was reformed, all became state schools. And I continued my Jewish\neducation, I had my Bar Mitzvah with a very memorable teacher, Mrs. Eisenstein, who was\nanother formative element, maybe Ill tell you privately another time about her, but she was a\nremarkable person, Hannah Eisenstein. A book about her was printed in Israel, includes my\nmemories of her, and Meier Rosenne\u2019s memories, because he also was a -- a student of her in\nRomania before he left for Israel.",
        "Q: And she taught you Hebrew?",
        "A: She taught me Hebrew, she taught him Hebrew.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: [indecipherable] that his parents decided to go to Israel very soon, when my parents decided\nto apply for immigration it was too late, and they were rejected. So that\u2019s why I stayed in\nRomania. But she was our mora, our teacher at the beginning and we both -- every time I meet\nMeier Rosenne now, we still talk about what she taught us, you know. She was very important to\nme. And then I -- I went into research after I went to [indecipherable] training, I did research,\nlearned sociology. Also, it\u2019s a complex period, with a lot of political implications and --",
        "Q: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: -- it -- it was kind of profoundly affected. I believe you asked me a question how it changed\nmy life. So my life was changed in the sense that I became concerned professionally too, about\nhow societies develop and change in political systems. And I did my research in sociology when\nthat became possible. I am trained in philosophy and sociology and then my research was --\nbecame of interest to other scholars internationally, so I was invited to the United State, to the\nCenter for Advanced Studies [indecipherable] that think tank, which I mentioned.",
        "Q: Yeah, think tank, yes.",
        "A: And my wife, Stella Cernea was also a sociologist. She was trained and she became a\nassistant profe -- associate professor at the university. When I applied to become the same, and I\ngot my Ph.D., I was told no, we don\u2019t take Jews any more, point blank. And this was happening\nin -- in \u00b058, \u00b059.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: In -- in communist Romania. So fortunately I was able to continue my work as a researcher in\nthe system of the academy of sciences, and I did my research there, which apparently was\nimportant enough to be picked up by American scholars. Then, unfortunately, my wife died --\nStella, and -- by a brain hemorrhage and aneurysm.",
        "Q: And this was in the 60\u2019s?",
        "A: And this was in the -- \u201968. Put it very briefly, I -- I received at that same time the invitation to\ngo to the center where I went two years later after a epic fight between that center and Romanian\nauthorities, who would not allow me -- would not give me a visa, period, until they gave it under\nAmerican pressure. And I was there -- I had to come back because they came -- kept my two\nchildren hostage, and my mother took care of them while I was away. So I stayed from \u201971 until\n\u00b074, when I again was invited by the American Sociological Association and traveled to Canada\nand the U.S.. I decided not to return at that time, and I could do that because the children were --\nwere older and I could still count on -- on them to survive well and to -- until I was able to get\nthem out. And really, it took an hour and a half -- I-I\u2019m sorry, a year and a half, almost, to -- to\nget them out. Fortunately I was offered a job as the first sociologist to be hired by the World\nBank, that happened in \u201974, just when I left Romania. So that was another one of the twists and\nchances in life which happened, and hey, I did, I hope well in that job. So it brought me great\ngratification, realizing a lot of my values and ideals in helping poor people in societies and\nchanging people\u2019s life. I honestly believe I made some contribution in that. And that brings me to\nthe present day, Joan, wh-when --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- I retired from the bank. I do continue my work and my writing.",
        "Q: When did you retire from the bank?",
        "A: I retired from the bank at the end of \u201976, beginning \u201977. I published a number of books in the\nmeantime. I keep laboring on --",
        "Q: Wait a minute, \u201976 or \u201977? No.",
        "A: No, sorry, no.",
        "Q: \u00b096.",
        "A: \u00b096 - 797.",
        "Q: Yes",
        "A: Sorry, sorry. \u00b096 - 97.",
        "Q: And when did -- you remarried?",
        "A: That was a -- I was about to say, I remarried in \u201987.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: With Ruth, my wife, she is also an anthropologist. If you want to know the story, there\u2019s a\nvery funny story because -- anyway, I have to -- let me tell you. It was a nice -- after so many sad\nstories, this is a nice story to record. As an anthropologist at the World Bank in Washington, I\nwas trying to be in touch with the community of Washington anthropologists, which there is an\nassociation, WAPA, Washington Association of Professional Anthropologists. And while at\nanthropological meetings, I bought a book at the meeting, because I saw an interesting book,\nwhich was about -- it\u2019s called, \u201c\u201cAfikoman in Exile\u2019, about the ritual of Passover from an\nanthropological viewpoint.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Which I read, I enjoyed very much. I knew much -- learned much more about that. And in one\nof the outings of that Washington Association for Professional Anthropologists, sa -- and went --\nwent to the races, if you can imagine. And we ate, we gathered a large group and somehow in\nanthropology the discussion came about Passover rituals and somebody said something, you\nknow, we engage in a discussion and we have a little -- a really sharp discussion because I\nthought I was there -- maybe another Jewish, or anthropologist or two, and I knew well to say\nthat I, you know, knew the book, and I kept my thinking sa -- on some points. Somebody had a\ndifferent opinion, there was there a lady who had a different opinion and that intrigued me. And\nshe was very firm in her opinion and I was very firm in mine. But I couldn\u2019t convince her, so\nthat\u2019s was it, you know, we went home and the boss as -- before telling -- saying goodbye, I told\nher, \u201cAnd I think really I was right, you were not right on the point, and to see that, you need to\nread the book about that. And this is a book called \u201cAfikoman in Exile,\u201d and you will see,\u201d I\nsaid. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t, I know -- I think -- I think I know I\u2019m right and I don\u2019t have to read that\nbook.\u201d So that was -- I say, \u201cWhy?\u201d She said, \u201cI wrote it.\u201d Well that concluded the argument,\nthat concluded the argument, so --",
        "Q: And did you start dating soon afterwards?",
        "A: Well, I -- I tried to -- yes, I went straight to the book and looked at what they said about the\nbiography of that lady.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: In the bio-note of that book --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and yes, I did call her, and we met and fortunately we could get married.",
        "Q: Yes. That\u2019s a very interesting beginning, it might have been disaster.",
        "A: Yes, that was the first argument she won, I have to say not the last. But it was -- I -- I -- I won\nalso some.",
        "Q: You won some arguments, I\u2019m sure.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And your -- you have two children from your first marriage, both of whom are physicians?",
        "A: I have two children, yes, both are physicians. This is my daughter Darna, who -- I didn\u2019t tell\nyou that after my -- I saw -- they took me a ni -- year and a half to bring me my children. I had\nfamily here in America, also branches of the family from Bessarabia, again cousins, the Jacobsen\nfamily from Buffalo, and the Rochester fami -- the Davis family from Rochester. Also a relative\nof ours, whose, you know, grandfathers, or fathers left earlier from Balti and came to the States\nlong before the Holocaust.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And my mother tracked them down and mobilized them to plead with their political\nrepresentative in the Congress, and in the Senate, to press for the freeing of the children and of\nmy mother from back in Romania. And they did, they -- you know, the senator of New York was\n-- Rochester, Buffalo, you know, for New York the senator was Senator Javits.",
        "Q: Javits, sure.",
        "A: So they told him the story, he wrote the letter to the -- to the Romanian ambassador. In\nStanford while I was there, I met Alan Dershowitz, who was also a fellow like myself with -- to\nwhom I entrusted my -- my desire to -- to come and he say, \u201cMichael, if you want to come now, I\nwill help you now, legally. If you want to go back, go back to the children.

My son had to go to\nhigh school here, at Georgetown [indecipherable], he was a very good student. He wanted to get\ncircumcision as I told you, at his initiative which he is proud to this day, I am proud to this day.\nBecause he didn\u2019t have the chance of a Jewish education in Bucharest. And now they created\ntheir own family, Darna is married, Eric [indecipherable] who has a Jewish French origin. They\nhave three children.

        "A: Yes, it is a difficult story, I thank you for your patience, and prompting and good questions\nand keeping so well, track. I think it\u2019s important that that story be known because it has -- you\nknow, it\u2019s lifes, individual life\u2019s which interfere with history in crucial juncture moments of\nhistory, which therefore individualized may -- in happening, may become more relevant for\nbroader purposes of identity or of faith, of history, of social change, political change. So I\u2019m glad\nthat you invited me to put on the record those things, and I hope that my children children\u2019s\nchildren and so on will sometime also see that video, you and me talking, and --",

        "Q: And who is this?",
        "A: This -- the picture of my great grandfath -- parents. This is -- the lady\u2019s name is Chaya. The\nman\u2019s name is Ushar. Chaya is the mother of my grandfather, Zollman Mayhel Faerstein. And\nthis picture was taken apparently about exactly a century ago in 1905, or maybe 1906 because\nthe family\u2019s story is that they left Balti at that age in that state. Apparently they were above 70 or\neven more, deciding to leave their family behind and going to the Holy Land to die there and to\nbe buried in the Holy Land. And lo and behold, they had the courage, the stamina, and the\nstrength, to accomplish that dream, and left Balti in 1906 or 1907. Finally they arrived in\nJerusalem. I don\u2019t know how they did it, because they spoke only Yiddish and maybe a bit of\nRussian and they had to travel, of course, by horse, and by cart until they got to the train and then\nfrom the train they should have crossed the sea by boat, and then to arrive, but they made it. And\nthey arrived in Jerusalem, lived Maya Sharim. As you can see he\u2019s -- has a beard, and has payas\nand the -- the traditional caftan. And my mother and I visited the cemetery in which we knew\nthat they were buried. And that was still during my mother\u2019s life, and my mother discovered in\nthe books their names. And we found their -- her grave in the cemetery of Jerusalem on the\nMount of Olives. We didn\u2019t find Ushar\u2019s grave because Ushar grave was desecrated by the\nJordanians when they controlled that part of Jerusalem. Last year I spent six weeks in Jerusalem\nat the Hebrew University, and I went back to retrieve the -- the grave of my great great great-\ngrandmother. So fi -- I did find it, cleaned the -- the gravestone, her name is there, exactly when\nshe died, and I brought the pictures back to my grandchildren. I would hope to get there with my\ngrandchildren so they get a tangible sense of heritage, of -- of family history. And I still try to\nfind out, to construct the full family tree, which -- for which I have a lot of data, but I have to put\nit on a good chart.",
        "Q: And this group?",
        "A: This picture is real historic picture, is a picture of the synagogue of Balti before the war, when\nthe synagogue was -- is -- it still existed. People attended the service and somebody took that\npicture which somehow arrived in my mother\u2019s hand and she saved it through the entire ordeal of\nmy family lifes until -- then brought it to the United States. So here in that picture you can see\nmy grandfather, Zollman Mayhel Faerstein, whose name 1s carried by my brother Zolly, as an\nold man there. And two of his sons, who are my mother\u2019s cousins and my uncles. This is Uncle\nYosl on the extreme right of the picture and Uncle Shrul, a bit younger. So the others -- I know\nsome names from my mother, but they are not relatives. But we are very proud to have this\npicture. But I like to say that I was very gratified realizing at my granddaughter\u2019s Bat Mitzvah\nthat all my grandchildren were extremely happy and proud to have their pictures of their family\ntree, counting themselves as the sixth generation down from Haier Faerstein. So this great great\ngreat-grandmother, that made them very happy and very proud. So I am very proud of them, too.\nWe have other pictures further, if you want to look.",
        "Q: Yes [indecipherable]. And this picture?",
        "A: This picture is my grandparents on my mother\u2019s side. It is Zollman Mayhel Faerstein, the man\nwhom you saw in the prior picture in the synagogue, the elderly gentleman. This is shortly after\nmy mother was born. In the picture is also my grandmother, Brana -- Brana Baratz Faerstein, and\nher little daughter Shanya, or Seindel Faerstein. She\u2019s barely one year old, and the picture\napparently was taken at the same time with the initial picture when the family went to the only\nphotographer in town, because the -- the parents, Chaya and Ushar decided to leave the country,\nso they made pictures. Zollman Mayhel is already the father of six children before my mother.\nAnd you can see he 1s still looking as a young -- relatively young man. For Brana, his second\nwife, this is the only and first child -- the first child and the only child, Shanya. This is how\nfamilies were at that time.",
        "Q: And this picture?",
        "A: In this picture you can see my other grandparents, on my father\u2019s side. This is Itic Catz, or\nItac Catz, and his wife Ava, or Chava, of whom I -- whom I both mentioned in -- in the prior\nnarrative of my life. They were in Roman. He was a -- a s -- a very small shopkeeper, is a grocer.\nThey were rather poor. My other grandparent in the prior picture had a workshop producing\nsoap, also very artisanal thing. But as you can see, he was also very distinguished in his looks,\nwith a very respectable beard. Kind of stiff in the picture, unusual for him to be photographed.\nHis wife Chava is the person whom I described to you as my grandmother who was rather short\nand heavy. You can see that he is sitting and she is standing and they are almost the same height,\nbecause she wasn\u2019t very tall and she grew bigger. The young man there is my father at a young\nage. He was in his teens, I believe; my father, Marcu Catz. I believe he was maybe 16 - 17,\nbecause his brother, Bernard, my Uncle Bernard is not in the picture, otherwise he would have\nbeen in the picture. The reason he 1s not is that he had to leave the town in which they left,\nRoman, because he was -- he got involved in some political activities a bit of the left, and he was\nbadly beaten up and threatened. We have some pictures in the family of his being bitten -- I\nmean, the wounds he -- he endured in that beating and it was unsafe for him to stay so he left --\nhad to leave with his left leanings to Paris, where he could practice them a bit more. And then he\nleft France for Canada where he established a family, but married in the typical Jewish way with\na girl he met on the boat, and established the family. He\u2019s had one son, Charlie Kent, my cousin,\nwho established a very beautiful family, the Kent family with four children in Toronto and\nPhoenix and the States. Many grandchildren. Charlie married -- married Ida, who is still alive.\nMy uncle -- Charlie Kent passed away, but they helped decisively in the -- in taking out my\nbrother Zolly from Romania. In fact, ransoming him with money from the govern -- Romania\u2019s\ngovernment, and this is how Zolly and his family arrived in Canada. But Bernard, unfortunately,\nis missing from this picture.",
        "Q: Right [inaudible]",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And who\u2019s this?",
        "A: This is my grandmother, again on the mother\u2019s side. I called her Babba Brana, this is Brana\nBaratz Faerstein, and the little person over there is me. That -- there is an inscription on the back\nof the picture which shows that at that age I was 11 months old. But you can see that my\ngrandmother still looked very -- was a very beautiful -- the very beautiful woman she was here,\nwith -- with white hair. In the earlier pictures with my mother at that age, she had hair was still\ndark and black. Young and beautiful and now she has -- that is what, about 30 years later, or so.",
        "Q: And here?",
        "A: Here are my two grandmothers. On the right there 1s Babba Brana, yes, who is my mother\u2019s\nmother, and on the other side is Babba Ava or Chava, who was my father\u2019s mother. They were\nwith us in Iasi. This 1s a picture taking -- taken just about a year after the -- before the beginning\nof the war. The front person is -- small baby is my brother Zolly, and I am hiding behind him,\nshowing only my head. Zolly this age had -- about 15 months or so, the grandmothers are both\nvery proud and keep a very possessive hand on him, this was the latest sign of the family. And\nthis is a very happy picture because it\u2019s a first -- the last picture I have with both my\ngrandmothers in the same picture. When the war started, they didn\u2019t make pictures any more.\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: Okay, go ahead.",
        "A: What you can see now Is the yellow star, the famous yellow star which the Jews from several\nparts of Romania were forced to wear. That part included Iasi. And that was the star I had, in\nfact, the stars were circulating in the family between me and my father. They had to be sewn on\nour garments whenever we went out. They -- if you use the same garment it stays the same, but if\nwe change the garment we cannot go outside without the yellow star. So my mother saved two of\nour yellow stars. One of them is in the Jewish museum in -- Holocaust museum in New York,\nthis is the second and I -- I -- that was my own and my father\u2019s, for some time. For --",
        "Q: And did you -- did you have to purchase these, or were these homemade?",
        "A: No, no, they were handmade by each family and this is why you have also variety. They were\nsewn in the house out of yellow fabric and black fabric.",
        "Q: And the pens are for scale?",
        "A: And the pen is in for scale, and you can see how it was. In fact, we had in our home, a sewing\nmachine, and that was used; I remembered how it looked, and it used for garment too, cause at --\nevery family sew a lot of garments at that time for themselves. But it -- 1t was used to\nmanufacture our yellow stars.",
        "Q: And what are these documents right here?",
        "A: These are documents from 1942, in the height of the Holocaust period. The first one is an\norder which my father received from the military authority of Iasi for the commandant -- you\nknow, the commander of the military authority, to be on call, to be ready that he is going to be\ncalled for duties, unspecified, and he should be ready any time such call will be made. It will be\ncommunicated loudly and he\u2019s bound to come to the address mentioned in the order, under sever\n-- severe penalty. It\u2019s also indicated that he was allocated to be a member of a -- a labor team\nnumber 38, to be led by another Jewish man named Kaufman, Yuda. His name was also written\nthere. The name of my father 1s up there, Marcu L from Leib, Catz. The -- the threat was terrible\nbecause it does not -- it did not specify what will happen to them. Other Jews from Iasi received\nthe same order, and the fear was that this is a systematic call again to -- to eliminate them, to kill\nthem. Indeed then it was -- became known that they have to present themselves, the specific\nplace was the railway station, exactly the same station where the Jews in the -- were put on the\ndeath train. So then my father was informed that he has to be present at a certain day there,\ntogether with other Jews. And with fear in his heart, he had to go. The bureac -- and he went.\nFortunately we saw him back. But this second document 1s the certificate which the military\nbureaucracy handed over to him to -- as a proof that he indeed responded to the call and was\nthere. That was important document too, to protect him from the accusation that he did not show\nup. So this our family document saved. There were more like that, but not all were sa -- saved.",
        "Q: And what is this?",
        "A: This is a document about myself. I believe I mentioned earlier that in 1942, the Romanian\ngovernment decided to make a full census of the Jewish population and they asked the\nFederation of Jewish Communities to do that. It was called the Center Organization of the Jews.\nWhatever the name -- Centrala Evreilor din Romania. So again we got extremely afraid that the -\n- the census of all Jews is being made to keep good track of where they are and who they are,\nwhen the decision will be made that they could be picked up and -- and something done not very\ngood to them. So this card however, is also very important historical document because it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nblunt, it say, this 1s a census -- Recensamintul locuitoriln cu ringelvreese. The census for\ninhabitants having Jewish blood. I mean, this is -- they were not mincing words. The ethnic bias\nis clear, blood bias. You have Jewish blood, you are a different category of person. The name is\nthere, Catz, Moise, my name, our address, Iasi, street Colonel Langa, tracepervachi, which 1s 13.\nMy fa -- because I was a minor in 1942, my father and that -- June \u201942 is mentioned there as the\ndate, my father has to put his identity number on the left side of the card. Now, on the back of the\ncard, you can see two stamps. One is the -- the stamps of the Iasi police, and the other one 1s --\nthe first one is the Iasi police with the crown of the king over there you can see in the first. And\nthe second is the stamp of the Jewish community of Iasi, giving authenticity to this document.",
        "Q: And this document?",
        "A: This document is something -- is a gift which I received from the Jewish community of Balti\nin 1994 where I returned to my birth -- town of birth, simply to see how it looked at that time. I\nwas on a World Bank mission to Moldova for developing programs which the bank was\ndeveloping for Moldova, in my capacity the senior advisor at that time at the bank for social\npolicies. I also spoke the language of course, so I went on that mission, and I took a few days off\nfrom the work problem to be able to visit my town, Balti. At that time I wanted to see the\nsynagogue in which my -- my grandfather was praying in his time, but it had been destroyed long\nbefore by the war, and very little was left from Balti -- from past Balti. So I was told however\nthat the new synagogue was created in a home, which was built like a usual home, a dwelling,\nbut in -- it\u2019s used as a synagogue and was taken there. And then I saw there indeed, in \u201994,\nthrough the people who are living in Balti, the Jews living in Balti, in a -- in a Saturday morning,\nwith a full service done as -- by usual service. My leader, th-the person who brought me there\nwas my cousin, first cousin, Zioma Faerstein, who was -- whom I mentioned before, who was\nliving with his family still at that time in Balti, in \u00b094. He took me to the synagogue and\nexplained to me -- I -- I wanted to have some kind of memory and I asked whether I can have\nsomething from that -- they say we cannot give you any sidur, because we have very little\nsidurim, there are not enough, we don\u2019t have any other items. But I notice in that corner, some\ncardboards with some inscriptions. I say, \u201cWhat are these?\u201d They say, \u201cWell, these are things\nwhich we had to write when we opened up -- came back from -- from the camps and there were a\nlot of people who died in the camps, and those who stayed alive wanted to say Kaddish after\nthem, pray. But they didn\u2019t know to the Kaddish, the Hebrew Kaddish words. So we had to write\nthe Hebrew Kaddish with Slavic -- with Cyrillic letters so they can pronounce, reading in Cyrillic\nletters, the -- the words of the Kaddish. At that time we wrote -- we created the black -- the\ncardboards, and these are some of them.\u201d On the right hand corner you can see the Hebrew word\nfrom Kaddish, the dollit is missing. Only k-u then sheen. On the left hand corner is Kaddish the\nsame word with Cyrillic letters, and then the whole Kaddish is written in Cyrillic letter. [speaks\nHebrew] and so on. And this is a prayer which Jews from all the entire world are\nsaying in the memory of those whom they lost. It was very moving to me to see that -- that\ndocument, historic document improvised, a product of the Holocaust whose -- who was needed\nbecause of the Holocaust, who will -- had to be manufactured by hand because there was no\nprayer books. And I ask whether I can have at least one of them to me. They said you can have\nthem all because by now we have [indecipherable]. And they ended up giving me three of them.\nSo I brought them with me. One 1s this one, another one is in the Holocaust museum in New\nYork. The third one is with me still, waiting if your Holocaust museum, Joan, want to exhibit it,\nI\u2019m happy to -- to give it there. It is extremely meaningful for me because it 1s from the same\ntown I was born and from the synagogue, but I believe it\u2019s meaningful for the entire history of\nwhat the Holocaust mean -- meant, and how people came out of the Holocaust having to cry for\nthose whom they lost.",
        "Q: Okay, and this?",
        "A: This is a plaque, a memorial plaque which my mother commissioned after she arrived in the\nU.S. to -- for the memory of those in the family who died during the Holocaust and for the other\npeople in the family who passed away. She donated the money for planting trees in Israel in their\nmemory, and then ordered this plaque and she\u2019s -- it\u2019s written there, this garden of trees in Israel\nis in honor of the families Faerstein, Catz and Baratz, the families which I mentioned, made by\nShanya Faerstein Catz. In parenthesis, Buchika which is a nickname which the small kids a --\nyou know, gave to her, my kids gave to my mother, Buchika, and this is how she was left in our\nfamily. And on the left hand side there are the names of people who died in normal\ncircumstances before, or maybe after the Holocaust, but not in camps. It includes my\ngrandfather, my grandmother and so on. Some of them were in the Holocaust, my father,\nincluding my late wife, Stella Yavetz Catz Cernea. On the right hand side are the names of many\nof those who died in Transnistria, I mean in the -- in the former Bessarabia, Balti and the other\ncamps which I mentioned during my narrative. All of them whom she knew as certainly having\ndied in those camps by the time she -- she ordered this plaque. Subsequently she found out that\nothers, who are not here, also passed away, but their names are not [indecipherable]. In fact,\nthere were more than the 25 she mentions here.",

        "A: Yeah, when all the professional Jews were -- were, by law, fired from all places, so all of a\nsudden he became unemployed, as in fact I did, more or less the same time, although I was only\nwhat, eight, nine years old, because all the Jewish kids, by another law at the same time, were\nexpelled from all the state schools.",
        "A: SO --",
        "A: -- we shared -- we shared fates, yes.",
        "A: No, no, my father was a very warm person, loved me very much. I was his first born, so he\ninvested himself a lot in me. And I loved him, and course he was a constant presence in my life,\nso to say th -- spiritual presence too, he gave me my religious education when I was a child, and\nmy intellectual education he contributed very much because he was an intellectual, too. And --\nand my mother was also an intellectual, she was trained as a pharmacist.",
        "A: Yes. They both, in fact, met in the university in Iasi, where they got to know -- came to know\neach other, then got married. And my mother was a pharmacist, she was well educated also in\nliterature, which she loved, and was multilingual. Very bright woman, an extraordinarily strong\npresence in my life. And when I was unfortunate to lose my father in the late 60\u2019s, after illness,\nwhich is due largely to the to the pogrom in Iasi, my mother lived until her -- close to her 90\u2019s\nand she came to the States. I brought her to the States, in fact, and we had a very good time here.\nAnd therefore, she -- her presence in my life lasted until just 14 years ago.",
        "A: And it was a very presence -- a very strong presence. I owe -- I owe a very great deal to my\nmother for all I have done and for the way I am.",
        "A: For my values, so it was a very tight family life. I have a brother, is -- that 1s part also of your\nquestion?",
        "A: His name is Zolly, Zolly Catz. His name 1s -- the Jewish name is Zollman. And he 1s -- carries\nthe name of my grandfather of my mother\u2019s side. Be -- I -- my name Moiseti 1s -- Moiset is the\nname of my great-grandfather, also my mother\u2019s side.",

        "A: -- greatfather, yes, Moisei Baraz. So that was my mother, and I was very fortunate to have in\nour home, in addition to my brother and my parents, my grandmothers, on both sides.",
        "A: On both sides, until late. I mean, my grandmother on my father\u2019s side, named Eva -- Chava\nwas a s-strongest religious presence in the house, lived with us until the 1944.",
        "A: I knew also my grandfather on my father\u2019s sti -- side. His name is Itic -- Itic. And he passed\naway when I was a child, but I remember him when they visited us, in a kind of cart with horses.\nI remember his very imposing -- both my grandfathers were very imposing Jews, tall, both tall,\nwith gray beards, with payas --",
        "A: -- yes. So they hard to forget. And then my parents spoke very often with great reverence\nabout their parents, so I know a lot about that.",
        "A: It was a tight family, close family, and -- and you know, I inherited the -- the -- the devotion\nto the idea of family from -- from my own parents\u2019.",
        "A: Well, we had a large home by Romanian standards. It would be a -- a -- a [indecipherable] or\na tight home by American standards --",
        "A: -- yes. You know, is -- I slept with my brother in a room, or otherwise he sl -- I slept in the --\nor he slept in the so-called living room which doubled o -- [indecipherable] living room, and in a\ncorner had a bed for my -- one of my grandmothers, so that --",
        "A: -- I don\u2019t complain, it was a good family life, yeah.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t say that my family was among the poorest families, Jewish families, no, because\nthey were middle class.",
        "A: Middle class.",
        "A: No, until -- on a -- only after -- until my father was employed --",
        "A: -- then we had periods, long periods when my father did not make, you know, a salary.",
        "A: Had to improvise, and to expose himself to very risky activities to -- to bring something on\nthe table --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Seindel.",
        "A: Sein -- Seindel, yes, Seindel, and her name 1s in Jewish, yeah Seindel -- Shinya -- no, sorry,\nher Jewish name 1s Seindel, her -- the name by which everybody knew her and called her was the\nRussian diminutive of Seindel, which was Shanya.",
        "A: Shanya, yes.",
        "A: Shanya.",
        "A: She -- she was pr -- very proud of her family name as a girl, which was half a century before\nmodern feminist bent. And she always liked to call herself Shanya Faerstein Catz.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And this is what she wanted to be written on her gravestone and this is how I wrote on her\ngravestone.",
        "A: Yes, it was unusual, it was not frequent. But she was bright, she wanted to get educated. Her\nfather was really enamored by her, her mother. She was his only child of her mother, who was\nthe second wife of my grandfather. My grandfather had six children for his first marriage, and\nthen his wife died, Chava died, and -- and he married my grandmother, Brana, who came from a\n-- a -- another little shtetl, Briceva, also there. Brana Baraz. And their only child was my mother,\nso it was a child, at old age you can imagine --",
        "A: -- how dear -- in fact, I have a -- a picture of my grandfather, imposing as he was, my -- my\ngrandmother and my mother at the age of one year, where she looks like a doll, you know.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, it was a --",
        "A: -- yeah, it was a happy household obviously, but it was not -- 1t was a Jewish household\nwhere you would have a fight and you would have some people screaming, and you have\narguments. Was a whole hullabaloo, you know? I do remember arguments, too. I do remember\nmy father getting upset and angry and you know, using strong words. He was a coyen and you\nknow, the Kohanim are -- are traditionally seen as people who are easily irritable.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, they have a short fuse.",
        "A: \u2019ma coyen, too.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve -- you know, going through so many cultures, I try to temper it -- that\ncharacteristic, but I wouldn\u2019t say that I am alien to my heritage. So I inherited that too. But -- so\nit was a normal household, Joan, nothing very special, but an educated household where, you\nknow, discussions were very often about politics, about broader issues and the daily life values.\nSometimes philosophy, you know --",
        "A: -- issues, political issues, tyranism, anti-Semitism, a lot of discussion the situation in\nRomania, the situation in Russia, whether Jews are doing better in Russia -- this was before the\nwar --",
        "A: -- and during the war what -- you know, a lot of discussion. My mother was involved early in\nthe Zionist movement. And she had connection there, so the matter came up and she -- I recall\nthat she would go to reunions of the Zionist women of Iasi at that time, and she came back and\nbrought and spoke to me about oranges who grow in Palestine. Yeah. And then sh -- they were\nalso involved on the left of center activities, like many other Jews at that time were in Romania,\nbut particularly my mother, coming from Russia had friends who were really enrolled in anti-\nFascist, an-and communist underground, and they, in fact, used the friendship with my mother to\nask her to give them shelter when they were pursued by the police. And -- and some of them\nslept and came and hid in our house and then disappeared as silently as they came. Only for us to\nrecognize them -- and my mother, of course, she knew, but then sh -- after the war, when they\nemerged as political leaders.",
        "A: And one of them even became a minister in gr -- Romania\u2019s government, who was in hiding\nin my mother\u2019s -- father\u2019s home, brought by that -- the people. So it was -- to come back to your\nquestion, 1t was a house where political issues were discussed, and I -- I listened as a child.",
        "A: I can -- I was not a participant in those discussions.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no, no, I don\u2019t re --",
        "A: -- no, I don\u2019t ever recall that I was sent to my toys, no.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, he was re -- a rel-religious person himself, he got the --",
        "A: -- very strong religious education for his father -- from his father. Went to the synagogue\npretty often, not every day, but when he wouldn\u2019t go to synagogue he will put tefillin in the\nmorning and do the prayers at home every single morning.",
        "A: For years, yes. So on the holidays we go to the synagogue, all of us, I remember -- like 1t was\none year -- you know, holiday I could play with the other kids for the entire day in the big\ncourtyard of the synagogue. Coming in, when the Kohanim gave their blessing of -- for the\ncongregation, something which doesn\u2019t happen here unfortunately. It\u2019s the only thing I am\ndisappointed because the Kohanim here are not -- except for very Orthodox synagogues are not\ncalled on high holidays to give their blessing you know, for the -- for the congregation. So at that\nmoment th-the prayer, even when I was small child, five, six, seven I was called in and I s-\nstrained to hear and recognize my father\u2019s voice because if you saw sometime the scene, the\nKohanim are the front, then they say to the back, to the congregation which is behind them, and\nat a certain point they all turn around but they have their heads covered by the big talit -- talitim.\nAnd their hands, which are -- are covered.",
        "A: Well, the Kohanim are supposed to give a blessing on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur on\nthe congregation. They -- there is a special text which is the blessing and which they have to\npronounce when they give the blessing. The -- they have to keep their hands in a blessing\nmovement, and the -- the way the hand have to be kept is to keep two fingers together on each\nhand, tight, and separated the two, and you keep your hand this way, yes.",
        "A: Which is not very easy.",
        "A: Not everybody can do it. But the Kohanim are trained to do that. Pll -- I can tell you how I\nwas trained to do that. And he would then say the blessing and the long prayers, stay with the\nback of the congregation and when they have to say Ivareh\u2019ha adonai ve\u2019ishmereha and so on,\nthey turn around to the congregation and say that in loud voice. And this is when I was trained --",
        "A: -- straining to recognize the voice of my father, and to tell you frankly, honestly, it still rings\nin my ears when I think of that.",
        "A: Yeah, is really -- he was really yelling, and I was able to recognize, among the chorus of the\nvoices.",
        "A: So, as a child before Bar Mitzvah you are not supposed to do that, but after Bar Mitzvah you\nare [indecipherable] you have to po -- so, as part of the -- when it came time to be prepare for the\nBat Mitzvah, there were terrible times already in Romania, the war started, the -- there was a\nmassacre, the pogrom of Iasi to -- in \u00b041, and I was to be Bar Mitzvah\u2019d in \u00b044. So from \u00b042, in\nfact, they took -- he took -- and my mother [indecipherable] for me a Melamed to teach me at\nhome because -- I believe we are jumping history, you know, again, but after the pogrom I\ncouldn\u2019t go to the school so I stayed at home for a full year. The Melamed would come and teach\nme, and will teach me Hebrew and other things, but one of the things of those teaching was to\nkeep my hand this way. And this was done very simple, anything body can do. Take a string and\ntie those two fingers together and those two fingers together --",
        "A: -- and then separate them. And do that several times and you\u2019ll end up able to --",
        "A: -- to do it. And most people when they try, they do it this way, and they cannot, th-they\ntremble, and -- try it, you'll s --",
        "A: It\u2019s not easy, so --",
        "A: -- you -- you tend to think that you cannot do it.",
        "A: But you can.",
        "A: If you [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: Yeah, wi -- we live in several houses, my parents never owned a house, so we had to move\nevery two, three years for rent purpose and for other things, so I remember some of our houses,\nand you know, you ca -- friendships depend on geographical location and on space patterns, so I\n-- [remember I had a very good friend, his name was Marcu Grunberg, in one house, which I\nterribly missed when we moved in another house and I kept looking for him years, and I found\nhim again when I was in my 20\u2019s or so -- looked for him. So there were some friends th -- this\nway then, in the last house we lived in the year before we went on refu -- or became refugees, I\nhad some kids in the same courtyard, which was basically a Jewish courtyard with one Romanian\nfamily, and I befriended -- befriended also the girl in that family, who was about my age. So\nbasically I had a mixed group of friends, I think. Most of them were Jewish, and then when I was\nthrown out of school and I resumed ler -- schooling after a year in a community, Jewish\ncommunity school, of course all my friends were Jews, yeah. That was my childhood, right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Because in Romanian -- rom -- in Romania we were identified as Jews.",
        "A: Not as Romanian, Romanian was a second kind -- of course we were -- my father was\nRomanian citizens, we all were Romanian citizens, but we were the Jews of Romania. Here in\nthe States, and you know, the American culture, you say always both, you know, Romanian\nAmericans, or Jewish Americans, or --",
        "A: So -- but over there it was very distinct. So when I say Romanian, I mean non-Jews. They\ncould be Romanian or even Hungarian people, and others, all kinds of national -- it didn\u2019t matter\nto me at that time, the exact ethnic identification, but we knew who was Jewish and who was not\nJewish.",
        "A: Yes. In fact, we were reminded very often that we are Jewish by those who were not.",
        "A: Yes, of course --",
        "A: -- yes, yes.",
        "A: In all kinds of ways. In school you are known and remembered. We had the very clear\nidentifier, the name. So being named Catz was from the very beginning a clear identifier to\neverybody, first the teachers, who knew that we are Jewish, and I\u2019m Jewish, and many of the\nkids, who heard a lot of things about Jews and non-Jews in their families. It was -- no, yo-you\nneed to understand also the background. Moldova, that part of Romania was heavily populated\nby Jews, and by the turn of the century, many townships in Romania and some bigger towns too,\nhad -- a majority of their population was Jewish. So the presence was massive, there was always\nan issue, and in Romania when I lived, it was the second town of Romania, and by that time it\nwas almost half -- a little bit less than half of the population was Jewish. I read documents which\nsaid at a certain point in time, the beginning, turn of the century or [indecipherable] before, the\nJewish population exceeded a little bit, 50 percent.",
        "A: In Iasi, yes. So that made everybody conscious and clear who it is and who isn\u2019t. The heavily\npopulated Jewish areas are almost homogeneously Jewish. Ours was not, we were a bit farther\naway from the massive Jewish concentration of Iasi. But our courtyard had still a majority of\nJewish people, even though our house was very close to the most important chur -- cathedral in --\nin Iasi, the Mitropolea, Mitropolea, which was a very important, the most important religious\nplace, Christian religious place. So this explains my reference, Joan.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, you can reason this way --",
        "A: -- the question wa -- the question is whether that was real what happened. In fact, the presence\nof many Jews made it easier for the ideologically anti-Semites to build their entire propaganda\nand advocacy ag -- against Jews, that here is a population which 1s a parasitic population, which\nis Oppressing us -- which was not true because they just didn\u2019t have the political power -- which\nabsorbs our economic resources. Which again was false because the Jews being in economic\nactivities were the -- in fact the engine of -- of many activities and facilitating. They were not\nland owners, or maybe large land owners never Jewish. But they facilitated the trade between\nagricultural sector and the urban consumers. And so -- so the number made it easy to mount a\nvery strong chauvinistic, anti-Semite attitude for those who wanted to exploit that. Not\neverybody bought that on the Romanian side. Some did not buy. Not every single Romanian was\nanti-Semite, but there was a long tradition of anti-Semitism in Romania. The literature is replete\nwith description of Jews in a very negative way. You know, the Jidan was the equivalent of\nKike, and this was thrown very liberally to everybody. Not liberally in the positive sense, but\nvery easily to everybody as an insult.",
        "A: Is -- you know, go to Palestine. I mean, I know that -- the existence of Palestine I learned\nfrom the curses which were thrown at me as a child. When I came home and asked my mother,\nwhat is Palestine? So in that time there were boys who knew that and say you don\u2019t have a place\nhere, and use that. So this accounts for the distinction.",
        "A: I-It was something which was intended as a humiliation. And when you are a child and you\nare cursed, everything which is accepted as a curse 1s -- becomes a curse. So yes, you were -- you\nwere -- you felt very bad, and insulted and all of a sudden kind of sad that\u2019s you are -- you are\nsomething totally different and base. That was, again, in the context of literature which described\nJews often as -- as evil. There is now a book, a very interesting book, written by a -- somebody\nin Romania, a Sociologist who is Jewish [indecipherable], \u201cThe Image of the Jew in the\nRomanian Culture.\u201d The book is that thick.",
        "A: Because there is a lot to write about the image of the Jew in the literature, in poetry, in -- in\npaintings, in design, in -- in all -- all the means of arts. The -- very unfortunately, the main poet\nof Romania, Mihail Eminescu was really a very great, romantic poet. In his political philosophy\nhe was very reactionary on various grounds, including being an anti-Semit -- Semite. And he\nwrote -- well, his poetry is beautiful and everybody can enjoy it, and -- and really feel the\nemotion and identify with the poetry. His article, because he was also a] -- a journalist, were\nreplete with base, evil reasoning, which are a shame. In fact for him, now as you look at him in\nretrospect, and for -- very unpleasant and uncomfortable for Romanian culture, but it\u2019s a fact.\nThis is how -- so however the reputation of his poetry somehow gave more weight to -- to the\nevil political reasoning, and that captured too, a lot of minds. So anti-Semitism has been a -- a\nbig problem in Romania, and Romania is not -- has not expurged even today, yet.",
        "A: Despite all the changes which Romania has gone --",
        "A: -- and all the progress --",
        "A: -- and now moving to a totally different pass, a democratic pass, anti-Semitism, paradoxically,\ndespite the small number of Jews who are still there, is still visible, yes. Not so widespread,\ncertainly not as of -- official pol -- policy or ideology, definitely not so, but still present.",
        "A: You have to ask me what school, because --",
        "A: -- yes. I started school in 1938.",
        "A: Yeah, seven.",
        "A: Seven, yes, seven, exactly seven. But two years later, in 1940, by decree of government, all\nJewish children were expelled from state schools. And therefore I had to go to a Jewish school.\nThe community had to create in a hurry, school for all this mass -- big mass of children who\nwere suddenly all expelled. I -- so my first recollections are from the school where I went\ntogether with other children.",
        "A: All kind of children, like any school in my district. From that school I have very good\nmemories too, about little kids. I felt good, I didn\u2019t feel bad in the school, on the contrary. But I\nhave one scene. We had the most beloved teacher we had -- we had two teachers. In elementary\nschool you don\u2019t have many teachers. One was particularly loved by everybody. And we didn\u2019t\nknow why, but in a -- one good day, a gang of people with green shirts, leather bands, and came\nand simply pulled him out of the classroom, beat him in front of us, and turned and pull him\naway and we are left without our teacher. It was -- this was Iron Guard, as I learned afterwards.\nHe apparently was a democrat. I don\u2019t know what his political -- I didn\u2019t know what that political\nal-allegiance. And they knew of that. And he was a very good teacher, that\u2019s the only thing I\nknew, but they did not hesitate to come and pull him and beat him in front of the children and\ntook him away. And I never saw him --",
        "A: In the classroom, in front of the children. This was the Iron Guard, thugs.",
        "A: Oh, I -- I don\u2019t forget it, I cannot forget it to this day. I -- I know the name of the teacher was\nMotas, Constantin Motas. I mean, that moment seared him in my memory forever, more than\neven his being a beloved teacher -- beloved teacher. Could have remembered him anyway, or\nforgotten him, but that made him unforgettable to me. And the Iron Guard persecuted a lot of\nRomanian intellectuals. In fact, the Iron Guard, which was the Fascist party, the Nazi party of\nRomania, even killed the -- the most -- the highest reputed scholars of Romania, the -- a scholar\nof international reputation, who was an historian, Byzantineologist, history of Byzanthe --\nByzantine Empire. And he was a democrat, a liberal, western oriented, French oriented, not\nGerman and Nazi oriented. They knew of that. He was also a politician. They simply pulled him\nout, and -- one night from his house when they were fighting for power, took him in a forest near\nBucharest and shot him to death. It was a uproar in the entire country and in -- in the world,\nbecause he was highly respected scholar internationally. So the fact that they pulled an\nelementary school teacher was not -- as I learned more, was not an isolated event. They were\nfighting the democrats in the -- in Romania. And not only the Jews.",
        "A: That scholar was Nikolai Iorga, Iorga.",
        "A: I-o-r-g-a.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, of course.",
        "A: I was scared --",
        "A: -- tha -- everybody ask what happened, and I told them, and the mother didn\u2019t know at first\nwhat happened, but then she understood, and a few days we didn\u2019t go to school, we didn\u2019t have a\nteacher. And when -- and then we had somebody, but I never saw him again. I don\u2019t know what\nhappened to him. I really don\u2019t know. I tried asking --",
        "A: Never found out. And that\u2019s all I knew about his name, but [indecipherable] hear laters on,\nbut no, I didn\u2019t. He did not reappear to the school, and next year I -- I went to another school,\ncloser to home. As a matter of fact, the other school I was registered for my second class was the\nschool of a monastery which was close to us. They had a school, and their name was Trei Ierarhi,\nwhich exists still in Miaj. Beautiful church, nicely painted. And they also had the school, 1t was\nnot a confessional school, it was a, you know, secular school, but it was on the grounds of that\nand because it was close, I was given there, registered there, and I learned there. My mother --\nmy parents were not, you know, how to say, so closed [indecipherable] oriented to give me only\n-- and to register me only on -- on a Jewish school. But I -- I was there part of the year and then I\nwas expelled. So --",
        "A: 1940 --",
        "A: 1940, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That was in \u201939, yes.",
        "A: The -- when the law came, I don\u2019t recall exactly when the law for expelling the children came\nback, it was a state law.",
        "A: The good thing about that, because it was a good thing in -- in -- which I didn\u2019t realize at that\ntime, of course, the community mobilized itself to create schools, and created schools in\nsynagogues. And when I resumed school, which was one year later because it was also the -- the\npogrom and the massacres started, the war started, and I lost a si -- a year, I went on the last to\nthe improvised school to finish my education. And what was a good thing is that not only the\nchildren who are expelled, but all the Jewish teachers were expelled from all the state schools.",
        "A: So the community had a good supply of very good teachers, and they were very good teacher,\nmaybe among the best. So we -- we had, all of a sudden, a very good complement of teachers in\nthose improvised schools in synagogues. So th -- they were not only the only good teachers. As I\nsaid, my teacher, the Motas was not Jewish, clearly was a good teacher himself, very good, I\nloved him. But then we had, and I realized later on how good my teachers were, because I\ncontinued in -- you know, beyond elementary school. And I realized they were all one and one.\nAs a matter of fact, when things changed in Romania after the war, some of those people who\ntaught elementary school or high school kids, turned out to be, in fact, scholars of high capacity\nin Romania, mathematicians who were recognized immediately and made into university\nprofessors. Yes, yes, immediately after the war.",
        "A: Including Minyash, yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, it was -- of course a topic of discussion. We didn\u2019t call them all the time the Iron\nGuard, in Romania this is Garda de Fier. But they called -- called them the Legionari,\nlegionnaires. And it was a full -- how to -- how to protect ourselves from them, how to avoid\nthem. I -- we knew where there was the building where they had their headquarters. It was, as a\nmatter of fact, not far from our house, on a major street of Iasi, which was called Stefan cel\nMare, which is, you know, the name of a Romanian king. And this is where they had their\nheadquarters, and of course called cuibue, the nest of legionnaires. And I tried always to not\nwalk on that side of the street.",
        "A: To walk on the other side. Other times, later, when they were defeated by Antonescu, it still\nremained a building with all kind of political -- with -- and there was a flag hanging on there,\nincluding this flag with a swastika. I -- anyway. This -- yes, of course. So the answer to your\nquestion is the discussion we were aware of the [indecipherable] were aware of their campaign.\nIt was a matter of parents training children to not go on that street, to pass away, to avoid them,\nto not look into their eyes, to -- when you see, if you can turn around, go turn around. If you\ncannot go on the other side of the sidewalk and avoid them because they can hit you again. As it\nhappened, I mean it happened to me, I was beaten -- beaten up, but you know, the -- the\ndiscussion was constant. We were aware, it was -- as we came closer and closer to the war, and\nas I became more and more conscious, that was a per -- constant concern.",
        "A: My father was talking politics all the time --",
        "A: -- So we knew that the war started. When I really became conscious of that was when the\nstream of Jewish refugees from Poland came down south and went through -- came through\nRomania, and some of them tried to move further to the seaside to leave for Palestine. But some\nstayed in Iasi, and -- and created synagogues and Hassidim or Hassidim, and my father -- and a\nlot of them, I mean we knew it was convoys of refugees coming from Poland. Romania was not\nyet in war at that time.",
        "A: That was \u201939. And my father took me to one of those Hassidim\u2019s synagogue [indecipherable]\nthe rabbi and -- and I remember that visit because they prayed and then afterward they sang, and\nthey started to dance. It was probably holiday, with a tune which I remember for years. I will not\nproduce it now to you, but I remember the tune, I think I still remember it.",
        "A: I probably can, but it\u2019s on video, so anyway -- but it was with -- was oh, you know, ta, ta ron,\nton, ton-ton. It was a real nice tune, and at certain time it has -- it turn around and you start it\nagain and start it again, and every time faster. And it was nice.",
        "A: Yeah. I did like it, yes, I liked it.",
        "A: Yes, they did. The -- as I told you, the my -- my mother was Russian -- well, I mean, not\nRussian, w-was educated in -- her childhood in Russia, so she knew Russian literature very well.\nAs a matter of fact, later on in life, she had to make a living out of her knowledge of Russian and\nof Russian literature and Russian language, so she took a second degree in -- in the 50\u2019s in\nRomania and became a teacher before my father ma -- was already in and didn\u2019t have a job and\nshe had to sustain the family. And wi -- she went back to -- to school at the university and\nstudied for four years. I mean part time, but took all the exams, because she already had a -- a\ndiploma, university diploma, and became a qualified teacher of Russian, and knew a li -- Russian\nliterature. So her friends -- there were a number of friends who were, you know, who thought\nthat everything in Russia 1s fine, and considered living in Russia. Some considered leaving for\nPalestine, other for Russia. So discussion about -- some, in fact, left for Russia, unfortunately. In\n1940 when -- when Russia took that part back, with Hitler\u2019s support, the people who were born\nin Russia had permission by law from Romanian authorities to emigrate in Russia. And some of\nmy parent\u2019s friend did, and lost their life soon thereafter, and after everything. So they discussed,\nI mean, other friends of my family, the family Gluckman, also the lady was a classmate of my\nmother, and a good friend. They also considered, but they decided to leave for Palestine. And\nthey did, and they were so smart. They left, they escaped the life, and my good friend, childhood\nfriend Irma left with them, and grew in Palestine, then in Israel, was trained there. Then went to\ntea -- to study at Berkley, and became an economist. And years later, when both her parents,\nwhom my mother retrieved by correspondence after the war, they reestablished contact, but both\ndied and my mother lost contact again. In 1970, by -- absolute by miracle, when I was, for the\nfirst time invited to the United State, to that think tank at Stanford for my -- because I wa -- the\n[indecipherable] Romania arriving there the first day, the second day, I was told there is a\nRomanian lady scholar, an American -- sorry, an American scholar who was born in Romania,\nwho is also the same roster of fellows. And do you want to meet her? Why not? So she came, she\nintroduce her, she told me her name Irma Adelman, I told her my name, we started to discuss,\nand she said she is from Romania, childhood and so on. And that started triggering my memory.\nI said, \u201cAr -- Irma, you said Irma, right?\u201d \u201cYes, Irma.\u201d \u201cBy any chance, could it be possible that\nyour maiden name was Gluckman?\u201d I mean, she was dumbfounded. It was like stricken by -- it\nwas my actual first day in the Center for Behavioral -- Advanced Studies and Behavioral\nSciences. The highest reputed think tank for social scientists in the U.S., she was there a fellow. I\narrived much later because the Romanian government would not allow me to go in time, and it\u2019s\nanother story. But in the first time -- day of meeting -- telling her, she said, \u201c[indecipherable]\nhow do you guess that?\u201d \u201cSo I said, if you are that, I am your childhood playmate. Do you\nremember the name of Musi? Musi Catz?\u201d She looked, \u201cYes, of course I remember.\u201d And -- and\nthis 1s how I [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah. And -- and she is one of the foremost economists of the United States, I mean, is\nextraordinarily accomplished in her field, yes.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Well, you know, the -- Irma\u2019s husband was a ph -- ma -- physicist, and -- who took the year\noff to accompany her to the think tank, to the center. And everybody was so stunned. And he\nthought to calculate the statistical chance, likelihood, in fact for us to meet after so many years,\nwith names changed, and factor in also the fact that it\u2019s different country, different profession,\nshe\u2019s an economist, I\u2019m a sociologist, and that that think tank has a pattern of one year roster, so\nwe could have been on two different years and just go like the stars in the night and never met --\nmeet again. And he calculated statistical probability of that to actually happen, and he came up\nwith a number like that, and show it to everybody, so all -- there are a lot of scholars there, and\neverybody was amazed on that. So all of a sudden from my second day I became a -- a cause\ncelebrity.",
        "A: All -- but it was also good because I was coming at that time from Romania, the -- the\nmanagers of the center knew me. Some of the people who knew my work and invited me knew,\nbut all the others didn\u2019t know anything and -- and knew that I\u2019m coming from Romania, who am\nI?",
        "A: All of a sudden there was a friend, a recognized person of [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- who -- who vouched for my family, for who -- Iam where I\u2019m coming from, so I felt all of\na sudden so well in that center. That year in the center was a marvelous year, and influenced the -\n- the rest of my life, Joan, for all my work subsequently in the States, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, right, yes, yeah.",
        "A: I -- what I recall from 1940 is that shift from the -- the fact that I was expelled from the\nschool, and that my father lost his job suddenly, and he wouldn\u2019t go any more to -- he -- he was\nan engineer in a textile factory. And all of a sudden he would be at home, and not go to his work.\nSo --",
        "A: Yeah, that was, yes, exactly.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. The other thing, not immediately after, but the end of \u201940 - \u201941, they were\nclearly more military in tone. So this what I remember. That was -- he was very grim, kind of\nheavy, and we were increasingly worried about what might happen, what might happen. In\nRomania there is a, I would say [indecipherable] fear really, it was a -- the epitome of worrying,\nwhat can the future bring us. And this what I recall. Nothing else, but this 1s --",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no.",

        "A: -- anything of that [indecipherable] I cannot say that they wouldn\u2019t talk, or some would not --",
        "A: -- speculate, but I -- I have no recollection of that, and I don\u2019t think anybody at that time was\naware or -- or could anticipate what was likely to happen.",
        "A: My mother wasn\u2019t working, she was a -- she was a pharmacist by training, but she worked\nvery little in the beginning of her -- after 1 -- after the marriage, her marriage [indecipherable] but\nthen she didn\u2019t practice pharmacy.",
        "A: So she was, you know, keeping the house and my father was making an income. When --\nwhen he lost the job, there was no context in which she could found -- find work. Had she been\nemployed she would have been eliminated as well, so no. And my father quickly had to make\nsome living and what they did was to transform the front room of our house with the exit -- with\nthe entrance, into a store. And to have a number of shelves built. And my father bought a few\npieces of textiles, you know, to sell. But that was an improvisation because our home was not in\na commercial district, nobody would come there. In addition our home was somewhere in the\nmiddle of a courtyard, it was not at the street. So nobody could see it, all passersby on the street\nwouldn\u2019t no -- see nothing, just a big gate and the entrance to a big courtyard. So we had that in\nthe front and he will go in the -- the commercial center, talk to one merchant, to another and then\npossibly from time to time bring somebody, pull somebody to our home. And that was always an\nevent. So what happened, would he buy anything? And he became an intermediary in a way\nbetween people who had various textiles. He was a specialist engineer, he had more knowledge\nabout those fabrics than the usual merchants of them, and how they are produced. And he would\nintermediate buying and selling because the commercial quarter still was alive, those people\nwere not expelled, they were their own shops, and Iasi was a big city and there were a lot of\npeople coming and buying their textiles, their, you know, clothes. By that time they were not\nready made clothes, and they would buy everything from cotton for shirts to -- to fabric for -- for\ntrousers, to heavy coats and so on. So that was a very lively area. I know it because when I\nstarted to go through to school, I had always to cross that street, that long street, which was\ncalled Colonel Langa. So I know, and even before that, my father would take me sometimes and\nkeep me by hand and we go from shop to shop and he will ask, do you need that, do you need\nthat, you know? There is somebody who has such a thing, would you like to buy? He carried\nsome kind of briefcase with samples, simply to make a living, because by having a small\ncommission from mediating a sale, he would get a small commission, and that was a livelihood.",
        "A: No, there was -- th-th-there -- there was strain at that time, there was [indecipherable] you\nknow, the -- there\u2019s a concept in Yiddish, parnasa, which means making a livelihood, you know.\nTh-There I learned that term, and that is a cen -- there was, at least at that time, a center concept\nin -- in the effis of -- of Jews, and whether they were able to make a living or not, because it was\na matter of -- of making a living. So, do you have a parnasa, what\u2019s your parnasa, you know.",
        "A: Good parnasa, and it\u2019s like that.",

So, he was born in \u201939, and you know, was not aware of what\nwas around him except he does remember, I -- I checked to him, as it happens he is visiting with\nus this very week, so I checked him and he has this -- th -- the -- even at two years, he\nremembers the pogrom and what happened to him at that time. But nothing else. However, I -- I\nknow that he didn\u2019t have good years 1n his childhood. The war, the first years were --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. But the whole, he was -- you know, the end of the war was in \u00b045, and then the\nsituation started to improve. And he was -- at that time he was six, so it was better times. But the\nfirst six year were really bad, really bad. So.",
        "A: Yes, there was an announcement, yes, yes, yeah, yeah, there was a big announcement, very\ndramatic announcement of Marshall -- Marshall Antonescu, was broadcast all over when it\nhappened, on the radio, on the, you know, public speakers and so on, everybody heard it, and the\nwar started, the -- before that, the town was already full of military, 1t was obvious to everybody,\nimminent that something will start sooner or later because the city of Iasi was at 19 kilometers,\nwhich is equivalent of about 11 miles from the border with Bessarabia, which by now was\nRussia already. And when you have so much might, army in town, the Romanian and German,\nyou don\u2019t have to be too smart to -- to know that something will happen. So then he said the\nfamous four words, \u201cVa ordon treceti Prutul!\u201d Which means, you are or -- I order you, cross the\nPrutul, the river, which is the border. That remained in -- in the Romanian folklore, almost as a --\nas a prototype of a dramatic order. It\u2019s -- that I remember, that I remember.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: There was -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember knowing at the time how things happened.",
        "A: That there was an agreement between Germany, and imposed in Romania because Romania,\nalthough was gravitating to the Germans, moving away from the traditional allegiances to the --\nto France and to England, to the western Europe, and moving to the Germans, it was a process.\nBut I was not aware of the politics or the process, but I was aware when that big thing happened\nat Bessarabia was moving back to [indecipherable] then when Transylvania was lost, also by\nHitler\u2019s dictate, everybody talked about that. You know, the Romanian map became so distorted\nby that, totally different from -- from a round piece to something which looked like a big\nparenthesis.",
        "A: Shaved on the east, shorn of a big piece all the way to the heart of the country, given away to\nanother country, to Hungary, so -- so everybody -- it was a national trauma at that time.",
        "A: So I knew that something very bad happened. I didn\u2019t know the mechanics, the politics of it.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, right.",

        "A: Yes, I have right here.",
        "A: Yes, well we were in our home, I mean all of us at home, the war started and everybody was\nfrightened to death. There was some bombing on -- on the town in the first week of the war. N-\nNo big damage, I mean no damage at all in our area. They might have fallen some other places,\nbut as I recall, the newspapers didn\u2019t report any major damage from those bombing done by the\nRussians. However, those bombing were used as one of the pretexts to justify what became the --\nthat -- the pogrom, the massacre of the Jews of Iasi. Just one week after the war started, it was a\nSunday, it was -- the war started on June 22\", that was June 29\", we were on the house and we\nsaw that there are columns of people moving on the street. We saw -- we had a view through the\ngate of the courtyard into the street, and you could see a narrow corner. We saw they were\nmoving, we didn\u2019t know were [indecipherable] but they recognize there were Jewish people in\nthose columns, so we understood that something bad happened, and we\u2019re all kind of huddled.\nAnd sure enough, very soon, a group of individuals came in. There\u2019s some military, some police,\nsome civilians, started knocking this first -- go -- a couple of them, two, three, went to each one\nof the houses in the courtyard, and they started knocking the door, came to us, entered the house,\nopened -- pulled the door, entered the house and said, \u201cOut, out, all Jews out, all Jews out.\u201d And\nviolently pulling everybody from -- from the house away. This is when -- a moment which is\nremembered even by my brother, happened, as I mentioned before, in our house lived both\ngrandmother\u2019s. My grandmother on my mother\u2019s side, was a short woman, rather heavy woman,\nand very religious, if I said that, really she was a -- a bearer of religion, she imposed on my\nmother to be very kosher for her, nothing was kosher enough, nothing, nothing. And she had\nspeaking [indecipherable] she would berate my mother often for -- for -- this is relevant, [Il tell\nyou why it is relevant, for not being kosher enough. So she was heavy, she was ill, and she was\nlaying in bed, really laying in bed. And they were pull -- and they saw that woman is laying 1n --\nin bed. So they say, \u201cOut, come out.\u201d She barely spoke Romanian, but she wasn\u2019t able to move.\nSo -- so one of them, very angry, went and -- and caught her by the hair and pulled. And there\nthe hair came off. Because she was wearing a wig as a very, very Orthodox woman. And the guy\nwa -- and the guy said -- and -- and this is what my -- my brother remembered because he was\ntwo years, and sh -- he told me, down in there, he was so scared, saying that he -- he pulled all\nher hair. And -- and you know, my father was begging and praying, she\u2019s ill, she\u2019s very heavy,\nshe\u2019s very old, please, please forgive her, let her be there, she cannot move. They tried to pull\nher, but she was too heavy. And they realize that she will be unable to move into the column, so\nthey left her in the bed, and pulled us, all of us. Fortunately they didn\u2019t shoot her on the spot, but\nthis is why it was relevant that she was very Orthodox, and -- and we were pulled, put in the\ncolumns, and then the column started moving, slowly, slowly, because it was s-s-stopping at\nevery next courtyard, and waiting for the Jews of that courtyard to be pulled. And the next\ncourtyard was -- a friend of mine was living, a very good friend, Nuni Steinberg, who -- his\nfamily was pulled and -- and brought in our back, and put into the column. And so it was until\nthe -- our entire street, that was street Colonel Langa, on which we lived, came to the main street.\nThe main street had been already combed by prior groups, so once we got to the main street, we\nsimply marched, were marched further, we didn\u2019t have to stop because from the main street on,\nthe place were already judenrein.",
        "A: No, they sh -- cha --",
        "A: Shot, or -- or moved them. Not all shot on the -- they -- so we moved. But with us was my\nbrother. We had all to -- to go with hands up when we moved. When we stayed, they allowed us\nto keep the hands down, but when we moved, we had to -- and my brother was two years old, so\nhe couldn\u2019t move, a child of two years, so my father put him on his shoulders. And my father\nwas supposed to keep I -- hi -- hands up, and they little boy keep -- kept.

        "A: -- [indecipherable] and with his little --",
        "A: -- little hands up. And this is how we were marched. Then as we were marched, they saw\ncorpses on the street, and we --",
        "A: Yeah, we did see corpses on the street here and there, kind of people who obviously didn\u2019t\nmove, dead or -- or mortally wounded, who knew, were -- we -- er -- people in the column were\nbeaten, I mean they were forcibly marched, screamed at. People screamed from the sidewalks\nwho were not in the columns, [indecipherable] the inhabitants, insults and so on, and were\nmoved there, and whoever was old was pushed, and you know, there -- the rifle, the butt of the\nrifle pushed and -- and hurried to advance faster. As a -- and we were shepherded toward the\nheadquarters of the police in Iasi. As we approached that -- that place, we noticed there were\ncolumns coming from different other directions, cause you had to pass a -- a square, a big square\nand that was on the other side of the square. So we -- really that happened from all parts, and\nthere were -- so the streets were full with columns. There was a -- a -- a lot of people, a crowd\nwas on front of the big gate of the -- which was a big metal gate, a wooden gate, but closed, you\ncouldn\u2019t see inside the courtyard, but part of the gate was opened. So when we were brought in,\nour turn came, then they will be the triage, the selection. They kept all the men and the grown up\nboys, and sent women back with children. And as we arrived there, they pulled my father in, and\nthey waved us all back. I was at that time, in \u00b041, was -- was I --",
        "A: -- nine and a half -- yes 10, almost 10, but I was a small kid at that time. Now I am taller, but I\nstarted to gr -- grow after 13, I had a tonsils operate and started to grow fast, but as a child I was\na very small child, so at 10 I was still small. Other children, I mean boys of 13 - 14 - 15, some\nwere sent back, some were kept. Then my father disappeared through the gate. I -- we didn\u2019t see\nwhat happened to him. Later -- later I -- I learned what happened to him, and we were sent back.\nAt that time my father passed my brother to my mother, and we were hurrying back. The coming\nback, in small groups not in column, was a real scare, enormous scare, and hellish because we\nwere not in a column, only a small group. Everybody who was not Jewish knew what happened,\nand so, and there were people beating my mother, and my grandmother, who was with us. And\nmy mother would -- would embrace Zolly, my brothers, and screaming all the time, copilul,\ncopilul, please, we\u2019re all c-copilul, protecting him. And I started to protect him too. And my\nhands was -- were beaten by, you know, the -- you -- sticks, and --",
        "A: -- and -- and we are running and my poor grandmother was running with us. So we made it\nalmost -- so this was really -- there -- by that time there were more corpses, I remember seeing\nmore corpses laying on the streets, and blood here and there. And as we came close to our home,\nanother gang of people stopped us all and collected us again, and said, \u201cWo -- how do you go?\nWhere do you go, home? No, no, no, you should go to the police.\u201d And -- and stopped and\nstarted to collect all the people who were coming back, who were only women and children, or\nelderly people, not men, including some other people from our courtyard. A family called\nZilberman, with two girls older than I, Lidia and Mia, whom I knew very well, but they also\nstopped there [indecipherable]. And then the women started to beg and to pray, say, \u201cWe were at\nthe police, please allow us to go home. They released us from the police.\u201d \u201cNo, no, no, you are\nlying, you are escape. We\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d So they -- they made like they were about to shoot\npeople, say, \u201cYou stand to the wall.\u2019 And then somebody came and say, \u201cLeave them, let them\ngo.\u201d And all of a sudden they were let go. We were already close to home, so we ran home. And\nthat happened to the family, that Zilberman family, and that other, but with all the men. In our\nhouse, in our courtyard there was another family, Barad, who was also a -- a merchant, and with\na family lived there, and they had three sons. And it was only the lady who was released, and the\ntwo smaller sons, children. The father and the elderly son was retained, like my father. Well,\nwhat happened -- and I learned later, to my father, to everybody who was pulled there, was that\nthey had to move through a -- I would say the gauntlet of people, you know, two rows of people,\nsoldiers, policemens, [indecipherable] people with iron bars, with rubber truncheons, simply beat\nthem with rifles, beat them bloody, then stepped on them. And they were forced to -- to pass\nthrough that, and to run, and move, move, move, while beating. Some fell, were trampled, others\nwere hit. My father were -- was badly hit, and they ran, and in the back of the courtyard,\nthousands of people were already gathered. So they gathered the crowd. That I learned later. At\nhome my mother was scared and concerned to death and said, \u201cWhat will happen to Tata?\u201d And\nwhat they believed, they are still very naive, is that they are rounding up the Jews to send them to\nlabor camp as labor. And she said, \u201cBut he left with nothing, I mean, with the clothes on him. Let\nme make something and see what I,\u201d -- she was, as I told you, she was extraordinarily -- very\ncourageous. She got in front of the mirror, dress herself with her best clothes [indecipherable |\neverything, put lipstick -- she was very pretty woman -- to look as elegant as possible, not Jewish\nat all. Made the bundle, a little -- with a -- with shirt, with a -- some -- some towels, soap, some\nmedication, maybe a little package, to take and get to the police to be able to pass on to her\nhusband so he has something where he is deported to a labor camp, because he didn\u2019t have a\nshirt, nothing. And prepare them, you know, we are afraid and my grandmother say don\u2019t go, her\nmother say don\u2019t go, don\u2019t go. She would say, \u201cNo, I have to go, I have to go. Nobody will\nrecognize me, I will try to do, you know, and if then they will beat me, they will send me back,\nthey retain only -- but I have to go, I cannot leave him.\u201d And she was just about to go when my\nfather appeared to the door. Bloodied, beaten, but appeared at the door of the house. What\nhappened there?",

        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, she was ready with a little package, and bundle to -- to take, and he came back and --\nbeaten, full of blood here and limping. And he make -- and he kind of fell into the house and\npush her back, and say, \u201cStay, stay, don\u2019t go.\u201d \u201cWh-What is happening?\u201d He was shocked to see\nher so elegantly dressed, but she -- what happened at the police, the police had a big courtyard,\nbut as time passed, I mean, they start in effect the rounding up of Jews not only the 29\", but on\nthe 28\" in the evening, as I learned later -- we had no way of knowing, but later I learned that in\nfact on the 28\" of th-the -- the -- of June, they also killed a lot of people in their homes and in\ntheir houses. In the 29\" in the morning they were surrounding, and also killing, but 0 --\noccasionally killing, mostly bringing them to the police. So as they brought column after column\nand -- and selected only the men, even the men were too many for the courtyard. So the\ncourtyard became full brim -- full to the brim, they couldn\u2019t push any more people in that. So\npeople -- the column kept going -- they accumulated in front of the -- so something happened\nthat they brought -- my father described that exactly. They pushed some -- brought a table, two\nchairs and two Romanians officers, with a paper and a stamp, and making a list, and s -- started\nto call people come. And whoever was in the front row started to move one by one. Say name,\naddress and giving them a piece of paper, take it, with a stamp, that say he can go. Lieber, it was\nwritten in that. And that gave them the permission to go out of the -- so, going out was another\ndifficult moment, they had to run because again were the beaters there. And people started to be\nfreed from the -- the police to create room for others to enter. And that apparently lasted for\nsome time. My father saw that, he tried to be in the front, push himself, ran [indecipherable] and\nwas beaten down and got up and got -- he was on the side come -- as I said, you know, and\nfinally he got the line to go and got the thing and came out. This is very relevant because as we\nalso learned later from other people and the survivors, after awhile of giving those tickets to\nmany people, not just to a few, to many, creating room, some German officers appeared there.\nThey had a discussion with the Romanian officer, and they stopped giving out those things. From\nthat moment they wouldn\u2019t give any more. Those who got it, got it. That accredited idea, that\nthose who got the ticket and gave the address were kind of hereby enlisted for the future\ncollection for labor camp, or maybe they thought of deporting them, who knows? But -- but the\nothers who are -- in the meantime, the day was over, s -- dark started to -- to come down, and the\ncolumns stopped too. And that -- that I haven\u2019t seen, but I know from the stories. And my father\nwas home, this is how my father was home. I am telling my family story, not what happened, but\nI explain how he got home. So when he got home, my mother told him and they understood\nimmediately, they said, \u201cYou have to hide. Yo -- they have your name, address, they can come\nafter you. You have to hide.\u201d My mother remained -- undressed, dressed again normally. And\nnext to our ho-house in that big courtyard was a kind of -- the land, I cannot say the word in\nEnglish. In Romanian it\u2019s a Ripa. It\u2019s a kind of little valley with some stream and a little small\nlake, I mean [indecipherable] in the bottom. And that little valley had kind of this undulation\ngoing down, with a -- we used always in winter that valley this way to put our -- how do you call\nthat? Sleighs.",
        "A: Sleighs, yes. And to go down, and every time we go here, jump, and they caught, you know,\nlots of speed and it was fun and the whole thing was to get down in high speed and to avoid the\nlittle water, the little lake where the -- otherwise you fall on your face.",
        "A: And it was -- this is what I -- I learned my mastery 1n conducting the sleighs. And it was very\nfun, and in the winter there was nothing but this -- this tops from the corn which was growing. In\nsummer, however, that was all cultivated, it was fertile land, with corn. So the corn in June was\nalready tall. So where could my father fall -- the -- my mother made some food for him, a piece\nof clothes to lay on the ground, and he immediately disappeared into the corn, because the corn\ntall, you know, and big and -- and have a -- and disappeared and didn\u2019t see anything, and stayed\nthere, hidden. And we were in the house. Indeed the nay -- night came, my father didn\u2019t come\nback, he was hidden there, and sure enough during the night, we hear again beatings. I don\u2019t\nknow whether my mother slept or not, I sure did. And we heard heavy beatings, and then\nscreams, th-the door was already kind of barricaded and strong, but we were afraid, we couldn\u2019t\nresist, so immediately my mother called us. We were dressed. We were asleep, but I was dressed,\nand my brother was dressed. And again my -- my grandmother was in bed, but the other was\nmobile. And while they were beating in the front door, we exited through the back door.",
        "A: Hitting, yes, sorry.",
        "A: La -- ra -- yeah, beating the door.",
        "A: Beating the door at that time.",
        "A: Trying to enter, and we heard immediately there were a big noise and they were beating the\ndoor, hitting the door and screaming, open, open, open. So we immediately -- what is? And we\nwent down to the back of the house, which also had a door, looked [indecipherable] looked,\nnobody was there out of the group of the front, so we ran away through the back. And we ran to\nthe back of the yard where there was that single Romanian family in the -- in the courtyard, who\nwas Mihaescu, Mihaescu -- Mihaescu something. When I had my playmate, that girl, Coca. They\nwere not very friendly with my mother and my father, generally speaking, not very pleasant, but\nthey sheltered us. So they were a bit -- you know, now they\u2019d be really rewarded for that. But\nthey received us and we hid there. And we wouldn\u2019t know what happened in the house. We were\nsure that my father hears the noise, because if -- he was in the corn, but not far, and hope he will\nnot come out and they will not find him. And we stayed the whole morning, and in the morning\nmy mother went first -- sent the neighbor and then went first, and found indeed the house -- the\nhouse -- the -- the front door was badly damaged, but they didn\u2019t break in.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t break in and the -- they found the house. And then, slowly, we came back, and\nthen my mother went onto the corn with more food to find my father. And she found him, with\nMarcu, Marcu, you know, s-slowly, she [indecipherable] found him, he heard all -- sh -- he was\nvery happy hearing that everybody is fine. He kind of understood because those people could be\noverheard as they spoke, and -- and cursed, you know, that they didn\u2019t catch us. He imagine what\nhad happened. In short, he stayed there for three days and three nights. And my mother would go\nand bring him food and water and come back, and he would not come back into the house for the\nfear that they will come again and -- and pick up the men, or the people, whatever. So he slept on\n-- on the -- the ground because of cour -- and on the fourth day he first came o -- in the meantime\nwe started to learn through voices and people that a lot of people didn\u2019t come back. In our\ncourtyard some came back, but others didn\u2019t. In the family Barad, which I believe I mentioned,\nonly the woman with two children came back, the man was -- and he didn\u2019t ex -- ec -- access the\n-- the point to where they got the ticket. And I learned that a lot of people were killed in the\ncourtyard of the police, and that others were taken to -- to the train station. Again, I didn\u2019t know\nwhat happened, train station made it plausible that they were taken to some labor camp\nsomewhere, to be -- as it turned out later, it was not a labor camp, but the -- the -- the si-situation\na bit calmed in the sense that there were not gangs of people roaming the s -- the town to pull out\nthe Jews. There were other things on their agenda because the war was already in the 10\u2019s or\n12\u2019s or 13 days, you know, and the army broke through the Russian row -- armies -- and\nadvanced, and all the news were very happy. The newspapers said, you know, the victory of that,\nand -- and it appeared that the interest in the Romanian Jews faded for the moment, it was felt.\nMy father came, stayed in the house, didn\u2019t go out for months, weeks, I don\u2019t know. Kept me in\nthe house, everybody stay, we -- the -- they exchanged food between neighbors. It was very, very\nlittle food; water we had. And this is how we passed the time after the thing. Then, only later on,\nwe started news to percolate, or at least for me to learn that in the -- what happened, that people\nwere put in the trains. And these were the famous death trains of Iasi, which became, you know,\nthe equivalent of Nazi chambers on the wheels. There were box cars stuffed with Jews to the\nbrim, cars which normally couldn\u2019t take anything else but -- but, you know, bags and sacks and -\n- and freight. People were like sardines in a box, 150 - 200, I don\u2019t know, but it was full. And all\nthe boxcars were filled, and then they sealed the boxcars so the doors cannot be opened, and\nthere is no air, and the train started to move and to go in a direction nobody was told. But in fact,\nthey didn\u2019t go anywhere. It was moving between stations. If you ask me why it was moving, I\ndon\u2019t know whether they didn\u2019t know where to go or whether one pulled -- I mean the -- the --\nth-the -- there were soldiers on the train guarding those things, or whether they intentionally did\nthat back and forth to kill the people in the [indecipherable]. But with no food, with no water,\npeople started to scream and -- and die, in fact, and -- and were horrible scenes which were told\nby the survivors after several days, six or seven days, one of the trains reached a far away point,\nafter shuttling far away, but a point which could have re -- be reached in several normal hours of\ntrain, and only a few of the people still were alive and were taken out. Another, second train, was\nin fact never moved farther away, they were shuttling between very close places. No, because it\nwas -- people were screaming all the time, and they were stopping in stations, the soldiers\nwanted to stop to do their things, they also realized that people dead -- there were dead people,\nan-and they opened the door, and asked the people from the boxcar to throw out people who\nwere dead. And they brought and throw them on the pavement. And they -- the -- those who\nwere all right were not allowed to -- to come out, wa -- and they left on the pavement, sealed the\ndoors again and the train left. Those who were there -- in some places there were some Jews in\nthose little towns. Not in all, because before the war, the Jews from the smallest places were\nforcibly relocated in the bigger towns. Was a political design in -- in fact. But this what\nhappened, nobody knew at that time why. But 1n some smallest towns there were some Jews who\nwere not on the trains and who were summoned to collect those people, and to bring them in the\ncemetery. In other places, they were simply loaded on horse drawn carts and dumped in the\ncemetery. Were some interesting scenes because as a train like that, screaming, comes and stays,\nand people hear of that, and some of the locals came too. Some cursed, some others tried to help.\nAnd there are -- there are records made by the survivors who testified that some of those who\ncame really wanted to help, and to give them water. Some traded the water and the people in the\nboxcar gave them rings, and gold, and whatever they had on them. Others simply grabbed and\ngive them. One -- I remember that one of those who was reported doing so was recognized by\nYad Vashem as among the Righteous of the People. And her name is there, and he\u2019s -- she\u2019s very\nmuch revered -- revered. Victoria Agarici is her name. She is being described by the survivors by\nsetting the gendarme aside. \u201cI don\u2019t care about you, I need to give water and bread to those\npeople. Beat me if you want.\u201d And she broke through the rows and approached the train and\ngave people water. I mean, it\u2019s a very emotional, but this is the story, and she saved probably the\nlives of some of those people who were -- you know, people drank the urine of other people.\nThere was a hole in the wooden -- in the board, they would struggle among themselves who\ncould put his mouth on that hole to breathe some fresh air from outside. So horrible Dant\u00e9-esque\nscenes inside. And here was a good, honest woman, was willing to fight the police to do what\nshe felt was right, and to give the food and to save other people. So this is what happened. This is\nhow so -- the m -- the majority of the people who were put on the trains died on the tra -- either\ndied on the train, or came out at the arrival point of the first train and died in the next several\nhours. And their numbers, which probably the Holocaust Museum has, about how many exactly\nsurvived, and how many died, because statistics were kept, all -- all those by -- by the killers, and\nthey reported so many corpses, which were [indecipherable] in fact, there is a report which was\ndiscovered in the archives of the -- the special service, security service of Romania, who\napparently organized the massacre of the Jews, about the total number of Jews who were killed.\nThat was a report th-the pride, accomplishment and was reported by numbers, and the document\nexist which reports a -- a -- you know, a scary figure. If you can imagine that 13,100 or 200\npeople in total were killed in those days. And this was a report sent by the local unit of that\nspecial service to their superiors, as an accomplishment. I couldn\u2019t give you my own opinion, I\ndon\u2019t have a number, but I know how many I saw myself. But this is a total number, so they kept\nnumbers also on the people who survived from the trains, and people who were unloaded. But I\ncan again say that I saw in this -- in the 90\u2019s, when I was able again to travel to Romania, and I\ndid travel. I got married in the meantime, here in the States, and I took my wife, who is\nAmerican, and we went through the route of the Moldova, and stopped in all these little t-towns\nuntil we went to Iasi, where I was born and showed her, and then went further. She\u2019s also an\nanthropologist, Ruth Cernea, very interested in the story of my family, and the story of the Jews\nin -- in Romania. She\u2019s -- her field of study is Jewish culture, and the Passover Seder, which --\nshe wrote books on that. No -- well -- very well known anthropologist. And of course was\ninterested herself in seeing what happened. And in those little towns, coming close to Iasi, where\nthe train stopped, we visit cemeteries, and you can see huge graves, collective graves, in which\nthose bodies were dumped, without any identification, nobody knows who was buried where.\nShortly thereafter, the war, those common graves covered, you know, by soil and -- and branches\ngot, you know, stone covers, and immediate after the war, the community, the town put huge\nslabs of concrete. It\u2019s not normal gravestone, but they are -- they are enormously impressive\nbecause you see slabs of concrete covering the collective graves of those killed in the trains,\nwhich are stretching from here all the way to the wall there, one after the other, one after the\nother.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: There were about even more, seven, eight meters I would say, which yes, exactly 25 feet\nlength. All standard cement, you know, some -- but those are the collective graves, which were\nset immediately after the war -- I mean, the -- the -- the slabs. And historical -- historical paradox\nand irony, and the sociological paradox is that those -- the graves of those killed in those -- in the\nmassacres, are in several cemeteries not far from another corner of the cemetery, which co-\ncontained the graves of people who were killed during the first World War, and in some prior\nwar, which was called the War of Independence, when some Jews were allowed to fight for -- in\nthe army. Still distinguished as Jews, but they\u2019re very willing to fight and proud to fight for the\nindependence of Romania. And then they were buried in the Jewish cemetery, where their\nremains were brought because they were Jews, in -- but the Jewish communities were very proud\nthat part of their community gave their lives in the fight and in the war for Romania\u2019s\nindependence. It was a matter of honor, and the desire to make their contribution to the country\nand identify with the right cause of independence of the country they were living. And that\ncorner of cemetery, the heroes of the independence war, and of the first war is always treasured,\nand kind of honored specifically. And next to it you can see the -- the Jews killed in Romania in\na massacre, in a pogrom which was the -- the premonition of what was to happen in the next year\non a even larger scale to so many other hundreds and thousands of Jews.",
        "A: So this 1s -- it was -- later when we -- some of the people who remained alive, send messages\nwhere they are, and their families went and contacted, and tried to find out whether their own\nrelatives were among the survivors. One arrived in some wha -- Calarasi. And another, which\nwas farther away, another was in Portleroi which was closer and easier from Iasi to travel there.\nAnd you know, there was an unending waiting, and when people came back, family members,\nand were -- got the news that their father, or their brother, or their son didn\u2019t make it, was killed,\nand others was all right, no, you know, that -- you know, Sroul Abramovitch died. I know for\nsure because he died in front of me. And the other died, and I know when his body was -- was\nthrown down. So they found -- they got the certainty of having lost those people forever. So it\nwas a continuous awareness of that pogrom.",
        "A: No, no, I mean the -- the -- the climate the people who disappeared were first deemed alive\nand hopefully will return, because as I said, not only my parents, but others thought that\neventually they are being transpor -- transported to some labor camps. The country was in war,\nthe need for labor was obvious. It was a plausible -- maybe it was wishful thinking, but nobody\ncould imagine that they -- people, live people are being put in train and shuffled from one place\nto the other, without food and wa -- to be killed, or be killed in -- s -- but this happened, so\nawareness seeped in more and more, and the tragedy, and the crying and th-the suffering and the\nfear was -- were prevailing.",
        "A: So it was very hard months and years, and my parents kept me the entire year, inside the -- the\nhouse and would not allow me to go except in the courtyard under supervision, to know all the\ntime what happened to me. No going out on the street. And I was not the only child treated this\nway by their families. So, it was a time of hard oppression, of fear for the -- in the entire\ncommunity. And the awareness of -- of the loss, and of the massacre, which nobody would have\nconceived that. You know, there -- that was not actually the first in Romania, there were\npogroms before, in \u201997 -- 1907, some Jews were killed, there were riots in Romania\n[indecipherable] killed. There was a small pogrom in 1940, apparently done by the military,\nwhich some people learned about it. I did not know about that at that time, I was a kid, but it was\nin Dorohoi. A number of Jews, two or 300 were killed. I read about it later. My parents could\nhave known that it happened in 1940. We all knew, however -- I also knew tha -- about what\nhappened in January in \u201941 before Romania entered the war, when there was the -- not the riot\nbut the attempt to a coup -- coup d\u2019etat that -- the coup by the Iron Guard to grab power, and\nAntonescu was the leader, use the army to -- to squelch that -- that attempt to grab the power, an-\nand defeated the Iron Guard. But during the Iron Guard upraising and attempt, they killed Jews,\nand they killed also Romanian police or Romanian soldiers who fought them. When they took\nthe Romanian soldiers, which were Romanian, they would still kill them. But for the Jews, there\nwas a special treatment. They took the Jews whom they caught, brought them to the town\nslaughterhouse, killed them, and hang their bodies. And the newspapers carried pictures of that.\nThe reason the newspapers carried pictures was bay -- because the newspapers of Antonescu,\nwho fought the Iron Guard, was interested to show what the Iron Guard was doing, killing\nRomanians, and also those jidan, you know, th-the Jews. And look what they did, they were\nsavages and --\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: No, no, well it was a very hard year. It was a general year of -- of -- a sense of impending\ndoom. After all we heard that ha-happened, the fear was pervasive in our bones, it could re-\nhappen again every -- every day in fact. We were seeing that the presence of the army was less,\nand there was apparent quiet, but the rumor mill and the fears, the -- the -- the sense that, you\nknow, we have no -- no -- no protection whatever, you can -- absolutely -- are absolutely at the\nmercy of anything anybody wanted to do. And there was now and then, news coming about\nsomebody was beaten, somebody was -- you know, in the open day, everything was stolen from\nhim, and beaten and left there in full day -- full daylight. And police didn\u2019t say anything. So, the\nsense was that you were under siege all the time.",
        "A: Yeah, I wasn\u2019t -- I was, beca -- you know, I did have at that time, 10 - 11 years, but those\nevents make you more mature than your age, and your fear makes you sensitive. No, th -- and\nreal things happened, it was not simply a -- an anonymous or kind of general unexplained fear.\nMy father for instance, and other Jews, received a paper which was called Call Order. Was a\nmilitary paper from the military service saying -- and this was tha -- six months we -- after the --\nthe massacre, in beginning of \u201942. They say, hereby you are informed that you are to deliver to --\nto work as labor -- forced labor. You are part of a team number 38, or some number, under the\nteam leader is so and so. This is the place where you have to be present when called. The calls\nwill be made publicly, by public speakers and other ways, and you immediately have to present\nyourself at that place, under severe penalties. Signed, the military circle of Iasi. So we received\nthat, and that document I -- I remember was the -- the scariest of all. So finally they said they are\ncoming now around to put out all the Jews, to round them up and to send, and this is even\nofficial, and not unan -- announced. And with -- make -- happen all the day because there 1s no\ntoday. And so you lived in fear that that order would be executed any time, and would not know\nwhat would happen to -- to him, or to us. And sure enough, shortly thereafter that order came\nanother one asking him to -- to come to be present for forced labor at the place, which was the\naddress of the train station. Now this was a train station from where the -- the death trains were\nsent out. And here is a paper asking him to come there and -- and work, so you can imagine what\nhe thought. Will he ever come back, or are they all rounding them up there under some kind of\norder, pretext, whatever. They will load them on the train and here it will happen again, they will\nbe killed, taken away, you will never see them. On the other hand, he couldn\u2019t not go. How could\nhe not go, because it was obvious they had his name and his address and in full. So, with all the\nfear in your heart, and other people also received, so it was a collective -- and the rumor mill k-\nkept going, did you receive, did you receive, I did receive, I didn\u2019t receive, why didn\u2019t that\nreceive, what will happen. So on the appointed day, he was all dressed, equipped with heavier\nbecause it was a cold winter, with a package, you know, to last him, and he was summoned and\nhe had to go to the train station. At the train station they were all put to shovel snow, and clean\nthat and clean that, and we were waiting, waiting. And it was the explosion of joy when at the\nend of the day we saw him back. We didn\u2019t know whether he will come back. And he worked\nthere for I don\u2019t know how many, a -- a week, or [indecipherable] and he came back every day,\nand others came back. They did not send those -- them again or kill them. Was hard work, forced\nlabor, but they all came back. But with the indication that they can be called again any time. So if\n-- we all lived in expectation of another call, so the -- the sense of fear, the terror, the impending\nrisks or -- were there. And he was called indeed, but he came back. Interesting enough, the par --\nthe bureaucracy works in all system. He received a document that he did present himself to that\nplace, and he did the days of labor. And I have the documents of, you know, the call order, and\nthe confirmation that he was present and did the hard labor, signed by the military, you know,\ndepartment, with the dates exactly what it is. So that was the year -- oh, yes, I was saying about\nall the Jews, there was, at the end of spring, the -- the -- the news came that all the Jews will have\nto be submitted to a census, the entire Jewish population. And that should be done through the\nJewish community, the Jewish community was responsible that -- that all the Jews be recorded.\nNow, we knew that the Jewish community knew who the Jews are and where they are, so why is\nthere all of a sudden need to do again such a thing? Again, th -- all the inferences and the fears. It\nwas just short of a year from the pogrom, from the massacre in May, June. And it was announced\nand we lived in fear and then there were cards sent for each to fill in, because it was a census to\nbe filled in. Indeed, the community was asked to do, to submit to the government. We didn\u2019t hear\nthe community, we fer -- we feared what was going to happen, and everybody had to receive,\nold, young, child, no matter, so we fe -- I -- I filled the card of that census myself, as the original\ndocument, which was titled, you know, census of all inhabitants with Jewish blood.\nRecensamintul locuitor cu ringelvreese. I mean, this is how blunt it was, nothing veiled, nothing\nhi --",
        "A: This is the Romanian government, no, no, no, this is absolutely the Romanian government,\nand -- and it was [indecipherable] my name, my age, my place of -- my address, my everything.\nAnd because I was a minor, my father was -- had -- there was a place to record that -- his\nsignature, to guarantee for the accuracy of the data. So I was also on the record as a inhabitant\nwith Jewish blood. You know, available for pick up, if needed.",
        "A: Everybody, yes, everybody.",

Maybe sometime I\u2019 Il donate it to the Holocaust Museum, because it\n[indecipherable] a document. So you may realize from those moments which I try to reconstruct,\nthe -- the climate in which we lived, and how everything like that was like a -- a jolt of fear and\nyou know, shaking us up and throwing us back into fear and uncertainty and th-the sense of\nconstant siege, and a risk of life. You know, I told you when I came -- I was near execution on\nthe way back from the police quarters when they caught us, stopped us and put us with the face\nto the wall. And they said, you escaped, you will -- going to be killed, until that voice sounded,\nlet them go. But it was impending execution to be with your face -- so you don\u2019t forget easily\nsuch things. So that was what we felt at the time and how the year went, and --\nany moment. Do you have nightmares? Do you -- I mean are you still this -- a kid whose -- and\nyou --",
        "A: Y -- like I say, it\u2019s very likely plausible, I -- I -- perhaps it was. I don\u2019t have a recollection to\nsay specifically that this happened to me.

        "A: [indecipherable] here. And it was justified because later when I was star -- started leaving the\nhouse, I was once knocked down by somebody who was coming across me, didn\u2019t show any sign\nof hostility except he stopped one meter in front of me, and when I came close, he really slapped\n-- knocked me down until I was down. He -- in fact, I saw him taking the glove, and stopping\nthem, he knocked me down, and then I was down. He didn\u2019t say a word, he put his gloves back,\nand walked away.",
        "A: So I waited for him to walk away, I collected myself and -- and ran back home. Well, so this -",
        "A: -- so I don\u2019t know whether I had nightmares, but I know that it was a nightmare during --",
        "A: -- awake hours yes. In wake hours.",
        "A: I cannot say, but it was -- they had to do expeditions outside, they were selling certain things.\nThere were -- yes, I do remember some things. You know, Romania was an agrarian country, a\nlot of f-food was brought by -- and there were women peasants who would bring thing in the\nmarket, and then they started to bring things to home, realizing that people don\u2019t come to the\nmarket, but they may be customers at home. And they will say [indecipherable] smintina brinza,\nwhich is sour cream, or cheese, or other things, some vegetables. And -- and this was truck, this\nwas exchange of food for items.",
        "A: No money, no. There were things being given to those women, and then a bag to come back,\nand they would come back after three weeks or four weeks, bring another thing, sometime they\nbrought a -- a chicken. And this was the way we\u2019re getting food, they were trading things from\nthe house.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I -- well, I think that whatever food there was came first to me and to my brother, in the\nhouse, yes.",
        "A: Because we were very loved as children --",
        "A: -- and I know that my mother ate very little. My father ate a bit more, but no, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t\nrecall being hungry, I don\u2019t recall being hungry. Oh, my parents did something. They realized --\nyes, this 1s significant, they realized how lonely I am, and how bad it is for a child to not have\nanybody. So they reach an understanding with another family who had many children, to take\none boy of my age to live with us.",
        "A: Yeah, his name was Haim, Haimala. Simply to give me -- to create a companion for me.\nThere was no payment exchanged. Those -- but they promised to share the food with him. For\nthat family, where there were about six children, that was a good relief. They knew my parents as\nvery respectable, and they allow that child to come. And this was Haimala, and my father, who\nwas an engineer, was a good chess player, taught us both chess. And that was very fortunate\nbecause to learn chess you have to have a partner of more or less the same caliber to be play --\nyes. And we learned at the same time, and it was match each other and the other, and we played\nfor hours. For hours we played chess, and he lived with us for a few months and I had a -- a\nfriend in the house, in the house. Some times we go in the field, and -- I don\u2019t remember his\nfamily name, but his first name, Haim, Haimala.",
        "A: Yes, we got along very well.",
        "A: For a few months in -- in \u201942.",
        "A: In \u201942. A period after the massacre, not beyond the -- the summer of \u201942, because in the fall of\n\"42 I -- I start to go into school.",
        "A: Yeah. But -- so this was the period then --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah [indecipherable] yes, yes, yes, they did, and that -- I wish I can name that person,\nthough.",
        "A: Well, not chess [indecipherable]",
        "A: But yes, I played, but he was really small.",
        "A: I mean, he was -- in \u201942 he was three years old, \u201944, so [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- I was already 11 years old.",
        "A: Yeah, so he claims that I wasn\u2019t very nice to him always, but -- but so I loved him.",
        "A: I mean, he was my -- I protected him when people were beating my mother with him in her\narms.",
        "A: So I love him, and he was my brother, but I don\u2019t think we played a lot together.",
        "A: Yeah. At that time it was a big age difference.",
        "A: I mean later, you know, the age didn\u2019t count so much.",
        "A: Yes, and --",
        "A: Yes, I leave the house, as I said, things slowly, slowly --",
        "A: Yeah, we had the -- the census of the Jewish community done by the Jewish community. We\nare afraid that something will happen. A month passed, two months passed. People from the\ncommunity said no, we gave the data over here, but we don\u2019t think s -- the danger is -- send your\nchildren to school, we\u2019ll do the best to protect, so they encouraged, and then they send me to\nschool indeed. Indeed we saw -- we saw that although the census was made, and my card bears\nthe date of the census, which was June, I believe, \u201942, and one month, two months later, nothing\nhappened. There was evidence of who are the Jews, but nothing happened. At the same time,\nwhich was a very important factor, the Romanian army was victorious. It was far away, deep into\nthe Soviet Union, and -- and there was a -- a -- a sense of triumph in the Romanian community\nand clearly they were -- there were a lot of things being stolen from Russia and coming in, it was\nknown there 1s a -- trains of items were brought and officers came with cars loaded, military cars\nwith their own build -- I mean, their items stolen and -- so somehow the concern with the Jews\ndecreased a bit, and we felt that. So it was a bit more relaxed and they send me to school. They\nwanted to -- me to learn something. I told you that during the same year, I was -- a Melamed\ncame to our home. Again my father asked somebody who was younger than him\n[indecipherable] to come and teach me. And again, the payment was in -- in things. And he came\nand taught both me and Haimala the -- the Hebrew alphabet, and this is when I actually started. I\nknow -- I remember we weren\u2019t too good students and he was not a very tough teacher and ri --\nwe didn\u2019t do our schoolwork and so on, it wasn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t learn too much. But he came -- he\ncame and he tried, so I was a bit prepared. And my mother would talk to me about literature, so\nsome kind of home schooling, and my father did with me, math. Math, mathematics, you know,\narithmetics, to -- to teach me the f -- the things, because he was an engineer. And then Haimala,\ntoo. So we had some kind of improvised schooling at home. And then they said, you know, the\nchild grows, he has to go to school. And they send me to school, and first I was accompanied,\nthen finally I would go by myself. They advised -- the parents want for us to come in groups, so\nsay if something happens, you run and tell whoever you can what happened, so we\u2019ll come to\nhelp. And I was crossing the Jewish quarter in fact, all the way to school, and the school, what\nwas the school? The school was a big synagogue with a shtender, you know the shtender, it was\nindivid --",
        "A: The shtender 1s the -- the piece of furniture on which you keep your -- your Sidur, to read\nwhen there is an individual bench. Otherwise there is a full bench. A lot of times there is, you\nknow, a chair, and the shtender at a chair. Here we were given the shtenders to be able to use the\nboxes to put our copy books -- prayer books. It wasn\u2019t proper equipment for children, that was\nmade for ad-adults, but I remember very well how we learned. We had teachers and we went to\nschool. We had breaks, you know, we played in the breaks and a bit of normalcy seeped in. And\nthis was end of \u201942 - \u201943, and then Stalingrad happened, and then we became happy, and the\nRomanians, and the others people there started to understand that the war is turning. And since\n[indecipherable] and casualties were on the Romanian side pretty severe -- very severe in fact,\nbecause the Germans put always the Romanian troops and regiments in the -- in the fire, you\nknow, in the most dangerous, and there were many casualties and losses. So the situation turned\ngenerally grim, but we were able to -- to learn about what is happening, and some hope started to\n-- to come up, that the Germans are going to be defeated, and the war is going to be turned\naround. So that gave us a bit of hope, our hope grew. The situation generally didn\u2019t worsen, and\nit didn\u2019t worsen for Jews as it was -- became apparent much later, I did not have any way myself\nto learn that, but for the overall picture it appeared that the politicians, including the government,\nAntonescu, realized sooner than we did that the war is turning and then the risk of being --\nkilling the Jews is 10 times as high because they may be a -- become accountable. So the -- the\nstate\u2019s anti-Semite activities did not grow, or did not expand their -- I am not aware of any other\nmassacre or pogrom, or further very severe -- I don\u2019t recall my father being called again in \u201943 to\n-- to do forced labor and now I understand, I mean there are documents which show that the --\nthe government wanted to -- to change course. They send also representatives on the sly to\ncontact the allies, without Germany knowing. And that was \u201943, in \u00b044 Romania turned sides\nalready. So for us the situation was better on that. Still fear, still Jews. We had an episode of\nwearing the yellow star in the period of \u201941, I don\u2019t recall in -- exactly how long, but I still have\nthe yellow star and -- two yellow stars, in fact. One was also exhibited in New York, and --\nwhich were mine, my -- my mother kept that too, which were sewn on garments when we had to\ngo out of the house, and stayed on the garments except that if we had to change the garments, we\nhad to move those things. So there was -- that situation of living between how do you I say it,\none fear and the other, and one hope and another hope. Until -- but then, you know, the -- the\nsense of hope and the sense of possible escape started to soon -- rather s-soon to disappear again\nbecause the Russians were successful in pushing the Germans and the Romanian armies back.\nAnd that increased the -- for us, th-the sense of fear that if they are defeated, and if they are\ngoing to retreat, we can be again in great jeopardy, and another massacre may occur when the\narmies will be here. That was one -- one thing. The other thing which happened in that - those\nyears, 1S news percolated to us that our relatives were deported, or -- but some of them may be in\ncamps. Not -- not specifically was about our relatives, but news about the Jews in Bessarabia.\nMy mother was desperate all the time, knowing that so many of her cousins and brothers -- my\nmother had four brothers -- half brothers of course, but brothers very good, and two sisters,\nbecause from her --",
        "A: Yeah, her -- her -- her father in the first marriage had six children. She was the youngest but\nshe was very close to the youngest because she was from the second wife. But very close to the\nyoungest child from the first wife because my grandfather, when he lost his wife, and a man with\nsix children, tried to marry soon again and he did marry and his wife bore him a child, my\nmother, who was very close in age to the smallest child he had from the --",
        "A: So that particular child became the friend of my mother, a boy about three years older than\nmy mother. What his name was? Not shu -- I remember. I knew his name. I know the name of\nhis son. And as she was extremely energetic, hoping that some of those people, of her brothers\nand cousins and aunts, and then there was a family on her mother\u2019s side. All these brothers and\nsister I mentioned were on her father\u2019s side. But her mother had also three sisters, who got\nmarried there, and those sisters had children who were her cousins and so on. So she wanted to\nfind out who is where and if anybody was alive. You couldn\u2019t write, there was no post. But\nsomething happened. Romania got short of medical personnel. There are a good number of\nJewish doctors and Jewish paramedics, and so on, of course, health personnel, who was fired\nfrom all positions when my father was fired in \u201994, they weren\u2019t allowed to practice, and they\npracticed then for the community, Jewish community [indecipherable]. And then they -- some\nkind of decision was made to re-allow, to bring back some of the Jewish doctors in the military\nto tend to the wounded, because there were enormous amount of wounded people and they\nneeded to be treated and the Romanian doctors were not enough. So the Jews -- the Jews were --\nphysicians were brought back, given a military uniform, with a distinctive sign that they are not -\n- they are military doctors and they are not the regular army, and which identified them with\nJews. But they were put to practice. That was [indecipherable] that was permanent. My father as\nengineer was put to forced labor, unqualified labor, but they were put to qualified labor. And\nthey were sent to the front, going to the front back and forth by train, they stopped here and\nthere. And some of them became couriers in trying to give messages and visit camps. My mother\nfound one of such doctors, gave her -- him the name of our people, the Faerstein family, Zioma\nand Uca and Monea and other names and told him, begged him, please whenever you have a\nchance, ask who has ever heard of the Faerstein family from Balti.",
        "A: How do you know --\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, so it was more than one, two, three, whomever she could catch. As I said, my mother\nwas extremely energetic. You can see that I loved my mother very much from the way I speak\nabout her, but she is -- truly was, truly extremely energetic she was. And she, being the first\nuniversity educated person in her family in all -- among all her brothers and uncles and so on,\nnobody had [indecipherable]. And moving to the big city, she became the center, the -- the -- the\nanchor point, not the center, the anchor point. When everybody needed something, they would\ncontact Shanya, before the war, already, and she was there. And she kind of assumed\nresponsibility for them. Somebody ill would be sent from Balti to Iasi, that was in the years\nbefore the war. And she would take care, go with them in the ho-hospital and so on, so on. So --\nand she loved them, she grew up there, she was very much concerned. She tried to identify them\nand -- and lo and behold, one of those doctors -- ambassadors, ambassadors to the camps, this 1s\nwhat they were, one comes back one good day and says, \u201cI found it, I found your family.\u201d You\nknow, I remember that moment, I mean that was extraordinary. Whom did you find? She found,\nin -- in -- not she, he found, in a camp farther away from Balti, the family of one of her brother --\nbrothers, Yosl, with two of his children and his wife. The two children were Zioma and Uca.\nAnd as, you know, the -- then I learned that from my mother, the details, because it\u2019s -- it\u2019s such\nan extraordinary story, and how did he found -- he was going from camp to camp, and asked do\nyou know somebody from -- and no, no. And then somebody told him, in that camp may be\nsomebody with that name. And he went, apparently towards Marculesti, or -- I have to remember\n-- one of th-the camps was Marculesti, and the other was Cecilnica. I don\u2019t recall which one was\nthat, but -- and then somebody else, we have got your family here, and they pointed there and he\ngoes and he found one -- one of the two younger brother, and not -- not my mother\u2019s fa --\nbrother, and the mother of the two boys. And indeed it was her family, and she said, \u201cYou know,\nI am the doctor, I was sent by Shanya Catz, and she\u2019s your relative.\u201d And then they told him the\nwhole story and what happened to them, and they came, and the address. And my -- those people\nare my cousins. There were four brothers. So the story was that one of the four got sepa -- when\nthey were marched -- th-the -- the whole thing 1s that the Jews of Balti were marched, walking by\n-- by soldier of the Romanian army on horses. Put in column and marched for tens of kilometers\nto be evacuated out of Balti. When the army entered they were first put in a prison, in the Balti\nprison. They were kept there a couple of weeks or some shorter time, and there they were started\nto march. If you look -- to march them to the east --",
        "A: -- to the east. And they stayed in a place, and then moved further and pushed further and\npushed further. All the time no transportation offered, no -- no help to people who are old or sick\nor incapable of doing. Lots of them perished on those marches, you know, they weren\u2019t given\nhorses, the soldiers have the horses. And until they stayed in a place for awhile, they had to beg\ntheir food, they are receiving very little, beg their food from the peasants around them, steal the\nfood from the field, eat whatever they could find on the field, potatoes, raw potatoes and any\nother thing. And he found them -- and then were stayed in houses emptied by people who went\nwhen the Russian army retreated, they -- many people evacuated with -- together with the\nRussian army. And those camps were not in the system of the German camps, you know, the\nbarracks were well organized German style, were simply improvised, the same way like the --\nyou know, the -- the -- the killing of the Jews in the pogrom, which I already told you, was a very\nartisanal killing.",
        "A: Artisanal killing.",
        "A: I mean, in death trains, you know, hacking them to death, it was not the gas chambers, the\ntype of thing, the horrible. And maybe the fact that, you know, the gas chambers are so well\nknown is not due only to the huge numbers but to the industrialized manner of killing Jews. Here\nit was more the traditional manner was used, you know, kill directly, or the innovation was\nputting them on trains. But 1-in the camps were -- do the same thing. They were herded to a\nplace, compelled to work, or left abandoned there, fell on the ground, found someplace to sit\ndown. And then in a week or two days or three days or maybe two months, when the new order\ncame, or when the soldiers rested, they were shepherded further. So he came back and told us\nthat my uncle Yosl died of starvation and -- and illness. He was not shot, but he caught typhus\nand -- and he died in the arms of his sons. That the -- his wife is alive, Surka, Aunt Surka. Who\nwas, as it happened in a Jewish family, she was also the youngest sister of my grandmother. So\nthe grandmother, my grandmother married as a second wife, her husband, who had sons from the\nfirst wife. Some of the sons were much older than [indecipherable] young people. So one of them\nat the -- some point, married the youngest sister of my grandmother. So the son married the sister\nof his father\u2019s wife, second wife. But it was perfectly [indecipherable]. And she became -- and\nshe gave birth to four sons, who are my direct first cousins. And the story came that one of them,\nin that terrible evacuation being herded, separated from the family and was lost. As it turned out,\nhe didn\u2019t separate by chance. He wanted to -- to run away and to run away with the Russians and\nto reach the Russians and to fight. And he did succeeded, went east on his own, crossed the front\nline, reached the Russians line, and became a soldier. And for the entire war in the Russian army,\nall the way to Germany, survived. Was crippled, unfortunately, and remained cripple -- shorter\nleg for -- but came back alive. And we are very proud of him because he wanted to fight and he\nfought the Nazis to -- to the end. And -- and then another one, who lived not with his father in\nBalti was caught in an -- another thing, and also apparently left and was on the Russian side. So\nto escape that war and the camps, the father died, the boys survived, and the mother survived.\nAnd the doctor brought us the information only about those who he fou -- he found in the camp,\nwe -- at that time we didn\u2019t know about those who fought in the army. And then next time when\nhe went, my mother gave him money, gave him a blanket, gave him medication. Not too much,\nbecause he couldn\u2019t carry. He went back to the same camp, found them and gave them the\nblanket. Now imagine what it means in that condition to receive something like from heaven,\nyou -- you get, and it was -- and they never forget. I met th-the cousin Zioma, one of them I\nmentioned, I believe before, that I met him in Balti years later and then he went to Israel. The\nyoungest one, Uca, is fortunately still a-alive. He left the Russia earlier than his older brother, he\ncame to Canada. And he\u2019s still alive in Canada, and I talked to him on the phone a few days ago.\nAnd he -- he -- you should interview him because he was in camp. I was not directly in camp, I\nwas with the massacres, but his story is extraordinary, how he -- they were moved from camp to\ncamp, marched in -- in the worst conditions, not fed. How he had to go and steal and bring home\nsome food for people, how his father died in his hand, sick and no-not medicated by anybody.\nThe stories are horrible, but he is alive. He is almost 80 or more. And he has his daughter and\nson and they live in Toronto. If you want I will give him your --",
        "A: It\u2019s Uca Faerstein, you keep the name and so -- so th-this -- that was again a hor -- a typical\nevent for our family, typical Holocaust event which marked our lives because we were able --\nmy mother was able once to send those things. But then she co -- started to collect things and\nprepare, in the hope that she will be able to send again and again and again. And collected from\nwhoever she could, that and the other thing. There was no other option to send. But at least we\nknew that they were alive. And they kept hope that they will survive. So this is how we moved\nthrough \u00b043. And then 44 came, and the front was coming closer to -- closer. This is when the\npanic started in the Jewish community again, that as the army would retreat, they were already\nvisible retreating and convoys of people, very poorly looking, came through Iasi. You know, in\nthe early years we saw Russian prisoners brought through Iasi. In the later years we didn\u2019t see\nRussian prisoners brought through Iasi any more. We saw convoys of the Romanian army, or of\nthe Germans coming in a very ragtag shape. They were visible in \u201943, I remember, not \u201942, but in\n\"43 I remember. And the stories was, you know, between people, telling whoever saw,\ncommunicated to the other, you know, I saw another convoy, it doesn\u2019t go good for them.\n[indecipherable] So --",
        "A: No, no, I --",
        "A: No, that\u2019s -- I -- lask myself the same thing --",
        "A: -- and for instance there were the killing of the Jews in -- in Kiev, which was -- that time I -- I\ndon\u2019t recall, I cannot say that my father and mother knew nothing, but I am inclined to believe\nthey didn\u2019t learn about such things. There were some things I believe about Odessa because\nshortly after the beginning of the war, the Romanian army moved fast, they arrived in Odessa\nand then they did a bloody massacre of the Jews in Odessa, which were very close to Romania\nand the news came. But never did the news tell of the proportion.",
        "A: But I am frankly not surprised about that, Joan, to tell you the truth, because I -- I know how\nthe massacre in Iasi happened, that was the largest pogrom, I mean 13,000 people in one\ncommunity is huge, is a huge -- men -- mostly men, maybe a few children and some women, so -\n- but th-there was a veil of silence afterward, nobody talked. At that time no newspaper reported.",
        "A: How would people know? Nobody discussed, that was buried under silence [indecipherable]\nthing. Th-Th-The west didn\u2019t know. Later on, you know, if you read those things, you find out\nthat apparently some news percolated to the U.S. embassy in Romania, of course still an embassy\nthen in \u00b041, and some allusion -- you should ask your expert in the museum, some reference was\nvague in a -- some dispatch from the U.S. consul or embassy in Romania about some events in\nIasi. But without proper description, nobody realized. And then the system kept it all the way\nsecret until the war. In the war there was a process of them s -- at the end of the war.",
        "A: Some of the people who are caught with very little full evidence, and then when the\ncommunist system took over in Romania, they put another veil of silence because they didn\u2019t\nwant to -- Romania to be blamed for doing such things, such a massacre. In fact, however that\nmassacre was o-of a magnitude unprecedented in Europe. Even at Kristallnacht in Germany,\nthere were no 13,000 Jews killed. A lot of destruction, and a number of victims, but not 13,000\nJews. So that was th-the first big event on the European scale of killing Jews en masse. Maybe in\nPoland it happened too, in \u201939 or \u201940, I don\u2019t know. But then it was repeated in Odessa, it was\nrepeated in Kiev. Babi Yar was a clear copycat of that, these people brought and killed in front of\ntheir trenches and [indecipherable] there. But there are description from the pogrom in Iasi that\npeople -- corpses were loaded on trucks and when trucks came to a grave, first they -- they\ncarried body by body, then they become too cumbersome, and they say, you know, let\u2019s shovel\nall of them at once, to fall straight into the grave. This was how it was treated. And the -- the -- in\nshort, there was -- what happened in Romania was huge, and yet little known. So therefore I\u2019m\nnot surprised that we didn\u2019t receive the news from all the things which happened under the\noccupation in the Russian territory. We only realized through that doctor who came, when we\ngot the story how they were pushed from place to place, that they were pushed to the east to be\nbeyond any line which could presumably still remain under Russia. That that territory had to be\nclean of all the Jews, which that territory which was expected to become Romanian in the event\nof the war ending with a German victory, should be clean of Jews. This is why they -- they\nmoved them, they killed some of them, but whoever stayed alive should be on the other side to\nRussia. Which was -- which -- that is what today we call th-the proper concept, ethnic cleanstick\n-- cleansing. That preceded with decades the ethnic cleansing in -- by Serbia\u2019s -- or -- or by the\nMuslims in Croatia, and in what happened in Yugoslavia very recently. But 1t was ethnic\ncleansing. This throwing an ethnic group, either by direct killing, or by starvation, or by hunger,\nor allowing them to be killed by epidemics. And pushing the -- the remainders o-out beyond the\nborder. So this is --",
        "A: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "A: At the year of the -- end of the four days, we -- we didn\u2019t know itt.",
        "A: What happened. When we started to learn the story about the trains, we started to get more\nand more information and a grasp of events. Then the news percolated that a lot of people were\nkilled then -- I mean, the people who saved the life, s -- told and communicated home that we are\nalive, but we saw that that and that was killed. The Iasi families [indecipherable] through\nmessages, through friends, including Romanian friends, to contact those whom we ler -- who\nthey learned are in Calarasi, I mean far away, to -- what happened to, you know, Avram\nRoitembaum, and so on and so forth. And the news we -- I saw him dead.",
        "A: So this -- the -- the realization of the -- of the magnitude seeped in gradually.",
        "A: And we s -- we realized it was bigger and bigger and bigger than we could realize then. We\nhad it firsthand because in my courtyard, two people did not return, the -- Mr. Barad and his\nolder son. And the family was -- stayed Shiva when they learned about that thing. So we realized\ncontinuously th-the inc -- increasingly realized the size of the -- the numbers we only found out\nand learned after the war, the total numbers. And as I mentioned to you during the communist\nsystem, there were no reports and le -- except the -- the trial of some of the criminals who were\ninvolved, no publicity was made. The Jewish community would have a commemoration of the\nmassacre each year and they would say there were so many people killed, the -- 11,000 was the\nnumber at a certain time, which they believed it was, just huge. Then the documents were\ndiscovered that there were -- in the special services reported more then 11,000 killed. And\ngradually we\u2019d realize the size, but not when I was a child. From a child my -- my direct\nexperience was about the reality of that happening to me, to my family, to the neighbors in the\nimmediate --",
        "A: -- in the most indisputable and tangible way. The proportions I learned later, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes, exactly.",
        "A: Like a sword hanging.",
        "A: All the time.",
        "A: And then really happening, I mean my father receiving the piece of paper that he had to -- to\nshow up.",
        "A: And then having to show up and then us being on edge the whole day whether he comes back\nor not. Then with the census, with all our data, and our mind was this 1s a list for them to come\nand systematically pick up and make sure that nobody is -- is -- is omitted from the pick-up. So,\nof course we had very strong indication that things can happen any day. Wh- When things\nworsened on the front, we -- we started having hopes that who knows, maybe we\u2019ll be lucky\nenough to survive that ordeal.",
        "A: That -- that was -- but we were, you know, fearing disappearance and death every time, yeah,\nyeah.",
        "A: Exactly, how could [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- but it\u2019s un-unforgettable. It shaped my mind at that time because all my [indecipherable]\nwhen I came out from the war and when I started to go to school, and when the first years of\nfreedom, everything was fresh in my mind and you know, I joined a group of more consciously\nthinking kids in our school, and even politically oriented kids, too, and engage in discussion, you\nknow, what -- so what will happen? Will that happen again, what -- are they [indecipherable] are\n-- the Jewish problem, that was a [indecipherable] problem nationale which we discussed\nendlessly and shaped our aspiration, political conviction, desire to do something to create a\ndifferent type of society. And that 1s a very clear chapter in -- in my life. After the war, as a\nresult, a conscious result of the extraordinary sense of oppression and injustice which I had,\nwhich was imprinted in my cells and my genes, and I came out with that. And that, you know,\nsuch oppression, such injustice shouldn\u2019t happen, I mean, again. So in that respect, it -- it\nchanged me. Without that experience I -- definitely I would have been a different person.",
        "A: But otherwise it did change me, and it\u2019s -- it -- 1t\u2019s rooted in my mind, certain aspirations and\nvalues which I believe I still carry.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what th -- worry we -- we reached the point --",
        "A: -- as the --",
        "A: -- the Russian was approaching, we fear -- the fear thermometer, I\u2019d say. The fear\nthermometer, or barometer went up again, and say well, they\u2019re coming, they\u2019re going to destroy\nus when -- if the Russians are victorious and pushing them, when they retreat through Iasi, they\nwill kill again all the Jews.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s what they fear --",
        "A: -- Romanians and German --",
        "A: -- because the front was coming.",
        "A: We are going to be decimated, and destroyed, and -- because even the first time they took\nrevenge, Romanian army took revenge on the Jews in Iasi and in other places, also on account\nthat the Jews of Bessarabia, when the Romanian army retreated from Bessarabia in 1940, kind of\nrejoiced in that retreat.",
        "A: And then they had to pay -- to payback, and they paid back by killing. So with a -- they\u2019re\ngoing to retreat, that will be the end of us. We -- we survived until now, but that, no. And then\neverybody who could, say we have to run. We have to run, we have -- how to run? And this is\nwhen my parents, and other people started to -- to think how they can ran -- run away from --\nwhere to run? There was no -- nothing, no place to run, but they said, if we can run to Bucharest,\nwhich 1s a big city with a much smaller proportion of Jews, we\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll disappear in the mix,\nperhaps we\u2019ll get lost ra -- in -- in Bucharest, a pogrom like that did not happen. So we -- that\u2019s\nwas -- was the reasoning. And th-this -- my parents started to prepare themselves, and to do\nwhatever they could to run away.",
        "A: And that prepared their -- their running away and becoming refugees and running away from\nIasi at the end of the month of March, 1944. Which we, at that time, you know, they identified a\ntaxi driver, in fact, who was -- or somebody who owned a car, I don\u2019t know whether he was a\ntaxi driver, but owned a car, and reached a deal with him to pay him to transport us from -- from\nIasi to Bucharest. And that\u2019s the entire story, I have to tell you [indecipherable] the trip, because\nwe didn\u2019t have enough money, there was no cars, and we had to fit ourself in that car, all my\nfamily and the Barad family, who lost the head of the family and one of the sons. So we were\nfive of us, I tell you about my other grandmother, and three of them to fit in one car, one small\ncar. My father kind of took charge of the Barad family who remained without a man in the hou --\nwithout a head of the family. And they were very close friends. And indeed, we were all loaded\nin that car, and that was an ordeal, but they made it to Bucharest.",
        "A: Okay. All right.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: Yes, unfortunately there were, there were. And the one other uncle of mine, my mother\u2019s\nelder brother, half elder brother, whose name is Moise Leib was in a totally different camp, also\ncoming from Balti, but they were driven, chased to another camp, and he died in Obadovka, this\nwas the name of the camp. It was already in Ukraine, that Obadovka, like Cecilnica, which I said\nbefore, as they were pushed, and they arrived there, but died in the camp, and that camp, also his\nson, my cousin, if I recall correctly the name, I was -- it was also Yosl.",
        "A: But he was still a small child, or a child of eight, 10 - 12 was -- who also was killed. Only his\nwife escaped, the wife of Moise Leib. That was again his second wife, of that uncle of mine\nwhose son was killed. She survived, her husband and her son was killed. My uncle and my\ncousin were killed, she survived. But my uncle had two other sons from his first marriage, and\nthey also either disappeared or were killed, I cannot tell you for sure about each one and all of\nthem, but there were much more losses. Those which I mentioned I know for sure, and I know\ntheir names and I recall the instances we discussed. But my mother, who kept a very sober count,\nand a very loving count of them, in fact dedicated a number of trees in Israel, growing trees, to\ntheir memory and altogether it must be a big forest in -- in Israel only for them. And she also\ncreated the plaque with their names, the names of all who died from the family Al Kidush\nHashem, and made a plaque which I have, a plaque at home, I have it, you can see it.",
        "A: If you want to put it on record with this. What is meaningful is that in fact, she did that plaque\nearly on enough that she arrived here, in the States, and [indecipherable] you know. But then we\nfound out about the others, who also were killed in the camps, and for whom -- my mother\nthought that they were disappeared in the war, or in the evacuation with the Russians, and they\nwere war casualties rather than Holocaust direct massacred or killed people. But they were --\nthey didn\u2019t fit yet in -- in the -- in that table, in that plaque. So there are more than in the plaque.\nThe answer yes, in Romania we -- you have very many casualties on that side. Everybody had\ncasualties, I mean on -- on my grandmother\u2019s side, there were her sisters who were there, and\nwho had their children and grandchildren, some of them were killed, some of them escaped,\nsome of them were killed. There was no family which was left unscathed by that, that losses. I\nmentioned to you Uca, the one who is now in Toronto. He married, when he came after the war,\nsurviving and came back to Balti, he married a woman in Balti. That woman was the only\nsurvivor of her family. Yanya is her name, and she\u2019s alive and his wife now. But she was a\nsurvivor in her family.",
        "A: So the casualties were terrible, and many, many [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, I mean, the statistics show that altogether, the Romanian Jewry was one of the most\nnumerous Jewish population in -- in Europe. Before the war about 850,000 Jews lived in\nRomanian territory. By -- after the war only four -- 400,000 were alive. Half or more on the\neastern side, a good number on the Romanian territory, as happened in Iasi, and in Dorohoi and\nin other places which I mentioned. Bucharest and so on. And a good part in the western part of\nRomania, which was taken away from Romania before the war, and was under Hungarian\nregime, and under Nazi control, and the Germans and the Hungarians deported the Romanian --\nthe Jews from that part, from Transylvania. So it was not the Romanian government which killed\nthem, but they were part of the Romanian Jewry who were killed in the west, as opposed to in\nthe east.",
        "A: Some of them we -- went to Auschwitz and to other big camps, and never returned.",
        "A: So it was how --",
        "A: -- yes, yeah.",
        "A: -- the -- the fact is --",
        "A: -- it doesn\u2019t matter on -- so much on whose account -- I mean on whose count of murders they\n-- their names are, what matters is a murder took place, mass murder, mass killing.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no, we couldn\u2019t like -- take any luggage, very, very few things, but those few things were\nsome of the things, the documents, and some of the Jewish heirlooms which my mother saved. In\nother words, the whole house was left un -- untouched, as you know, we left and\n[indecipherable] they tried to -- to run away for life, and escape with their lives. So the entire\nhouse we don\u2019t what happened to the house, to the furniture, to whatever was left in the house,\ndepleted enough as it was for th-the -- the exchange of --",
        "A: -- house item for goods and food. But there was still a household. The car -- I mean, what I\nremember is something which you d -- understand that a boy of that age would remember, I\nremember the -- the brand of the car.",
        "A: At that time, oh I -- you know, it was a Plymouth.",
        "A: P-l-y-m-o-u-t. And at that time I didn\u2019t know English, and so for years I -- I kept 1t in mind, in\nthe Romanian reading, Plymouth. But now I can tell you. And it was a spacious Plymouth\nbecause in addition to the normal seats it has those banquettes, you know, the seats which -- so\nthis is how we fit, but it still was an ordeal. So I don\u2019t know exactly how everybody was divided,\nbut first of all we had a very heartbreaking situation with my grandmother on the mother\u2019s side.\nWe were preparing to leave and it was absolutely obvious that she cannot make the trip. She was\nvery heavy, still ill, everybody catered to her. She was more -- more lying than standing.\nAdvanced in age.",
        "A: Yes, and -- for years, but as -- with every year, worse. So -- and -- and she said, \u201cLeave me\nhere, leave me here.\u201d And my father said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to, how can we take you, what should we\ndo?\u201d And he wa -- we were desperate. But it -- it was impossible to -- to take her, and eventually\nthey found a solution. The solution was they went to the same family where the child Haim\ncame, who was a family with children. They did not contemplate to -- to leave, or they didn\u2019t\nhave the means, I don\u2019t exactly know. But they were s-saying we are staying here and if you\nwant, we can take Chava as a family member, and we will take enormous care of her, whatever\nwe can do for -- for us, we\u2019ll do for her. So this is what happened. Chava moved to the family of\nHaimala, and stayed there, and lived a little bit longer and then passed away indeed, because she\nwas close to that moment. I believe she survived a few months, and passed away. I never saw her\nagain. But we knew, and they took good care, because she got ill, and she was hospitalized, too.\nThere was a former Jewish hospital owned by the Jewish community, which -- it was a very\npowerful community there, but then it was taken by the state. But we -- we learned that she was\ntaken to the hospital for good care and that she died in the hospital, so at least we know that she\ndidn\u2019t die abandoned and -- and [indecipherable] --",
        "A: -- but she -- it was a -- you know, she was very old, too. And --",
        "A: It was very -- it was heartbreaking, and worse [indecipherable] my parents were in touch with\nIasi by that -- those time the phone was terrible, but they were in touch even after we arrived in\nBucharest. But I, in the 90\u2019s, when I was in Romania again, before I left, I couldn\u2019t track her\ndown. But when I came back from the States after that, I did everything to find her out, and we\nwent to the cemetery in Iasi and tracked down who passed out in that years in the Jewish\ncommunity, and we found the record. And I went to the cemetery in Iasi, and we found the place,\nbut everything was, you know, weeds and soil and debris and so on, with a lady -- caretaking\nwoman and the man at the cemetery, we started to dig and clean at the place where the numbers\ncoincided, and lo and behold, the -- the grave appeared.",
        "A: Yes, and we found the name there. So I know where my grandmother is buried. So this was\nthe -- one thing about departure. And then the other grandmother was in much better shape\nphysically. And indeed, she survived until \u201966 or something.",
        "A: Yeah, another 20 years after that. And we got all loaded, there was no room, and I was the\nsmallest -- not the smallest one, there\u2019s Zolly, but I was the smallest adult, so to say. So they\ncombined me with the youngest boy from the Barad family, took up only one seat. So he was a\nbit older than me, his name was Eugene, and again I can tell you some of a little story how I\nrediscovered him later. But I was on his knees the entire trip.",
        "A: No, this was about 500 kilometers -- 400 --",
        "A: -- four -- four --",
        "A: But it was not the distance, it was the duration which was killing us. A distance is a distance,\nbut it was the -- the highways were not highways, or -- you know, roads as they were \u201944, and\nthey were clogged with refugees on carts, on -- on cars, trucks, military people coming from the\nwar, ambulances, checkpoints which slowed the tr -- down the traffic, everything. Y -- military\nunits going to the front, and military units retreating from the front. So the -- the trip was I don\u2019t\nknow, almost 24 hours, leave one day and arrive the next day in Bucharest. The poor driver\ndrived all the time. He secured some piece of paper for him to prove, and really that was a --\nlifesaving, because we were stopped.",
        "A: He was showing the paper, and my mother was pushing the bribe. That was a pattern because\nalone the paper justified, but they wouldn\u2019t let it. And my mother had, you know, one thing and\nanother thing, precious thing, some jewelry went. And we -- one after the other went through all\nthe -- the checkpoints.",
        "A: Sh-She -- she was, yeah, she was the real --",
        "A: My father, as I told you, came wounded and ba -- and he suffered for rest of the life for the\nconsequences of those --",
        "A: -- thing, which became more psychologically damaging than physically damaging. He\nrecovered physically from what he had, but psychologically it was really bad. So he had good\ntimes, but he was out of kilter for many. And then had strokes and -- a series of strokes, you\ndon\u2019t -- cannot say for sure that the -- that 1s a direct relationship, but -- so we arrived in\nBucharest. I remember I was not able to stand, and every time we stopped I wasn\u2019t able to stand,\nthis is how numb --",
        "A: -- my -- my legs were from sitting on his knees and being bent, because the car was low and --\nand the room was extraordinary tiny. So, but we made it eventually to Bucharest and we arrived\nat the friend of my father, whose name was Lupu Catz, the same name, but they were no relative.\nThere was also a Catz from the town of my father, and they were friend in -- in childhood, and\nthey remained friends through the lifetime, and in time of need they had the house, and we all\ndecamped to their house. And we stayed there for awhile and I remember he had one daughter, a\nbit -- one year younger of me, so my age, practically. And she was -- she had a cold at that time,\nso she was bedridden. So here I see a -- a girl who became my friend and she\u2019s still alive and\nfine, and we are friends. But I remember the moment when I see -- saw her first time. Jenica is\nher name. And we stayed in their house [indecipherable] it was totally different for me, it was a\nbig city, bigger indeed, it was close to the Jewish quarters of Bucharest, but a bit out. And\nindeed, the Jewish community was kind of smaller and lost in the total population of Bucharest.\nAnd nothing bad happened since then directly about Jews. The bad thing which happened 1s the -\n- the -- the allies started to bomb Bucharest. The front was coming up.",
        "A: So we -- we arrived at Bucharest virtually -- less than one week from the biggest ever\nbombing of Bucharest. And the fourth of April, 1944, that was the biggest bombing of Bucharest\nby the British planes, based somewhere I don\u2019t know. In the Mediterranean, the Greece, and they\nwere coming to bomb the Romanian gas hills, Romania had the gas, and those were within 40\nmiles of Bucharest, so they drop part of the bombs there, on the gas field, and come with the rest.\nThat was putting pressure on the population of the government to -- to --",
        "A: -- to stop the war and to come out, preparing them to -- softening them for -- for the political\nnegotiation to get Romania out of the war, and against the Germans. Because the Russians were\npressing from the east, and here was the government, and -- who had to be bombed into\nsubmission, and bombed to -- to accept the -- the ca --",
        "A: Yes, and we escape the war only to -- to fall here, and mind you, what happened after that\nfirst bombing, the raids continued to the point that they came every single day to bomb\nBucharest.",
        "A: And to increase the political pressure, they came every day at the same hour. Ele -- 11 of the\nmorning, we knew that this is the -- and [indecipherable] away I -- all the -- always the -- the -- it\nwas deliberate, it was not -- so, I guess -- I didn\u2019t have any contact with the British headquarters\nto know, but why would they send the planes every day the same hour, except to demonstrate\nsomething, they are able to do it, and this is not --",
        "A: -- and you -- you -- you still fear, and you know that the next day they to -- come again. And\nthen you cannot [indecipherable] so when will this stop, I mean how long? The -- then -- you\nknow, the sirens would start screaming wildly, everybody would run away, everybody --\nBucharest wasn\u2019t bombed during the war, it was far from -- from theater of war. In the beginning\nmaybe some, but I wasn\u2019t there, but during the -- the -- the height of the war it wasn\u2019t. But when\nthe war came to the end, the pressure was put on Bucharest. It wasn\u2019t Dresden.",
        "A: Yes, but it was a lot of pressure.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: So we knew that every day. And then we had to -- to hide ourselves now in the basement of\nthe building, eventually move from my friends and my father\u2019s -- my mother found a small\napartment in a building in which another family from Iasi, also going as refugee escaping, which\nis a family of -- Rosenhaupt family. And in fact, it was the parents of the famous Israeli lawyer\nand politician, Meier Rosenne. Our parents were friends in -- in bu -- in Iasi, so hum -- somehow\nthey got together, found the same building, and they moved into an -- one apartment. It was a\nsmall building with several apartments. And they were in another apartment in the same\nbuilding. They knew -- th-the parents knew th -- I knew Meier from -- from his childhood, but\nthen we really became close because we\u2019d be together, we\u2019d play together, and we would run to\nthe -- to the basement together at 11 o\u2019clock when the sirens will -- will start. And that happened\nfor weeks. A number of houses were destroyed, and unfortunately the Barad family found an\napartment in another place, the one I talked to you. And unfortunately that was -- that place was\nclose to the Bucharest railway station. And the railway station was a part of the -- the bombing\ntarget in the fourth of April. There was blanket bombing there by the British. A lot was\ndestroyed, the station was almost un -- disabled, I don\u2019t know was completely. But their house\nwas bombed, and she was killed. The -- the baby was -- was with us one week before in the car\nand escaped the war in Iasi, was killed, and the -- the two boys were buried in the rubble of the\nhouse, which we learned later, when the youngest boy found ou -- us, after having been buried\nunder the rubble for three days and three nights. And he came out, they were pulled out from the\nrubble by rescue teams when they found him in the rubble, and they found there was some\nplaque hanging there by his mother saying, if this boy is found somewheres, you know, alone,\nbring him either at that address, her address, or to the fa -- Catz family, who is on the street\nMogos Vornicu five, where we are [indecipherable]. Or not Mogos Vornicu five, it was Kolono\nMoraro, one of the addresses. But this is how he could found us -- find us. He was -- his face and\nhead were swollen from being hit by the bombing and debris and being on no food and no water\n[indecipherable] the air for under the debris until he was rescued. He could move, but his head\nwas very swollen, I remember his swollen head, and he found us and told what happened. And in\nthe process, you know, she had the -- the -- her purse with all her -- their fortune was lost. She --\nthey had money and, you know, gold coins, whatever they had they lost, and they were poor like\n[indecipherable] so we had to help them, too, in that situation. But -- and they were victimized a\nsecond time, that family Barad, a really unlucky case. And then the -- then, you know, we went\nthrough the spring with so many bombings. Yes, my -- given the risk, I -- there were the same\ntreatment. I had to carry here --",
        "A: Yes, with a name and who I am and where I should be brought. And my mother sewed some\nthings which they still had, some gold coins in my -- in my pants, yeah, and tell me always keep\nthat pants, don\u2019t -- don\u2019t give it away and you know, know that in the need, that\u2019s what -- how\nyou can pay for your food. Fortunately, our house was not bombed, and we lived 1n it throughout\nthe bombing, until the middle of August, 23\" of August when Romania shifted sides.",
        "A: And two, three days later, the Russian tanks came into Bucharest, because the -- Romania\ncame out of the war by -- by political maneuver with the king, and the -- Antonescu was arrested,\nand the Romania shifted sides. Then the Romanian army stopped fighting, and the Russian army\nwas already in the east and with no opposition, advanced very quickly and tanks came into\nBucharest, and I remember the Russian tanks coming, and me waving them, and my mother\nwaving them, and finally the liberators.",
        "A: You know, you hear -- s -- hear so many things about American liberating people in Dachau\nand then all the camps. We were not in a physical camp like that, but I -- I surely recognize the\nfeeling of people who are in a -- in that state, and are liberated by -- by the army who comes\nthere, so --",
        "A: Oh, it was terrific --",
        "A: -- you know, yes. And in addition, you know, my mother was able to talk to the Russian\nsoldier who are [indecipherable] --",
        "A: -- she speaks Russian, yeah, I knew a few words.",
        "A: I even had an adventure with them because then, you know, I was there and next two or three,\nfour or five days the Russians all came, and they -- a few of them camped in a little square. And I\ncame to them, I said, you know, \u201cDobry Deni,\u201d and they were really surprised --",
        "A: -- so all very happy, all of them were missing their own children, gave me bread, gave me\nother thing. And then they said, \u201cDo you want to come in the -- in -- in the truck?\u201d We are going\nhere, they say. I understood something that they g-go to fetch something, and will come back.\nAnd I say yes, and I got into the car. And they started driving and driving and driving and I mean\nI don\u2019t know whether the story is of any interest, so let me stop here. [indecipherable]",
        "A: They were taking me -- well, in short, they took me to a forest where they have an\nammunition depot, and loaded the truck with ammunition. That was still when the Germans were\nbombing Bucharest.",
        "A: And that took a few hours and in the meantime, my mother --",
        "A: -- absolutely mad, hysterical, and I couldn\u2019t do anything, I was with them, and they could\nhave taken me. They brought me back, late, after six hours of -- my mother was on the street,\nsaw me, and I don\u2019t want to put on video, but I got my pants down and I got a spanking.",
        "A: You know?",
        "A: A spanking in the street, I will never forget that.",
        "A: Not quite, no.",
        "A: Not this way. I mean, she said never, never [indecipherable]. No, she didn\u2019t -- she didn\u2019t\nspank me, but sometime it happens, you get -- and you got that.",
        "A: This was real, yeah, oh I mean she -- she was out of her mind, she was -- that\u2019s the end of me,\nthat I was kidnapped, I was killed --",
        "A: -- I was something, I will never return.",

        "A: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s late, it\u2019s --",
        "A: Yes, well, I believe we reached the -- virtually the end, almost the end of the war, when\nRomania shifted sides, and then what happened, relevant to the past, that th -- we mean the past\nis, that we -- we really tied ti -- tried to find out what happened to everybody else in our family.\nAs I mentioned, we had a large family on the other side --",
        "A: -- where they were in camps. And my mother had a very, very intensive way to do the search,\nand wiv -- she found some of the people, found out about others who died. My cousin, Zioma,\nwho was in the camp, as I mentioned, in Marculesti, and hi -- another camp he was, I remember\nhe and Uca were first in Rawoutsel, a camp, and then in Marculesti, and then in Cecilnica. As\nthey came back to Balti, my cousin Zioma went into the army after a little while, because the war\nstill went on, and lo and behold, he appears in Bucharest in the uniform of the army which freed,\nyou know, so you can imagine our -- because the last we knew was -- of him was when that\ndoctor found them and brought them the -- the blanket.",
        "A: And he reported to us with a letter from them that the blanket was delivered, which was a\nlifesaver for them in that time. So he came and we were happy, in fact, I have a picture with him\ncoming, and I don\u2019t have it here with me if you ask for it, but it\u2019s at home if you need it. So we\nwere very happy. The other cousin of mine, Monea, who fought all the way to Berlin, and we are\nvery proud, and was decorated, and was wounded, and became a cripple for the rest of the life\nhis [indecipherable] came twice to Bucharest. And so we were very rejoicing 1n those -- and also,\nyou know, mourning those whom we learned were lost. So it was a f-family stock-taking of what\nhappened to all of us, and how we -- we went through. And that again, before -- beyond the stock\ntaking, helped cultivate in me the sense of family and what -- how important, I mean the\nsolidarity and the family solidarity is a very big, important value for me throughout my life and I\nbelieve those hard times instilled that value, and my mother deliberately instilled it. And -- to the\npoint, in fact, that even after my mother\u2019s death, I felt the need to go to -- as I -- I think I\nmentioned, to the place of my birth, to Balti and to find out the place, and I found that\n[indecipherable] the synagogue didn\u2019t exist, but I found there another si -- very relative moment\nof Holocaust. In that synagogue, you know, people who came back to town -- it was also my\nfamily, my town. And they said Kaddish, and I -- I was given by the Jewish community from\nBalti, some Kaddish cardboards, and where the Kaddish words were written in Slavic le --\nletters, for people to be able to pronounce the -- the Hebrew word, you know, [speaks Hebrew\nhere] . But all thing with Russian letters because, as I was explained, the people in\nBalti, many of them didn\u2019t know the torit Hebrew. And I got that cardboard, one of them is in the\nHolocaust Museum, but not in yours, in the Holocaust Museum in --",
        "A: -- in New York. I have another one, which 1s a -- a historic document, Kaddish, and -- and --\nwl --",
        "A: Fine, fine, 1f you want to --",
        "A: -- you\u2019re welcome. So then, you know, the life fell back into normal except that we are -- w-\nwe were bearing memory --",
        "A: -- and the consciousnesses we gained. I went back to school, I went to a Jewish school, my\nparents kept me to a Jewish school as long as Jewish schools were around in Romania, until 48\nwhen the education system was reformed, all became state schools. And I continued my Jewish\neducation, I had my Bar Mitzvah with a very memorable teacher, Mrs. Eisenstein, who was\nanother formative element, maybe Ill tell you privately another time about her, but she was a\nremarkable person, Hannah Eisenstein. A book about her was printed in Israel, includes my\nmemories of her, and Meier Rosenne\u2019s memories, because he also was a -- a student of her in\nRomania before he left for Israel.",
        "A: She taught me Hebrew, she taught him Hebrew.",
        "A: [indecipherable] that his parents decided to go to Israel very soon, when my parents decided\nto apply for immigration it was too late, and they were rejected. So that\u2019s why I stayed in\nRomania. But she was our mora, our teacher at the beginning and we both -- every time I meet\nMeier Rosenne now, we still talk about what she taught us, you know. She was very important to\nme. And then I -- I went into research after I went to [indecipherable] training, I did research,\nlearned sociology. Also, it\u2019s a complex period, with a lot of political implications and --",
        "A: -- it -- it was kind of profoundly affected. I believe you asked me a question how it changed\nmy life. So my life was changed in the sense that I became concerned professionally too, about\nhow societies develop and change in political systems. And I did my research in sociology when\nthat became possible. I am trained in philosophy and sociology and then my research was --\nbecame of interest to other scholars internationally, so I was invited to the United State, to the\nCenter for Advanced Studies [indecipherable] that think tank, which I mentioned.",
        "A: And my wife, Stella Cernea was also a sociologist. She was trained and she became a\nassistant profe -- associate professor at the university. When I applied to become the same, and I\ngot my Ph.D., I was told no, we don\u2019t take Jews any more, point blank. And this was happening\nin -- in \u00b058, \u00b059.",
        "A: In -- in communist Romania. So fortunately I was able to continue my work as a researcher in\nthe system of the academy of sciences, and I did my research there, which apparently was\nimportant enough to be picked up by American scholars. Then, unfortunately, my wife died --\nStella, and -- by a brain hemorrhage and aneurysm.",
        "A: And this was in the -- \u201968. Put it very briefly, I -- I received at that same time the invitation to\ngo to the center where I went two years later after a epic fight between that center and Romanian\nauthorities, who would not allow me -- would not give me a visa, period, until they gave it under\nAmerican pressure. And I was there -- I had to come back because they came -- kept my two\nchildren hostage, and my mother took care of them while I was away. So I stayed from \u201971 until\n\u00b074, when I again was invited by the American Sociological Association and traveled to Canada\nand the U.S.. I decided not to return at that time, and I could do that because the children were --\nwere older and I could still count on -- on them to survive well and to -- until I was able to get\nthem out. And really, it took an hour and a half -- I-I\u2019m sorry, a year and a half, almost, to -- to\nget them out. Fortunately I was offered a job as the first sociologist to be hired by the World\nBank, that happened in \u201974, just when I left Romania. So that was another one of the twists and\nchances in life which happened, and hey, I did, I hope well in that job. So it brought me great\ngratification, realizing a lot of my values and ideals in helping poor people in societies and\nchanging people\u2019s life. I honestly believe I made some contribution in that. And that brings me to\nthe present day, Joan, wh-when --",
        "A: -- I retired from the bank. I do continue my work and my writing.",
        "A: I retired from the bank at the end of \u201976, beginning \u201977. I published a number of books in the\nmeantime. I keep laboring on --",
        "A: No, sorry, no.",
        "A: \u00b096 - 797.",
        "A: Sorry, sorry. \u00b096 - 97.",
        "A: That was a -- I was about to say, I remarried in \u201987.",
        "A: With Ruth, my wife, she is also an anthropologist. If you want to know the story, there\u2019s a\nvery funny story because -- anyway, I have to -- let me tell you. It was a nice -- after so many sad\nstories, this is a nice story to record. As an anthropologist at the World Bank in Washington, I\nwas trying to be in touch with the community of Washington anthropologists, which there is an\nassociation, WAPA, Washington Association of Professional Anthropologists. And while at\nanthropological meetings, I bought a book at the meeting, because I saw an interesting book,\nwhich was about -- it\u2019s called, \u201c\u201cAfikoman in Exile\u2019, about the ritual of Passover from an\nanthropological viewpoint.",
        "A: Which I read, I enjoyed very much. I knew much -- learned much more about that. And in one\nof the outings of that Washington Association for Professional Anthropologists, sa -- and went --\nwent to the races, if you can imagine. And we ate, we gathered a large group and somehow in\nanthropology the discussion came about Passover rituals and somebody said something, you\nknow, we engage in a discussion and we have a little -- a really sharp discussion because I\nthought I was there -- maybe another Jewish, or anthropologist or two, and I knew well to say\nthat I, you know, knew the book, and I kept my thinking sa -- on some points. Somebody had a\ndifferent opinion, there was there a lady who had a different opinion and that intrigued me. And\nshe was very firm in her opinion and I was very firm in mine. But I couldn\u2019t convince her, so\nthat\u2019s was it, you know, we went home and the boss as -- before telling -- saying goodbye, I told\nher, \u201cAnd I think really I was right, you were not right on the point, and to see that, you need to\nread the book about that. And this is a book called \u201cAfikoman in Exile,\u201d and you will see,\u201d I\nsaid. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t, I know -- I think -- I think I know I\u2019m right and I don\u2019t have to read that\nbook.\u201d So that was -- I say, \u201cWhy?\u201d She said, \u201cI wrote it.\u201d Well that concluded the argument,\nthat concluded the argument, so --",
        "A: Well, I -- I tried to -- yes, I went straight to the book and looked at what they said about the\nbiography of that lady.",
        "A: In the bio-note of that book --",
        "A: -- and yes, I did call her, and we met and fortunately we could get married.",
        "A: Yes, that was the first argument she won, I have to say not the last. But it was -- I -- I -- I won\nalso some.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: I have two children, yes, both are physicians. This is my daughter Darna, who -- I didn\u2019t tell\nyou that after my -- I saw -- they took me a ni -- year and a half to bring me my children. I had\nfamily here in America, also branches of the family from Bessarabia, again cousins, the Jacobsen\nfamily from Buffalo, and the Rochester fami -- the Davis family from Rochester. Also a relative\nof ours, whose, you know, grandfathers, or fathers left earlier from Balti and came to the States\nlong before the Holocaust.",
        "A: And my mother tracked them down and mobilized them to plead with their political\nrepresentative in the Congress, and in the Senate, to press for the freeing of the children and of\nmy mother from back in Romania. And they did, they -- you know, the senator of New York was\n-- Rochester, Buffalo, you know, for New York the senator was Senator Javits.",
        "A: So they told him the story, he wrote the letter to the -- to the Romanian ambassador. In\nStanford while I was there, I met Alan Dershowitz, who was also a fellow like myself with -- to\nwhom I entrusted my -- my desire to -- to come and he say, \u201cMichael, if you want to come now, I\nwill help you now, legally. If you want to go back, go back to the children. But when the\nmoment -- you decide the moment comes, I'll give you all my support, you can count on that,\nthis is my word.\u201d And indeed I go -- went back, but when the moment came, I called, and Alan\nDershowitz was right there to help.",
        "A: He had sent in fact, a student of his, Ben Segal to check on me after I went back in Romania\n[indecipherable] student. And when I came back that student was already a lawyer in\nWashington as it happened. So I got all the -- the best and the strongest --",
        "A: -- legal assistance and help. And they wrote -- Ben Segal\u2019s father, who was a former rabbi, in\nfact, knew ha -- Hubert Humphrey.

        "A: And I got the children, and f -- you know, my daughter Darna came when she was 17 and she\nwas accepted straight into Brandeis after an interview, and she studied there. My son had to go to\nhigh school here, at Georgetown [indecipherable], he was a very good student. He wanted to get\ncircumcision as I told you, at his initiative which he is proud to this day, I am proud to this day.\nBecause he didn\u2019t have the chance of a Jewish education in Bucharest. And now they created\ntheir own family, Darna is married, Eric [indecipherable] who has a Jewish French origin. They\nhave three children. Darna decided to shift to a kosher home, with all my credit for that. And her\nchildren are going to Jewish day school in -- in New Hampshire, and get a very solid Jewish\neducation, a very solid secular education. I\u2019m very proud, we just had the Bat Mitzvah of the\nolder one, Sarah, who has the name of my first wife, S-Stella.",
        "A: Stella. So she is Sarah [indecipherable]",
        "A: In -- sorry, New Jersey --",
        "A: -- did I say New Hampshire?",
        "A: Sorry, no, New Jersey.",

        "A: -- from my house, and a -- av -- a very happy family, and we are very thankful to -- to our\nfaith, for our faith and what happened.",
        "A: Yes, it is a difficult story, I thank you for your patience, and prompting and good questions\nand keeping so well, track. I think it\u2019s important that that story be known because it has -- you\nknow, it\u2019s lifes, individual life\u2019s which interfere with history in crucial juncture moments of\nhistory, which therefore individualized may -- in happening, may become more relevant for\nbroader purposes of identity or of faith, of history, of social change, political change. So I\u2019m glad\nthat you invited me to put on the record those things, and I hope that my children children\u2019s\nchildren and so on will sometime also see that video, you and me talking, and --",
        "A: -- and they will know what is the history behind that.",
        "A: Thank you, thank you very much.\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "A: This -- the picture of my great grandfath -- parents. This is -- the lady\u2019s name is Chaya. The\nman\u2019s name is Ushar. Chaya is the mother of my grandfather, Zollman Mayhel Faerstein. And\nthis picture was taken apparently about exactly a century ago in 1905, or maybe 1906 because\nthe family\u2019s story is that they left Balti at that age in that state. Apparently they were above 70 or\neven more, deciding to leave their family behind and going to the Holy Land to die there and to\nbe buried in the Holy Land. And lo and behold, they had the courage, the stamina, and the\nstrength, to accomplish that dream, and left Balti in 1906 or 1907. Finally they arrived in\nJerusalem. I don\u2019t know how they did it, because they spoke only Yiddish and maybe a bit of\nRussian and they had to travel, of course, by horse, and by cart until they got to the train and then\nfrom the train they should have crossed the sea by boat, and then to arrive, but they made it. And\nthey arrived in Jerusalem, lived Maya Sharim. As you can see he\u2019s -- has a beard, and has payas\nand the -- the traditional caftan. And my mother and I visited the cemetery in which we knew\nthat they were buried. And that was still during my mother\u2019s life, and my mother discovered in\nthe books their names. And we found their -- her grave in the cemetery of Jerusalem on the\nMount of Olives. We didn\u2019t find Ushar\u2019s grave because Ushar grave was desecrated by the\nJordanians when they controlled that part of Jerusalem. Last year I spent six weeks in Jerusalem\nat the Hebrew University, and I went back to retrieve the -- the grave of my great great great-\ngrandmother. So fi -- I did find it, cleaned the -- the gravestone, her name is there, exactly when\nshe died, and I brought the pictures back to my grandchildren. I would hope to get there with my\ngrandchildren so they get a tangible sense of heritage, of -- of family history. And I still try to\nfind out, to construct the full family tree, which -- for which I have a lot of data, but I have to put\nit on a good chart.",
        "A: This picture is real historic picture, is a picture of the synagogue of Balti before the war, when\nthe synagogue was -- is -- it still existed. People attended the service and somebody took that\npicture which somehow arrived in my mother\u2019s hand and she saved it through the entire ordeal of\nmy family lifes until -- then brought it to the United States. So here in that picture you can see\nmy grandfather, Zollman Mayhel Faerstein, whose name 1s carried by my brother Zolly, as an\nold man there. And two of his sons, who are my mother\u2019s cousins and my uncles. This is Uncle\nYosl on the extreme right of the picture and Uncle Shrul, a bit younger. So the others -- I know\nsome names from my mother, but they are not relatives. But we are very proud to have this\npicture. But I like to say that I was very gratified realizing at my granddaughter\u2019s Bat Mitzvah\nthat all my grandchildren were extremely happy and proud to have their pictures of their family\ntree, counting themselves as the sixth generation down from Haier Faerstein. So this great great\ngreat-grandmother, that made them very happy and very proud. So I am very proud of them, too.\nWe have other pictures further, if you want to look.",
        "A: This picture is my grandparents on my mother\u2019s side. It is Zollman Mayhel Faerstein, the man\nwhom you saw in the prior picture in the synagogue, the elderly gentleman. This is shortly after\nmy mother was born. In the picture is also my grandmother, Brana -- Brana Baratz Faerstein, and\nher little daughter Shanya, or Seindel Faerstein. She\u2019s barely one year old, and the picture\napparently was taken at the same time with the initial picture when the family went to the only\nphotographer in town, because the -- the parents, Chaya and Ushar decided to leave the country,\nso they made pictures. Zollman Mayhel is already the father of six children before my mother.\nAnd you can see he 1s still looking as a young -- relatively young man. For Brana, his second\nwife, this is the only and first child -- the first child and the only child, Shanya. This is how\nfamilies were at that time.",
        "A: In this picture you can see my other grandparents, on my father\u2019s side. This is Itic Catz, or\nItac Catz, and his wife Ava, or Chava, of whom I -- whom I both mentioned in -- in the prior\nnarrative of my life. They were in Roman. He was a -- a s -- a very small shopkeeper, is a grocer.\nThey were rather poor. My other grandparent in the prior picture had a workshop producing\nsoap, also very artisanal thing. But as you can see, he was also very distinguished in his looks,\nwith a very respectable beard. Kind of stiff in the picture, unusual for him to be photographed.\nHis wife Chava is the person whom I described to you as my grandmother who was rather short\nand heavy. You can see that he is sitting and she is standing and they are almost the same height,\nbecause she wasn\u2019t very tall and she grew bigger. The young man there is my father at a young\nage. He was in his teens, I believe; my father, Marcu Catz. I believe he was maybe 16 - 17,\nbecause his brother, Bernard, my Uncle Bernard is not in the picture, otherwise he would have\nbeen in the picture. The reason he 1s not is that he had to leave the town in which they left,\nRoman, because he was -- he got involved in some political activities a bit of the left, and he was\nbadly beaten up and threatened. We have some pictures in the family of his being bitten -- I\nmean, the wounds he -- he endured in that beating and it was unsafe for him to stay so he left --\nhad to leave with his left leanings to Paris, where he could practice them a bit more. And then he\nleft France for Canada where he established a family, but married in the typical Jewish way with\na girl he met on the boat, and established the family. He\u2019s had one son, Charlie Kent, my cousin,\nwho established a very beautiful family, the Kent family with four children in Toronto and\nPhoenix and the States. Many grandchildren. Charlie married -- married Ida, who is still alive.\nMy uncle -- Charlie Kent passed away, but they helped decisively in the -- in taking out my\nbrother Zolly from Romania. In fact, ransoming him with money from the govern -- Romania\u2019s\ngovernment, and this is how Zolly and his family arrived in Canada. But Bernard, unfortunately,\nis missing from this picture.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: This is my grandmother, again on the mother\u2019s side. I called her Babba Brana, this is Brana\nBaratz Faerstein, and the little person over there is me. That -- there is an inscription on the back\nof the picture which shows that at that age I was 11 months old. But you can see that my\ngrandmother still looked very -- was a very beautiful -- the very beautiful woman she was here,\nwith -- with white hair. In the earlier pictures with my mother at that age, she had hair was still\ndark and black. Young and beautiful and now she has -- that is what, about 30 years later, or so.",
        "A: Here are my two grandmothers. On the right there 1s Babba Brana, yes, who is my mother\u2019s\nmother, and on the other side is Babba Ava or Chava, who was my father\u2019s mother. They were\nwith us in Iasi. This 1s a picture taking -- taken just about a year after the -- before the beginning\nof the war. The front person is -- small baby is my brother Zolly, and I am hiding behind him,\nshowing only my head. Zolly this age had -- about 15 months or so, the grandmothers are both\nvery proud and keep a very possessive hand on him, this was the latest sign of the family. And\nthis is a very happy picture because it\u2019s a first -- the last picture I have with both my\ngrandmothers in the same picture. When the war started, they didn\u2019t make pictures any more.\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: What you can see now Is the yellow star, the famous yellow star which the Jews from several\nparts of Romania were forced to wear. That part included Iasi. And that was the star I had, in\nfact, the stars were circulating in the family between me and my father. They had to be sewn on\nour garments whenever we went out. They -- if you use the same garment it stays the same, but if\nwe change the garment we cannot go outside without the yellow star. So my mother saved two of\nour yellow stars. One of them is in the Jewish museum in -- Holocaust museum in New York,\nthis is the second and I -- I -- that was my own and my father\u2019s, for some time. For --",
        "A: No, no, they were handmade by each family and this is why you have also variety. They were\nsewn in the house out of yellow fabric and black fabric.",
        "A: And the pen is in for scale, and you can see how it was. In fact, we had in our home, a sewing\nmachine, and that was used; I remembered how it looked, and it used for garment too, cause at --\nevery family sew a lot of garments at that time for themselves. But it -- 1t was used to\nmanufacture our yellow stars.",
        "A: These are documents from 1942, in the height of the Holocaust period. The first one is an\norder which my father received from the military authority of Iasi for the commandant -- you\nknow, the commander of the military authority, to be on call, to be ready that he is going to be\ncalled for duties, unspecified, and he should be ready any time such call will be made. It will be\ncommunicated loudly and he\u2019s bound to come to the address mentioned in the order, under sever\n-- severe penalty. It\u2019s also indicated that he was allocated to be a member of a -- a labor team\nnumber 38, to be led by another Jewish man named Kaufman, Yuda. His name was also written\nthere. The name of my father 1s up there, Marcu L from Leib, Catz. The -- the threat was terrible\nbecause it does not -- it did not specify what will happen to them. Other Jews from Iasi received\nthe same order, and the fear was that this is a systematic call again to -- to eliminate them, to kill\nthem. Indeed then it was -- became known that they have to present themselves, the specific\nplace was the railway station, exactly the same station where the Jews in the -- were put on the\ndeath train. So then my father was informed that he has to be present at a certain day there,\ntogether with other Jews. And with fear in his heart, he had to go. The bureac -- and he went.\nFortunately we saw him back. But this second document 1s the certificate which the military\nbureaucracy handed over to him to -- as a proof that he indeed responded to the call and was\nthere. That was important document too, to protect him from the accusation that he did not show\nup. So this our family document saved. There were more like that, but not all were sa -- saved.",
        "A: This is a document about myself. I believe I mentioned earlier that in 1942, the Romanian\ngovernment decided to make a full census of the Jewish population and they asked the\nFederation of Jewish Communities to do that. It was called the Center Organization of the Jews.\nWhatever the name -- Centrala Evreilor din Romania. So again we got extremely afraid that the -\n- the census of all Jews is being made to keep good track of where they are and who they are,\nwhen the decision will be made that they could be picked up and -- and something done not very\ngood to them. So this card however, is also very important historical document because it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nblunt, it say, this 1s a census -- Recensamintul locuitoriln cu ringelvreese. The census for\ninhabitants having Jewish blood. I mean, this is -- they were not mincing words. The ethnic bias\nis clear, blood bias. You have Jewish blood, you are a different category of person. The name is\nthere, Catz, Moise, my name, our address, Iasi, street Colonel Langa, tracepervachi, which 1s 13.\nMy fa -- because I was a minor in 1942, my father and that -- June \u201942 is mentioned there as the\ndate, my father has to put his identity number on the left side of the card. Now, on the back of the\ncard, you can see two stamps. One is the -- the stamps of the Iasi police, and the other one 1s --\nthe first one is the Iasi police with the crown of the king over there you can see in the first. And\nthe second is the stamp of the Jewish community of Iasi, giving authenticity to this document.",
        "A: This document is something -- is a gift which I received from the Jewish community of Balti\nin 1994 where I returned to my birth -- town of birth, simply to see how it looked at that time. I\nwas on a World Bank mission to Moldova for developing programs which the bank was\ndeveloping for Moldova, in my capacity the senior advisor at that time at the bank for social\npolicies. I also spoke the language of course, so I went on that mission, and I took a few days off\nfrom the work problem to be able to visit my town, Balti. At that time I wanted to see the\nsynagogue in which my -- my grandfather was praying in his time, but it had been destroyed long\nbefore by the war, and very little was left from Balti -- from past Balti. So I was told however\nthat the new synagogue was created in a home, which was built like a usual home, a dwelling,\nbut in -- it\u2019s used as a synagogue and was taken there. And then I saw there indeed, in \u201994,\nthrough the people who are living in Balti, the Jews living in Balti, in a -- in a Saturday morning,\nwith a full service done as -- by usual service. My leader, th-the person who brought me there\nwas my cousin, first cousin, Zioma Faerstein, who was -- whom I mentioned before, who was\nliving with his family still at that time in Balti, in \u00b094. He took me to the synagogue and\nexplained to me -- I -- I wanted to have some kind of memory and I asked whether I can have\nsomething from that -- they say we cannot give you any sidur, because we have very little\nsidurim, there are not enough, we don\u2019t have any other items. But I notice in that corner, some\ncardboards with some inscriptions. I say, \u201cWhat are these?\u201d They say, \u201cWell, these are things\nwhich we had to write when we opened up -- came back from -- from the camps and there were a\nlot of people who died in the camps, and those who stayed alive wanted to say Kaddish after\nthem, pray. But they didn\u2019t know to the Kaddish, the Hebrew Kaddish words. So we had to write\nthe Hebrew Kaddish with Slavic -- with Cyrillic letters so they can pronounce, reading in Cyrillic\nletters, the -- the words of the Kaddish. At that time we wrote -- we created the black -- the\ncardboards, and these are some of them.\u201d On the right hand corner you can see the Hebrew word\nfrom Kaddish, the dollit is missing. Only k-u then sheen. On the left hand corner is Kaddish the\nsame word with Cyrillic letters, and then the whole Kaddish is written in Cyrillic letter. [speaks\nHebrew] and so on. And this is a prayer which Jews from all the entire world are\nsaying in the memory of those whom they lost. It was very moving to me to see that -- that\ndocument, historic document improvised, a product of the Holocaust whose -- who was needed\nbecause of the Holocaust, who will -- had to be manufactured by hand because there was no\nprayer books. And I ask whether I can have at least one of them to me. They said you can have\nthem all because by now we have [indecipherable]. And they ended up giving me three of them.\nSo I brought them with me. One 1s this one, another one is in the Holocaust museum in New\nYork. The third one is with me still, waiting if your Holocaust museum, Joan, want to exhibit it,\nI\u2019m happy to -- to give it there. It is extremely meaningful for me because it 1s from the same\ntown I was born and from the synagogue, but I believe it\u2019s meaningful for the entire history of\nwhat the Holocaust mean -- meant, and how people came out of the Holocaust having to cry for\nthose whom they lost.",
        "A: This is a plaque, a memorial plaque which my mother commissioned after she arrived in the\nU.S. to -- for the memory of those in the family who died during the Holocaust and for the other\npeople in the family who passed away. She donated the money for planting trees in Israel in their\nmemory, and then ordered this plaque and she\u2019s -- it\u2019s written there, this garden of trees in Israel\nis in honor of the families Faerstein, Catz and Baratz, the families which I mentioned, made by\nShanya Faerstein Catz. In parenthesis, Buchika which is a nickname which the small kids a --\nyou know, gave to her, my kids gave to my mother, Buchika, and this is how she was left in our\nfamily. And on the left hand side there are the names of people who died in normal\ncircumstances before, or maybe after the Holocaust, but not in camps. It includes my\ngrandfather, my grandmother and so on. Some of them were in the Holocaust, my father,\nincluding my late wife, Stella Yavetz Catz Cernea. On the right hand side are the names of many\nof those who died in Transnistria, I mean in the -- in the former Bessarabia, Balti and the other\ncamps which I mentioned during my narrative. All of them whom she knew as certainly having\ndied in those camps by the time she -- she ordered this plaque. Subsequently she found out that\nothers, who are not here, also passed away, but their names are not [indecipherable]. In fact,\nthere were more than the 25 she mentions here.",
