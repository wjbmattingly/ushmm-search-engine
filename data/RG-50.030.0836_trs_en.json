I want to go back to\nyour school, where you say all of a sudden the children no longer play with you, no\nlonger talk to you, and you\u2019re by yourself. How soon after that \u2014 was it a period of\nmonths, or a year, or fairly quick that you no longer went to that school?",

        "A: Usually trolley car.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you have any experiences on the trolley cars that were \u2014",
        "A: Only \u2014 never, we were fine until the 10\" of November.",

        "Q: Well, tell me what happened on the 10\" of November.",
        "A: Well, we woke up in the morning, like every other morning.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And somehow or other, my mother, or nursemaid, I don\u2019t know who said, today\nyou\u2019re going to be driven to school. Well, it turns out our driver didn\u2019t get there. So\nwe had \u2014 you know, streetcars ran every 15 minutes, so we had to go by streetcar.\nWe hopped on the streetcar. The ride took us through the main street of Cologne,\nwhich 1s called the Ring. And once we made the turn onto this major street, my\nsister and I are sitting in the trolley, and we\u2019re saying, this must have been \u2014October 4, 2015\nsomething terrible must have happened, people must be drunk. We saw the entire\nstreet, which by the way is documented in Germany, they have pictures of all of it\n\u2014 and interestingly enough, I met the Biirgermeister of Cologne years later, who\nthat same morning was on a streetcar also, and we exchanged \u2014 he\u2019s not Jewish, of\ncourse \u2014 so we \u2014 he said, you saw this? And I said, yeah. He said, I did, too. So,\nthey had plundered all these shops. There was stuff all over the street: clothes,\nbicycles, whate \u2014 whatever the shop sold, was on this major street. And we couldn\u2019t\n\u2014 how could this happen? So we got to school, and the minute we got to our\nclassroom, we were told to go to an assembly, which was outside in a courtyard.\nThe two schools had two different buildings. And one of the buildings was on fire.\nAnd needless to say, there was a little confusion in the courtyard. And the rector\nspoke on a microphone and said, you are to try to reach your parents by phone. We\ndidn\u2019t have cell phones, but there were telephones in \u2014 at school, or get on the next\n\u2014 find a way to get home immediately. So, I hadn\u2019t seen my sister, there were\nhundreds of kids, I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know my way around, or who knows,\nmaybe I was scared, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Well, you were 10 years old.",
        "A: And the next thing I know, my sister was \u2014 suddenly was there, and she grabbed\nme and she said, we have a ride home. So I went along. It turned out our saving\nOctober 4, 2015\ngrace, that a friend of hers, whose mother was not Jewish, married to a Jewish\nattorney, she had heard what was going on, I don\u2019t know how. Chauffeur had come\nto school to pick up this little girl, and told the little girl, whoever she wants to take\nalong, come home, hop into the limo. So there were six or seven of us. So my sister\ngrabbed me, and I was in the limo. I didn\u2019t know where I was going, but \u2014 so we\nwent to a lovely home, had a lovely lunch. And from that moment on, it changed\nmy whole life, yes.",
        "Q: So Kristallnacht was the key. The \u2014 you know, things had been going\nincrementally, but that really \u2014 let\u2019s go back a bit. Your sister, when she gets out of\nthe cast, still can\u2019t walk, so her hip needs to be re-broken, and she\u2019s in another cast?\nIs that right?",
        "A: And she suffered all her life.",
        "Q: Oh my. From that bicycle fall.",
        "A: Not only that, at childbirth, the first child she had, they had directions not to put\nher into stirrups, and they neglected it, and they damaged the hip, which had been\nbroken twice.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: She suffered all her life, yes.",
        "Q: Did it take a long time for it to heal properly, and when could she walk again?\nOctober 4, 2015",
        "A: Sh \u2014 it never healed properly, ever, until she had one of the first hip\nreplacements, bec \u2014 she \u2014 no, gotta back up, no. She did not consent to a hip\nreplacement, which is what they suggested, but at the time, it took a year of\nrecovery, and the surgery was only done in England.",
        "Q: This is after the war?",
        "A: Here, yes. Later on in life. And so, she had a \u2014 I don\u2019t know what they call it, she\nhad a pin put in. She had several pins put in.",

And I wanted to\nexplain a little bit why I wanted to know this detail, simply because people should\nnot have only a sanitized version of what others went through in order to survive.\nAnd that often, you had to make a tough decision.

Now, about\nfive years ago, or four years ago, this doctor, Dr. Keesing gets my name through an\norganization here that\u2019s \u2014 the Kindertransport has an organization. I went to one\nor two meetings, and find out about Dr. Keesing.",
        "Q: Okay, so we\u2019re going \u2014 at this point I\u2019m going to interject and say that, we\u2019re\ntalking about \u2014 now jumping ahead to about 2010, and Dr. Keesing 1s \u2014 tell us who\nshe is, and \u2014",

And she writes me this \u2014 all of this information of the\ndocuments of my entry, the documents of my exit of Holland. She had already\ndocumented me, she knew all about me. But she\u2019s trying to figure out how this allOctober 4, 2015\nhappened. So, on our second or third email, I said, with all the work you\u2019re doing, I\nhave been thinking about a young man by the name of Danny Appel(ph), and I had\nno response. I can\u2019t figure it out, because previously she emailed me back right\naway. One evening I am by myself, right here, and the phone rings. And a\ngentleman is on the other line, and he said he\u2019d like to speak to me, and was I in\nHolland, blah, blah, blah. And I\u2019m sure that this 1s a hoax. So I said, I\u2019m terribly\nsorry, but I don\u2019t know who you are, and I\u2019m going to hang up the phone. And he\nsaid, no, no, no, no, no, he said, I forgot to mention Dr. Keesing gave me your\nnumber. Well, with that I knew whoever this person was. It turned out to be Danny\nAppel(ph) \u2014",
        "Q: Wow.",

He was \u2014 he remained in Holland at the\nbeginning of the war, but when he was \u2014 the entrance into Holland, his German\npassport, he was Rudolf Appel(ph), that was his name. He changed it to Daniel,\nDanny for short. That\u2019s what he was known by. So when I\u2019m asking for Danny, he\nis no longer Danny, he jar \u2014 he joined the French underground \u2014",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: \u2014 and survived in France, under Danny. He \u2014 he finally gets a visa to come to\nthe United States, and his passport is Rudolf, so he has to change his passport back\nOctober 4, 2015\nto Rudolf. And I said to him, I have your picture, and he said, I can\u2019t believe it. So I\nwent, enlarged the picture, send it to him. And my children said, Mom \u2014 this was in\nFebruary, so my children said, get on a plane and go to New York. I said no, it\u2019s\nwintertime, I\u2019m not doing that. So that summer, I did just that.",

And my sister and I, who never had\nheard of this, didn\u2019t know anything about it, we, both of us refused to have anything\nto do with my mother, because she\u2019d been with \u2014",

All our things went to L.A., and some clothes went to L.A., and we were not\nprepared for winter, except what we had on our bags. But the gentleman who has\nsponsored us, who was a Chicagoan, had a brother in L.A.

So, I\u2019m fascinated. I was \u2014 went over, introduced myself in German, and I\nsaid, forgive me, but I\u2019m curious. What are you doing in Israel? And this one lady\nturned to me and she said, I know so little about the Holocaust. She said, I\u2019m doing\nmy master\u2019s in education, and we all came here to be educated. She looked at me\nOctober 4, 2015\nand she said, and what are you doing in Israel. And I \u2014 of course, I answered her,\nand she said, you lived through Hitler\u2019s time?

But you know, I had young kids, I\nwasn\u2019t interested, or \u2014 I think I sent Christmas cards or something, but nothing on a\nvery personal basis. So, it was a glorious two days.

And I \u2014 I have always feel that perhaps I was too young to realize what was\n103October 4, 2015\nreally going on. I didn\u2019t have the burden of all the hardship. I was \u2014 I was well\ntaken care of until Kristallnacht. And I felt my childhood was absolutely glorious,\nlovely. I mean, I had as lovely a childhood as I wanted my children to have. But we\n\u2014 we definitely had values in our family. We had religion in our family. And I have\nfelt very grateful that \u2014 we talk about it a lot, especially when the holidays come\nabout. Because most of my friends are not so inclined. And I love to go to services,\nI enjoy it, I\u2014 something very personal that I get out of it. And I think my \u2014 my\nchildren are involved, but not to the extent that I am. They are \u2014 I always feel they\ndo things cause they know it means a lot to me. They do go to services, but not on a\nregular basis, you know. But that\u2019s fine. They have their value system, I have mine.\nSo I have been \u2014 I have always said, I\u2019m so grateful that I had the kind of parents I\nhad, cause I was given values that have served me well, and I \u2014 you learn very early\non in life, I was very independent, and I\u2019m very particular about friends I choose.\nAnd I \u2014 I\u2019ve always been.

        "A: She was very unusual.",
        "A: I have no idea.",
        "A: I have no idea. I would imagine that she didn\u2019t go on the road to different\nexhibitions, my father did that, and I \u2014",

        "A: Yes, absolutely.",
        "A: And then later on, I had to go \u2014 that gymnasium had a lower school also.",
        "A: And that\u2019s when \u2014 I transferred there, and that was a good 35 minute by\nstreetcar. But we \u2014 we had a driver from the business, and when he showed up early\nenough, we would be driven to school. But it \u2014 it wasn\u2019t an every day occurrence.",
        "A: Yeah, I have \u2014 I have lo-lovely memories. I had wonderful girlfriends who lived\nin the area, none of whom were Jewish. And I came home one day, and \u2014 from\nschool it tears, because everybody was wearing a little brown uniform. And I\nwanted a brown uniform. My mother tried to explain to me that I can\u2019t have it, that\nOctober 4, 2015\nI\u2019m Jewish. Well, I ki \u2014 I didn\u2019t know why \u2014 why I couldn\u2019t have what they had.\nLike a brownie uniform. But this was a Hitler youth, and they were no longer\nallowed to talk to me. So, suddenly I had no friends, no one to be with, and that was\na little difficult. However, then I immediately, within months, I was forced to go to\na Jewish school. And so I got \u2014 had all new friends.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Not really, my life didn\u2019t change, no.",
        "A: That didn\u2019t happen \u2014",

        "A: The \u2014 prior \u2014 I think once, prior to Kristallnacht, we had these giant windows,\nstore windows, and several of them were broken, and merchandise taken, but \u2014October 4, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 that was prior to Kristallnacht.",
        "A: But after Kristallnacht, that was a si \u2014 totally \u2014 that really \u2014 yes, 1t was a major\nchange in my life. But prior to that, we had a major change also.",
        "A: The year prior to, we were to have left Germany, and you know, you needed a\nnumber. Are you familiar with that?",
        "A: Okay. You needed a number to \u2014 to emigrate, an emigration number.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: And my mother had gotten a number, very unusual. She had gone to Berlin \u2014\nthis is difficult \u2014 because Irving Berlin was entertaining in Berlin, and my mother\nsomehow or other, got to see him [indecipherable] ticket, an affidavit from Berlin,\nor from Irving Berlin, or perhaps help through someone. She had managed to \u2014 to\nget this, to no avail.",
        "A: However, she had a number in 1937, that was quite early. She \u2014 my mother gave\nmy father an ultimatum, I am leaving Germany. My father \u2014 this is interesting \u2014\nhad been an army officer in the first World War, as a Jew. I have his army papers.",
        "A: I do.",
        "A: He \u2014 my mother went and got them, my \u2014 my father said, I\u2019m not leaving\nGermany. Hitler will not touch me because I was an officer. My mother said,\nwhatever you want to do, I am leaving when my number comes up. The number\ncame up, and unfortunately my nursemaid had given my sister and I a Hanukkah\npresent, a Christmas present of a bicycle each.",
        "A: And we went and tried out our bicycle when there was a little snow on the\nground. My sister was a little heavy and clumsy, and fell off her bike and broke her\nhip.",
        "A: And at the time, you could not go to a doctor in your area unless he was Jewish.\nSo, I don\u2019t know how my mother did this, or how my father did this, she went to theOctober 4, 2015\nnearest hospital, where she wasn\u2019t supposed to be. They set her hip, and they put\nher into \u2014 oh, I don\u2019t know what they \u2014 gips, what \u2014",

And when she \u2014\nduring that time, our number came up. Well, my parents couldn\u2019t leave with a child\nin a cast, that doesn\u2019t work.",
        "A: And when she got out of the cast, she couldn\u2019t walk. Her hip had to be re-broken\nby a Jewish orthopedic doctor. It was terrible. So we missed our chance of getting\nout of Germany, because Rita wasn\u2019t able to walk.",

        "A: Oh, no, no, no, she \u2014 she applied the minute the \u2014 the numbers became available,\nmy mother applied.",
        "A: So, I don\u2019t know when that was, maybe probably \u00b037?",

        "A: I just want the uniform, like my girlfriends.",
        "A: And there, within a very short time \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 I was transferred to the other school.",
        "A: Because I \u2014 I wasn\u2019t comfortable going to that school, I mean, you weren\u2019t safe\ngoing to that school.",
        "A: And because we were not in a \u2014 we were in this unusual, new neighborhood,\nwhich was kind of \u2014 it wasn\u2019t real residential \u2014October 4, 2015",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, it\u2019s huge.",
        "A: No \u2014 yes, there were lots of \u2014 lots of businesses, smaller businesses. A lot of\nthings pertaining to the meat industry.",
        "A: So this was not a fancy neighborhood.",
        "A: Oh, we had a lovely home.",

        "A: \u2014 best suburb.",
        "A: Yes, there was. There was, many times, yes. Absolutely. You knew when you\nwere coming closer, absolutely.",
        "A: Usually trolley car.",
        "A: Only \u2014 never, we were fine until the 10\" of November.",
        "A: That was an experience, yes.",
        "A: Well, we woke up in the morning, like every other morning.",
        "A: And somehow or other, my mother, or nursemaid, I don\u2019t know who said, today\nyou\u2019re going to be driven to school. Well, it turns out our driver didn\u2019t get there. So\nwe had \u2014 you know, streetcars ran every 15 minutes, so we had to go by streetcar.\nWe hopped on the streetcar. The ride took us through the main street of Cologne,\nwhich 1s called the Ring. And once we made the turn onto this major street, my\nsister and I are sitting in the trolley, and we\u2019re saying, this must have been \u2014October 4, 2015\nsomething terrible must have happened, people must be drunk. We saw the entire\nstreet, which by the way is documented in Germany, they have pictures of all of it\n\u2014 and interestingly enough, I met the Biirgermeister of Cologne years later, who\nthat same morning was on a streetcar also, and we exchanged \u2014 he\u2019s not Jewish, of\ncourse \u2014 so we \u2014 he said, you saw this? And I said, yeah. He said, I did, too. So,\nthey had plundered all these shops. There was stuff all over the street: clothes,\nbicycles, whate \u2014 whatever the shop sold, was on this major street. And we couldn\u2019t\n\u2014 how could this happen? So we got to school, and the minute we got to our\nclassroom, we were told to go to an assembly, which was outside in a courtyard.\nThe two schools had two different buildings. And one of the buildings was on fire.\nAnd needless to say, there was a little confusion in the courtyard. And the rector\nspoke on a microphone and said, you are to try to reach your parents by phone. We\ndidn\u2019t have cell phones, but there were telephones in \u2014 at school, or get on the next\n\u2014 find a way to get home immediately. So, I hadn\u2019t seen my sister, there were\nhundreds of kids, I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know my way around, or who knows,\nmaybe I was scared, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: And the next thing I know, my sister was \u2014 suddenly was there, and she grabbed\nme and she said, we have a ride home. So I went along. It turned out our saving\nOctober 4, 2015\ngrace, that a friend of hers, whose mother was not Jewish, married to a Jewish\nattorney, she had heard what was going on, I don\u2019t know how. Chauffeur had come\nto school to pick up this little girl, and told the little girl, whoever she wants to take\nalong, come home, hop into the limo. So there were six or seven of us. So my sister\ngrabbed me, and I was in the limo. I didn\u2019t know where I was going, but \u2014 so we\nwent to a lovely home, had a lovely lunch. And from that moment on, it changed\nmy whole life, yes.",
        "A: And she suffered all her life.",
        "A: Not only that, at childbirth, the first child she had, they had directions not to put\nher into stirrups, and they neglected it, and they damaged the hip, which had been\nbroken twice.",
        "A: She suffered all her life, yes.\nOctober 4, 2015",
        "A: Sh \u2014 it never healed properly, ever, until she had one of the first hip\nreplacements, bec \u2014 she \u2014 no, gotta back up, no. She did not consent to a hip\nreplacement, which is what they suggested, but at the time, it took a year of\nrecovery, and the surgery was only done in England.",
        "A: Here, yes. Later on in life. And so, she had a \u2014 I don\u2019t know what they call it, she\nhad a pin put in. She had several pins put in.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: This is way later on \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 after her first child.",

        "A: She was in big trouble.\nOctober 4, 2015",
        "A: And then she was fine, but she couldn\u2019t do a lot of activities, you know. She\nnever regained full motion.",
        "A: Oh, it did. Yes, it did.",
        "A: Absolutely. It was topic of conversation all the time.",
        "A: Absolutely. There, people were trying to figure out where \u2014 what possibility they\nhad, if they wouldn\u2019t get their \u2014 their visas, their visa to the United States. They \u2014\nmy parents applied to China, they applied to Argentina, they applied to, oh, a\ncouple of other places.",
        "A: Yeah, oh, absolutely.",
        "A: We wanted to \u2014 but prior to this, I think it would be worth to tell you that my\nmother had two cousins in Holland, and \u2014 Jewish.\nOctober 4, 2015",

        "A: At the border.",
        "A: At the border, my sister had high heeled boots on. They took her \u2014 her heels off\nthe boots, thinking she was hiding diamonds or something. And it turned out that\nwe were not allowed to leave, and he ha \u2014 they would not allow us into Holland,\nearly 1938.",

So, I don\u2019tOctober 4, 2015\nknow whether I have blocked that out of my mind completely. However, my father,\nthe next day that we got home, my father disappeared. Totally disappeared. And for\nthree days, we had no idea where, how, what. The Germans had taken him, and\nthrown him into prison. Which was \u2014 every other man was taken off the street, for\nwhatever reason. No reason whatsoever, just pull him. Fortunately enough, the \u2014 he\nhad friends, an attorney, who got him out of jail. That was the first time. And after\nthat, things were terrible, because he had to go back to the business every day to try\nto finalize plans. This was \u2014 then they were forced to sell the business. But what\nhappened during that time, I can\u2019t tell you, except that my father was taken again,\noh, I think right in December, somewhere in December, and never knew how my\nfather got out of jail, until my mother was on her deathbed, and she said, I think I\nought to tell you something I have never revealed to anyone. So she told my sister\nand myself how she managed to get my father, and I don\u2019t think I ought to tell that\nStory.",

And she said\nshe\u2019d love to. And it got very involved. And she said, but the only way she would\nconsent is if he would be so kind, and give his signature, so that her girlfriends, who\nwere like herself \u2014 probably figured she was a lady of the night \u2014 her girlfriends\nwould never believe that he invited her.

He\u2019s in his like, middle 20s. And he\ncame to the ship to greet us, to tell us that unfortunately, we could no longer go to\nL.A. All our things went to L.A., and some clothes went to L.A., and we were not\nprepared for winter, except what we had on our bags. But the gentleman who has\nsponsored us, who was a Chicagoan, had a brother in L.A.

And so I had a little suit on, and a little sweater that I\nwore every day, and a raincoat over it. And big boots, we all wore boots, which\nwere not in fashion here, at the time.

There\nwasn\u2019t anything special. As long as you were sitting there, I figured why not? What\ndo I got to lose? I mean, all the other kids were going. Turns out this lady had three\nsons, she never had a daughter.

Could I\nadopt her?",

So, I\u2019m fascinated. I was \u2014 went over, introduced myself in German, and I\nsaid, forgive me, but I\u2019m curious. What are you doing in Israel? And this one lady\nturned to me and she said, I know so little about the Holocaust. She said, I\u2019m doing\nmy master\u2019s in education, and we all came here to be educated. She looked at me\nOctober 4, 2015\nand she said, and what are you doing in Israel. And I \u2014 of course, I answered her,\nand she said, you lived through Hitler\u2019s time?

I was \u2014 I was well\ntaken care of until Kristallnacht. And I felt my childhood was absolutely glorious,\nlovely. I mean, I had as lovely a childhood as I wanted my children to have. But we\n\u2014 we definitely had values in our family. We had religion in our family. And I have\nfelt very grateful that \u2014 we talk about it a lot, especially when the holidays come\nabout.
