        "INTERVIEW WITH MOISE (MOISHE, MOSHE, MOSES) WEINER\nMay 4, 1992\nRockville, Maryland\n(RG-50.233.0140)\nAbstract\nMoise Weiner was born in a shtetl near Vinnytsya, Ukraine where there were about 45,000 Jews\nbefore the war. The family consisted of three brothers and two sisters, another brother having\ndied around the time Moise was born. Although the family was poor, they valued education as a\nway out of poverty. Moise attended the Ukrainian school, the path to study for the professions,\ninstead of the Jewish school. He tells how people reacted when Molotov announced war with\nGermany. His older sister urged the family to get away, but they had no money. Because his\nsister was engaged to an Army officer, she was given one of the train passes issued for her\nfianc\u00e9\u2019s family. Moise\u2019s parents threw him on the train with his sister, though he had no pass;\nthus saving his life. They never made it to their destination because the Germans attacked the\ntrain. They managed to escape, and made their way to Orsk in the Urals. He worked at different\njobs until he was called into the army in 1945, after the war.\nMoise also tells about the Russian Civil War and how his parents were almost killed during the\npogroms of that time. His brothers and sister became Communists during the war. He was\ncalled a non-party Bolshevik. After the war, he became a writer and was a Refusenik for ten\nyears. Both his parents, a younger sister, a brother, and many relatives perished in the\nHolocaust.\nTranscript",
        "Moise Weiner:Moise Weiner, I was born on the 24\" of May, 1927 in the shtetl",
        "Vakhnovka (Vachnovka, Vichnifka, Wachnowka) by name. It\u2019s in the Ukraine",
        "not far from Vinnytsya (Vinnitsa, Vinnytsia, Vinitza, Winnica, Winnitsa,",
        "Winniza) Region (Oblast).",
        "Interviewer: Can you spell the shtetl for me?",
        "Moise Weiner: V A C H N O V K A, Vakhnovka, not far from Lipovets (Lipovich,",
        "Lipovec, Lipovetz, Lipowiec).",
        "Interviewer: Can you tell me a little bit about your family, what your father did\nfor a living, what your mother was doing, how many brothers and sisters you\nhave.",
        "Moise Weiner:My mother had six child births; but one, the eldest child, died when I was born in\n1927, from scarlet fever. So before war we were seven in all --- five children,\nthree brothers and two sisters. Before the Revolution my father began to work at\nthe age of eight years, when a little boy, when his mother died. I don\u2019t know how\nto say it in English; it\u2019s a long story to tell because you should know the history\non the Ukraine. It was under Polish influence. It was an estate of the Pulitz (ph?)\nor the Polish Count; and the shtetl, the villages, were working for that estate, for\nthe castle of the Pulitz. My father was taken to a merchant who bought cattle far\ndistance, and they buy food. He was a cowboy; simply he was a cowboy.",
        "Interviewer: Like he drove cattle?",
        "Moise Weiner:Cattle from Warsaw to Ukraine, from Moldavia to that place and\nso on. So he was a cowboy; and before the Revolution he was a cowboy or the\nhelp of the merchant of the cattle. After the Revolution he had no profession; he\nwas an unqualified worker. It was very hard for him to earn money for a living;\nto feed seven people, seven mouths. So we helped when we were boys; we sold\npapers.\nInterviewer: | Newspapers?",
        "Moise Weiner: Yes, you know the song, \u201cBagelach Koch Par Terrosin\u201d (ph?)? So\nit was boys (?). My eldest sister worked at the plant. The main aim of our family,\nbecause my parents were illiterate people, true they knew Yiddish, but they went\nto the Cheder, and they went to a Jewish school. But in Russian they didn\u2019t know\nthe Russian language. They couldn\u2019t write, couldn\u2019t read. My father was 54,\nmaybe 56, when he started to speak Russian, to read the newspaper; that\u2019s all, to\nsign his name. Before the war he worked at market as a tax collector. That was\nhis last job. I want to say that they spoiled us; the mother and father, especially\nmy mother. That not obliging us; but simply it was a saying, \u201cIf I had a pen in\nmy hand, I would ... (?). It was a very poor region. The people were very poor\nthere; not a ghetto, but a slum.",
        "Interviewer: Was it an agricultural region? Did people work farms or was it in\nthe city?\nMoise Weiner:In the city, in the city, in the city. It\u2019s an agricultural region, but\nthe city had some plots. We survived in the great hunger of 1932. I was by death\nalready in 1932. But we managed how to survive that hunger.\nInterviewer: That was a very bad time, I know. I studied about the famine in\nthe Ukraine at that time.\nMoise Weiner:It was not an easy living. But the main aim of our family, of my\nbrothers, to get an education; because it was the only way to make a good life, to\nget away from the Jewishness, from that Judaism that was, did not gave way to\nthe social life surroundings because there was no Jewish social life. You couldn\u2019t\nbecome an engineer studying Yiddish. You couldn\u2019t become a doctor studying\nYiddish. You could become a doctor, and engineer if you studied Russian or\nUkrainian because there were universities and institutes, and the schools were in\nRussian or in Ukraine. I started at a Ukrainian school; I know the Ukrainian\nlanguage. So it was like nail in our brains to get education.\nInterviewer: Your parents encouraged you to study.\nMoise Weiner:To study, yes, and the war delayed a bit. My elder brother got\nhired; he studied as an economist when he was 40, when he came after the war. I\nstarted by correspondence because I had to make a living, to work. As the Bible\nsays, a boy who provides himself is not enough. So I never felt myself enough, to\nbe enough, because I began to work. So everybody of us get high education.\nInterviewer: How much older were ... were you the youngest?\nMoise Weiner:I was the youngest of the boys. My sister that was killed, her name\nwas Yeva (ph?). And my younger daughter who came with us now to the United\nStates, I named her after my sister. She is Yeva.\nInterviewer: How much older were your brothers than you were? Your older\nbrothers and sisters, how much older were they:",
        "Moise Weiner: Well, my elder sister was ten years older than me. She was 24, and\nI was 14 when we left. My elder brother was six years older, and my second\nbrother was three years older. Depart in 1941 and never get together again.\nInterviewer: Your brothers, you were separated from them?\nMoise Weiner: We were separated all our life. They were in the army. The\nsecond brother we didn\u2019t know if he\u2019s alive until 1947, because we had no\ninformation about him. He went away with the boys and perished. The elder\nbrother found us, me and my sister. There was a special office in Buguruslan, in\nthe creation office, and we gave our address there. He, from the army, made the\ninquiries, and they sent him our address, and he found us at the end of 1941. That\nbrother couldn\u2019t find it. He couldn\u2019t find him until 1947. We lived in separate,\ndifferent town, cities.\nInterviewer: After the war?\nMoise Weiner: After the war, yes. My sister stayed in, there was such a town,\nOrsk in Orenburg Region. And she got married and get her work too, oculist (7?)\nin Kazakhstan. She lives now here, there, all her life there. I was a bit a tramp\nand changed many cities in my life. But most the second half of my life I lived in,\nwith my wife and my children, in the center of Russia. It is not far from Volga,\nthere\u2019s such a town, Penza --- Saratov, Penza, Kuybyshev (Kuibyshev)/Samara ---\nthat\u2019s the triangle with Vyonetsk (ph?). It is a place where practically without\nJews because in that place, before the Revolution, Jews were not allowed to live.\nIn Penza Region, the population of Penza Region is about one and a half million.\nThey\u2019re mostly Russians, a million and two hundred fifty thousand are Russians;\nthe rest are Tartars and Mordova (Moldova, Mordva). The rest in official\ninformation is given ten thousands: that\u2019s Georgians, Estonians, Syrians, Jews,\nand so on, Gypsies, and maybe it\u2019s a thousand or two thousand Jews from that\nnumber. But most of them are assimilated Jews; no Jewish life at all. So I can\nsay that I am an assimilated Jew in the Russian culture. I\u2019m a Russian writer.\nInterviewer: That\u2019s what you did after the war? You became a writer?\nMoise Weiner:I studied; I became a teacher. I studied at an Institute of Foreign\nLanguages. I learned the English language, and I worked at school and then as an",
        "interpreter, a translator at the plant; and tried to become, it\u2019s not so easy to\nbecome a writer in Russia. Well, I worked, I like to say for work; I worked to\ngain money to feed my family, to keep my family. Then I worked for myself at\nthe table writing books.\nInterviewer: For this, the book?\nMoise Weiner: Well, it\u2019s not the only; I\u2019m an author of seven books, and I\ntranslated. When I was in the age of 56, I learned Yiddish myself, and I translated\nfrom Yiddish into Russian some novels of Jewish writers. And I had my own\nbooks, and I\u2019m still a member of the Union of Russian Writers. I was a member\nfrom 1964, so it\u2019s about 30 years. So we lived separate. My brother returned to\nVinnytsya, my sister stayed in Octuvist (ph?), Kazakhstan, and I lived in Russia.\nThe last four years I lived not far from Moscow. I was ten years in refuse.\nInterviewer: In where?\nMoise Weiner:I was refusenik. Ten years, they didn\u2019t allow me to go. I appealed\nin 19... I showed you the photo when we forced, they are standing in 1982, I\ncame to Vinnytsya. We met, all because I was a year in refuse, and I was waiting\nfor permission to go. And we met. It was \u201991 I appealed first to leave the country\nbecause I wanted to go away from there. I managed to get away only this year.\nInterviewer: How long ago did you arrive in this country?\nMoise Weiner: Three months and a half.\nInterviewer: So you got here when?\nMoise Weiner:In January, the 11\" of January. See, the 11\" is, how to say it,\narakavua (ph?), it\u2019s such a number. The 11\" of July in 1941 I left Vinnytsya, and\nin the 11\" of January I left Russia too.\nInterviewer: That\u2019s right, symmetry.",
        "Moise Weiner:I don\u2019t remember what is the English word for that.\nInterviewer: Can you tell me a little bit about Vinnytsya when you were\ngrowing up. What kind of town it was like? Were there a lot of Jews there?\nMoise Weiner: Yes. It was before the war, it was like Berdychiv (Bardichev,\nBerdichev, Berditchev, Berditchov, Berdyczow) that\u2019s the Jewish town.\nInterviewer: Very high Jewish population.\nMoise Weiner: Yes. It was a Jewish town, mostly Jewish town, and I spoke\nYiddish in my family. We were a Yiddish family. But in the street with my\nfriends, it was a Jewish street, a Jewish region, a Jewish settlement, Jerusalemka\n(ph?). It was a mixed language: Jewish, Ukrainian, Russian, not a pure language.\nAt school I started Ukrainian; all of us, we started in a Ukrainian school. I think\nthat it was about, maybe half of the population was Jewish. It was about maybe\n45,000 of Jews in Vinnytsya before the war; and 36 of them were killed; 36,000\nwere killed, approximately. Nobody knows the exact number. But you see even\nafter forty years after the war, when you have married and children, it recovered;\nit restored only to 10,000. It didn\u2019t recover the Jewish population. The remains\nof that population left for Israel; most of them. The son of my elder brother is the\nlast now who stays now in Vinnytsya, but he applied for ...\nInterviewer: To leave.\nMoise Weiner:To leave --- he wants to go to the United States, not to Israel.\nWell, so when he leaves, nobody of our relatives ...\nInterviewer: The last of the relatives.\nMoise Weiner: Yeah, it\u2019s the last of the relatives in Vinnytsya. But my sister is in\nKazakhstan, and her son is in Leningrad; that\u2019s all.",
        "Interviewer: Do you remember any instances when you were growing up of",
        "anti-Semitism:",
        "Moise Weiner:In Vinnytsya?",
        "Interviewer: In Vinnytsya.",
        "Moise Weiner: Only, only, how to say, in the street maybe; but there was no state",
        "anti-Semitism before the war. You can call it, it\u2019s not anti-Semitism. There were",
        "many Jewish schools in Vinnytsya. There was even a college, a Jewish college.",
        "But they lost their students, not because of anti-Semitism, but because of the",
        "trends of assimilation; because the main trend of the Jewish life was to become",
        "assimilated. It was theoretically approved by Marxism, because there was no",
        "Israel before the war. The only way to become cultured, educated people was to",
        "become, so the Marxists said, and it was the politics of the state, because it was a",
        "Marxist state, to help the Jews to become assimilated in the surrounding culture,",
        "the Russian Ukraine. So it was not an act of anti-Semitism, but I would say quite",
        "contrary. It was the desire to help the Jews to get away from that life they led",
        "because they were not educated; they had no profession, no skill. They were",
        "mainly shopkeepers; not shopkeepers, but petty shopkeepers.",
        "Interviewer: That\u2019s bourgeois?",
        "Moise Weiner:No, it\u2019s not bourgeois. It\u2019s you bought a chicken; our neighbor,",
        "she bought a chicken, alive. In our family we didn\u2019t eat poultry from the shops.",
        "My mother used to go to the market to buy live chickens, and I, as the youngest,",
        "my duty was to go with them to the shochet; if you know what\u2019s that. It was a",
        "special synagogue. The synagogue was demolished in 1936 or 37, but not as an",
        "act of anti-Semitism. It was an act of religious; because not synagogues, but",
        "churches, Polish kosciols, they were closed and demolished, too. There is a",
        "special --- do you know what is kashrut?",
        "Interviewer: Kosher, yes.",
        "Moise Weiner: Kosher, so if you want to have kosher poultry you have to go to a",
        "special man who killed with a razor; it was called shochet. He was in the",
        "neighborhood with the synagogue. But when the synagogue was demolished to",
        "the ground, his box was left; and I brought him the poultry, usually two chickens.",
        "But our neighbor, she bought a chicken. She cleared from the feathers and cut it\nin four pieces and went selling it to the neighbors. It was her living. So, is she\npetty bourgeois? This was the trade. In our house was a metal worker, I don\u2019t\nknow in English. The other was a kersak (ph?); furs, hats and clothes from fur.\nInterviewer: A furrier.\nMoise Weiner:A furrier, artisans maybe. The second was a glass-maker,\nwindows. He put glasses into windows.\nInterviewer: These people all lived in your building?\nMoise Weiner:On our street. It was such people. The most educated one in our\nstreet was an account. That was the intelligentsia of our street, that\u2019s all. That\nwas our Street.\nInterviewer: Do you remember what your street was called, the name of the\nstreet?\nMoise Weiner:The name of the street was called Niznagrazdowska (ph?). Now\nthe street does not exist. I showed you --- no street. Shalom (Sholom, Sholem)\nAleichem was the second. It does not exist now. A bit, three house on the second\nhalf maybe are left from Shalom Aleichem Street. That\u2019s all; so, a very nice\ntown, very green. A river, a very nice river, The Southern Bug (Buh). I had\nmany friends.\nInterviewer: Were most of your friends Jewish or were they ...?\nMoise Weiner: Jewish, Jewish. Most of them were killed. My best friend, his\nname was Reva Drakob (ph?). He and his father, they stayed in the town, were\ntaken for hard labor, and they worked for the Nazis not far from Kiev; dug in the\nearth, I don\u2019t know exactly what.\nInterviewer: Ditches.",
        "Moise Weiner:Ditches. And my friend, he was a boy with my age, maybe he was\nfifteen or sixteen already. He began to quarrel with the --- not the supervisor, but\nwith kapo I don\u2019t know what --- Ukrainians, policemen; and he was killed with a\nspade, my friend. And his father became mad seeing that. After the war I came\nto Vinnytsya, and they found the family, the mother; and she did not allow me to\ngreet her husband, the father of my friend, because not to disturb him. One of my\nbest friends, he has the same name as me, we were sitting the same desk in school\nseven years. Do you understand what\u2019s friendship, if you are sitting seven years?\nHe was killed during the war, and his mother, when she met me in the street, she\nbegan to beat me. She went into hysteria, she became hysterical; why he\u2019s killed\nand you are alive. But she didn\u2019t understand what she says, but she knew me\nfrom the boyhood. So most of my friends were killed during the war.\nInterviewer: Did you go to a Jewish school?\nMoise Weiner:No.\nInterviewer: You went to a public school then?\nMoise Weiner:I went to --- the Jewish schools were public schools. They were\nnot private schools. They were state schools, as the Ukrainians and Russians, but\nI told you that first, I wanted to go to a Jewish school. But then my elder sister,\nshe took me away from there because she wanted to make, not a career, but to\nmake life better. You have to go to, not only me, but everybody decided. I went\nto, my brothers, me and my sister, we all went to Ukrainian schools; started in\nUkrainian schools, it\u2019s not public. But before the war there were three Jewish\nschools. But if in our class, in the seventh class, were maybe 40 pupils in one\nclass; in Jewish school were only five. And one of my friends who went to the\nJewish schools, he said that we are lucky because we are asked by the teacher\nmaybe once in two weeks; and he had to prepare his lessons every day because\nthey are only five pupils in the class. It was before the war, but maybe at the\nbeginning of the war they are full. After the war, no Jewish schools. The main\nlanguage in the streets was Jewish.\nInterviewer: Hebrew or Yiddish?",
        "Moise Weiner:No, Yiddish. Hebrew was not in favor; it\u2019s loshn-koydesh (Lashon\nHaKodesh), it\u2019s only for the prayers. But every day was Jewish, Yiddish.\nTherefore, Ukrainian or Jewish was the language. After the war, maybe 50 years,\nI had Jewish speech; but the last years, no Jewish language.\nInterviewer: Let me ask you, do you remember any of --- I know that you know\nthe Germans come to power; the Nazis come to power in Germany in 1933. Did\nyou know, or did people in your family know, about the Germans; what the Nazis\nwere doing in Germany at this time?\nMoise Weiner: Well, I can tell you one detail of the beginning of the war what the\npeople heard about the Germans. It is an emotional. When the war, I was in the\nstreet with my friend. He photographed me, and we went to the shop to buy some\nchemicals for the negatives. And the way they announced it at 12 o\u2019clock, the\nprime minister will be speaking with the urgent information. And we went home,\nbecause we were waiting for something like that. It was Molotov speaking, and\nwhen he announced that we are at war with the Germans, I run out into the street.\nFrom every house 1n that street there was not weeping, but howling, like about\ndeath. The people felt that they are doomed to death. That was the first feeling.\nThat was the attitude, the knowledge about the Germans. Surely we knew about\nthe Nazi\u2019s attitude to the Jews, but not at that ... that was the first reaction; and it\nwas an exact reaction.\nInterviewer: Do you remember in 1939 when the Germans and the Soviet\nUnion divided Poland; do you remember what people thought about that at the\ntime? Were they concerned that the Germans were going to come on in to the\nSoviet Union, or were they not very concerned? Do you remember\u2019?\nMoise Weiner: Yes. My father, the matter is that Vinnytsya, the railroad was to\nthe west was through Vinnytsya; and we saw the trains with goods that were\nbutter, flour, and so on. We didn\u2019t get bread enough, and everything was sent to\nGermany. That\u2019s the first time; but when the Germans went into Finland in 1940\nInterviewer: When the Germans went into Finland?\nMoise Weiner: Yes, after we were at war with Finland, the Germans were invited\nby the Finns to come in; and when they went there, my father said, \u2018that\u2019s war\u2019.",
        "Interviewer: He knew that they were going to attack after that.\nMoise Weiner: Yeah, that\u2019s war. He was not very great politician, but he\nunderstand. He was a very clever man. He understood; he was not educated, but\nlife educated him. Life is a very good teacher. He understand when they went\ninto Romania, that they are ready to go to war. He understood it quite well.\nInterviewer: So it wasn\u2019t a surprise when they attacked?\nMoise Weiner:No, no, it was not a surprise, because we were waiting every day\nfor that. We were not far from the old frontier, and my brother was in the army;\nand he was on special courses in Chisinau (Kishinev, Keshenev, Keshinov,\nKhisinau, Kishenew, Kiscinev, Kishinef, Kiszyniow). But his division was in\nComrat (Komrat). Now if you followed the events in Russia, the Gagauz\n(Gagauzia, Gagauz Yeni) Republic there on the south; the capital of that\nautonomy is Comrat. And he was serving in Comrat; but he was in courses,\nspecial courses. He was in Chisinau, and his last letter was that he\u2019s recalled to\nhis --- it was the 29\" of May --- and when he got this letter, my father said, \u2018that\u2019s\nawful\u2019. He understood it.\nInterviewer: That was the 29\" of May in 1941.\nMoise Weiner: Yes.\nInterviewer: So about a month before the war started.\nMoise Weiner: Yes, because the Germans were there already in Romania. He\nunderstood what --- he knew it not from the papers, but he knew it from life; the\nmovement of our brothers, our sons, everything.\nInterviewer: Do you remember what the papers were saying at that time?\nMoise Weiner:I don\u2019t know exactly; but it was \u2018be calm\u2019.",
        "Interviewer: That war wouldn\u2019t happen, and things like that?\nMoise Weiner: Yes. Yes.\nInterviewer: You said that your brother was in the army. When did he go into\nthe army, your older brother?\nMoise Weiner: 1940.\nInterviewer: He went into the army in 1940, and that\u2019s your oldest brother?\nMoise Weiner: Oldest brother.\nInterviewer: What was his name?\nMoise Weiner:Israel. We all had biblical names. I\u2019m Moshe, Moise, Moses.\nHe\u2019s Israel; and my second brother is Shimson something, Simson; I don\u2019t know\nInterviewer: Oh, Samson.\nMoise Weiner: Yes. Samson, Samson the gibber (ph?), Shimson the gibber. In\nYiddish it\u2019s ... in Hebrew it 1s Samson the strongest, the giant, Samson.\nInterviewer: Do you remember --- let\u2019s see, you told me a little bit about when\nthe war started, when you said the people were howling when they heard about\nthe war starting. After that, what happened? What did people do? Did people try\nto get away? Did they run?",
        "Moise Weiner: Yes, the people tried to get --- my sister urged my father to get\naway immediately on November the 24\"\". But we were very poor, and we had no\nmoney, and ...\nInterviewer: This was your older sister who said this?\nMoise Weiner: Yes. She was the most cultured; she understood better than anyone\nwhat is happening. Three days she stayed in a line on the station to buy a ticket.\nInterviewer: For three days she did?\nMoise Weiner:She didn\u2019t manage to get a ticket.\nInterviewer: But she stood in line for three days?\nMoise Weiner:She stood in line beginning from the 26\" until the 29\", and then\nthey canceled to sell tickets.\nInterviewer: And this was tickets for the train?\nMoise Weiner: Tickets for the train; he wanted to go to Kiev. We hoped that Kiev\nwould never be occupied. The myth was that when the Germans would come to\nthe old frontier, fire will fire them off. They will perish in fire because we had a\nmyth that our frontier is like a line of Maginot. So we hope, and we ...\nTape 1, Side B",
        "Moise Weiner:29\" or 30\" of May, of June; but it was then to deal with that panic\nthe authorities spread. Not the news, but hearing, I don\u2019t know, that the cavalry\nof Budyonny (Budyonnyy, Budennii, Budenny, Budyoni, Budyenny), there was\nsuch a commander, a hero of the civil war, of the Revolution, that his cavalry\npushed back the Germans and liberated L\u2019viv (Lvov, Lwow, Lemberg, Leopol).\nAnd the people went home.",
        "Interviewer: They were calmed by that.\nMoise Weiner:By that; returned to their homes, not every ... But the authorities\nused these two days to form echelon and to send away their families.\nInterviewer: The government people did this?\nMoise Weiner: Yes, the Communists, the local ...\nInterviewer: Because they knew what was happening?\nMoise Weiner: Yes. They sent away in passenger cars with their dogs and\nsuitcases (?) with their home flowers. People saw that, after the second of June\nwhen they sent away their families, the panic began again. On the fifth, the youth\nwas sent away from the town.\nInterviewer: All the youth was, yeah.\nMoise Weiner:... is my brother.\nInterviewer: Oh, to go to the army; all the people who were of age to go in the\narmy.\nMoise Weiner: Yeah, they were taken away; and little by little the town became\nempty. It was every night it was bombed by the Germans.\nInterviewer: When did the bombing start, do you remember?\nMoise Weiner: Yeah, the first bombing was on the 24\" of June, on the second day\nof the war; on the third day of the war. And he came every day right at twelve\no\u2019clock.",
        "Interviewer: Twelve o\u2019clock at noon?\nMoise Weiner:No, no, in the night. And he bombed mostly with fire bombs to\nmake. And he knew what to bomb, he knew what to bomb. First he bombed\nstores --- medicine stores, the food stores, the Red Army building, and so on. So\nwas the first bombing.\nInterviewer: And that continued on every day?\nMoise Weiner:Every day, every day.\nInterviewer: What did your family do?\nMoise Weiner:Every night we went to the bomb shelters. We spent the night in\nthe bomb shelter.\nInterviewer: How far away from your house was the bomb shelter?\nMoise Weiner:Not far. It\u2019s maybe three --- it was in a Jewish school, in a\nbasement of a Jewish school; not far, two or three, two blocks away maybe. We\nmade trenches. I remember; on this place we dug trenches. In the day we sat\nthere. It was a deep trench, maybe two meters deep, covered with logs. We sat\nthere. But after that, a bomb struck one trench, and everybody was killed; we\npreferred to go to the bomb shelter.\nInterviewer: You said that your family didn\u2019t have enough money to go, to\nleave.\nMoise Weiner:I won\u2019t say. Well, we couldn\u2019t get tickets to the railway. The\nquestion was to buy a pair of horses and a cart and go away. My mother was an\nill woman; she was not very old I understand now, she was 48. But she had\nthrombosis (?), if you know what\u2019s that?",
        "Interviewer: No.",
        "Moise Weiner: It\u2019s varicose veins. We discussed several variants how to get",
        "away. By foot she couldn\u2019t go. To buy horses and a cart, no money. To get",
        "together with somebody, very poor people, no money. So we didn\u2019t know what to",
        "do. The only way was the railroad station. So we went on the eighth of July; we",
        "went to the railway station, that\u2019s all.",
        "Interviewer: And that\u2019s when your parents put you on...",
        "Moise Weiner:It was we sat three days there, not be able to get, only on the 11\"",
        "of July they gave eight open cars, open wagons. So we departed on the station",
        "with my parents on the 11\" of July.",
        "Interviewer: Did they tell you anything when they left as to what you should do,",
        "what you should try to do, just go where they took you or ...",
        "Moise Weiner: We didn\u2019t think that the Germans would really come. My father,",
        "because the bombings were every day, told that the children must be sent away",
        "from the town, from the bombing. He didn\u2019t think that the Germans would come",
        "because the old frontier will stop them. He was sure that it would be so. So he",
        "gave us a loaf of bread and a piece of fat; Ukrainian bread, that\u2019s all we had with",
        "ourselves for three days. He told us for three days it would be enough for you.",
        "You would go somewhere. I don\u2019t remember, I was a boy; I don\u2019t remember",
        "exactly what, but that was the whole supply. Instead of three days, a week were",
        "100 kilometers.",
        "Interviewer: For one week you only made 100 kilometers on the train?",
        "Moise Weiner: Yes. We stopped every half hour.",
        "Interviewer: Because of the bombing?",
        "Moise Weiner:Bombing, blocking of the rails and so on. The peasants didn\u2019t ---",
        "we went to a village to buy something. They didn\u2019t want to get the money, it\u2019s",
        "paper; give something, we hadn\u2019t. We had nothing. Change, natural change; they",
        "didn\u2019t take money. So I don\u2019t remember exactly any instruction what to do,",
        "because nobody knew what to do.",
        "Interviewer: Was this a special train to get children out of the city?",
        "Moise Weiner:No, no; a train; who had passes. The passes was to Kuybyshev;",
        "the pass was to Kuybyshev.",
        "Interviewer: How did you and your sister get passes? Did your parents buy",
        "them for you?",
        "Moise Weiner:No, no. I told you that my sister was engaged, and he was an",
        "officer in the army. And his family get passes. The pass was for four people. His",
        "parents did not go. His two sisters, three sisters, took for one place my sister. I",
        "was without a pass. I was thrown simply on the edge (7); that\u2019s all.",
        "Interviewer: Your father threw you on the train?",
        "Moise Weiner: Yes. He saved me my life; give me my life for the second time.",
        "Interviewer: As far as you knew, the train was just going to go to Kuybyshev;",
        "and that\u2019s as far at it would go?",
        "Moise Weiner: Yes.",
        "Interviewer: How long did it take you to get from Vinnytsya to Kuybyshev?",
        "Moise Weiner: We didn\u2019t get to Kuybyshev.",
        "Interviewer: You never made it there?",
        "Moise Weiner: We were bombed. Not far from Vinnytsya was a satcha (ph?)",
        "station of Sinivka (ph?). We were bombed there, and then after that we met the",
        "sisters of my sister\u2019s groom; they were in the army. And we stayed in the hospital\nwith them, in a military hospital. And after that, they put us in an echelon of\nwounded; my sister and his two sisters, as medical sisters to help the wounded.\nInterviewer: That was going to the East?\nMoise Weiner:To the East, yes; and we managed to go only 18 or 16 kilometers\nfrom that station. We met the German tanks, five tanks. They began to shell the\nlocomotives, stopped him, set him the fire. We didn\u2019t understand what was\nhappening. We thought it was bombing, simply bombing. We didn\u2019t catch it; the\nGermans are here already. So, but when we looked out, we saw five tanks\napproaching and shelling the echelon; and they shelled every, setting fire.\nInterviewer: Was this train marked as a wounded train, like a Red Cross on it,\nor anything?\nMoise Weiner:Do not remember. It was cars, like, not passenger cars, but we\ncalled them Japluski (ph?). That\u2019s for cattle.\nInterviewer: Cattle car.\nMoise Weiner:Cattle car or for foods; not food, but car for products, produce ---\nfreight. And there were shelves, mid-shelves, and the wounded were lying on the\nshelves and on the floor --- both sides. And we were helping them who was\nwithout in the head, with legs, and very hard wounded. And they set every car in\nfire; and who could run, they jumped out, and we ran away. And those who could\nnot run, could not move, they perished in that fire. So, 1t was such an experience,\nyeah. So after that, we ran by foot, maybe 24 hours, running from .... Those\ntanks, they were running after us and tried to shell, how to say it, to kill you with\nthe shell, the running soldiers. They were playing; the aim was like shooting.\nAnd we were running about 24 hours; don\u2019t stop. After the war, I found that there\nwas when we went to such a town, Uman, on the Ukraine. And after the war\nwhen I was writing that book about the war, I learned that the Germans\nsurrounded three armies from that town. It was called the Uman cattle. They\ntook like 100,000 soldiers and officers, only like prisoners of war. But we\nmanaged to get out from that loop.\nInterviewer: From the trap?",
        "Moise Weiner:From that trap; and we went out, not to the east, but to the south,\nsouthwest [was more likely southeast] to the railroad, such a town, Pervomays\u2019k.\nAnd from there we caught a train; it was maybe weeks, (??). So we never came to\nKuybyshev. We came to Kuybyshev after two months, maybe, of moving; but\nthey didn\u2019t wait for us. So we went further to the Urals. We wanted to go to the\nmiddle Asia, most of them. Most of the echelons were directed to the middle\nAsia, but when we sprang out from the tanks running, I was in a shirt and the\ntrousers, and my sister was in a thin summer dress. And that was all we had on\nus. And after two months, we were shabby and lousy, without money; and we\ndecided to stop our running not far from Orenburg. And one of our sisters, a girl,\nshe got a job in Orsk; and we lived 10 people in such aroom. And there it was at\nthe end of September ....\nInterviewer: Now Orsk is in the Urals?\nMoise Weiner: Yes, it\u2019s in the South Urals. It is on the river Ural. It is the frontier\nbetween Europe and Asia; so you can stay in Europe, cross the bridge, and you\nare in Asia. So I lived on two continents; it\u2019s divided. That town 1s situated on\nboth sides of that river, and that\u2019s in Europe and in Asia.\nInterviewer: When you arrived there, what did you do? Did they put you to\nwork?\nMoise Weiner: My sister got a job, and I found a job.\nInterviewer: What was your job?\nMoise Weiner:My first job was a terrific one. I was a little boy.\nInterviewer: You were about 14 at this time?\nMoise Weiner: Fourteen, yes. I was more than 14 because I was born in May and\nthat was in September; and 14 and three, four months. I went to (don\u2019t know",
        "what it is in English) tshicago (ph?); what\u2019s tshicago, how they call that cattle is\nkilled.\nInterviewer: How they kill cattle? A slaughterhouse?\nMoise Weiner:Slaughterhouse, yes; a huge slaughterhouse, and the cattle 1s killed.\nAnd from the meat is sausages and so on; conserve, baked, so.... I worked there\n10 days. It was a specialty, I don\u2019t know; the hind part of a cow, frozen, with\nsuch a knife. I had to clear the meat from the bones, and it\u2019s a great skill to put\nthe knife between the bone and not the meat; but if you know if meat. You know\nthat between the bone and meat is some layer ...\nInterviewer: A membrane.\nMoise Weiner:A membrane; and if you do not put your knife between the surface\nof the bone and that membrane, you will suffer a great deal because you will not\ncut ...\nInterviewer: Hard to cut it.\nMoise Weiner: Yes, hard to cut. I had not the skill to do it, and it was heavier than\nI myself and frozen. On the 10\" day, I put the knife into the fingers, and I got\nblood infection. So it was blue, my hand. I went away from that. After when\nthey healed my hand, I went to sewing --- not fabric --- 1t was enterprise, so ...\nInterviewer: This is where they built sewing machines?\nMoise Weiner:No, no. It\u2019s where sewing uniform for the army --- women mostly;\nand I started. First I was an apprentice, and then when I was 15, I became master\nof the shift because the grown-up were called to the front. And I and three other\nboys were the gang that had to check regularly to repair the machines. So I was a\nqualified master at 16. At 16, I had the highest qualification, the eighth\nqualification for master. And there I worked all the war until 1945, until I was\ncalled to the army.\nInterviewer: And you were called into the army in 1945?",
        "Moise Weiner: Yes.",
        "Interviewer: What time of year; do you remember?",
        "Moise Weiner:It was after the war. I was 18 in May, and it was in June or July.",
        "In August I was called to Leninburg (ph?) [perhaps Leningrad]. It was in August",
        "already. But I did not serve in the army. I was called to Lindacher (ph?)",
        "Academy, and I did not manage to get into it.",
        "Interviewer: Can you tell me a little bit about the town that you were in, in",
        "Orsk; what it was like at that time during the war? Were there lots of hardship,",
        "was there much food there?",
        "Moise Weiner: No; it is ... 1f you know the history of Russia, maybe you know of",
        "the Ukrainian poet, Taras Shevchenko. Taras Shevchenko was in exile in that",
        "town, last century. When he was in that town, he wrote about it. It is a town",
        "where nothing to hank (?) yourself. It\u2019s Steppe. It was formed as a fortress the",
        "Russians used to expanding into the middle Asia. In Asia they used to form in the",
        "Steppe, fortresses. Orsk was at first a military fortress.",
        "Interviewer: An outpost or something.",
        "Moise Weiner: Outpost, it\u2019s an outpost as you call it. It\u2019s a hill --- the first. The",
        "outpost was built on a hill. It looks around the Steppe. Before the war, they",
        "found nickel.",
        "Interviewer: Nickel, the metal.",
        "Moise Weiner:Metal. And they built a very large plant there, nickel plant. And",
        "many enterprises from the Ukraine, Russia, were evacuated to that town. Most of",
        "them were military. Over the fence there was from Moscow, a plant. Boys were",
        "working. They made mines, yeah. We were sewing ammunition for garment (?),",
        "and they were making mines. The others were making shells and so on. It was",
        "mostly plants, military plants, and three labor camps. It was gulag, one of the",
        "gulag places. They were mostly engaged, exploited, in building the houses.",
        "There was socialist town. They built the houses in that town; some schools, many",
        "hospitals, and that\u2019s a slaughter house, and that\u2019s all I suppose. Now it\u2019s a very",
        "large industrial town. Food, food, there was no food. There was no food; the\nsystem was they had cards ---\nInterviewer: A ration card?\nMoise Weiner:Ration card, yes. We got --- I got 500 grams of bread.\nInterviewer: Every day?\nMoise Weiner:Every day, but it was not enough.\nInterviewer: Did you get anything else besides bread?\nMoise Weiner: Yes, we used these cards only in the dining --- not restaurants, but\nthey were called; not fabric, but had its own dining ...\nInterviewer: Canteen or...\nMoise Weiner: Yes, and there we dined there. We had dinner there, and we had to\ngive our cards there. And I had a garden with my sister; we raised potatoes. And\nyour --- I don\u2019t remember --- Wallace maybe; was not the ambassador to Russia,\nbut he was a special envoy of Roosevelt in Russia. He called those gardens,\nvegetable gardens, victory gardens; because if not those gardens, it would be very\nhard to survive. So we had some supply of potatoes for the winter. That\u2019s all I\nsuppose what we had. But work, I worked; the shift was for the machines was 10\nhours; one hour the break, one hour to change the shift. It was 12 hours; 24 hours\nwere divided into two.\nInterviewer: So some people worked in the day, and some people worked at\nnight. Is that how it worked?\nMoise Weiner: We changed; one week in the day and one week in the night. The\nshift began at eight o\u2019clock in the morning and ended at eight o\u2019clock in the\nevening. The night shift began at eight o\u2019clock in the evening and ended at eight",
        "o\u2019clock. But we, the mechanics, had to work much more because we were\nobliged to work some two, three hours to help our colleagues.\nInterviewer: You all made sure the machines were running all right?\nMoise Weiner: Yeah, because we had no supplies of details, of spare parts during\nthe war; and the machines were out of work, most of them. So the usual working\nday for me was 14, 16 hours. And if that master who had to change me, if he fell\nill, I was put, as they called it, that time on the war situation; had no right to leave\nthe shop and could prolong three, four a week, round the clock work. Five\nminutes sleep was a happy change.\nInterviewer: And you did this until the end of the war? This is where you\nworked?\nMoise Weiner: Yeah.\nInterviewer: I think that\u2019s all the questions I have about your story. Can I ask\nyou about your parents?\nMoise Weiner: Yeah, I told you some things.\nInterviewer: You're right; let\u2019s go back. Tell me where they were born and\ntheir names.\nMoise Weiner: Yes, well I cannot say exactly where they were; I think they were\nborn in Vakhnovka. They were married in Vakhnovka, in the same shtetl where I\nwas born.\nInterviewer: What was your mother\u2019s name?\nMoise Weiner:I want you to explain me one thing, with the names. Nobody\nknows the full name, because when the Jews were given last names, what you call\nhere, they were not given their real Jewish names, but depending on the place\nwhere they lived or to the Count to whom they belonged. In the Ukraine the",
        "names were distorted. So my brother is a Suar (ph?); but in the Ukraine, it was",
        "distorted to Srue (ph?). I saw even here in America, a man died, and his name\u2019s",
        "Srue; not a Suar, but a Srue. It\u2019s not a name; it\u2019s something ...",
        "Interviewer: It\u2019s like a nickname or something?",
        "Moise Weiner:It\u2019s not a nickname; it\u2019s like Bob, Robert and Bob.",
        "Interviewer: Yeah, that would be a nickname. Like my name is Anthony; my",
        "real name is Anthony, but my nickname is Tony.",
        "Moise Weiner:So my father\u2019s father\u2019s name, not my father, but my grandfather\u2019s",
        "name; I only last year found it in the Bible. It is Issachar (Yissachar); Isischor",
        "(ph?) in English. But my father\u2019s second name was --- he was Isaac; my father",
        "Sauschis (ph?), not Issachar, but Sachar (ph?). You have half a name. So what is",
        "the name of my mother? The real, I don\u2019t know; I know she was called Machla.",
        "Interviewer: Machla, and that was her first name?",
        "Moise Weiner:Her first name, and her maiden name was Sandler. And when she",
        "married, she became Weiner.",
        "Interviewer: So your father\u2019s --- he was Isaac Weiner?",
        "Moise Weiner:Isaac Weiner, yes. Russian transcription of Machla is Maria. Well",
        "maybe we be transcribed as so, but we don\u2019t know 1s it really so.",
        "Interviewer: Machla looks fine to me.",
        "Moise Weiner:Fine, yeah? Well, it\u2019s Machla.",
        "Interviewer: Do you remember the years that they were born, their birthdays?",
        "Moise Weiner: Yes; the birthday I don\u2019t know.",
        "Interviewer: But the year?",
        "Moise Weiner: The year I tell you, it was \u201986 for my father.",
        "Interviewer: 1886?",
        "Moise Weiner: Yes; and \u201992 for my mother.",
        "Interviewer: Do you know when they were married?",
        "Moise Weiner:Twelve, 1912. I remember quite well because my mother had in",
        "the house a picture, hand worked it.",
        "Interviewer: Oh, needlepoint or something like that?",
        "Moise Weiner: Yes, needlework, and the date was of their marriage, 1912. I",
        "remember it. I see it before my eyes now, even now.",
        "Interviewer: I know we talked about what your father did; that he was a",
        "cowboy.",
        "Moise Weiner:He was a cowboy in his younger... Then he was maybe a bit of",
        "merchant maybe, I don\u2019t know; before the Revolution.",
        "Interviewer: Was your mother, was she just a housewife or did she ...?",
        "Moise Weiner:She was a housewife all her life, as far as I remember. She had",
        "five children to keep, to bring up. She began her day at five in the morning and",
        "ended at two in the night. And she did nothing in the eyes of the household.",
        "Interviewer: I think most mothers get that, unfortunately. They do a lot, but\nnobody actually sees what they do, unfortunately. Was you family, your parents\nespecially, were they very religious?\nMoise Weiner: Yes, my father was religious. I remember him to take me with\nhimself to the synagogue. But when the synagogue was destroyed, he prayed at\nhome. He had phylacteries, I remember, and the shawl. He was religious, yeah.\nMy mother went to the synagogue too, but not every day.\nInterviewer: Did your father go every day?\nMoise Weiner:On the holidays, mostly, because you see the synagogue was\ndestroyed in 1936 or \u00b037. I was a boy of nine or ten; I don\u2019t remember. I\nremember only that the last effort of my father to keep to religion was enough.\nBefore the war, he and his neighbor, there is such a Jewish holiday as Succos\n(Sukkos, Sicchos) in Yiddish, Sukkot (Succot); they tried to make a sukkah\n(siccha). It\u2019s a tent maybe with greens and so forth. Then, when they were sitting\nin that sukkah, drinking wine, maybe, I don\u2019t remember, a military man came and\ndestroyed that.\nInterviewer: He knocked it over?\nMoise Weiner:Knocked it over, yes; and pulled them away from there.\nInterviewer: Do you remember when that happened?\nMoise Weiner:It was not long before the war. That was, I don\u2019t remember, the\nlast effort to; after that he stayed home, prayed only at home.\nInterviewer: Did your father ever talk about World War I or the Revolution.\nMoise Weiner: Yeah.",
        "Interviewer: Was he in the First World War?",
        "Moise Weiner:He was not; but he was, two times, he was nearly killed. The first",
        "time --- maybe you know that during the Civil War there were many gangs,",
        "nationalistic gangs, that when they came to a Jewish shtetl, they made pogroms",
        "killing people. My father was young enough, and he took part in a band of self-",
        "defense, sammabaronika (?). When one of the gangs of Petlura (Petliura, Petlyura",
        "?) came, five people, and they were caught by the Petlurivtsa (?); and they want",
        "them to be shot. And the same time my mother rushed, not to the rebbe, but to the",
        "Christian ...",
        "Interviewer: Priest or... ?",
        "Moise Weiner: Yeah, the priest, the Christian, the Pope.",
        "Interviewer: The priest, yeah.",
        "Moise Weiner: The priest, yeah, the priest, the priest, and asked him for help to",
        "save the life of her husband. When they were brought to the lawn, was very green",
        "grass. And the leader of that gang said, \u2018it\u2019s a pity to spoil such grass with Jewish",
        "blood;\u2019 let us go further. And that saved them the life because the priest",
        "succeeded to come to the place and stopped the killing in the name of Christ. And",
        "they were set free. And my father, I remember, told that he was in such strength",
        "that his hands were bound, that he...",
        "Interviewer: Oh my gosh, he broke the bones.",
        "Moise Weiner:He broke the bones. It was the first time. So it was the legends (\u2019?)",
        "of our family, this killing, the second killing ... Was in their shtetl one of the --- I",
        "don\u2019t know how to call it --- a soldier, a gangster. He rushed in the house.",
        "Interviewer: Into your parents\u2019 house?",
        "Moise Weiner: Yes, and began to beat --- the Cossacks had on a stick, leather ---",
        "Interviewer: A whip?\nMoise Weiner:A whip, nagaika (nagayka, nagyka) in Russian. At the end he had\na leaden bob; it can kill you. And she had a little child, a baby, on her hand; and\nhe began to beat her. And she was saved only, she told me, that she pressed\nherself to the wall protecting the kid; and when he hit her, the bob couldn\u2019t get at\nher, but on the wall. The bob struck the wall, but not the ... And that saved her\nthe life and the life of the child. Maybe it was my brother that died in 19.. (1927\n?), maybe that\u2019s what. That\u2019s the experience of my parents in that war.\nInterviewer: That was during the Civil War?\nMoise Weiner:The Civil War, yeah.\nInterviewer: Do you ever remember your father speaking, or your parents\nspeaking about the Revolution?\nMoise Weiner: Yeah, why not? They did not make difference between the Civil\nWar and the Revolution, because the Revolution was not on the Ukraine. There\nwas no Revolution; there was only Civil War, because the Revolution was in\nRussia, and there they came to restore the Soviet power. And the Civil War there\nwere many gangs, Makhno (Machno), Petlura, Teuton (ph?), Degrees (ph?), and\nso on. They told many stories about --- there were stories only about the beating\nof Jews; bad, that\u2019s all. And about the Germans; one of the faults of the Jews on\nthe Ukraine was that they remembered the Germans of that time.\nInterviewer: From the first war?\nMoise Weiner:From the first war. Are they not Hilmen (ph?)? They are Hilmen\n(ph?).\nInterviewer: Honorable people, yes.\nMoise Weiner:Honorable people; people like we are. That\u2019s propaganda, and that\nwas the mistake. If we knew really what is coming, but who knew that?",
        "Interviewer: Did most of the Jews in the Ukraine feel that way, that the\nGermans were relatively decent people, and that they wouldn\u2019t do these things to\nthem?\nMoise Weiner: Yeah, yeah. Well I think many of them who remember.\nInterviewer: The older generation.\nMoise Weiner: The older generation; the young knew. We read books. We knew\nfilms; we saw films about ... Professor Mamlock was such a film. We read\nVectaya\u2019s (ph?) books, and so we knew --- the papers, the radio --- before the\npact; before the pact between Molotov and Ribbentrop, the propaganda was\nagainst the Nazis. So, we were a bit educated in that field. We knew what Nazis\nmeant. But older generation, \u2018sota vitenhop\u2019 (ph?).\nInterviewer: You said that your father, after the Revolution, he didn\u2019t have, you\nknow after the Civil War also, he was an unskilled laborer because he didn\u2019t have,\nI guess, an industrial job before the war; so he didn\u2019t really have a job after the\nwar. But he worked as a tax collector?\nMoise Weiner:No, he worked as a driver. He had horses at one time; you know, a\nbelagula (ph?). What is a belagula, in Yiddish, in Ukraine? It\u2019s a driver, it\u2019s not\npassengers you drive, but stones, bricks, and so on.\nInterviewer: So he transported these things.\nMoise Weiner:Transported, yeah. That was a long time his job until the mid of\nthe thirties. Then he lost his horses, and he was ...\nInterviewer: How did he lose his horses, do you remember? Did they die?\nMoise Weiner: Yes. One died, and the second he sold. He had two horses. Then\nhe worked as a night watch ...",
        "Interviewer: Night watchman?\nMoise Weiner: Yeah. And the last years when he became a bit ill, he became in\nthe market; it\u2019s an open market, so a tax collector. And that was his last job.\nInterviewer: There was a large open market in Vinnytsya?\nMoise Weiner: Two.\nInterviewer: Two markets.\nMoise Weiner: Yeah.\nInterviewer: One was near your home?\nMoise Weiner:No, they were both not near. One, on this place, when we arrived\nto settle here; there was a little market here, but it was demolished by the\nauthorities. But two big markets were on that end of the city, and the second, the\nbest, were on the other side.\nInterviewer: What did he collect taxes on? Was it on the things that people\nsold, or is that how he collected...?\nMoise Weiner:No, for the place.\nInterviewer: Oh, for the place. So he took fees for people to set up their\nbooths?\nMoise Weiner: Yeah, yeah; I remember that. If you come with a wagon of goods,\nyou had to have a place; and you have to pay a ruble for that.\nInterviewer: Did anybody in your family ever become Communists? Were they\nin the Komsomol or in the ...?",
        "Moise Weiner:In my family, my father and my mother, no. What\u2019s about my\nbrothers and sisters, we were all in Komsomol. My brothers during the war\nbecame Communists and my sister, too.\nInterviewer: So they joined the party.\nMoise Weiner: They joined the party. I never joined the party. I was, as we\ncalled, non-party Bolshevik; so we called it in Russia. I thought that three from\nus, it\u2019s enough for the party. Ill be free. I don\u2019t like party discipline; so I told,\nno.\nInterviewer: When we talked about before the Germans came and right before\nthe war, can you tell me what you remember; and what you know about what\nhappened to your parents after they put you on the train in 1941?\nMoise Weiner:No. We tried to find out who saw them the last, and we have very\nvague idea. You see hope dies the last; so we hoped that they survived.\nInterviewer: You don\u2019t know what happened?\nMoise Weiner: We didn\u2019t know. I tried, you see, the whole my life I tried to\nunderstand what was my father had been doing between the time the Nazis came\nand his death; from day to death. I see they were put to work from the jail. But\nthere is a book, exists such a book, the American author of John Hersey. He has\nwritten a book, The Wall, about the Warsaw ghetto. He has written that book\nusing the Ringelblum papers. I only here in America, I managed to get that book,\nRingelblum\u2019s Diaries. My daughter made me a copy of it. Now I\u2019m reading that.\nBut that book of Hersey\u2019s was written in 1950 or 53, maybe. I didn\u2019t know\nabout it; I came across it only in 1983. And in that book I read everything I\nwanted to. It\u2019s a book about the war and the ghetto, and what the Jews were\ndoing from day to day from the beginning of the occupation. So that\u2019s a great\nbook from my point of view.\nInterviewer: So you don\u2019t know what happened to your parents after they put\nyou on the train---you and your sister?",
        "Moise Weiner:No, no. He told me maybe he will go to Rakhnovka, to the parents\nof my mother; but they didn\u2019t do anything. They returned home, and they were\ncaught by the Germans there.\nInterviewer: And that\u2019s all you know?\nMoise Weiner: That\u2019s all I know, yeah.\nInterviewer: Can I ask you about your uncle?\nMoise Weiner: Yes, that\u2019s my uncle; Isaac too.\nInterviewer: He was also Isaac?\nMoise Weiner: Isaac, yes.\nInterviewer: And he was your mother\u2019s brother?\nMoise Weiner: Yes, it\u2019s my mother\u2019s brother.\nInterviewer: So he would be Sandler, also?\nMoise Weiner:Sandler; he\u2019s Sandler, yes.\nInterviewer: Was he also born in...\nMoise Weiner:Rakhnovka, yes. They were all born in Rakhnovka; they came\nfrom Rakhnovka, all. Well, I cannot say that tree of ..., theological tree...\nInterviewer: The family tree?",
        "Moise Weiner: We were not used to --- I know my parents and my grand..., that\u2019s\nall. Isaw my grandfather, my mother\u2019s father, maybe two times in my life. He\nwas a grey-bearded (?), and he lived until 86. If he would not have been killed,\nmaybe he would have. He was a very strong man.\nInterviewer: Do you remember when your uncle was born?\nMoise Weiner:No; I know he was younger than my mother; the difference, maybe\ntwo years.\nInterviewer: I'll put 1890 then.\nMoise Weiner:\u201994, maybe \u201995. So he was 45, maybe he was, when the war\nbegan.\nInterviewer: Did you remember your mother talking about him very much, what\nkind of person he was?\nMoise Weiner: Well, he was a person about whom, sort of a taboo, because he was\nmarried not on a Jewess; and he drank vodka. It was a horror for the Jews if a\nJew at that time drank Vodka --- not much. But he was a builder painter.\nInterviewer: He painted houses.\nMoise Weiner: Houses; and when he came from work, he took a glass of vodka,\nmaybe a little glass of vodka. It was a very terrible deed from the point of view of\nmy mother. She survived.\nInterviewer: His wife did?\nMoise Weiner: Yes. I saw her after the war; I was a kid. I wanted to know his\nfate. I remembered the address where she lived, and I went to her and asked her\nabout his fate; and she couldn\u2019t tell me anything at all.",
        "Interviewer: She didn\u2019t know for certain. You told me the story about what\nhappened to him.\nMoise Weiner:He was called to, maybe to, not exactly to the fighting army, but he\nwas called to the army. It was called battalions, building battalions; battalions\nthat earthworks and so on.\nInterviewer: Like the engineering battalion or something?\nMoise Weiner: Engineering battalion, yes; he was called to that. He was a painter.\nHe was called to that battalion, and when they were surrounded by the Germans\nand kept like war prisoners, they were ordered to stay in a line, or two lines; I\ndon\u2019t know exactly. Another witness told about his death to my elder brother; he\nstood beside him.\nInterviewer: He was right beside your uncle when he died?\nMoise Weiner: Yes. He was standing in that line. And when the command was,\n\u2018commissars and Jews step out three steps,\u2019 they stepped out. They didn\u2019t know\nwhy they did that. The command was make with them, how to say it in English?\n[He says something in Yiddish. |\nInterviewer: Get finished with them or make an end of them.\nMoise Weiner:Make an end of them. One of his compatriots standing there\nrushed out from the line, took off his bandage, and with that band he strangled\nhim from behind --- and strangled him. That was how he died. That was the\nStory.\nInterviewer: Do you know when that happened, was that 1941?\nMoise Weiner:It was 1941.\nInterviewer: Do you know where he was captured? No? Just somewhere in the\nUkraine?",
        "Moise Weiner:Somewhere; it\u2019s under Kiev, because it was not far from Kiev.\nInterviewer: It was near Kiev?\nMoise Weiner: Yes.\nInterviewer: Do you remember anything about your mother\u2019s family; about how\nmany brothers and sisters she had?\nMoise Weiner: Yes, because I remember it very well. Because I don\u2019t know how\nit\u2019s in your family, but in our family it was the cult of Machla\u2019s relatives. He\nliked them very much, and the love of my mother to her sisters, to her brothers,\nwere given to the children; and to the relatives of my father we were not so ...\nInterviewer: Notas close.\nMoise Weiner: Yeah, not as close. So they were six, three sisters and three\nbrothers.\nInterviewer: Where did your uncle fall in that? Was he the oldest or the\nyoungest brother?\nMoise Weiner:No, no, the eldest was my mother\u2019s sister --- her mother (they are\nlooking at photographs) --- Gittel. Her name was Gittel (\u2018?).\nInterviewer: This is Gittel?\nMoise Weiner: No, this is Rosa; she was a very beautiful girl. She was gassed\nbefore the war in Vinnytsya; she was a very beautiful girl. It\u2019s a photo, but in real\nlife she was very nice. Gittel had three daughters; she was the youngest. Two\nelder daughters of Gittel were married, and one had two children, and the other\nhad one. They had husbands, very nice guys, both; and they were killed in\nOdessa.",
        "Interviewer: The husbands were killed in Odessa, or she was killed in Odessa?\nMoise Weiner:The whole family was killed; my aunt, her husband, her daughters,\nher granddaughters. It was in Odessa.\nInterviewer: Do you know how she died?\nMoise Weiner:No; they were killed ...\nInterviewer: They were just captured by the Germans?\nMoise Weiner:Germans --- the mass killings, the mass killings.\nInterviewer: Can you tell me, Gittel and her husband, what did her husband do,\ndo you remember, for a living?\nMoise Weiner:He worked at a plant; he was a steel worker.\nInterviewer: Do you remember what plant he worked at?\nMoise Weiner: Well, I don\u2019t exactly remember, but I remember he presented us\nwith knives that he did at work; when he was, as a guest, you know. But his\ndaughters were educated and their sons-in-law, the husbands of the daughters,\nwere too educated. They had high education. One was a teacher maybe, the other\nI don\u2019t remember. I do not remember; I would not say.\nInterviewer: So Rosa was not married, though?\nMoise Weiner:No, no, she was 17; she was in the tenth form.",
        "Interviewer: Do you remember when she was born\u2019?\nMoise Weiner:If she was 17 in \u201940; \u201923 maybe.\nInterviewer: And she was born in Odessa?\nMoise Weiner:She was born, I don\u2019t know.\nInterviewer: But she wasn\u2019t born in Vakhnovka?\nMoise Weiner: Vakhnovka, I think no. Or maybe she was born in Vakhnovka; I\nwill not say.\nInterviewer: I think that\u2019s all my questions. Do we have anybody else?\nMoise Weiner: Well, the younger brother, Rafael (ph?) Liebowitz (?), [different\nlast name?] was killed with his family, of my mother.\nInterviewer: Your mother\u2019s brother.\nMoise Weiner:My mother\u2019s brother, the younger brother. He had two sons and a\ndaughter. He and his wife and the whole family of his wife was killed in\nLipovets; and one of the brother with my grand-dad, her brothers, was killed and\nhis son, his wife, three daughters; very many people died, were killed in\nVakhnovka. He was buried alive, I was told; that family was buried alive. They\nwere thrown into the ground.\nInterviewer: Oh, is this the person you\u2019re talking about who was buried alive?\nMoise Weiner:No, no. I talk about his brother. His brother was the father of\nthese; my grand-dad. He was killed too. So it\u2019s a long story to tell. It\u2019s about 60\npeople. I can\u2019t name you by myself.",
        "Interviewer: I think we talked about everybody. Is there anybody else? We did\nyour parents; we did Rosa. I may call you. Is that okay?\nMoise Weiner: What can I say? The only thing I want to save, the memory of my\nparents. That is all I want to say, the memory of those who were killed. I stayed\nalive; I\u2019m thankful. If I would have been a religious man, I would say, \u2018thank\nGod I\u2019m alive.\u2019 I\u2019m alive and that\u2019s the best prize in my life. I had my life during\nthe war, after the war; hard or not hard, it\u2019s everybody. But I\u2019m alive. My little\nsister 1s killed. She would have been now about 60. She had no life. My parents\nwere killed. My mother was a very young... I\u2019m older than my father now; he\nwas killed 56 year. My mother was 49. They were young people. My Uncle\nIsaac was 45. Rafael was maybe in his 30\u2019s or maybe 40. Gittel was a little\nolder, but Rosa was 17. They were young people, my brothers and cousins and so\non. So if there is any possibility to keep the memory about them, not about me. I\nhave my own memory, but they cannot say nothing. I can say for them\nsomething, not very much. Therefore, if you can have their names in you\nmuseum that people shall remember them, I would be quite grateful; that\u2019s all.\nInterviewer: [something in Yiddish]\nMoise Weiner:|[same thing in Yiddish]",
