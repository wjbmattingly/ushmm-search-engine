        "Q: OK. We're now about to start. Would you tell me your name, please?",
        "A: My name is Magda Blau. I was born Hellinger.",
        "Q: Where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born on the 19th of August 1916 in Michalovce, Slovens...Slovakia.",
        "Q: Will you tell me about your parents and your family?",
        "A: My parents. My husb...my father was a teacher of Jewish history. My mother was a very\nnice woman. He was...she was a real Jewish mother, who worked and cooked and baked and\nhad a garden. So we had all the fruit and vegetable. And she helped all the poor, where they\nneeded. So I saw already at home what it means to be helpful to others. That's how I was\nbrought up.",
        "Q: Tell me about your family. You had brothers at home?",
        "A: Yes, we had brothers. But I haven't a...didn't have so much contact with my brothers;\nbecause there, in a small town, little children went to learn Jewish history early in the\nmorning. Then we went to school. And then, as a only daughter between the four boys, it\nwas somehow different. I had my...my group of children; but sometimes we played, boys\nand girls, together. But mostly I had my own crowd of...either at, at school or after school.",
        "Q: Tell me about your childhood and growing up.",
        "A: My childhood was a very nice childhood, because my father was um--like I told you that--\nJewish history teacher. And every night, I couldn't get asleep. You know, like you tell\nstories for children? He told me always the stories about the history, because he was\nstudying in Frankfurt-am-Main; and he knew and visited all the places that the Jewish\nhistory was around. And so he told me the travels and all the stories what happened; and that\nwas very interesting. And so, before I go to sleep, I crawled in his bed and he told me those\nstories; and then I fell to sleep. And they had to carry me out from bed. And um as a matter\nof fact...because this time wasn't a kindergarten when I was a little girl. So I always went\nwith my father to the school; and I was listening to the stories. And the children, you know,\nthey was spoiling me rotten. (Laughter) And um when I grew tired, so my father asked one\nof the children to take me home. Because I was just a child. I was a very bad eater. I was\nvery skinny; but I already, as a young child, always worried about the poor. And I came\nhome to my mother, and I said, \"You know, Mom, I saw...I been at my neighbor's pla...our\nneighbor's place. And they are so poor. They haven't got anything. And it's Shabbat\ncoming, and they haven't got meat and fat and sugar and coffee and tea. So I am not going to\neat, but please give them.\" My mother said to my father, \"We have so much trouble for her\nto put a spoon of food in her mouth, (laughter) and she says she's not going to eat!\" So I\nmanaged that this way, already as a young child, that we went to the families. I was talking\nwith the lady of the house while my mother put it in the pots the food; because they was very\nproud to accept it. And that was the start of my childhood, and that's how I grew up helping\npeople and helping the neighbors. And I always said I will be a doctor, because this is also\nhelping the chil...the people. And later in my life, um there came from Poland some Hebrew\nteachers. And they came to the place where we girls was playing. And he introduced us a\nHebrew songs and dances. And that's what happened, that they put us first in this way. That\nin...we just played around in the place where one of the children lived; but later he\ntransferred us--like Jewish scouts--in a place which they called [Ma'adon (ph)], which means\n[louder (ph)]. And there I started to get to know with the history and what they want to try to\nmake: that they should be in a Jewish state, we should have a home our own. And so it\nstarted my youth. And I was very much involved; and...because if they...1n a certain\norganization, they found out somebody's willing and able, naturally they use. And I didn't\nmind it. I was sent out to start a new organization of Jewish scouts. And as a young girl, I\nhad the idea that's the only way how you can start an organization, gather them under a flag.\nSo I was very capable. I must say, today I don't even know how I did it. But I approach the\nall the right sources. I approached the teacher who was a sewing teacher, and I asked her if\nshe would sew the emblem of, the scout's emblem, on the flag. I approached a man who was\nselling material if he would donate that for us. Which he did. Then I had the idea that, you\nknow, to have golden nails with their names, which they donate. And...and the man who did\nit, he was doing it for...like for charity; but the one who had the nail written in the pole, he\nhad to pay for it. So...and also I arranged a very nice evening with children--dancing and\nsongs and a theater. And so a lot of money came together.",
        "Q: And this was all for the Zionist Organization?",
        "A: Yeah, all for the Keren Kayemeth [and Keren] Hayesod.' And you know what? I tell\nmyself I been very smart, because the collection of the money--I started with the generals.\nThere was three military generals. And I approached the one with the list if he was willing\nto support the nail of...the golden nail; and voluntarily how much he was willing to give.\nAnd every general was very generous. Then I approach the others. But on the top of the list\nwas a huge amount, so nobody was... You know how it goes. And so things like that, I did\nalready. They always send me to another place to organize a evening like for Keren\nKayemeth. So I did all those things before I started; and I postponed my finishing my\n' Keren Kayemeth [L'Yisrael], known in English as the Jewish National Fund, and Keren\nHayesod (English name unknown) were established by the Zionist Organization in 1901 for the\npurpose of purchasing land in Palestine for Jewish settlement.\nstudying as a kindergarten teacher, because I thought it's very important. Somebody should\ndo it. And then I finished there; because, in our town, wasn't able...I wasn't able to study for\nkindergarten teacher because there wasn't school. So I did it privately, by myself. I went\npracticing to another town, where it was a kindergarten. And then I did my...finished my\nstudy by myself, and I did the exams in Bratislava. This was the special town in Slovakia.\nAnd so I became a kindergarten teacher. But even as a young girl, during the holiday... I\nreally don't know how, how...where did I get all those ideas? I said to my--I had a girlfriend.\nI said, \"Look at the children running around, and there is not a kindergarten. At least during\nthe holiday, let's open a kindergarten.\" And I approached there, there was a...we called her\n\"Gleich Mamma.\"\u201d That was her name; and she was in everything. And we said, \"What\nwould you say...the children is running around the streets, and if we would open a\nkindergarten?\" She said, \"I am totally behind you children. I arrange everything.\" And she\ndid. Because when she went, two o'clock from home she went... You know, her social life\nwas...She went through the city, everywhere she had somebody. She talked with somebody.\nIf we ask her husband, \"Where is Gleich Mamma?\" And he said, \"Wait a minute. Now it's\nsix o'clock. Two o'clock, she was there. Three o'clock, she was there. Three o'clock...now,\nit's six o'clock. She will be in the shop there and there.\" (Laughter) He knew exactly her\ntimetable. And she arranged everything. So during the school holiday, we gathered forty\nchildren. And there was a man who wanted to get married. And he had built a house, but he\nmarried in two months later. So she arranged he should let the house for us. And sand pits,\nand somebody made us the furniture. And we two young children... was, I has then my\nbirthday in August, and the school holiday in our place is June and July, August. So I was\ndoing it before I was even fifteen.\u201d",
        "Q: As you got older, obviously things began to change. Um...what happened um...as indeed\nthings changed, and the war drew closer?",
        "A: When the real war came closer, I still...1 had my kindergarten. It's true that all the doctors\nand the lawyers, they were stripped from their um possibility to work. Because it's already\nstarted the war. And um...but I didn't have even to wear a...a yellow star; because my school\nbelonged, the Kinderheim [NB: children's home] belonged to the inspectorate of the other\nschools. So I, I...well, they didn't...they wasn't so strict on me. So I didn't feel much in our\ntown of the persecution, so far as that they lost all their jobs--the lawyers and everyone. And\nthey started to take away the businesses, and they put Arierstaters (ph)] in. That means\nsomebody had their eye on that job, and he was member of that...was a Hlinka guard--similar\nlike SS, or something--and so they took away the business from the Jewish men. And in\n*\"Gleich\" means equal or equivalent. Perhaps she was given this name because she was like a\nmother to everyone? \u201cMamma Gleich\u201d may also refer to Margit Gleich, who was active in the\nMichalovce community and a patron of the Zionist youth movements (she is mentioned in the\nMichalovce memorial book, published in 1969).\n* Since she was born in 1916, this would have been 1931.\ncame, without any um restitution or something for the...for the Jewish man, and he [NB: the\nJew] had to go out and he [NB: the Aryan] came in. So that was bad for them. And\num...and for me, it was... I don't know if we have time for it, but there was a shoemaker who\nlived in our vicinity, what he had a shop on the way where I went to the kindergarten. And I\nmade all my shoes there. He made me beautiful boots. And, really, top job. But what I\ndidn't know, that he fell in love with me. A father with a few children who lived in our\nneighborhood! And um every time I went to the kindergarten, he came out from the shop\nand he said, \"How are you\" and \"Good morning.\" And I thought it's just neighborly. One\nday, he came to the kindergarten; and he said, \"I want to protect you. In this way: that I will\nmake one child, whichever child that is, is your child. Because first now they are taking the\nyoung girls. And as you have a child, I can make that you are exempted from this um\ntransport.\" And I said, \"But why are you doing it? I haven't gotten a child.\" \"Can't you\nunderstand?\" I said, \"No.\" \"I am in love with you. I want to protect you.\" I said, \"And\nlater, when the children will have to go?\" \"Don't worry. I will protect you always.\" And I\nsaid, \"You mean, I should be your mistress?\" He said, \"Do I have to make it clear for you?\"\nSo...because I, I couldn't believe my eyes. But that's what he wanted. Naturally, I didn't\nwant it. I told my mother; I said, \"Isn't that funny? He's our neighbor, and he's my\nbootmaker. And he gives me such proposition!\" So I... \"What did you say?\" \"I said,\n'Thank you very much. You are really very nice. You mean it well. But,' I said, 'T couldn't.\nYou have a wife and children. How could you ask for me that?\" The same night, they came\nfor me. The same night they came for me; because he was so angry. Because he was\nwaiting that I will naturally say yes. But I didn't know...um, I wouldn't even... I can't believe\neven when I would know where I am going I would agree to it. But this time, they said to\nus...which they deceived us, and there was nobody to say something differently. They said\nwe are going to work in the Bata factory. So I said to myself, \"What's so wrong to go to\nfactory? So we will go to Bata factory.\" That's what I thought. Nobody ever said that there\nis danger. And then it came that um they gather us, they gathered us like at night. But me, I\nwas so sure that they will...I will be excepted...exempted as a kindergarten teacher. So I\nwasn't worrying about myself. I worried about others; especially, there was fathers whose\ndaughter was hiding somewhere and they took the fathers instead. So I worried about the\nold fathers; and um run around and gave them help. And I did get excepted um papers. But\nwhat happened, there is always somebody greedy. They knew I have the papers. And one\nwoman, a teacher, she bought my papers. She paid twenty thousand crowns, Czech crowns,\u201d\nfor the papers. And when my father...",
        "Q: To whom?",
        "A: In the inspectorate was a...a man who was doing the papers. She paid him twenty thousand;\nso she got my papers. And my father found out and he went to the inspectorate...because he\nwas also in...like teacher, you know. So they say, \"My dear man,\" he says, \"the times are\nchanging. If you bring me twenty thousand crowns, I take it away from her, even if she paid\n* Czech: koruna. Official currency of Czechoslovakia.\nit already. And I give it back to your daughter.\" But my father didn't have the twenty\nthousand crowns. He was crying like a baby, saying it to somebody who after the war told\nme... He was crying, \"They tear the nicest flower out of my garden, but I can't do anything.\nI haven't got the money.\" Anyway, when we came on the train...so from our hometown, we\nwent on normal trains. And we came there, and the girls was dressed like peasants woman.\nYou know, because they lived in little villages. And I had my beautiful wardrobe. So I\nopened my suitcase and I dressed them all up. And there was a policeman--what they called\nthem gendarme, a gendarmerie, because they was Czech. They... they had the quarters in the\nsame street that we lived on the corner. So they saw me passing by, and they was always\nvery friendly. And he thought...said, \"I never happened to see something, that somebody\nshould give away all the clothes!\" I had only what I had on me. The dress, the coat and a\nmuff, and a bag. All the rest I gave out. I dressed up all the girls, because... He said, \"Why\nare you doing that?\" \"Because,\" I said, \"we are going to Bata factory. I want the girls to be\nrepresenting nice.\" \"How could you be so naive?\" I was...nobody taught us any other way.\nAnd he wanted to help me; so he took me...he said, \"I am taking you to say once more to say\ngoodbye to your parents.\" And he took me there, and I said goodbye. And I said to him,\n\"How about if I would now run away?\" And he said, \"Try.\" I didn't. I didn't, because I\ndidn't know what, how...how will L.. If...1f not today, they will take me tomorrow; so\nsomething, I thought... So I didn't run away. And also, when they took us on the train, we\narrived to a place, Poprad. And there it was already, you know, different; because there was\num all girls was gathered and it was such a chaos. And he said to me, \"I am taking you on a\ntrain which goes on a different direction.\" And I had a kindergarten help...in the\nkindergarten a helper; and I said, \"But I am taking the helper with me.\" Because um she was\nhelping me; and her brother, who is the headmaster--yah, of the school--he asked me, \"Look\nafter my sister.\" And I promised him. So he said, \"I don't mind. Take her with you.\" And I\nsaid, \"Look, let's stay here. Let's not go back, because this train goes the other direction.\"\nAnd matter of fact, I told him, \"And how about if we are not going back with you, we will\ncontinue with the train?\" And he said, \"Listen. I'll leave it on you. But if I come back and\nyou are here, I have to take you back.\" So I begged her. \"Ilonka,\" I said, \"let's go on the\ntrain, and let's continue.\" He [NB: she] said, \"No. I am afraid what will happen to me. Let's\nnot go.\" And I...again, naive as I am, I promised. And my word is a word. So when he\ncame, he said, \"Are you here? So I have to take you back.\" And he took me back. But he\nsaid, \"Write a few words. I'm going to give it to your parents. I will try one more thing,\" he\nsays. \"I have a uncle in the Ministeria, in the ministry. I will write to him to send papers to\nyou that you are excep...exempted.\" And he did. Because it was that we are staying there\ntwo days; but to me...my bad luck, we went the same day. So, so much so I know, that he\ndelivered the letter to my parents. And in the letter, he said that I will be a nurse wherever I\nare going. So \u2018til my parents was alive, they thought I...wherever I go, lam aanurse. That's\nhow we came. And now it started. They put us in cattle tru... You know, you call it?",
        "Q: Cattle cars.",
        "A: Yah, and now it started the misery; because there wasn't possibility to breathe, we were in so\ntogether. And also the toilet question was also a question. I managed one thing; that\nbecause there was just a little window on top, you know, I asked the girls to lift me up.\nBecause I knew where we passing by there is a working camp for Jewish sol...they been\nsoldiers, but they had already a different uniform--not green, but blue. So in a...in Hebrew, I\njust said, \"They are taking all...us in cattle trains. We don't know where.\" Because he\nsurvived, and he told me that he told everybody about it. But they couldn't help us. We\narrived in the camp. And here came the SS with the dogs, with the scream...\"Raus! Raus!\nLos! Los! [Ger: \u2018Out! Out! Go! Go!\"]\" So beating us, hitting us. So this was the first\nintroduction in the camp.",
        "Q: Tell us...tell us about being on the selection platform. What happened to you?",
        "A: In... On...",
        "Q: You arrived at the camp. Tell us exactly what happened during the selection? What did you\ndo?",
        "A: Now in in the first, first thing they didn't select us. No. The first thing, it was that they put\nus to a...a barrack. During the night, we...we didn't know what happened. Just screams.\nAnd we been there during the night. And as we traveled so long, we been very dehydrated.\nThe German woman prisoners--who consisted mostly of prostitutes and murderers and\nthieves--they delivered their tea, but they said, \"It's poisoned.\" They delivered the food, and\nthey said, \"It's poisoned.\" So here we been dehydrated and hungry, and we didn't know what\nto do. So I volunteered. I said, \"Listen, girls, we have to do something. We can't last so.\nWe are dried out.\" Because we didn't get water for days. So I said, \"I'm going to drink it. If\nI don't come back 1n half an hour, that mean it's poisoned. The same thing I will do with the\nfood. Then you will know it's poisoned.\" But it was bad...I ate and vomited it, because it\nwas so bad. I hold my nose up, because it was all rotten. But it was still a little bit warm. I\nsaid, \"Girls, Iam here. We have to drink it. We have to eat something. Otherwise we lose\nour [thanks (ph)].\" That's how it started.",
        "Q: Excuse me...you had arrived in Auschwitz?",
        "A: In Auschwitz. In Auschwitz there was red barracks. And it was a little bit normal, because\nthat was um beds--not bunks. And the next day, they took us; and we been standing in the\nfreezing cold. And some girls collapsed. I was saying, when they asked us \"Los! Los!\nLos!\"--I said, \"Girls, let's run. Let's run and let's be obedient. Maybe that will help us.\" So\nwhat happened, I was the first in the room; but when the girls collapsed...so I asked\nsomebody to help me to put them somewhere 'til they recovered from collapsing from cold\nand from...from stress. So that's why my number is not 2000, but 2,318; because so many\ntimes I run with the girls to help. I was really physically very healthy, sport-minded. And\nate the right foods--a lot of fruit from the trees what we had in the garden. I ate for months--I\ndon't know what it is, it's something which you can't understand. I ate only the fruit for\nmonths. And my mother... I came back from kindergarten, and I just said, \"Hello.\" And I\nrun on the trees. And she came out and she said, \"My goodness me. If somebody will see a\nkindergarten teacher...\" I pushed my shoes down and sometimes the skirt, and off I went to\nthe tree. And there I had my lunch, my breakfast, my dinner. And my mother said, \"I'm\ncooking the beautiful soup.\" And I said, \"No, that's what I feel I need.\" I didn't understand\nhow important was that. It was like... don't know why I did it. But that's what I did all\nthe...all the time just eating fruit. Fruit in season. And we had all the fruit for all the season\nin our garden. I remember once I climbed on the cherry tree, on the high branches up. And,\nyou know, it was the branches went swaying here and there. And Mother...my mother says,\n\"Please come down. The branches will fell.\" I said, \"Oh, no. They are strong branches.\nAnd...and here are the cherries the sweetest, the healthiest.\" She said, \"Please come down.\"\nSo alright. I ...1 had my lunch. Now I came down. \"But have something to eat.\" I said,\n\"No, this is my food.\" And, anyway... So the next what was they...like I told you before,\nthey undressed all what we had um...they put us...like I am saying there in the article.",
        "Q: Tell us on tape. I want...tell us exactly how they treated you.",
        "A: Yeah. They undressed everything what we had. Now they let us stand there naked. Then\nthey shaved our head with blunt scissors, so our head was all bruised--at least mine. And\nthen the man, laughing man, stood me on the chair and shaved everywhere what was hair.\nAnd then, they call it \"disinfection.\" They put us in big bins; and it was murky water. Ten at\na time. And we had to go in, and with our heads in. And then naked, wet, we stood in that\nfreezing cold wintry day \u2018til we got the remnants of Russian prisoner of wars uniforms,\nwhich was cotton top and cotton pants. And mine didn't have a button on top and a button\non the pants. So I had to hold on to...not to lose it. And then we got wooden clogs, which\nwe hever was use to it. And so ...and naked and barefooted... And then that's how it was.\nThe start. We...we thought looking one each other, we didn't recognize. We thought they\nare crazy. But we didn't see that ourself--we looked like crazy, too. Anyway, we went to the\nbarracks. And in our room, there was about six hundred girls; and some of the girls under\nshock. What happened, they went crazy. Or, what you call it? Under the shock. And very\nsoon, in the first day, we found out--because there is always that certain communication and\ncertain gossip going around--that those who are crazy, they get a phenol injection. You\nknow what's a phenol? Straight away, a phenol injection. And there was four girls. And\n[...I knew how to...I had experience; because I work ...worked like a um assistant to a very\nfamous doctor, and so I knew how to handle um oh crazy. But they weren't crazy. They was\nunder the shock. So I slept in one bed with four of those, which was really meant for two.\nBut I slept with them. And my influence on them was so good they recovered in a few days.\nOthers who didn't do that, they was dead.",
        "Q: I'd like to stop the tape a moment. I'd like to take a break.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE IN TAPE",
        "Q: We'll pick up with more stories of Auschwitz. OK. We are in Auschwitz, in the barracks at\nAuschwitz...",
        "A: In a barrack in Auschwitz, and this... And there was, like I mentioned, about six hundred\ngirls; and there was in charge a German um woman who was a politisch [NB: political\nprisoner]. And he was there...she was there as a punishment, because in P_aszow she had\nhelped prisoners. Her husband was a famous doctor, but even so it didn't help. They\nbrought her to Auschwitz and they shaved her hair the same way like us. But she was not\nwell. Her legs were swollen. I don't know from what...what sickness it makes it. And so\nshe asked the girls who would help her. So I volunteered that I will. And the first... first\nday, because we needed to bring tea to the um for the people. So we went there. But the\nGerman prisoners, like I told you, they were prostitutes, thieves and murderers. And the\nrumors went that we are prostitutes too, and we are competition to them. So when I came to\nthe girls there for the drinks, so she says, \"We don't need any competition. And anyway, you\nwouldn't be able to carry the...the kettles.\" And I said, \"In case we are able to carry the\nkettles, would you not make any difficulties for us?\" And...but she said, they said, \"OK, we\nwouldn't. But you won't!\" So I said, \"Could you...\" And I pointed to one of the girls. \"...be\na partner to me, and we are carrying together?\" And usually they carry it four girls--two and\ntwo--because it's heavy. And I said, \"But I would like to carry it with you by yourself.\" So\nshe said, \"Alright.\" So... and I grabbed the kettle, because I told you I was strong. And later,\nwhen we went out of their view, so I said, \"And now you run, because I'm going to run.\"\nAnd so I was running. And it was a huge distance from where that food was given to the\nplace where we been. Because we was in Barrack 9. That was...two more barracks was\nthere, 10 and 11. And 11, it was the bunker where they killed politisch prisoners or\nwhatever. So and then she... she amazed, she was amazed. She said, \"I thought that you are\nall spoiled nobodies!\" And I said, \"No, we are not. We are decent human beings. And\nplease, in the future, let us have that food. Because whichever wrong that food is, what we\nneed something.\" So I got the respect from her. And she wanted to be...she was lesbian,\nwhich I didn't know. So she came and she wanted to make friends with me. But in our\ntown, in our country, we didn't know about what it means. But she started to pet me. So I\nsaid, \"Oh, you... Don't be angry, but I don't understand this thing.\" And I said, \"I appreciate\nif you leave me alone.\" And she was decent enough. She said, \"Would you like something?\nWould you like I bring you, I take you somewhere?\" And she really did. And she said,\n\"What would you like?\" And there was food, all the food what people was bringing. And I\nsaid, \"A little bit of a salt.\" Salt, because we missed salt. So she said, \"Don't be so silly!\nHere, you have a piece of speck [NB: bacon], too.\" And she gave me. And so I shared that\nwith all the others. But, you know, we were sucking on that skin so much that I broke my\ntooth on it. (Laughter) You know, because we been so hungry that that have it... So\nanyway, this was the first thing. In the morning, two o'clock, they woke us up with screams\nand with the sticks hitting us: \"Raus! Raus! Raus!\" Because it was the counting. And\nbecause they was so primitive, and so was the SS woman who came there too, thousand...\nThey were so primitive, they couldn't make the counting. So we had to get up two o'clock at\nnight in that freezing cold, bad climate. It was like a punishment from God, this climate\nthere in Auschwitz. Lot of people, they...they fell because they couldn't stand the cold,\nstanding on one spot. I was telling the girls to turn around--you know, like round, around,\naround. I...those... that mean movement on one spot, because you couldn't...you couldn't go\nout of the place. That's how it started. And then in the barrack, they started to say that they\nneed people for different work. Like in the kitchen and in the sewing rooms and different\ndepartment. And the girls volunteered then. And you know, everybody wanted a inside job,\nnaturally. And I was with that crazy woman, looking after them; and this um woman, the\nGerman woman, she said, \"Why don't you go also look for something? You are sitting with\nthose four crazy women. And look after yourself.\" And I said, \"What I am...I don't want to\nbe any time here. And otherwise, I want to go and work in outside and prepare myself.\nBecause I believe once it will be a place for Jews to go, and I want to prepare myself.\"\nMorning came, and the Kommandos was standing. And I was volunteering to go...like\nworking in the fields. But she knew better than I; so she slapped my face and pulled me in...",
        "Q: Which \"she\"?",
        "A: Hmmm?",
        "Q: Who is this \"she\" that slapped you?",
        "A: That...that German woman who was in charge of our room, which she was from politisch\nreason there. So she knew about it, so she pulled me in. And she said, \"You are going to\nwork inside and help me and scrub the floor.\" I says, \"With what? You haven't got\nanything.\" She said, \"With your nails. But here you will stay.\" So I...1 took water and I\nscrubbed the wat...the dirt with my nails. But I thought, \"I am crazy. I'm going rather\noutside on the fresh air.\" Next day, the same thing. I did it three times. The third time she\nsaid, \"What you think you are going to? You are going to work for the fields to prepare\nyourself? How long will you last? They will beat you there. They will, you know, run you\nthere. And you won't last three days there. And I need you there; because look my feet! I\nneed somebody who will help me.\" So, and she said, \"Otherwise, tell me what you are from\nprofession that you don't want to go to the kitchen, or....\". I said, \"I don't want to tell.\" She\nsaid, \"Tell me.\" \"I'm a kindergarten teacher.\" So she said, \"I am a teacher, so I understand\nwhat you mean you don't want your profession. But come and help me.\" So let's go start\nmy...my first career. She said, \"Help me, because I am unable to do that.\" So I was going to\ncarry the food, the bread, the evening meal. And we always had to volun...ask for\nvolunteers; because us was a small number and for six hundred people to bring bread and\nthis, that was a hard task. Because came tired from it. But we had to have the food, but\nstraight away I used that that I am home for something good; because you can do good even\nwhere is impossible. So I approached the girls who are um working in so-called \"Revier\"--\nlike hospital. I said, \"Steal wherever you... whatever you could and bring it home to me,\nbecause I know what to use it for.\" And to those girls who are working in the sewing room,\n\"Bring all the rags what you can. Steal it. Put it in the pants and bring it home.\" So they\nbrought it home. And when the girls came home, I saw what it is. Now I understood why\nshe didn't want to, because she...they had terrible experiences right away. So I bandaged\nthem. So I gave them some medication what it was. And I was even, when I gave the food\nout, I didn't sit down to eat the food; because I was... saw so many I had to help. And there\nwas a interesting thing. There was a girl who was watching me doing that. And she said,\n\"My name is [Bluma (ph)].\" She lives in Israel. \"I am a daughter...and I am a daughter of a\nrabbi from Bratislava,\" where my husband was born. \"And, you see, I think that God send\nme watch over you while you are helping others. And now you are coming and you are\nsitting down, and you have that little food. Otherwise you won't have strength to do what\nyou are doing.\" And that's what she did. Every night, she said, \"Enough is enough. Now\nyou are going to sit down and have your meal.\" So that's where it started, that togetherness\nto help each other in the girls where the misery was. And the sadisms of the woman who\ntook the girls out in kommando, and often they did hurt unnecessary. Like...you know, the\ndemolition all the...or they didn't want that the civil population should know, being so close,\nand see Auschwitz. So they...they demolished some villages and they transferred them\nsomewhere else. But there was ruins. So they took some woman and watched that; they let\nsome woman go down and some woman on top. And they had them to demolish and throw\nthe bricks down. And down the girls was working. And if they didn't want to, they beat\nthem. \"Throw that bricks down!\" And they threw the bricks on their own friends; and often\nthey came half dead, or dead already. Or they carried rocks from one place to the other.\n\"Los! Los!\" So this...this was the start. And the girls became sick, and the girl became\nweak. And some were...some run to the electrical um... We, we had an electrical fence\nwhich was with um electricity. So if you touch it, you been dead. But some girls, they said,\n\"I rather that. I can't take it anymore. And I can't see any end to it.\" Because except that the\nwork, there was other things that you wouldn't believe it. There was fleas, artificial-like\nbreeded to that they should jump only on places like eyes, ears, nose and mouth. You you\ncouldn't help it. There was hundreds jumping on you. Then there was lice. Everywhere\nlice, crawling all over you. And then was lice who was crawling under your skin. And all\nthat, plus the beatings and the starving and the brutality. So a lot of girls choose another\ndeath. But we lasted there in this camp Auschwitz about...I would say, beginning of August.\nI can't tell you exact days that I come. And then because...you know, days and weeks we\ndidn't know. We didn't have that somebody says, \"It's Monday\" or \"Tuesday\" or... We didn't\nknow. The days were just passing without us knowing. And so they took us um on walking\nto Birkenau from Auschwitz. If Auschwitz was Hell, Birkenau was thought on the biggest\nSatan what can exist. There was um barracks from clay, which meant before it was for\nhorses. And the place for one horse suddenly became a lodging for thirty woman. Because\nthey put two planks across, and some woman was lying down. Ten down, ten in the middle,\nand ten on the top. And they couldn't even move. They could just lie like sardines, covered\nup with one blanket. And this is not enough. But the whole camp was with holes, because\nthey supposed to bring canalization there. But they didn't wait 'til they have the canalization,\nor they have water or they have anything. They brought us there in this stage. First of all, a\nlot of lice and this place. And it was muddy. And it was... You had that one... They... One\nthing, they took away the Russian uniforms and they gave us one dress. But nothing under\nit. 'Nother scarf, and the same wooden clogs. And they...in that you had to exist in rain, in\nshine. So the rain...1magine what it does--the rain and the shine--what it is to a little rag. It's\nfelling to pieces. And some girls was falling 1n that...in those holes. And if you fall in this\nhole and you been weak, you couldn't walk out of it. That was the end of her. And except\nthat it was, when it was raining it was muddy. And it was muddy; and so the girls had the\nwooden clogs. And when they walked in it and lost the clogs, they couldn't even take it out\nanymore; because it was \"Los! Los!\" So they run...so they run barefoot in the cold, in the\nrain. It was terrible. And also, there was only one place where the water was. It was one\nwell. When you took the water out in a...like a basket. You had to wind it up. But imagine,\none for so many thousands. And the people came home thirsty. So one over the other. And\nlot of girls, they fell in and that was the finish. And then you couldn't drink that water\nbecause it was like that. And later they made like the water in the back of the barrack. But it\nwas always a restriction of the water. Soon you arrived there, they closed up the water. It\nwas all sadistically, brutality. You know, just make us like really swines. Because you\ncouldn't wash yourself. You couldn't go properly to the toilet. There was just a hole, and\nover the hole a piece of plank. And you was sitting on the plank and there was... So, and a\nlot of people, one push the other. And if you fell in, that was the finish. And things like that,\nfor you to see and to...to...to be able to...to...to go on with the life, it's unbelievable.\nUnbelievable. So...and on the other side, like I said, people fell in those--\"graven,\" you call\nit. Like, you know, they dig ditches for the...the pipes what they wanted to put in. But they\nwasn't in hurry to put in. And often, they made...they call it \"Blocksperre\" [NB: \"block\nclosing\"]. There was a siren and everybody had to run to the barrack. And say the girl was\njust on the toilet. And she wanted to run, but there was that ditch. They fell in. And when\nthe siren was over, and whoever was found in those ditches, they took them straight away on\nthe trucks to the crematorium. Often, I did that I saw some friend of mine...they, they just\nfell in. So I run out to pull them out and push them back to... Because I thought [to] myself,\n\"Every day when you are alive, maybe...maybe there will be a chance that something will\nhappen and prolong the life. Maybe some miracle will happen and the war will come to the\nend, and then they will recuperate.\" By one of these such occasions when I did it, and the\nwhistle came up and I was there with the girls. So, naturally, I also went on the truck with all\nothers to be taken to the gas chambers. And, you know, fate... This woman who many\nmonths ago had experiences carrying the water with me and I didn't want to be her lesbian\nfriend...but she was just having a Kommando taken out to work and she was the kapo of this\nkommando. And she saw me on that truck and she knew. So she came up and she gave me\none big slap; and she pulled me down from the truck. And to the SS who was guarding, he\n[NB: she] said, \"I couldn't walk out with the Kommando because she is missing!\" And she\nwas, you know, pretending to scream at me. And when I came and she said, \"And now, run!\nRun for your life.\" And that's... and it saved me. Anyway, and then...",
        "Q: Excuse me. At this point we're going to pause and change tapes. This is a good place to\nchange tapes.",
        "A: OK.\nTAPE #2",
        "Q: OK. There was a story you wanted to tell.",
        "A: There is...there is a short story I want to tell you. When I was a young girl...and because\nbeing a only daughter, my father took me to a famous rabbi, who came to the city, to be\nblessed. When he blessed and put his hands over my head, he says \"This girl has a special\nmission in her life. She is chosen, and she is going to save hundreds and hundreds of Jewish\nsisters and brothers. And that's what her life will be.\" My father came home, told my\nmother. They said, \"What? Seven year old girl, what he is talking about?\" Um, but\nnaturally I didn't know about it. Only before I went away, so my mother told me. Imagine,\nwhen you've been...the rabbi told that I don't know why he was telling it. And um my sister\nsaid, \"Probably that's what you are doing for Zionism. That's what it is.\" But when I was in\ncamp, I felt something that's... Often I opened my mouth, and I say things and I do things,\nlike...it's not me. Like...I don't believe in...in...11 unnatural or something. But it was like\nthat. Because I undertook to save um my friends, and...and implanted in them to do that, too.\nSo I thought, \"Is it me doing that, or is something in me what is doing it?\" So I just show\nyou one sample. You see, because the girls was wearing one dress and it was in rain or in\nshine, so they used the blanket what they have to cover up. And they tore it up to put it\naround their chest or wherever. So they took all the girls who been in charge to a room they\ncalled sauna, where they usually had once in a while um shower. And they put a big table\nthere. And all the commanders of the camp from all over were sitting there. And they\ninvited all... Invited! (Laughter) I am talking invited! All the...all the woman in charge\nthere, even the charge--it wasn't that we wanted to be in charge. They pressed us in the\ncharge. And they...they said, \"You know what the women are doing? They are sabotage!\nAnd you... They are tearing the... the German property. And you are there not to prevent\nthem. So you know what the punishment is for that? The punishment for that you are going\nto go, all of you, to the gas chambers.\" Suddenly, something pushed me. And I stopped...I\nmade a step forwards, announce my number--because that was...we been only number--and\nI said to him, to the commanders, I said, \"I'm not wondering that they are doing that, because\nevery human being 'til he's alive is trying to make his miserable life a little bit less miserable.\nIf you...1f you would be in the same position, you would be doing the same thing. And if\nyou would give us new clothing after such a long time which they are wearing that one um\ndress--which from rain and shine it's going to pieces--you would do the same thing.\" So, he\nstarted to scream at me. He said, \"You are a...a [chuke (ph)], a nasty [chuke (ph)]. How dare\nyou talking to me like that!?\" And that 1s expression \"frech,\" which I can't um translate.\nIt's...you know, who has a big mouth [Ger: \"insolent, sassy, cheeky\"]. They call it \"frech.\"\nSo, and he screamed at me. So I thought...and the girls in the back, they pulled me back.\n\"Magda, don't do it. Don't do it.\" But I...and, and I tell myself and...and I said what I wanted\nto say. And to my surprise, one of the biggest sadists--which I didn't know he is such a\nsadist, I... found it out much later--he got up, and he said, \"Listen. She's not only a like big-\nmouth [chuke (ph)]. She has something in her head. She's right. We have to give them new\nclothing.\" Next day...and they discharged us, and the whole camp got new dresses. So, I not\nonly saved us three hundred, but saved the camp. Because they got a little bit warmer\nand...dresses. And this is what we did, what we helped each other. There is another case.\nOne day, I was watching that the SS man came to select the girls--\"left\" and \"right.\" And\nwho was \"left,\" she had to go to the gas chambers. And there was present a girl...with the SS\nman was a um girl present which was Report Schreiberin. She was the one who wrote the\nreports. And she had to make the...all the numbers who will go to the gas chambers. I was\npassing by; and I observed that she's writing something. And then she looks left and right.\nAnd she doesn't see any SS man; and she sends the girls back to the barrack. And so she\nsaved about three hundred girls from immediate death. How long they will be alive, this\nnobody could guarantee. But she did it. And I saw many times she did it. And I had...didn't\nhave even the opportunity to ask how you do it. But I met her after forty-five years, two\nyears ago, in Prague. I went to visit her. And she told...and I ask her, \"Tell me, [Gatka (ph)],\nhow did you do it? I watched you writing, and then you send them back.\" She said, \"Listen.\nWe had to do something, because this was no...no end what they did to us. So I took from\nthe [cart-a-take (ph)| the dead numbers, of the dead. And I pretend that I am writing. And\nnobody saw. And I send them, because the SS didn't check it later.\" Because anyway so\nmany other was going; so they didn't check if those three hundreds are in it or not. And\nthat's what she did many times. There was another um how the girls, they had only one way\nto help each other or to survive. By own help; we didn't have anybody to help us. We been\nhelpless young girls to thrown in such unbelievable situation, which I don't know Dante\ncouldn't um couldn't find out such situation what we been in. Sick and fighting with every\nminute. Because one minute you been alive, the next minute you been dead. So one more\noccasion, I tell you: that I was working in a charge, like um a little helper there. And we had\nto put the whole barrack on, because a doctor--by the name [King (ph)], and she...her name\nis Anna, she lives in Australia--and um they had to select the woman out. But she gave me a\nhint, while he was turned around, that \"I am going to talk to him, and you girls try to pull the\ngirls in. They should run in the barrack.\" So she turned facing him from the front, and she\nstarted to talk to him. She was very...a very clever representative woman. And she was\ntelling him all different stories; and while the stories she was telling him, I was telling the\ngirls to run, run, run, run back to the barrack. One--which is remarkable and I never forget,\nbecause I didn't overhear all what she was telling him because I was concentrating more girls\nto go in--so she said, \"You know...\" And she named the...the... how far he was\nOberscharsturmfthrer, or whatever. You know, he was in... How many...he had on. And\nshe said, \"You know who is ...who is responsible for all the war?\" And he was surprised,\nand said, \"Who?\" And she said, \"The bicyclists and the Jews.\" And he said, \"But why the\nbicyclists?\" And she said, \"Why the Jews?\" You know, and he was laughing, \"Ha, ha, ha.\"\nYou know, it's a big joke. And meantime, the selection was over and the camp was saved.\nYou see, that's how we could do. There was no other way. Just by tricking and being\ncourageous. And our motto was: \"We are just going once through the chimney, sooner or\nlater. But 'til we arrive, we have to help each other.\" And that's how we helped each other.\nAnd often there was cases, like ... Like I told you, people were sick, you tried to help them.\nYou had tried to steal some medicine and give them. But then I myself fell into it; because\nbeing always in touch with those sick people, I also got typhoid. High fever. My tongue\nwas like the... Did you ever see a chicken stomach from inside, when you open it, how\nrough it is? So rough was my tongue. I had high temperature. I couldn't eat. And my\nstomach, I had to run. And no medicaments. The only thing what I wanted is tomato.\nWhere to got tomato? But then a group of girls was working for the Germans--they call it\nRajsko,\u2019 in a garden. And endangering her life, she brought a tomato in under her dress.\nBecause we been so flat anyway. So you didn't... And she brought a tomato, and with that I\nrubbed my tongue. And then what I was asking, it was lemonade. Where to get lemonade?\nBut one girl was working in the SS canteen, for the SS. She was... And so the girls told her,\n\"Can you steal a bottle?\" She said, \"I can't, but I will. If they catch me, I know I'll go to the\ngas chambers. But maybe, if I'm lucky, I...1 save her.\" So she did. And she managed to\nsteal a bottle, and she brought it and I was drinking that. Another girl, she said, \"I can't give\nher any medication. But I can steal some tablets to strengthen her heart. That's all what I\ncan give.\" So that's what was. And the other thing was because I became blind, and I\nbecame bli...deaf and I couldn't walk. So how can I...",
        "Q: (Cough)",
        "A: How can I op...",
        "Q: (Coughing)",
        "A: And how can I existed? So one of the girls told to the other girl, \"Can you, after work, do a\nnight duty? And so Magda could rest under the name that she is doing night duty. I'm going\nto steal potatoes. And when you come home, I will cook potatoes so you can strengthen up.\nAnd so Magda will be lying as she is on night duty.\" And as high temperature I had, she was\ntelling me that hundred times: \"You are on night duty, you are on night duty, you are on\nnight duty. And when the SS man comes and he probably will see you in bed like the others,\nthen you tell...you can jump out from bed if he wants you to.\" And there was a special SS\nman, who was the biggest sadist what you can imagine. And he just couldn't see some nice\ngirls and they didn't...he didn't want them to survive. And by off chance, all the girls caught\ntyphoid. And the girls was lying, because they couldn't get up. And he came and they was\non bed. But we didn't expect him to come, because he had no reason to come there.\nBecause there was SS man in charge of our barrack. So he came. And all the girls--young\ngirls, beautiful--yesterday they was healthy, but today they caught the typhoid and high\ntemperatures. So they was in bed. They all went to gas chambers. When he came to me, so\nI... You know, the sur...surviving is such a power that I said, in very quick German, that \"I\nam on night duty, but if you want I jump out from bed...\" So he said, \"Shut up! Hold your\ntongue! You bloody Jewess!\" But that saved my life. Saved my life. But I still couldn't\nwalk, and I couldn't hear. So when the counting was, so they just dropped. Like, like a sa...\nlike a doll, because I was limp. But um...and in this time, charge, you know, of barracks was\na German woman, a prisoner. And she said, \"I can't cover up for her. I must send her into\nthe gas chambers like these others. She can't work. She's no good for nothing.\" But one of\nthe girls says, \"Listen, I tell you what. I can sew. If you bring me needle, thread and\n> Part of the Auschwitz I complex.\nmaterial, I will sew you beautiful dresses, whatever. Just give her a chance to...to...to be\nali...to get better. And she will get better.\" So she said, \"Alright. But you look after her. It's\nyour responsibility. If some SS man comes and sees her and he says, 'To the gas chambers!,'\noff she goes.\" So she said, \"I will take that chance.\" So she sewed her, and she let me stay.\nAnd so it was one more day and one more day. But what happened, there one day they\ndecided that new arrivals are coming and they need the space. So they told us we have to go\nout from the camp. And there was a big empty paddock with nothing on, just snow and\nfreezing. And there we had to stay all day. I couldn't walk. So two girls from each side,\nthey took me here by my hand and they carried me. And my head, legs was dangling; and\nthey carried me and they pinched me that when SS man came I shouldn't say something.\nBecause I didn't see. I didn't hear. I just could talk. So they pinched me so I knew I should\nbe quiet. And so they carried me like that outside; and one of the girls...and this is how we\nhelped each other. She managed to get a bottle somewhere and she put tea in the bottle; and\nin that um what we got the food, it was a round dish. She put the bottle in the dish, and she\nput it here. As I said, we been so flat so it didn't made any difference. Can you imagine that\nI was so flat I didn't have anything? Nothing, just bones. Nothing, just bones.\nNothing...breast, no. Anyway, so they took me there. And there was a rock. They put me\non the rock. And from time to time, they gave me a sip of water I shouldn't freeze to death\n[on the] rock. And then they carried me a little bit around, and put me on the rock again.\nNow what happened: on the way back, they...a lot of girls froze to death there. And they\nwas dead or half-dead. And the rest, when we came in, they selected seventy percent out of\nthe girls--good or bad--to the gas chambers. Lucky, the girls from both sides which carried\nme, they been in better shape so they didn't saw me in between. Which saved me. And now\nwe knew why they did it, because new arrivals from all different part of the world came.\nFrom Belgium, from France, from Holland. And so they needed the space. That's how they\nmade the space. First they tortured them to death, and then they send them to the gas\nchambers. And um that was our existence. That was our existence. And I, by off chance, I\nhad...I was in charge from time to time in all nationalities I had. Jewish and non-Jewish.",
        "Q: Explain what were you in charge of.",
        "A: First I was the... How you say? A vice...like a vice, vice president you have. So it was a\nblock oldest [NB: Blockaltester], and I was either the...like the vice um oldest or I was just\num helping to bring the food, and block...",
        "Q: An assistant block...Blockaltester.",
        "A: Yeah. That was for a while I was doing that. And funny thing, the way I tried to handle\npeople... One of the girls who didn't know, she said, \"Magda, you handle always people\nlike... like they would be in the kindergarten. Like you would be a kindergarten teacher.\" I\ndidn't tell anybody I am. But I tried to help them. I tried to talk to them, and encourage\nthem. When what happened one day, you know, they selected people and they didn't send\nthem straight away to the gas chamber. They collected them in one of the barracks, which\nwas Number 25. And when it was full--and also outside the barrack, because it was a big\nfence built around them. Because from beginning, it wasn't a fence and some girls they run\nthrough the fence. Even it was um like nails on the top, but somehow they run through.\nBecause they wasn't really so bad, so they run through. So they made a fence all over. So\nnow they let also on the floor sitting those girls awaiting 'til the trucks will come. And it was\nhot and no water, and their face was swollen up. And it was just...their their eyes was....it\nwas just two spots and a nose. And it is... it is... I tell you, the heart was breaking. And I\nwas...I, I saw it. So I volunteered. I said, \"Let me go in.\" I asked. \"I am going to to give\nthem water.\" They said, \"Are you crazy? If SS man sees you, you go!\" _ \"So I go with them.\nBut I can't see those people suffer before the last minutes, being so swollen and and dying\nfor a...for a drop of water, in that terrible heat without having anything on their head or\nprotecting.\" So I took, you know, a dish and a cup; and I went from one to one. And I said\nto myself, \"If I die with them, I die. But I can't...can't see it. At least, the last moment.\"\nThey been so grateful. They knew they are going to die, but they said, \"At least we have a\nlittle water.\" And you know, the selection was done in a terrible way. Like sometimes it\nwas a Sickness which is not even a sickness. It is just like a scratching. You call it \"kretze,\"\nyou know? It was also an implanted thing. But they knew about it. So they let the woman\nundress totally naked; and when somebody had a little mark of scratch, in they went to the\ngas chambers. Then later, I...1 became a block oldest. And in every barrack, there was a SS\nman responsible for that barrack. And he had the right every day to make selection himself.\nEven so that many people went to work, but some was staying home because either they\ndidn't needed them or they was not well; so they was at home. And that SS man made the\nselection again. So I said, \"How could I stand by and see him selecting the people, my own\nfriends and bro...and sisters?\" So I arranged the girls so that in the front and in the back was\na strong girl, and everywhere; and in the middle was the weaker ones. And I pushed the girls\ntogether. 'Cause usually you had to stand so that you can go through, here and there, and\nhere and there. And he said, \"Do you think I don't know why you're pushing the girls so\nmuch in together? So I couldn't walk through, I shouldn't see that they are sick or weak\nwoman which I have to send to crematorium.\" And I said, \"Yes, that's why I did it. But I'm\ngoing to tell you something. They are not so sick that a few days at home wouldn't...they\nwouldn't recover. They just need a little rest.\" \"So, and what are you going to do?\nHow...how you want to do that?,\" he says. So I said, \"I tell you how. (Pause - drinking\nwater) I want to do something good for Germany.\" \"What you mean, 'good\"?\" (Pause) I\nsaid, \"You know how many um shoes are lying around, and how many dresses are discarded\neverywhere? Lying around in heaps, and not...nothing happen to them. And those can be\nrecycled.\" \"What you mean, 'recycled\"?\" I said, \"Washed and dried. And those girls can do\nit. All the shoes,\" I said, \"could be gathered and washed and dried and band together. And\nwhile they are doing that, they will recover.\" \"Where are they going to do it?\" I said, \"In the\nback in the barrack, there is a wash room. And they can wash there. I will look after them. I\nwill get some string where they will dry the clothes, and they will dry the shoes. And it's\nrecycled, you can use it again. And the good things, you can send to Germany. That's a...a\nservice, isn't it? Give me that chance!\" And he says, \"Have it. If you want to bother with\nthat, go on. Bother.\" I said, \"Thank you.\" And I established that, that they was in the back\ndoing what I said. And I tried to...you call it \"organize\" food. I said to the girls, the... Next\nto the kitchen, 1t was um onions and potatoes. And woman was peeling it; and there was a\nfence clo...around it. Not Jewish girls do that, because it was too good for Jewish girls.\nJewish girls would survive there. So they gave it to the Polish girls. But you know, one way\nor another, you make a eye contact; and when nobody sees... So we told them, \"Throw\nsome potatoes close to the fence. And in the evening when nobody's there and the SS man is\nout, so we will pull that before...between the fence out, the onions and the potatoes. And we\nwill in this way help each other.\" And some of the girls could do miracles. They could cook\nfrom...from nothing. From nothing. They could um peel the potatoes; and they found some\ndish and they made holes in it and they (laughter) mashed it up. And then they, somewhere\nfrom the kitchen--also from...from Polish girl--they got flour. And they mixed it up and they\nboiled it. And it was food. Additional food. So you see, little things like that made a\ndifference in helping, somehow. And some girls who worked outside and digging the\npotatoes out, sometimes... Again, it was dangerous. If they catch you with one onion, one\npotato: death. But they did it. They brought the potatoes. Everyone brought one potato or\ntwo, and so they helped somehow. How long, nobody had a guarantee; because came the\nselection was so often happening. So often. Some...and if...1f 1t wasn't...1f 1t wasn't then, they\npunished you this way or the other way, or...or beat you up. I tell you a sample. A nice girl--\nshe was blond and blue eyes--and she was working. SS man came to her. \"I show you blue\neyes!\" And he took the revolver...not the revolver, the big one. How you call that?",
        "Q: Rifle.",
        "A: The rifle. And beat her so long that he beat her to death. And he says, \"Now you can have\nblue eyes!\" And things like that happened very often. Or they say, \"Would you run there\nand there. And bring me that, my cap.\" And while she was running and doing the order, he\nshot her. For nothing. So like ...like I told you, I was from time to time chosen from one\nfunction to another. I didn't want to; but when the SS said, \"You are going to be block\noldest,\" there was no excuse. You said, \"No,\" right... So you been. And now it depended on\nyou. You could...and you tried to do the best you could. Not everyone could. A sixteen year\nold girl in charge for thousands hungry, tired, sick girls, to keep order... Because order has to\nbe, you know. The German order has to be. And if it wasn't, so she went to the gas\nchambers because she couldn't manage. But they didn't consider that she's sixteen years old,\nand how can you manage? Not everybody could manage. And cases like that was many,\nmany. And um I had um... When I came in charge, so I had Czech not Jewish girls from\nBeneS--he was President of Czechoslovakia.\u00b0 The whole family came there. Then I have\nPolish woman, non-Jewish woman. And that costed me terrible much, because they had\ntyphoid and they had diarrhea. And being on the third bunk, how can you run down with\ndiarrhea to get to the toilet who was so far? It's impossible! So, first of all, um with the girls\nI choose from the girls on the new arrivals a few who would be my helpers. So I said, \"We\nhave to do something.\" So we steal some ...it was wooden boxes. And we cut a hole in, and\nwe put a like...what you...what you carrying food in it...a bucket. We put the bucket in so\n\u00b0 Edvard Bene\u2019 was the democratically-elected President of Czechoslovakia until he resigned in\nOctober 1938 just after the Munich Conference.\nthey could relieve themselves. But some couldn't even walk down. So what they did, the\npoor girls, in that dish--which is not even nice to say--what they had for food, they finish\nthemselves there. And they threw it through the window out; because windows was broken.\nThere wasn't windows, good windows. So they threw it out. But imagine, then came the\nsun. And that was terrible. So I found out that in back of the barrack, there is a certain clay\nwhere the gypsies used to make their houses to cover it from. So I said, \"A good idea!\"\nThen I approached one day a man who delivered all...for the Kommandant woman. And\nI...when nobody saw me, I said, \"Please bring me two whitewash, and two...\" How you say?\nWhere the beer is in.",
        "Q: Kegs.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Kegs of beer.",
        "A: Big kegs, big... How you call them? I don't know the expression in this moment. He said,\n\"How you want me to? Where do I get it?\" I said, \"I don't care.\" \"How will I get it in?\" I\nsaid, \"You're delivering for the kommandant. So if...1f somebody asks, it's for her.\" \"But\nwhat happen if they say, 'It's...it's not for her?\" \"Then you tell it's for me. Then I have the\nresponsibility.\" But, somehow, he went through. He put it down. The girls quickly grabbed\nit and took it in. And during the night, the one group... Yah, we steal some um leather and\nsticks, and rags which we covered the stick on. And they did that outside with that mud,\nwhich had the color of um...nearly color of the bricks; and the windows, and inside the girls\ndid it with the whitewash. I thought I will disinfect the barracks. And I had already that\nhere, and maybe it will help a little. But I didn't realize what I am doing. In the morning,\nthey got up and here is the barracks standing with white windows. Can you imagine that?\nOh! They run. You know, they say, \"We are going to shoot you, hang you, because you are\ngoing to give signs for the...for the Americans: 'So here is a camp.' You know what you\ndoing? You are doing the worst thing, and for that is punishment. Not in the gas chambers,\nbut punishment. First punished, punish and then hanged too. But first you will get it.\" So I\nthought, \"What I am going to do?\" And meantime, I... that SS man who...you know, who\nwas in my barrack when I did the ...what I did with the washing, he was in another barrack.\nAnd by one occasion, when he was in my barrack, some girls was so grateful. So from rags,\nthey made me two dolls. You know the...I don't know if you know in America, but in\nEurope it was like um long legs, long hands, with black velvet. And here it had the pointed\num head, and the face was white and pointed. And it was such a doll. And they made me\nthat. I don't where they got the material and whatever, because the impossible was possible.\nAnd they put it on my bed. And I said, \"My goodness! What I am going to do with that?\nThey found it, so then I am in trouble and they are in trouble: where did they get it.\" So I\nthought myself, \"Be smart. Give it to him as a present.\" So I ...when he came in, I said,\n\"You are probably going one stage home. Take it to your wife as a present. She will be very\npleased.\" He said, \"Oh, that's beautiful. That's a good idea! I really was thinking what to\nget to my wife. That's what I am going to take.\" And he forgot to punish me. So...but what\nnow I use the opportunity. So I approached him, and I said, \"You know what, they want to\nhang me, but first to punish me and...and get...beat me up and so on. But what I did, I do it\nfor some hygienic reason.\" And I said, \"And I did for you, too.\". \"How you mean?\"\n\"Because you and the other SS who are coming to the camp, and they are approaching the\nbad barracks where the typhoid is, they will get it, too.\" She [NB: he] said, \"Don't tell\nanybody. Just recently five SS man died on typhoid.\" First I thought myself, \"Oh, let them\ngo. Why only us? Let them be ill, too.\" But on the other side, he said, \"Hold on.\" So I hold\non; and he went to the SS men commanders. \u2018Cause that was the woman commanders. The\nman commanders; and he explained that \"What she's doing is really for...\" Not on...not for\nus, so much as for them, because they are coming to the barracks. So they was talking in\nfavor of me. And now they came back, and you know what? \"The commander says that you\nare in charge. And you will have to tell all others that they have to do the same thing what\nyou doing...what you did.\" \"Oh, my God. Did I have...did I need that?,\" I said. But I was\nrunning around; and when I came to the barrack where that was the 25th barrack--where all\nthey was selecting to the death--so he said, \"Are you crazy?!\" Because there was a huge\nwall around, and you know how much work it has to do to paint that, too. So he said, \"Are\nyou crazy?! I'm going to...to listen to a bloody Jewess, she has crazy ideas?\" And I\nsaid...announced my number, I said, \"Would you be so kind and ask the commander?\" He\nlooked at me. He didn't say a word. And so... But what happened: now the women was\nvery mad at me. And they wanted to kill me, and now the men saved me. They have to\npunish me somehow. So what happened: in this stage, the experimental barrack opened in\nAuschwitz, in Barrack 10.\u2019 So they said, \"Alright. They saved your life. But in you go, in\nthe experimental block...barrack. But you will be in charge of the barrack.\" So I ask straight\naway, \"But could you give me also help, because I can't manage.\" \"Ah, take yourself!\" So I\nsaid, \"Sixteen girls.\" And I quickly named girls which are... they working outside, and I\nknew they won't last long. So I took those girls with me. And I went to the that barracks,\nwhich was the windows--that was the only women barrack in the men camp. So they\nclose...the windows was all with shutters and wire wiring. So we couldn't look out, and they\ncouldn't look in. And we been closed up. And a SS woman was there all day with us. And\nthe food was delivered \u2018til the door and--by men--and the woman took over. But when I\narrived there...so Hauptsturmfthrer Doctor Wirths,\u00ae whose brain child this idea was, he came\nand he said to me... I was blond and short cropped hair. My hair grew a little bit. And I was\nslim, naturally. And he said, \"You are not Jewish, are you?\" And I said, \"Yeah, I am\nJewish. Like all others.\" 'There must be a mistake.\" He said, 'There must be a mistake.\nYou don't act like Jewish. You don't look like Jewish. You don't behave like Jewish. You'll\nstand up for yourself. There is a mistake.\" And he said, \"And what are you from\nprofession?\" I said, \"Kindergarten teacher.\" \"That proves it!\" (Laughter) Incredible! That\n\u2019 According to the Auschwitz Chronicle, this would have been at the beginning of April 1943.\nSee Czech, Auschwitz Chronicle, 1939-1945, pp. 366-387.\n* SS Oberstiirmbannfiihrer Eduard Wirths, born 1909. Garrison physician in charge of all medical\npersonnel at KL Auschwitz from 06 Sep 1942.\nproves it! Why? Why does that prove it? So now I saw that he wants this way. So I said,\n\"If you want that to be a hospital, then we need blankets and then we need bed covers, sheets\nand towels and soaps. And even nightgowns.\" I told myself, \"Now he's going to give me a\nkick in my pants!\" But he said, \"Alright. You can have everything, and it will be delivered\ntoday. But the nightgowns will come tomorrow.\" You see? And now, because I managed\nto do that, so every SS man told that I am his proteg\u00e9e. I didn't do anything for him, and I\ndidn't even try to make a nice face opposite. But that was written I am his proteg\u00e9e. And um\nnow I tell you, you know, because it's a tragicomedy. Those girls was there in the barracks\nto choosen for the experiments. So I thought to enlighten their life a little bit. I said, \"As the\nnighties come, you are not going to pick and choose. If it's a small nightie and a big woman,\nshe has it or worse. And they can't exchange it.\" And then they are walking down from the\nstep down. So imagine, with those miserables as they been, it was a laughter. Because a tall\nwoman had a nightie coming here (showing hand on thigh) and (laughter) and a small\nwoman had a nightie coming there (showing hand on ankle). So I said, \"Don't laugh! This\nis the fashion parade.\" And then it gave me idea that, matter of fact, now where we are\nclosed up--because the SS woman went away. Um, she was there 'til lunch time counting,\nand then she went. So we been locked up. So I said, \"Is there anybody who is um like a\nlittle bit in the theater, or knows something? Dancing, acting, whatever. And we will make\ntheater in the evening.\" And that's what we established, a little group. And nobody was\nthere. We was sitting down, and somebody was performing. But I tell you what. I didn't\nlast there long either. Why? Because I... First of all, I must tell you that that um about the\nexperiments, closer I can't tell you. Because I wasn't a nurse. I just checked which\nexperiments are the least dangerous, there I will put more people. So the sterilization was\nnot so dangerous; because a doctor said to me that is his idea, and that Dr. Clauberg\u201d stole\nthe idea for him before he finished it. So he...even if it's not pleasant, what they still will be\nable if they survive, to have children. But they didn't survive, from other reason. But then,\nnaturally, they made also a very bad experiments. Brutal experiments, without any\nanesthetic. Terrible! And the girls suffered. And the radiation they made. And I tell you,\nit's terrible. And when they finished with the experiments, they send them to Birkenau\nwhere they didn't last long. Because now they been sleeping in bed and had a blanket and\nhad a towel. And they even if they suffered, but they had a little bit and like could look after\nthemself. And there was nurses which could help them a little. But that, they didn't survive.\nSo even, like I said, the sterilization wasn't so bad. But they didn't survive when they...\nWhen it was the experiments was ready they sent in; and they are not needed anymore, and\nthen send them away. What...",
        "Q: Can you tell us something about the women in the experimental barracks, people there?",
        "A: No. I tell you one case. Um they picked some woman which they made mask. And they\nsaid...they said the Jewish race is minor below the Aryan race, and they want to prove it\n\u201d \u00a7S Brigadefuhrer (honorary) Dr. Carl Clauberg, born 1898. Physician in charge of the\nsterilization experiments on women at KL Auschwitz from April 1943.\nsomehow. So they took the mask, and then they said they are going to send them to a\nsanitorium where they will have a good life and the doctors will making certain experiments\non it. They closed the women up in a room, and they give the key to me because I was in\ncharge of this barrack. Like I told you, the proteg\u00e9e of Dr. Wirths. But suddenly... And\nthey supposed to come at nighttime, twelve o'clock, to pick them up. Suddenly a girl\npick...um knocked on the door. She said, \"Please, let me out. I don't believe they are\nsending us to the sanitorium. Because how can they make to prove that our brain is not\ngood? They have to kill us first. So this is not a sanitorium. It is a certain camp where they\nwill kill us first, and then from our brain they will make the experiments.\" So she said, \"Let\nme out.\" So I let her out. Another one knocked. She said, \"I have a sister here. I want to be\nwith her. Please let me out.\" I let her out. Closed the door. I didn't think what will be the\nafter effect of it. I let her out. And, naturally, when they came, they didn't think that the um\namount is not proper. But when they put them on the train coming to that camp where they\ndid that--they killed them and they made. Later I found out. But after the war I found out;\nnot during the war. So they counted up two are missing. And they said, \"You know what\nyou did? This is sabotage! What right did it give you to take the girls out? You know what\nyou are going to get for it? You are going to be punished, and you are going to be hanged or\nshot!\" And in 11, Barrack 11, was a man named Jacob who was the hangman. But he was a\nJewish man and a very good-hearted man. But sometimes, he couldn't help it. He had to do\nit. Otherwise, they kill him. And he send a message to me. He said, \"Magda, I will do it in\nthe quickest way.\" So I was prepared. And they send me to the Politisch Abteilung. That\nmeans the \"Politisch [NB: Political] Department.\" A woman came to pick me up. And there\nwas Aumeier.'\u201d He was a small man with a husky voice, who was a brute. Who came under\nhis hand, with his own hands he murdered him on the spot. Whoever it was. And she said,\n\"Goodbye, Madga. I know you are not going to survive that. Because he will tear you to\npieces like he does with the others.\" What can I do? So we said goodbye. But I came in;\nand he said, \"What are you thinking, Staatskriminal ...?!\" You know, and made him... I\nsaid, \"I did what I was asked for, and I think I did a good thing.\" He say, \"What!?!\" And he\nscreamed, but he didn't touch me. I can't believe it, even today not. He didn't touch me. So I\ntold myself, \"Who did it?\" Then I thought, \"That's the work of Hauptsturmfuhrer Doctor\nWirths. He did it. He wanted to frighten me. And he wanted to please the woman [NB: SS\nwomen commanders], you know? But he didn't kill me. And what happened once, with\nHauptsturmfthrer Wirths, there in the barracks was... in the um experiment barracks, was a\nlot of Greek girls. And I tried to help them; well, because either you try your best or you you\ndon't care. But I cared. Wherever I could, I helped. So they were so grateful that, again I\ndon't know where they got it, they made me two pillows. Hand-made pillows. And they put\nit on my bed. The same story. What do I do with two pillows? If somebody sees tt:\n\"Where did you get it? Who made it?\" So they will be in trouble. I will be in trouble. So\none day, Hauptsturmfthrer Wirths came in. And he left the door open and his car was\nstanding before. I ran for one minute out. I threw the pillows in, and I run back. And I\ndidn't say a word. He didn't say a word for weeks. But then he came and he asked me the\n'\u00ae SS-Hauptstiirmfiihrer Hans Aumeier.\nsame question. \"What did you do? Didn't you do what, now what this for that punishment\nfor what you did?\" I said...I said the same thing to that, to him. And he just said so much:\n\"The pillows was very nice.\" So much is said. And I came to the barrack, and the girls\ndidn't believe I am alive. And you know, I don't know if you know this 1s [tilam (ph)], you\nknow? The girls was praying [tilam (ph)] for that that I survived; because they loved me so\nmuch and I helped them so much. But that didn't help me for long. Because one day Grese--\nthe \"Angel of Death\" they call her, but I had experience with her before--came to pick me\nup. And \"You are coming with me.\" And I said, \"Where I am going?\" She said, \"You are\njust coming.\" I didn't know where I am coming. And I don't know...you know what's a\nbunker is? Yeah. There was a bunker under the earth which was so big that four woman\ncould stand next to each other like sardines. My punishment was... The woman couldn't\nstand it that the men saved me again, so they wanted to punish me. So I had the punishment:\nseven nights to stand there all night, then to be on the call-- the Zahlen Appell [NB: Census\nroll call]--and then punishment was to clean all the la...toilets or latrines. I wouldn't survive\none day, because standing there and then the roll call for hours. I...[ was... You know, one\nminute I would be finished. And now to clean all the toilets. But, you know, there was a\ncertain um... You know, news travel. And the men who was working in the camp, they\nfound out while I got this punishment. So they came to my rescue. They said, \"You lie\ndown here, and we will do your work. When SS man comes, then you will get up. Pretend\nthat you are working.\" And that saved my life. You see, this is what I mean, helping each\nother. That was only the way that some, some--meaning from twenty thousand of us, a few\nhundred--survived.",
        "Q: At this point I want to pause, and we're going to change tapes.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nTAPE #3\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: OK. We are on. Would you tell me about...? Tell us about Irma Grese.",
        "A: Yeah. I met Irma Grese in beginning of my life in concentration camp. I mean, in Birkenau.\nFrom beginning...um it was...1t must be August, September '42. And I was a Stubendienst --\na helper. Not in my...stuben oldest, just like a little helper who went...carried the bread and\nthe food. And I went to um... and I needed always volunteers to that. People who was\nworking; and I asked them nicely, \"Listen, I know it's very hard, because you're working\nhard. But if we don't get the food, the bread, you won't have any. And we can't...for so\nmany, those few girls, they can't manage to... We've haven't got even time, because then it's\nthe roll call and everything. So, please come.\" And I was talking to them on...where Grese\nwas there, because she was in the...in the...where the bread was given out. She was in charge\nas a SS woman. She looked a chubby woman, young woman. In my eyes, she was about\neighteen, nineteen; with long blond pleats...plaits, chubby. And she didn't even have the hat\non. And while I was talking, I was telling the girls, \"Look girls, um I know it's very hard, but\nplease do it. And I will myself carry as much bread as you. So let's do it nicely and\nquickly.\" And while I was doing it every day, she called me and she said, \"What's your\nname?\" I said, \"Magda.\" And she said, \"I'm watching you, because you are talking to the\npeople and you carry the bread. You are different like the others. You taking so much\nenergy and time to...to encourage the people.\" And I said, \"I will do it to the last breath of\nmy life. If I can help, I do it.\" And...and I said, \"And what's your name?\" I forgot I am\ntalking to the (laughter) SS woman. And she said, \"My name 1s Irma.\" And I again said,\n\"Nice to know you.\" Then later, I said, \"My goodness! What are you, crazy? You're talking\nto SS woman!\" But that did it, that I said to her. And um so, for a while she was there and I\nwas...and she, every time she was talking with me and asking me something. And she\npretended, that woman...you know, deceiving me. She said that she didn't...part maybe was\nright. She said, um, \"I was um living in a small place, and suddenly they asked for\nvolunteers. But I didn't know where they are taking me. So I volunteered, and here I am.\"\nBut later, I found out they first they took them to a place to brutalize them and prepare them\nto be brutal; and then she came. But that I didn't know then. Anyway, so we been in contact\nlike that; and suddenly we lost touch about each other. She went her way, and I went my\nway. And later I found out that she was wanting to be somebody, suddenly. And then one\nday I met her, and she was slimmed down. She had her hair up and very nicely the cap on.\nShe had boots shining like glass, or silver or whatever. And she had...in her boots, she had a\nwhip and she had a belt with a pistol who was shining also like silver. And she said, \"Hello,\nMagda.\" Nobody called me Magda, because I was for everybody number. And I said,\n\"Hello, Irma.\" And I said, \"Oh, but now you look dressed!\" And I said, \"Shining like that,\nand like a real SS woman. I hope I will never see you brutal like the others.\" She didn't say\nanything. She didn't say, \"This is not your business,\" or...or \"How dare you.\" She just\nlistened and went away. Later, I found out that since she is like she is, she's riding out on a\nhorse and going out to the Kommandos and with that whip she's whipping the girls. And\nmostly she's whipping on the breast, because that 1s very sensitive part. And often it breaks\nit. And what is the end? Death. But I didn't know. I found it out much later. And then,\nwhat happened: the...I was working in a office [at] one stage. I was so happy to work in the\noffice, not to have that responsibility and to see the...all the cruelty. Because there I was\nworking on the [karteaustaschs (ph)]. You know, the Germans are punctuality plus! And I\nlearned the, the... I had anyway a nice writing as you saw; and now even I made it even\nnicer. And I was happy. But one day, I heard the news that the Hungarian arrivals are\ncoming from Budapest and from Hungary. And one day I was called up by the commander\nreplacing the commander-in-charge. And he...she said, \"You will be the Lageraltest in the\nnew camp where the arrivals are coming.\" So I said, \"Oh, I am so happy here in, in where I\nam.\" And she laughed. She had teeth standing out like that, you know. She said, \"Oh, ho,\nho, ho.\" She said, \"Oh, you are happy here, are you?\" She said, \"But you are taking that.\nYou will be in charge.\" And I said, \"I don't know how to be a Lager oldest.\" I said, \"I never\nbeen one.\" And she laughed with her teeth, and she said, \"Where could you be? There was\nnever a camp...where there was a camp.\" And the other reason was, I said because for the\ntime being I heard that in this camp are men on one side. And I'm so afraid that I got\ninvolved...I will get involved with some man for what is punishment there, and I don't want\nthat. She said, \"About that, you don't have to worry. We will watch you carefully.\" Nothing\nhelped me. So...and there was the report um writer which I knew, and I approached her. I\nsaid, \"Please, [Gatka (ph)]. Don't let it happen. I know how can you help all thousands and\nthousands people? And when we really would, by any miracle survive, how many enemies\nwill I have? \u2018Cause you can't help by the thousands. Somebody...I, I didn't look nice or\nwhatever.\" So she said, \"Look, this is not that the SS wants you. But the underground wants\nyou; because they know that you will try the best to save people, as many as you can. And if\nthere another woman comes there which 1s a sadist, she will have the pleasure to do it. So\nthere is no way. They choose you. The underground choose you. You have to take. And\nit's up to you how you will manage.\" What can I do? So they took me to the camp. And the\nLagerkommandant, Kramer'!--which was a man of six foot six, with hands like that--he said,\n\"Here you will be Lageraltest.\" And I looked in. There was empty barracks, nothing in it.\nNot bed, no straw sack, no blankets, nothing. And I said...clapped my feet and announced\nmy number, and I said, \"Lagerfthrer, please. Here you want me to be, that next day or the\nThursday you can call all the woman 'Jewish swines.\" Because they're...where can they...\nthey will sleep on top of each other, and they probably won't be able to go to the toilet and\nthey will make on each other!\" So I said, \"Why don't you send them straight away to the gas\nchambers?\" And I said...and he said, \"Why you worrying so much about the other people?\nWorry about yourself, that you take care of yourself!\" And I...but wonder of wonders...\nNow I tell you, I don't know who was talking from my mouth. I said again, that ceremony...I\nsaid, \"If you, in reverse, would be in charge and you will be a Lager oldest; and the prisoners\n'' SS Hauptsturmfiihrer Josef Kramer was Kommandant of Birkenau from May 1944, when the\nHungarian Jews began arriving, until December 1944, when he was transferred to KL Bergen-\nBelsen by Rudolf Hoss.\nwould be your fellow Germans and you wouldn't help them, I would call you 'Coward.\"\nAnd I said it. I said, \"My goodness! Magda, are you crazy? Whom you talking? This is the\ncommander who whenever somebody he doesn't even like or who is just in his way, he grabs\nit by his neck, squeezes it a minute, throws them like a doll. And he is killed. And you\ntelling him what is?\" But I stood straight, and I said, \"Be strong, and don't move from this\nspace.\" And he looked at me, and he saw I am not shaking. I am not crying. I am not\nbegging. He says, \"You know what? You are right. Tomorrow you will have what you\nwant.\" So I said, \"I want beds. I want straw sacks. I want blankets. I want um a utencils to\neat; and I want spoons.\" \"OK. Have it.\" And I said, \"And I want some woman who...who\nwill be in charge. In every barrack is thirty barracks, and I want some thirty girls which I\ncan have which I want.\" He says, \"Have them! Just tell them which one you want, and have\nthem.\" So again, miracle [of] miracles, they thought--you know, the news traveled--that I\nam the protegee of Kramer. But that's nothing. Never mind. I couldn't do...I couldn't just\nsave everybody. I can't... couldn't, but where I could. I was running up and down from\nmorning to evening. Where I could, I explained, I begged. I...I ...1 watched the...the...the\ngirls in charge. I said, \"You try your best. If not, I personally punish you.\" And I did. I\ncame in; and I saw that the girls didn't take care that they should have the proper kind of\nfood. And they was a little bit [leger (ph)] on it. So I called them to the front whereI __..\nAnd I said, \"You are going...\" There was water for in case there will be fire; so it was from\nthat it would be taken, the water. \"Around that water,\" I said, \"you are going to jump.\nBecause you are here for helping, not for making yourself comfortable. You saw me\nrunning from morning 'til evening to the camp Birkenau. You saw my feet um swollen like\nthat. You look at my face, how it's swollen. You I picked and choose, and I took you out\nfrom maybe you wouldn't be alive. So you do your duty. And now this was a punishment. I\nknow you are my friends, and I know you will be angry at me. But you will remember,\nbecause it's still better like a SS man would come in and something is not in order.\" So that\nwas it. But this why I said I was so strict on my own friends. But one girl um who who was\na...she could write poems, she got a paper and she wrote a long poem about me, to me. That,\nyou know, she appreciates that she knows what I am doing and it was wrong for them to be\nnegligence, a little bit. But, you know, persons 1s like that--1f he can make himself the life\neasier, he is. But not with me. So one day Commander Kramer came... Because here was\nthe women camp, there was a road and the next after the road was the main camp. And often\nthe woman husbands was in the camp. And they just arrived. So they screamed over to each\nother. Or sometimes the man, if he had a chance to get something extra, so he put it in a\npiece of paper um in in a rock and he threw it over. So...and he [NB: Kramer] found out that\nthey are doing it. So he put me in charge that I have to...Sunday when SS are not in, I have\nto watch it shouldn't happen. So I have to watch next to the um fence. I have to walk up and\ndown. But naturally I said to the girls, \"When I am up, down you can talk. And...but watch\nif you hear some automobile or whatever coming, or SS man.\" So the little runners which\nwe have watch it. One day Kramer came. All the girls disappeared. And he said, \"What\nare you doing here?\" I told myself, \"You know, you put here in charge.\" So I said--\nunbelievable--I said, \"I am...I want to go to the theater, and I am thinking what I am going to\nwear. I haven't got a dress. I haven't got soap. I haven't got a mirror. I haven't got perfume,\nand all those things which needed to the theater. That's what I am here standing and thinking\nabout.\" And you...would you believe? And he said, \"You are right! Tomorrow morning, I\nam coming to pick you up. And I take you there, and I get you all what you wanted.\" And I\ncame to the girls and I told them. So, you know, the tragicomedy...they started to laugh.\n\"Magda, are you crazy?!\" I said, \"What could I tell him? Should I tell him I do the duty?\"\nAnd I thought...I said a very bad expression. I said (laughter)...you know, and I said, \"I am\nnot going to satisfy that 'I am doing what...what you told me to be here,' because then I am a\nlittle crawling rat.\" And I said, \"No, I am not telling him. I am telling him the impossible.\nTomorrow he will forget it, anyway,\" I said. But you know, in the morning the runner came.\n\"Magda...Lageraltester, to the front! Lager Commander Kramer wants you.\" So I...I arrived\nthere. I announced myself. He said, \"So here Iam.\" And I said, \"But I need fifty people for\nthis.\" \"Fifty people?\" And I said, \"Yes. Fifty people or nothing.\" So he said, \"Have them!\"\nSo quickly I said to the runner, \"Bring the fifty people in the fifth...by the five, five, five...\"\nWhichever, whoever was the first fifty; and we went to the place that all the clothing was\ndone. I never been there before. I was standing outside. And I left the message through that\nthey should prepare little...um it looked like... How could I say? Like a big box, and in the\nfront was two sticks and here through; and you could um carry it like...you could wheel it.\nIt was um... How could I say? You know what I mean? So I said, \"Get me five of those\ntrolleys, or whatever you call it. And give the message all over they should put there soaps,\ntowels, medicines, blankets, clothings, sweaters. But pile it up to the full capacity.\" And\nthat's why I needed fifty; because to every one, ten woman would be able to to wheel it.\nAlright. It was all prepared. Suddenly Kramer came, and you know he brought me antique\nlittle um...like in on the boudoir you have it. It is a mirror coming here and back; and here\ntwo...two drawers. And he showed me. \"Here you have the soap, the perfume, the lipstick,\nthe comb, the brush. Everything.\" And on his hand, he had a most beautiful silk dress.\n\"And here is the silk dress. Do you like it? So now you have everything, and you can go to\nthe theater. Are you satisfied?\" I said, \"Very much so.\" And he pretended not to see the\nfifty woman. And he...I said, \"I take it.\" He said, \"No, I take it. I told you I bring you, so I\ntake you 'til your camp. And then I give it to over to you.\" And he came 'til the door, 'til the\nthe place of the camp. And then he said to...they're in charge, \"Let the woman through, the\nfifty. And when they are ready let them...the empty, and one with them is going to deliver\nthose back. And here now you can go to the theater.\" So quickly we wheeled that in in one\nof the barrack where I've been. It was a big foyer there empty, and I said, \"Unload quickly\nthe things, and um select the soaps.\" And all...all the girls I...I took which was there, the\nlittle runners, \"Come on, quick. Put the soaps here, the sweaters there, and then go outside.\nDon't say anything, but put the people in the rows, always by the fifty. Bring them in and\ndischarge them, this...give everybody.\" And I said, \"Everyone has to save it on the bed who\nwith him. The soap, the towel. One gets the towel. One gets the soap. One gets the...\" You\nknow, and like that; 'til we emptied everything. And nobody should know about that. It had\nto be done very quickly and very quietly. No SS man saw it. This was the second thing.\nThe third thing what he did: one day I should come to the front. The Lagerkommandant is\nthere with his black car, and he wants to discuss certain things with me. So I come there.\nGrese 1s...she became the Lagerfiihrer of our camp. The other side is Mengele; and here in\nthe middle with the car is Kramer. And he says, \"Lageraltester, come and sit in the car. I\nwant to discuss with you some matters.\" And I said, \"But um Kommandant, please. I am\njust a bloody Jewess. Here is Dr. Mengele. Take him in the car.\" \"Let him bloody walk.\nAnd you come and sit in the car.\" Grese heard that. She didn't believe her eyes. But you\nknow, my status symbol went high; because she thought who knows what I have with the\nKramer. But I still said, \"No, I better don't sit in. It wouldn't look nice.\" But, you know, this\nwas a old car which outside it had like a stand on it. I don't know if that cars are still in. I\nsaid, \"I better stand on it outside.\" And I forgot one thing. I forgot that I had the ring which\nthe War...Warsaw uprising people made. And they brought it in, in some miracle way. And\nwhen they heard about me, how I am to the people, they donated me. And that was also not\na easy thing to bring in, and I just got the ring on. So...and while I was, while I was standing\nI leaned with my hand on the car. And he said, \"What! You are wearing a ring of the\nWarsaw Ghetto uprising before me?!\" And he grabbed a pistol. \"I am going to shoot your\nhand with the ring up!\" And I said, \"I am in your charge. Whatever you want, you can do. I\nam just a bloody Jewess.\" He looks at me and said, \"Ah!\" He said, \"Ah, get away!\" And he\nput the revolver back. And all that, Grese saw. So, you know, these are the unbelievable\nbelievable thing. So now about Grese: like I told you, she became Lagerfthrerin in our\ncamp. And our contact was still the old contact. When I became there in the camp, I\ngathered all the doctors from the camp, they should come to me. And I said to..., \"Now Iam\ngoing to divide you. In every barrack will be how many you are, two or three.\" I can't\nremember, but minimum two. \"And you are watching, and you are going to help those\npeople. I am going to try to get some medicines, whatever. We can't do miracles, but\nwhatever. But you watch; and especially watch the mostly for an epidemic.\" And they said,\n\"And what we are going to do?\" So I said, \"What I am afraid is scarlet fever. And what you\ndoing with them, straight away came...come to me and tell me about it. And that person\nwho has that, put in the...\" Back of barracks was a room which supposed to be a washroom,\nbut they didn't finish it. \"So that will be the quarantine.\" So, suddenly, all the doctors came\nthat \"We found two,\" \"We found three.\" \"But now how to...we are to do with the\ncounting?,\" asked me the girls. So I said, \"Leave it to me.\" So it was summer...hot. Hot!\nThe sun was incredible shining, you know? Like I said, if it was as Satan...Satan was there\nin this place, in...1n Birkenau. So I approached Grese; and I said, \"Irma, look. Why should\nyou run around in this hot weather and do the counting? I am going to do the counting for\nyou, and you be comfortable. Sit down here in this room. And the report writer, and I will\nannounce her and she will count it up. And when it's all right, then you...\" \"You are right.\"\nBut she said, \"And what will do the Lagerkommandant in from the camp to mine camp?\"\nAnd I said, \"Are you Lager um Fuhrer of this camp?\" She said, \"Yeah.\" \"Then you do what\npleases you the best. And she has nothing to say in your camp.\" And she sat down. And I\nsent the runners down, and they put the legs down on the bed, you know? So it was easy to\ncount. And they counted, you know, like this. They didn't go out, because then it would be\nmissing. So nobody knew about it. And nobody should know about it. It was kept secretly.\nAnd so I did the counting for six weeks, 'til the scarlet fever 1s over. The worst part is six\nweeks. I did the counting, and Grese agreed with me. And it was always the counting right,\nso she didn't have any excuse. And that we saved thirty thousand people. Why I am saying\nthat, because there was a little camp across or across the road. They called that camp\n\"Mexico.\" It was B...zwei...drei, three.'* And there the scarlet broke out, and there wasn't so\nprepared. And eight thousand five hundred--healthy or not healthy--all went to the gas\nchamber. So that's what it is what I am saying. That you could be in function which was not\nvery pleasant--because always a Damocles [NB: Sword of Damocles] was hanging over\nyour head--but you had the chance to save people. I saved the people some other way, too.\nMengele came to select and often I had to be present. And he did it in the most unbelievable\nway. He was whistling the Donau Waltz. And he said (humming a bar of the Blue Danube\nWaltz), that means that went to the left. (Humming the subsequent bar of the Blue Danube\nWaltz), was to the right. (Humming from Blue Danube Waltz) And that was left, right, left,\nright--healthy, sick, that's how it came. He didn't touch anybody. He didn't! But he just\npushed them to the gas chambers good or bad. So what happened: when he finished um like\nthe selecting and he went away, so I run to the door. And I don't know, I couldn't...I couldn't\nsteal them all. But I just came like...like I would be in charge of it, and I cut a certain part.\nAnd I said, \"Turn backwards, and with me march.\" Nobody knew. Nobody knew. And I\nsaved that woman. Sometimes it was twenty. Sometimes fifty. Sometimes hundred.\nSometimes two hundred. And back to life. How long, I don't know. But the most um thing\nwith Grese was, that like I told you, before me she was good as gold. So much so that even\nshe introduced me her boyfriend. She had the boyfriends galore. She had the boyfriends,\nevery day somewhere else. Matter of fact, to point out, one day she came and she said,\n\"Magda, I have in the main camp a man. He's a prisoner, and I fall in love with him. And I\nwould love to visit him.\" So I said, \"Now, why don't you? You are in charge. Go to visit\nhim.\" She said, \"No, that wouldn't look nice. Because what I am doing there?\" So she said,\n\"But you come with me.\" I said, \"I?\" I said, \"Why?\" \"Because then I make it official. You\nare coming. We have some...something to finish up. And I put you there in the un like in\nthe schreibstube.\" In the... where the papers are done. \"You will be waiting there for me, so\nthey think you have some... Nobody will check.\" So I said to myself, \"Oh, you give me\n[there (ph)] occasions!\" So I sent right away my runners; and I said, \"Woman who has\nhusbands in the other camp, write quickly. We will organize some paper and pencils. Write\nquickly a few words and give it to me; because I am going, say two o'clock or three o'clock,\nand I take it with me.\" So I took the letters and I been there. And I asked the man in charge\nthere who was the writer... I said, \"Look, you have the number of the barracks. Please do\nme a favor. When they catch you, I am. But they won't probably ask you, because you just\ngoing like on official business. Take it to them. It's a letter from their wife, and if they...\nTake paper with you and pencil. They just have to write one or two words, because we\nhaven't got more time.\" And so I was a delivery man. A postman. Just because she had that\nfantasy on a certain man. So I show you that unbelievable. She needed me, I should go with\nher. So it was for a while I did it. And she even introduced me another boyfriend, what I\nthink about him. If I agree with him. She had every day another one. I don't know why she\ndid it. But she asked me, \"What you think?\" And he was a good looker--a tall, broad-\n'? Camp B3 was part of the Birkenau complex. The term \"Mexico\" was coined in the Spring of\n1944 because the prisoners assigned there wrapped themselves in blankets.\nshoulder. And he didn't look like a cruel man to me; but um yet you never know. So things\nlike that she did. But one day she was in camp, and suddenly the words was coming, the\nrunners: \"Magda, please! Come quickly! Quickly! Grese got...Grese got...Grese got\ncrazy.\" \"What is she doing?\" She's...with the whip, she's whipping the woman through the\nbreast. And it's opened all the breast, and it's blood running and the woman are crying.\nCome quickly!\" So I said, \"Oh, my goodness! That vicious, vicious, vicious witch! She had\nto do it when I am turned away?!\" So I came there, and I saw. And I said, \"Now you can be\nproud of yourself! What did you do? You know what you did? Imagine somebody would\ndo that to you!\" And I said, \"And if I don't get quick help for them, tomorrow they are\ngoing...or in an hour in gas chambers. Because they will get infected.\" So I quickly sent\nsome to the Revier, and they should at least give them First Aid. And she lifted the whip on\nme. So I said, \"Go ahead! Whip me! You like to do it. You like to do it for woman,\nespecially on the...on the bust. Do it to me!\" She looked at me, that I am standing there.\nShe put the whip down; and I said, \"I am offended!\" And I walked away. Would you\nbelieve it? I didn't believe it myself. And half an hour later, she came. And I pretended that\nI am offended still. And she said, \"Forgive me.\" She said, \"Forgive me.\" And the girls\nheard that. She said, \"Magda, I don't know, what you have a sypo...hypnotic um power\nover her or something?\" She [NB: I] said, \"I don't want you to see it once more again, what\nyou did before.\" I didn't. She did it somewhere else, but not before me. Imagine. Imagine.\nSo this so far I can tell you, she was the worse sadist ever been; and she wanted to be in very\nhigh. You know, that how good she is, how brutal she over does all everybody. And she\nlooked million dollars, because she was very pretty. And especially now, being always\ndressed--everyday immaculate shirts. A matter of fact, a cousin of mine was...I put her in\ncharge to work to wash her clothes, because in this way she was saved and she helped her.\nAnd everybody was happy. So every day, she was washing and ironing her shirts. So she\nwas starched collar and beautiful. But um...but then people said what she can do, she was\nterrible. She was terrible. But um that's how we existed together.",
        "Q: Did you know anything about Irma Grese's lesbianism?",
        "A: I... knew. I knew. I knew about her lesbianism, because she wanted approach some of the\ngirls in the...in our camp too. But I, I heard about it. So I said, \"You can cleverly avoid it,\nbecause she has plenty other German woman and other woman. But why should she use a\nJewish woman to...\" And especially she liked dark-haired woman. She approach; and she\ntold me that Grese came and she told her. But, you know, you can um you can say it in such\na way it's too obvious. But I said, \"You be very diplomatic about it, not to offend her much.\nBut you just say that you don't know. Because you don't know that, because we don't know.\nWe never heard about it. 'And there many others who'd be willing, because you are so\nbeautiful.\" And so I know...I knew about it. But um luckily she didn't try with me; and like\nI told you, I warned the girls because I heard she is. She was having affairs one after the\nother, and even prisoner. It didn't matter. And one I was there...(laughter) That was a funny\npart. When we been in the experimental block, from some...from no reason whatsoever--\nbecause she wasn't in charge of that--she came and she said, \"Magda, came with me.\" I said,\n\"Why?\" \"Because I like a man in this...J know in barrack. And um I want to see him.\" But\nyou know what um the coincidence is and the irony is, when they delivered the food... I\nmust say something. I managed from Hauptsturmfthrer Wirths to ask that the girls had all\nday locked in, and they can go out and either to collect herbs or collect flowers and be a little\nbit on the fresh air. And he said, \"By all means.\" You know? And so the girls went out, and\na herbalist came and they collected herbs. And also they...also they always brought some\nflowers. And they been an hour or so outside in the fresh air; and the food, when they\ndelivered, the men--because they saw the girls out, so everybody picked one--and they... In\nthe kettle, when they lift it up between the food, they put a little either packets of some\nspecial food, or just a letter or a little present. And so a man send me letter on little parcel,\nand to...directed to me. And this is the man she picked (laughter) for liking. He wrote me\nlove letters which was... Yeah, love letters! He saw me just walking by. I didn't...I didn't\neven see him. He saw me. But then I found out that who he is, because signed the name and\nwe found out. And one day, she said, \"I want to go to this and this.\" And now we faced\neach other with this man who was writing me those love letters. And she said, \"You wait\nhere, Magda. I am going with him. And I will try if I can... You wait here outside.\" She\nwas waiting...I was waiting outside, and... But nothing came out of it. I don't know how he\ngot out of it; because he...he was um he was a Polish man, but he supposed to be um\nreleased. So maybe that's why he, he um... I don't know how or what, 'cause I didn't um go\nin detail. But um when she came out; and then in the next letter, he wrote me that she\nwanted him...to go with him. But he... (laughter) he just didn't feel for her nothing, so... So\nhe just wrote me. I, I don't know if they went; probably they went. I don't...but what, what\nthat made difference? He was...he writes me. Alright, I took his word. But I took with\nreserve his word, because he just wrote me letters. So never he mentioned anyway. So I tell\nyou those... those things, you see, incredible. Unbelievable. This was Grese. This was\nGrese. She could talk to me like...like a friend; and the next minute she was a devil.\nThat...that's what she was. A real devil. A sadistic devil. But she was so pretty, you know?\nThat's why they called her \"Angel of Death.\" That's about Grese; because I think that covers\nit, more or less. Now...",
        "Q: (Cough)",
        "A: I want to tell you about a French woman, because that has also something to do with the\nexperimental block. One day, arrival of um...",
        "Q: I just want to make time clear. We're now going back to when you were in the experimental\nblock?",
        "A: No. No. I been in Birkenau.",
        "Q: We're still in Birkenau.",
        "A: I am in Birkenau, and I am going to the \"Revier\"--so-called Hospital--with some woman to\nget some medication. Because we didn't dare to leave them here...there for long, because\nsoon as the \"Revier\" was filled, they went over to the gas chambers. So we are there, and\nsuddenly we heard woman singing the Marseillaise. And every...after two woman a police,\nan SS man with the... How you call it? I forget.",
        "Q: With a rifle.",
        "A: With a rifle. And the whole camp had to turn to the face away from them, so not to get in\ntouch with them or they were afraid we will make a revolution. Ho, ho, ho. But this\nis...suddenly the...the girl who was in charge, the report um writer, she was looking for me.\n\"Magda, Magda! Where are you? I need you.\" I said, \"Why you need me?\" \"I want you to\ntake those French woman over. You will be in charge.\" I said, \"Oh, my goodness, leave me\nalone! I am now in so hidden. I want to have a little peace. But what you want?\" \"They are\nFrench woman. They are all politisch. They are writers. They are um doctors. They are\nnurses. They are professionals. They are... they all have red triangle, because they are\npolitisch. You want them to to get somebody who won't be able to handle them, and they\nshould die or or take them to the chambers?\" So she said, \"You take them.\" But I said, \"I\ndon't know French.\" You know, excuse. She said, \"Oh, my God, you don't know French!\nYou know 'essayez-vous,' or a few words. (Laughter) I know that you went to gymnasium,\nso what you telling me? And the rest, I leave it to you.\" Anyway, nothing helped. I went in\ncharge. First thing, I said, \"Who is speaking German here?\" So it was Maria Elise. She was\na journalist, and she spoke German. And I explained to her I didn't volunteer for that, and I\ndon't want that position. \"And it's not a pleasure. And the whole life here is not a pleasure.\nBut I am going to try to make your life as easy as possible, with your help. We have to\ncommunicate. We have to manage to help each other, because typhus is raving. Um\nflies...lice are there. Everything. Try...um take the hygienic as possible, with all the little\npossibility as it is.\" Because I...for example, when I didn't.... couldn't wash. So at night\nwhen the kettles from the tea was empty, so I emptied the left-overs from all the kettles and\npoured for that what was there. From that I washed myself. Somehow, I had to wash\nmyself. Because I knew how important is. And wet. Naturally, I didn't have a towel, too.\n(Laughter) Anyway, so I told...I told her everything, to explain to them. When is the roll\ncall, then roll call. When is to take food, then is taking the food. Not to hesitate, because\nthen they make life harder and I don't want to scream at them. I don't want to be cruel to\nthem. And so they have to help me. So they did. What I did the first day, I said to them,\n\"Tomorrow I am going to wake you up a little bit earlier because we are going to do\nexercises, because I believe that in healthy body is a healthy spirit. And the moral [NB:\nmorale] is very important.\" And I got up with them. And the rest said \"Magda, that crazy\nMadga! She thought that...(laughter) She's doing exercises. She's getting up earlier. She\ncould be in bed a half an hour!\" So I said, \"Never mind. Never mind. Let me be crazy,\" I\nsaid. \"I'm doing it.\" So...and the girls was very appreciative. And so much so that...that\nMaria Elise, she said ...after a while she said, \"Tell me, Magda. How could you survive\nbeing so human under such unhuman circumstances? I don't believe I could. I don't believe\nI could.\" So anyway, now I just give you a little backwards, forwards. After fifty years I\nfound out her name is Maria Elise Cohen, and I found out her address. And before I went\naway, I wrote her a letter. Because, you see, it works and I have to run backwards and\nforwards. It...1t takes two to tango. It's always working. You help somebody, it gets back\nto you. But I come back to that later. Just remind me; because I want to tell you when I was\nin the Barrack 10, the experimental block. So one of the girl...woman, of the French woman,\nwas chosen to be a doctor for these experiments. But she was the only one who refused to\ndo unnecessary operations. And she said...you know, like when we promise so to be a\ndoctor, so we are helping the others. And she's not going to do any operation which makes\nwrong. And not anesthetic...without anesthetic. If she can repair something which a woman\nhas, that she do. But not to make terrible things what they do. So they said, \"And you know\nwhat you are getting for it?\" \"Whatever I getting, I am taking it.\" So they said, \"All right.\nNow you are going to be placed in the Straf bunker... kommando.\" Which means a\n\"punishment kommando.\" But her being a doctor--tall and slim--she wouldn't survive a day.\nBecause those sadists would just make a toy out of her, because she was so clumsy probably\nin this work what she has to do there. So I got in touch--and it was always ways,\nunbelievable ways--to this woman who was in charge of report writer. And I said, \"Look,\nthis woman, Doctor Adelaide Hautval, is on the way to go to this Kommando. Please\ntransfer her quickly somewhere else, because she won't survive.\" So she transferred her...on\nthe way coming, she transferred her to that Revier. But the next day went a transport with\nFrench woman to Ravensbriick. So she added her quickly so nobody knew about her\nexistence. I didn't know about her existence for many years. Once I been 1n Israel, and there\nis a forest on honor of people. And I said to my husband, \"Let me have a look there at trees.\"\nHe said, \"There are hundreds of trees! What are you going to look for?\" I said, \"Never\nmind. Just let me for one minute.\" Because, you know, men are sometimes so impatient.\nAnd the first tree I see 1s Dr. Adelaide Hautval. The tree is donated from France on her\nhonor. I said, \"B\u00e9la, B\u00e9la, come quickly! Make a picture here.\" And he made a picture of\nme, and there was Adelaide Hautval. So meantime, I got her address from Dr. Lore Shelley.\nI don't know if you heard about her; because she wanted to know our experimental block\nand I helped her. And so I asked her, \"Do you by any chance know the address?\" So she\nknew. So I wrote Adelaide Hautval, and I sent her this picture. And she was very pleased\nwith that picture. And she said that \"I was surprised, because you looked so well. So I wish\nyou everything the best in the future.\" And so...so we been in contact with each other, and\nunfortunately she died. But the family of hers send me the announcement of her death, and\nso I sent my sympathy. So you know, it's going backwards and forwards. It's...somehow it's\nentwined. And now if you want to know further on, I was there in the...1n the Lager C:'\u00b0 and\nsome women went on transport. They was chosen people who had good hands, in certain\nfactories. Who had good eyes, I had to bring always to the front because some specialists\nfrom this factory and this factory came. And I had to um send out runners: Who had good\neyes? Who can see well? Brought them there. And he selected so many, and they went--\nwho had good hands, they are good with the fingers. And so lot of transport went; but\nunfortunately, a lot of people went to the gas chamber. Which I couldn't, by all my strength\n'S This was the women's camp designated as B2c in Birkenau.\nand influence, I couldn't... Because Eichmann was here. Not I was the one who dictated\nthe...the running of world. Eichmann did. Anyway, so the Lager finished abruptly; and\nKramer came for me and he said, \"Now, come with me. I am going to take you and you are\ngoing to work hard.\" I said, \"Like all others.\" \"No, you are going to work harder.\" So I\nsaid, \"This is my fate. I am going to work.\" And imagine, he took me to the kitchen, and--\nthe lager kitchen--and he announced to the SS woman um...um Schultz... No, I don't say the\nname because maybe it comes back. And he said, \"Here I bring you a new kapo of the\nkitchen. She will be in charge.\" And she said, \"Fine.\" Franz. Did I said Franz before?\nFranz. Because we called her \"Franzka.\" Franzka. And um she had a sister there, too. She\nwas working somewhere else. And um I knew that there is a kapo, a German woman, who 1s\na lesbian friend--you know, because you knew those things--of a Lageraltester. A German\nwoman with a red triangle. And I said, \"If I take the position of her lesbian friend, how she\nwill handle the other woman? Because she will be mad; and mad on...on innocent people.\"\nSo I said to her, Franz...I said, \"Listen, I am not good in those things. I wouldn't even know\nhow to manage those things. She is doing a very good job.\" But I said, \"I would rather do\nthe counting out, the Lager office work. I'm good in that. I will count on the food. How\nmuch, so many.\" So she said, \"But what will the Lagerkommandant Kramer says?\" I said,\n\"He will be satisfied.\" Like he would tell me, you know. I said, \"He will be satisfied.\" So,\nin this case, he said, \"Go and do the counting.\" And I was in the counting; and another\nwoman who used to be in the kitchen in the C, she was suddenly here and she didn't have\nwhat to do. She said, \"Can you help me somehow?\" So I said to Franz, to this SS woman\nFranz, \"Listen. There is so much work. It's two camps to handle and a little bit too much for\nme. Could I have another help?\" \"Ah, have how many you need!\" \"No,\" I said, \"one will\ndo. And now I can count wonderful.\" People didn't know why they suddenly got double\nportions. (Laughter) Because I counted so many. But it didn't last long. With me, it never\nlasted. I felt very comfortable there. You know, we...we did the counting, and...and I was\nhappy to know that people are happy. Suddenly, they called my number to the front. When\nyou call the number to the front, that meant that you are going to the Politisch [NB: the\nPolitisch Abteilung] and probably did something terrible, and they are going to kill you. All\nthe girls said goodbye. They kissed me, hugged me. And I went to the front; and here again\nKramer with his black car. And he said, \"Sit in the car.\" I sat in the car. So now, he said,\n\"Tell me what did you...\" It's a German expression: \"ausgefressen\" [Trans: \"chewed out\"\nor \"finished\"; colloquialism] Which means, \"what did you do wrong?\" What is special,\nmore than wrong. And I said, \"I did always to the best of the people and the running of the\ncamp.\" And he repeated it hundred times, and hundred times I said the same thing. And\nnow when we went to...in the car, so if he would go straight then that means he would take\nme to the crematorium. Suddenly, I see that he wents in. And that was again to the Camp C,\nwhere I was. Why I was afraid that when he said that \"What did you do wrong,\" because I\nstill had the letters which I didn't have time to deliver. And I thought they found the letters,\nand now the punishment will be gas chambers. But no...because he said, \"Step out. [Ranken\n(ph)].\". And he said once more, \"What did you ausgefressen?\" And I said, \"I did to\neverything to the best of the camp and the people.\" \"Is that so?\" \"Yes, that's so.\" \"So here\nyou will be Lageraltester again, but you will have a Weberei.\" That means, a Weaving\n[Room]. They...they will be weavers in the camp. So I became again Lageraltester.",
        "Q: We must stop. OK. The tape has run out...has ended. We are going to break.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nTAPE #4\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: OK. Weare back. Um, Madga, would you tell us about being returned to Lager C?",
        "A: Yeah. As I mentioned it before, I was um returned by Kommandant um Kramer to Lager C.\nAnd there was a Weberei. We been for a while there. And in another Lager, in another\ncamp next to us a... It was emptied the camp. And there was a Lagerfthrerin, her...her name\nDanz, was her... And she was a terrible brutal woman. But the camp was emptied. And also\nthe girls, whom she was working with, um was free. So she thought she will put me down,\nand she will put the other girls on and herself. And she is push...and she pushes Grese out,\ntoo. So, yah. She came to the camp; and she says, \"Magda, you are not Lageraltester\nanymore.\" And she was watching me what I will say, I will beg for it. But I said, \"That's\nalright.\" So she said I will be um somewhere in a barrack. I accepted it. And the other girls\ncame on, with her together. But she was even more brutal than...than Grese; because she\nwas running like crazy all over the camp with the whip, and whipping left and right. I was\nvery sorry that is happening, but I had no way to stop her from it. But there was a German\num prisoner, and who was really a...with a black triangle which he was a thief sometime.\nBut he was sitting many years there. And he was saying there to a young girl, who he\nsometimes he rested in...1n her barrack; because it was the last barrack on the camp, and he\nused to come with the kommando there. And he had different privileges, so he asked if he\ncould rest there. And he told to that girl, \"I will fix her! Madga is coming back, and that's\nit!\" So it was really lasting three days. And after three days, I was back. Back again 1n the...\nlike...like Lageraltester. But it didn't last um very long, because it was coming already close\nto the march of January 18th [1945], when the death march started. But...and may I...?\nBefore I go with the death march, I have a few interesting things which I forgot. First of all,\nin Lager C--the first time--it was in one...1n two barracks was concentrated all the young girls\nwho was from fourteen 'til about seventeen. And in one of the barracks--and Mengele who\ncouldn't, you know, stand such beautiful girls, Jewish girls, being there. So just when one of\nthe barracks was emptied, either part went on transport or the other part into the crematoria,\nhe asked to transfer all the barrack from one block to Block 3. And there, at night, they\nsupposed to come for them to be gassed. He put there, in the front of the barrack, a post\nman. Not a post man--a SS man who was...he didn't have a big...a big function, you know?\nJust a ordinary man, who should um be there on watch. When I heard what happening, so I\nwent together with the report uh writer of mine. And I said, \"What can we do to save those\nchildren? After all, from no reason whatsoever, from there one day or 'nother they should be\ngassed. This is our future, if there will be a world. We need that generation!\" So I said,\n\"You know what? We are going to approach this man. And we will have a little chat with\nhim.\" Because it was already after the \"appell,\" the counting; and in the camp was no other\nSS man but him. So I started to talk with him. And I said, \"How are you\" and so so. And he\ntold me that he is going...tomorrow morning he is going to the Siberia, to the front. I came\nwith the news together, and said \"Oh, here is our chance. We have to do something.\" So she\nsaid, \"What?\" \"We have to get somewhere a bottle of schnapps and make him drunk.\" So\nwe found a bottle of schnapps. Matter of fact, at that girl's place where the German with the\nblack triangle used to rest. And he left a bottle, so next day he should drink. We...we\nsearched all the barracks 'til we came to that barrack, and there we find. So I said, \"Gerda,\n...\"\" She was...that was her name. \"...Go there with a cup and tell him, 'Have a little um\ndrink. Tomorrow you are going to the front. Be a little bit merry.\" So he had a little drink.\nAfter a while, I went and offered him a little drink. Again, Gerda. The fourth time, I gave\nhim the whole bottle. I said, \"Look, be merry! What...you know what happens. Forget the\nworld.\" He was already a little bit tipsy, so he didn't need much. And when he drank the\nbottle, he fell asleep. You know, he slammed down and fell asleep. I said, \"Gerda, that's our\noppor...opportunity.\" I went to the back of the barrack--which I told you there supposed to\nbe like a wash room, but wasn't. I knocked on the door. They opened the door, and I said,\n\"Shhhh...\" And I put the girls down in the five, about hundred a time. And then I just went,\nand I put the girls in every barrack. I said, \"You have hundred girls more tomorrow on your\ncounting, and don't say anything.\" And so by the hundred I took them, and I divided them\nall over the camp. And we left. When everybody was divided, we just left the barrack,\nclosed the door; and we went to bed. 'Til today, we didn't know how it is possible that\nnobody was claiming the girls and nobody claimed anything. If they killed the man, or they\nsent him to the Siberia anyway. What happened, we don't know. But one thing I know:\nthat in this way, we saved the eight hundred girls. And the eight hundred girl... Yah, just\nwith that thinking how can we overcome and play out at Mengele. Because I was so mad at\nhim that he did it. Anyway, but um later it was very interesting that... Um now I have to\njump ahead. On that death march when we been already um going towards Malchow,\u201d but I\nwill come back to it. So an SS man, in a orderly manner, approached me. And I don't know\nfrom what reason he asked me, \"What are you from profession?\" I said, \"My goodness me!\"\nI said, \"We are going to Malchow. What do I need to have profession?\" \"No, no. I need,\nbecause I have forty young girls here. And I want you to be in charge of the forty girls.\"\nAnd that was a part of those forty girls. Where the other girls are, I don't know; but I just\nrecently heard that they are still... A few of them, I don't know where else or how many, are\nliving in Israel. So this is the one thing which I thought I will mention; because it was not\nsuch a easy thing. How when we went to sleep 'til we woke up, we thought, \"My goodness!\nIf they found out...\" But they didn't, thanks heavens. Then (cough) the other thing which I\nforgot. In Birkenau, one um day I was called again to the front. Always called to the front.\nAnd the Lagerkommandant said to me that a Russian um village is coming here as an\nexchange for the Russian...for the German generals. \"And we found in the papers that you\nare a kindergarten teacher, so you will take over this whole um Russian village except the the\nwoman between eighteen 'til thirty-five. The rest--the little babies, the pregnant woman, the\nwhole, the old ones--belongs.... Um, you will take them over.\" So I again open my mouth;\nand I said, \"In this case, if I have to take over Russian village who has to be exchanged for\nRussian general, so I want.\" And I put conditions. I said, \"I want them to be bathed daily. I\nwant them to have not to stand on the app...on the counting. I want to pick um sixteen girls\n'* Subcamp of Ravensbriick, located near Mecklenburg.\nout from the Russian woman to be my helpers. I don't want to them to stand \"appell.\" And I\nwant them to get the food of the German SS.\" You know, I was waiting; and I was thinking,\n\"Madga, you crazy?! What you are...(laughter) What you are asking? Who are you to\ndemand?\" And he said, \"OK. You get it.\" And so I got the Germa...the Russian village,\nwith the little babies to the old woman. And, naturally, didn't take them long to find out that\nthe...how the other people lived and how they lived. So they um...really, they admired me;\ncarried me around, took me to the...to the room. And they said they will take me to\n[batushka (ph)] Stalin. They take me to Russia to show me to Stalin. Thanks very much. I\ndidn't know then (laughter)... I didn't know what Stalin is, anyway. And so they stayed with\nme, and they was very grateful. One thing, which is a cruel thing of the Germans; that one\nday they gathered all the children from about um four or six, and they send them to\nGermany. And matter of fact, Grese, you see--who always was telling me things... She said,\n\"You know where they going? They are going to Germany, and they will be um...they will\nbe given away to um the farmers, who hasn't got children, for adoption. In a few years, they\nwon't even know they are Russians. And they, the parents, will have a new genera...new\nchildren.\" Anyway, and um also anoth...another occasion, Grese told me, \"You know why\nwe are putting Jewish woman in charge? With all the strength which you wouldn't want to, I\nknow. But imagine, if the war will be over and the Germans are losing, so they won't...they\nwon't remember the SS. But they ... Because they don't see them so often. But they will\nremember those girls with whom they been everyday, and who had such a hard position,\nwhen they are so hungry, thirsty and tired. And now comes a woman in charge; and maybe\nshe raises her voice or demanding. Her, they will remember! And that's what we want. We\nwant to be unknown. If we either um not succeed, but we do succeed.\" I tell you, she said.\nAnyway, this was the other thing. And now um coming back, um... So that was the\nRussians. I really did...um we went to [bombard (ph)], and they had a beautiful food. And\nimagine, the whole camp was saying, \"Magda is crazy! What she is doing, nobody can do\nthat like her! Demanded Russians should get the SS food, for the SS man!\" But anyway...\nThen we went on the march, which you heard it so many times displayed. So I'm not going\nto details, only...",
        "Q: I do want to hear your story.",
        "A: You want to...?",
        "Q: Yes I do.",
        "A: Yah, so when we went on the march. So um before we went, so they broke in the kitchen.\nAnd the girls, they took what they could; because they knew what...they didn't know how\nlong the march will be and where they are going. So they took some um salami, bread,\nmargarine, sugar and salt. And they went; but naturally who... The..the SS men was\nrunning away, because they knew the Russian are coming close. So they...yah, they was\nrushing us with all the speed possible, because they didn't want to be caught by the Russians.\nAnd anyone who...who moved down to fix her um shoes or bend down for something, they\nstraight away um put her to death. And my aim was: \"Girls, we in the front.\" Because in the\nback, they was shooting everybody. And um the girls was carrying the...that we found there\nsome rucksacks in the store room; and they, in the rucksacks they put the food. But it was\nheavy to run and to carry; so slowly, they threw most of the food away. And what I asked\nthem to keep is margarine and sugar, because this time we thought that this is the source of\nenergy. And so we marched, and we came to Ravensbriick. Ravensbrick...um we been put\non the floor, and there were just a huge tent. And in that tent, we been in without food, on\nthe floor--nothing, no mattresses, no blankets. The situation was terrible. I don't\nthink...many, many um lost their life. And I was very sick there. But, you see, again the fate\nwanted something. So I told you about the French woman who was so grateful to me, and\nthere was in Ravensbriick. Because they was, like I told you, intellectuals; and they was\nworking there in the offices. They found out that the Birkenau girls arrived. So... and they\ncame to the tent, and they looked for Magda. So they found me. They took me to them, and\nthey really brought me back to health. And they...they let me have [butna (ph)] wash. There\nthey feed me. They been...they gave me medicament. And so, 'til we had to march, I just\nwent to the roll call there. Otherwise, I been always in their barrack. (Cough). When it was\nthe time to march farther on, I was good again. But on the march, (cough) suddenly the\nGermans, they drove us to a empty um...like where the trees are. What is it? A...(cough)\n(Pause) Not a mountain, but where are the trees....",
        "Q: The trees...the hills? Trees, in the woods.",
        "A: Woods. They...they... Yeah, thank you. In the woods, and there was nothing. It was snow\nand freezing...just was an empty...empty barrack there. And they put us there, and they went\naway. And we been finishing nearly with that little margarine and sugar, which I every day\nmade a little bowl. And I divided to everyone which the group which I had. Like a hand\nwith the little chickens. I had always around me, you know, like a harem. Whom I couldn't\nhelp everybody, but whom I could. So it was getting to end, and we been very hungry. And\nI was um, you know, dozing away in the weakness. And suddenly I had a dream. And in the\ndream, my mother came. And she had a big dish, with fresh beautiful um cakes what you\nmake for Saturday, you know? From butter, butter and milk and little...round little cakes--\nlike roll-types. And I want to grab one in my dream, and she is pushing it always away.\nAnd I said Mom, \"I'm so hungry. Why you taking it away?\" She said, \"Because I want your\npromise.\" And I said, \"What is the promise?\" \"Promise me when you marry and you will\nhave children, you will bring them up as Jewish children.\" And I, in my dream I said, \"My\ngoodness, Mom! Where I am alive? Where I am married? Where I have children? What\nyou want that promise, when I am so hungry?\" She said, \"You can't have it 'til you don't\npromise.\" And so I said, \"Alright, I promise.\" In this moment, somebody's touching my\nshoulder. And I open my eye. And the Russian woman--like I told you, they been very\ngood--and they already heard that in the woods are people from the um from Ausch...from\nBirkenau. And they...and when she heard, she was working like a nurse in the SS hospital.\nShe made a big bowl of peeled potatoes, like potatoes in the peel. She wrapped that all over\nin blankets, and she was going through the woods and was looking for me. And she found\nme. And she said, \"Magda, I brought here food for you.\" And this was when I was just\nreaching with my hands in my dream. And here I have my hand like that, and she is petting.\nAnd I open it, and here she offers the fresh boiled hot potatoes. And we been...you know, it\nwas the biggest delicacy. And that really saved our life for a while again. And so I say that\nit's never...like when you do something good, you never know when you are getting um\nrepaid with some goodness again. And that was it. Then um we marched, um and we came\nto the place Malchow, like I said. So I had the forty girls there. But meantime, there was a\ngirl who knew me um a few years ahead and she knew how I was. So she said, \"The forty\ngirls can hand to somebody else. But there is um many like thousands um woman, and they\nneed somebody to take care of them.\" So I was exchanged, and I became there again block\noldest. And again I was explaining the girls that we have to keep together. We are to help\neach other, and we will survive. \"And...and I will try to do everything you should get food,\nand I will make sure that everybody...nobody is left over. I divide the food evenly.\nWhatever I have, you have.\" And so it it was for a while. And suddenly the news came that\nDanz is coming here. So...and I saw her again with the whip running around the camp. So I\nsaid, \"Oh, my goodness! What could we do to stop her?\" But she made the decision herself.\nThey needed a a woman who would um divide people to go to work; and they called\nArbeitsdienst--\"working in charge,\" or something.'\u201d So um everybody wanted to be in that\nposition, because it's not that bad position. I didn't. And she choose me. She choose me. So\nwhen she choose me, I [NB: she] said, \"You know why I choose you? Because I have a\nrespect for you.\" And I said, \"Do you?\" \"Yes. You remember when I put you down as from\nLageraltester, and pushed you down and you wouldn't be maybe alive now. And you didn't\nfor one moment say \"Why,\" or beg at me that I should give you the position or nothing. You\njust accepted and you been proud standing there. And...and I have respect from you, that\nyou weren't afraid and you didn't ask or you didn't bring me or you didn't want to bribe me,\nthat all...that I should put you on. So I.... am picking you for that position.\" So I said, \"Now\nI have the chance!\" There was, you know, in all positions like that camp or prison, there is\nalways that you are looking... reading from the palm and all things. So while she got\nacquainted with me again, she told me all her story: about a brother she has in Siberia, and\nhow she's worrying about him and all those things. And I listened, and I said, \"Now is my\nchance.\" I looked for one of those girls who was also reading for my palms, and I told her\nthe story about the Danz and her brother, and that. I said, \"You have to be very careful.\nWhat you know the facts, but you don't have to make it obvious. You have to just slowly,\ngradually... Because you have plenty time; because while you are occupying her, she's not\ntrying...running around with the whip around.\" So she went around. And she um told her\nthis and that. But it finished up that, \"Oh, your brother is worrying about you.\" \"What you\nmean?\" \"Because he is in the Russian front.\" \"How you know?\" \"I can see it in your hands.\nAnd he is worrying you.\" \"What you mean, \u2018he is worrying you?' You mean he's worrying\nthat the war is to the end, and that I am like I am, doing that to the prisoners, and he 1s afraid\nthat maybe I will get the punishment for it?\" And she said, \"I don't know what you mean,\nbut that's what is written in your hand. That he is very worried, and he is really thinking on\n'\u00b0 NB: Labor Service.\nyou with all his heart. And he loves you so much, and he's caring for you and he's scared for\nyou.\" So, that did it. Next... And I was keeping away, meantime; I didn't want to know.\nAnd then she calls me, and she said, \"Magda, this woman is wonderful. Do you know what\nshe told me?\" And that and that. So she said, \"You think I should stop going hitting people\non... on the...with the whip?\" I said, \"I don't know.\" I said, \"I don't know. Um, is that your\nbrother's wish?\" She said, \"It seems to be.\" So I said, \"I leave it to you.\" But it left her this\nway; but I thought maybe she would think it over, because... So I found somebody else.\nThere is...was a...is a girl, she lives in Melbourne. She's a very good portrait artist, not a\nprofessional but.... And I came to her the next day, before she has a chance to reading her\nwhipping again. And she said...I said to her that, um, \"Oh, I have a very good um portrait\nwriter ...um painter, who thinks you would be very good um to make a portrait about you.\"\n\"She...and she thinks I have the face for it?\" \"Definitely!\" I said, \"Definitely. Would you\nlike her to come, and...and she will make you a nice portrait. It, it...she doesn't want\nanything. Doesn't cost you anything. You just have to sit and see. If you like it, good. If\nyou don't like it...\". But I knew she would like it. So that was it. I kept her from the street\nagain. And I said to her--Edith is her name--I said, \"Don't rush with the...(laughing) with the\npainting. But always show her your progress, because then she is interested.\" And one day\nshe told me, \"You know, this girl. She's very good. She's doing a wonderful job. I wonder\nwhen she finish? I am really anxious to see how it will look.\" And anyway, then I said,\n\"You know, you better make it now quicker. Because um that would not be good.\"\nAnd...and so she finished the um portrait. And she was very happy with it. And you know\nwhat? She never used the whip again. And I was very happy because, you know, such a\nwhip. It wasn't just a whip. With inside, it was uh like...like iron, you know, a certain thing.\nIt was...outside it was leather, but inside... When you got whipped with it, it really hurted.\nAnyway, and meantime the war was getting closer. And again they was rushing us out from\nthe camp and they wanted to us to go closer...um deeper in Germany. And on the way, it\nwas...the population was moving backwards and forwards with their baskets and with their\nfurniture and everything. And suddenly some Russian girls arrived. Because they found out\nthat we are marching, and...and they thought I will be there. And they knew that the Russian\nare coming close. So suddenly they been there. And they said, \"Magda, we came to save\nyou. And we are going. We are partisans. We been partisans, and we know how to hide a\nperson in the woods. We will make like a little hut for you, and we will hide you. Because\nwhen the Russian will come--which we have heard that they are very close--there, first of all,\nthey will rape you all...um like not one, but all. And then if somebody pointed that you been\nin function, then they will kill you. And I want to have a chance...we want to have a chance\nto explain who you are, and then we take you out.\" So first, I...1 was arguing; because I was\nthe hand with that little chickens. So I argued, and I said, \"I want to take girls to hide.\" She\nsaid, \"Magda, you ask the impossible! How...then we had to make a real...not a [place to]\nhide, a bungalow. A bungalow! So we can't do.\" Anyway, on the end, three. Three we\nmanaged, and they really hide us in the woods. They made branches, and so we been inside\nlike in a cocoon. And the Russians soon arrived. Meantime, before they arrived they um\nstopped in a... Uh where ...where they made um flour. No, how you call it?",
        "Q: In a mill?",
        "A: In a mill. And in the mill, they was... They run away, the Germans; but there was a store\nroom of everything what you think. In the cellar: food, meat, everything. They had supplies\nfor years there. Anyway, so they always brought us something to eat. Meantime the\nRussian arrived. And they settled in this mill, because it was so big. And they settled in; and\nthe girls, they used the opportunity to slowly brought them to the idea that...about me, and\nthat how now they was explaining how I was to them and like a mother, like a this, like that.\nAnd when that was explained, so they came to pick us up. And when they came to pick us\nup, so they put us to the head table. And, you know, was like personality plus I was. And\nwhen I wanted to help to cooking, you know, how because there was a lot of... So he said,\n\"No.\" You know the Russians said, \"Nyet.\" You know how they said, \"Nyet. You sit down.\nYou have the celebrity. You did a very important thing for our Russians. Now the...let the\nothers work.\" So that was that. But naturally they had to continue their journey; and we\ncontinued, too. And then we came to a place, and um where all the Czechoslovakian people\ngathered. And now they started to bring them with the trucks back to Czechoslovakia, 'cause\nit wasn't very far. But I can't tell you the place, which is not important. Anyway...but what\nhappened: there was a lot of Hungarian girls, and the Hungarian girls went on the\nrampaging, you know, in the houses and... How you call it? Um, stealing the jewelry and\nthen the bed and carpets and everything. So the Czech girls, they said um they are very\nupset about those girls and they don't want with those girls to go home. First of all, the\nRussians wanted them to send to Siberia and to work, or to the harvesting. So and they came\nto me: \"Magda, listen. They are sending us to harvesting! We want to go home, and see\nwhat...if somebody is alive. And we work enough. We don't want again.\" So I went to the\ncommander; and I spoke by the time, you know, very well Russian. And I told them, \"They\nare not your enemies. They... they been Jews. That's why the um Hungarians threw them\nout. Now you want them...to send them to work to Russia, because they are enemies of...of\num...like of the Russians. Like they are like friends with the Hungarian! They are not\nHungarians. They are Jews who suffered because they are Jews.\" So they...he said, the\ncommander, \"Yes, you right.\" Then they wanted to send the girls to work in the meat\nfactory. So again they came. \"Magda, what we are going to do? They send us to the meat\nfactory!\" So I again went to the commander. And I said, \"Look. They are girls who live\nthree, three and a half years, two years concentration camp. And now you want them to\nwork here? Isn't that enough German woman here who was living here in comfort? Take\nthem!\" And he said, \"You're right!\" And so I saved those also. But then they didn't want to\ntake the Czechoslovakian girls home, the Jewish girls. So a woman, like a older woman,\nfrom my hometown, she said, \"Magda, you have to do something or they will leave us here.\nThey will take the Czech people, and be...leave us here under the Russians and between the\nGermans. What will be our fate, I don't know. You have to do something. You have to go\nto the Committee of the Czechoslovakians.\" And... and I said, \"Please leave me out. I was\nsweeping enough. Let somebody sweep.\" And, you know, that's a song like that... (singing)\n\"that I sweeped already enough.\" Anyway, so she said, \"But this is the last time you have to\ndo something.\" So I went there...(laughter) I went there to the Committee; and I said, \"I\nheard that you are sending away the Czech girls, but you are not sending the Jewish girls.\"\nAnd...and he said, 'We haven't got enough trucks.\" And I put my hand on the table, and I hit\nthe table so that the papers all jumped up. And I said, \"If I would be a cousin of President\nBene\u00a7S, then would be trucks for me. But because I am not, I am only a Jewess who was a\nvery good citizens for the Czechoslovak Republic. We been honest and right citizens, and\nyou threw us out like rubbish. And now, after the war, you don't take us back? This 1s not\nfair.\" And he got up; and he says, \"I am the cousin of President Benes.\" And I said, \"Then\nyou are going home. But we are going to stay here?\" And he looked at me and he says,\n\"The first trucks which arrive, you will be on it.\" I came there; and they say, \"Oh, Magda,\nyou saved us again!\" And that's how it finished up. And that goes the story now, which 1s\nnot important, how I meet my husband.",
        "Q: No. I'd like to hear that.",
        "A: You would like to hear it? So we arrived in Prague, and I announced right away I want to\nPalestine. I didn't...I didn't even think on B\u00e9la, or something. But I thought, \"I am going to\nPalestine. I'm not staying in this place where they threw me out like dirty linen.\" So while I\nam signing all the papers I am going to Palestine and everything, from far away--because it\nwas a huge room and there was hundreds of people there--somebody screams. I know he\nwas a doctor, and I know from what town he is. And I don't know how he knew; but he says,\n\"Bela is alive!\" B\u00e9la is alive. Fine. And um...and he said, \"You should go after him.\" But\nhe screamed that over hundreds of people, you know. (Laughter) He screamed, \"Ah...\"\nAnd I...you know, I listened to that. And so I...he told me, while...while he told me that I\nshould look after him. And he told me that he has a sister in a certain place, the first thing I\nshould go there. When he came home, then...",
        "Q: Which...which...which \"he's are we talking about?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: We're talking about B\u00e9la?",
        "A: B\u00e9la! When B\u00e9la came home to Prague, so girls told him on the station, \"Magda is home in\nher home town.\" Everyone told him that Iam home. They saw me here. They saw me\nthere. They saw me there, and they saw me there. So as he heard that I am home, so off he\nwent to my hometown. Meantime, because he said the first thing I should go to his sister's\nplace, so I went there. I am coming there; and they said, \"But he is looking for you in your\nhometown!\" Anyway...so I was there a few days, and then I went to my hometown. I'm\ngoing home, and he is coming back. (Laughter) When he came back and found that I went\nhome, so he wrote me a letter. And I should straight away come, because he... So...so I\ncame back to _ilina, was the name; but I felt very awkward to live at his sister place, who\ndidn't know me ever. And...and I had there some friends from my hometown, so I went to\nlive there. I thought, ''Til B\u00e9la comes home, I don't want strange people.\" But his nephew,\nwho was twelve years old, he came to pick me up. And he said, \"You know, Magda, my\nuncle loves you very much.\" (Laughter) He 1s...he was a tall boy for twelve. And he says,\n\"And he is the best man on the world. So please don't run away from here, because he will\nbe very unhappy. So come with me, and wait till he 1s coming home.\" And that child didn't\nmove 'til I didn't go with him. And he was going with me to swimming, to exercise, to um\nthe pictures, whatever, 'til B\u00e9la did came home. And so then I...that night I stayed at their\nplace, and at night B\u00e9la came home. And then he saw me, he grabbed me in his hand, run\naround in...in a...in the... Because he was happy. And that's we...how we met; and the rest is\nnot so important anymore. But that's how we met anyway. And um that, matter of fact, I\nthink finishes up. Because there was so many other stories, which I go away for hours. But\nI think the most you heard. You heard enough.",
        "Q: When did you--just tell us, briefly--after the war about when you and B\u00e9la married and when\nyou moved to Israel and then to...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Just bring us through to the United States.",
        "A: Yeah. When, when we...when we met then, then I said, \"I'm not going to stay here. We\nhave to move away from here.\" So we went first up to Prague, and we booked in the hotel.\nHe, meantime--that's why he went away, because he wanted to earn a few...few crowns that\nhe would have. And because for those who been in camp, there was a possibility to get\nsomewhere...like to settle, to start. A new start, because we didn't have a penny. So, so we\nwent. But B\u00e9la, being as he was--broken down, lost his wife and child--and something broke\nin him. He didn't have that really business sense, or... So he didn't pick a big factory, or big\nshop or whatever. He picked a little...in a little town. On the end of the town, a little house\nwhich used to here have a woman whose husband was working and she was doing the\nrepairs and meantime she was selling something. A little... So when...when I saw that what\nhe choosed--because he wanted away from people, you know? He suddenly didn't want to\nsee many people. So I...I told myself, \"That little place! Couldn't he pick something bigger,\nthat we should have a chance?\" Because it was all empty. We had to run away for material,\nand...and get things done. And ...and you know that place had stairs like that. Spiral stairs.\nSo I had run up and be in the shop and cook. And...and...and sometimes customers came in,\nand...and I was running down. And I said, \"Don't worry. You can't touch anything, because\neverything is on wire. And when you touch anything, it's...(laughter) it's um ...the bells are\nringing upstairs. So, and tell 1t to everybody,\" I said. Sometimes I had to go up; but I know,\nand then I know. And, you know, you can tell people and they believe you. And they\nbelieved me. Anyway, so they didn't touch anything. And um so we started to work it up.\nBut, you know, because really with hard work and with friendliness, with our personality, we\nbrought people from...from the town to the end of the town. And so we started to do a little\nprospering. And then I was um pregnant with my first child...was our first child. And when\nI was in hospital even... This time, in Czechoslovakia, they made, you know, from feathers a\nlittle...like um feather [bed] and this is like--like I said--like a wurst, and here it gets over and\nyou have to attach things. And the baby is inside; and here is lace around. And when Maya\nwas born, so baby...B\u00e9la made it up and brought in. And there was a woman who didn't\nhave that thing, and she liked it very much. So B\u00e9la said, because he was so happy, he will\nmake [for] her. But then it come to pay, because he didn't have it for nothing. So worked\nout that her husband is a very high um in this business to checking everything; and...so he\ndidn't want to pay. And when B\u00e9la demanded he should pay, so he send a committee and\nthey gave us a punishment. A financial big punishment. Imagine! I said, \"B\u00e9la, you see\nhow it happens. When you're good and good-hearted, somebody--not that he doesn't say\nthank you because you made it for his child. He makes us all our saving and our hard work\nwent on...on it.\" And here we been, and somebody on top of it was jealous because we\nbrought all the customers there. He wanted that shop. So they took away the shop. So then\nI went again to Prague to demand that what happened, and with no reason they took it away.\nSo we gave another shop. But now was the question that they wanted...it came a change,\nand they wanted B\u00e9la to be a member of the Communist Party. He didn't want to be. So\nthey closed him out from the party, without being in the party. And they said...again they\ntake all the business away, because if he is not a member... So I said, \"What you mean?\"\nThey said, \"You can have it, if you divorce him.\" So again...so we had a lot of bad luck like\nthat. The fate wanted to see how much I can endure. And naturally then we got another\nlittle... I was running after this member and this member, and we got another little business.\nBut B\u00e9la had to travel, and it didn't bring much money.",
        "Q: When did you go to Israel?",
        "A: And then I decided...I said, \"Look. You...you are not a communist. And whatever will be,\nthey will find out a reasons of you.\" And they was...did find out. They said that he wants to\noverthrow the government; which I said, \"I didn't know he was so smart.\" (Laughter) I said\nthat to that man who...who said it. \"I didn't know my husband is so smart.\" You know, I\ncould always talk. But um...but that didn't help me. And then Israel started, so I said, \"We\nare going to Israel.\" All my life, I wanted to go. All my friends and relatives said, \"In this\ntime, beginning with a baby of one and a half and three, you are going to Israel? You know\nwhere you will live? In tents on the sand.\" I said, \"I don't mind. Israel was um born, and we\nbelong there.\" They said, \"But you can't...you can come with us first to Australia, and then\ngo to visit Israel when you made already money.\" And I said, \"If everybody would say it,\nwhere would Israel be?\" So I think, \"I'm going:\" and we went. And naturally we was being\nin the camp in the tents. Wasn't the best thing. So the only thing was that I...I uh said that I\nwant a kindergarten job. So I went to the directress, and I said, \"Would you give me a\nkindergarten job?\" And she said, \"Can you speak Hebrew?\" I said, \"A few words.\" But he\n[NB: she] said, \"So how do you want to be a kindergarten teacher?\" I said, \"Did Danny\nKaye talk with all the children, with all the nations which he didn't know the language? So I\nwill be!\" So she looked at me. \"I give you a chance. I go in that camp, and I take all the\nteachers out and the helpers. And you go in. If you survive ten minutes, you get it.\" I went\nin; and in ten minutes, the children was on the floor and on top of me. And we been\nlaughing and giggling. So she say, \"Ah, have it!\" She made, \"Oh, have it.\" So that's how I\ngot ajob. And I need a job most of it because the food wasn't made for Europeans. It was\nmade for Africans. And for a little baby of one and a half, she started to get sick. But then\n[...as I was on the staff, so I got the food of the staff. And, you know, a mother is never\nhungry when it comes to it. And I said, \"Could I take the food to her home, when I will be\nhungry?\" She said, \"By all means. Take it!\" And so I brought the food home, divide it\nbetween the children and B\u00e9la, and what was left was mine. I was so skinny...",
        "Q: We need to move a bit. When did you come to Australia?",
        "A: Um first...and then we went to live in um Holon. And then again I put um my furniture out,\nbrought a kindergarten in; and then again the kindergarten out and the furniture in. And B\u00e9la\nhad to go always to the military service, which he didn't like very much because he wasn't as\nyoung anymore. And one stage, he was there for a month. And it was terrible; and they\nbeen attacked and then it was it was wet and everything. And meantime, my cousins from\nAustralia send the papers. \"Come to Australia.\" And B\u00e9la came home. He said, \"Send the\npapers.\" My cousins wrote, \"You have to wait anyway for two years, so...so then send it\nquick as possible.\" We send the papers; but a fluke luck, in six weeks we had the papers to\nmove. So that's...1n'65 we went to Australia. But again, without a penny; because the place\nwhat we had we sold, and that was just enough for our journey. We arrived again penniless.\nSo, again a hard time. Hard time all the time. But I never lost faith. We brought our\nchildren up in a very good way, and they are...they... Because they had to work. They had\nto help me to clean to the place where the children... And they helped. They had to wash the\nfloors. And the neighbors said they know better the bottom of my children than the faces.\n(Laughter) And that's happened.",
        "Q: Magda, thank you. You had a statement you wanted to read.",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "Q: We wanted to know the effect of the war on you, and I think your statement does that.",
        "A: Yah. Must still be a little wet. Yeah. Can I take my glasses?",
        "Q: Sure can.\nPAUSE",
        "A: (Reading from paper) My number is 2318. Under this number, I survived and endured\nunbelievable dehumanizations, beatings, screams. I suffered all kind of sicknesses. I had\nmalaria. My Lager sisters took me to the Revier (kind of hospital), so I could at least rest a\nlittle. But rats been running around me, biting on my toes. So I asked my lager sisters to\ndischarge me rather to the barrack. The same day, unfortunately, the whole Revier been sent\nto the gas chambers. I had typhoid, and all different sicknesses. As a consequence, I lost my\neyesight, my hearing. I couldn't walk. I was many times close to be sent to the gas\nchambers. By one occasion, I was one the track together with other victims on the way to\nthe gas chambers. Against all the odds, I lived through three and a half years; first in\nAuschwitz, then in Birkenau. My hair been cut many times, with blunt scissors so after my\nhead was always bruised. On a chair, (looking up) I was telling you already that, (reading\nfrom paper) um while laughing men been cutting or shaving everywhere where hair was. On\nSS order, all my possessions were taken away. And I was dipped in murky water in large\nbins, ten at a time. Then I stood wet and naked, shaking in the wintery cold \u2018til I got\nremnants after the Russian prisoner of wars. Cotton pants and top. On mine, all the buttons\nbeen missing; so I have to hold the top and bottom with my hands, not to lose them. And a\npair of wooden clogs. Before I start to tell my story, I wanted to mention this part as a start.\nBecause there are people, some writers, professors, scientist, who from unbelievable reason\ntry to deny that the Holocaust existed. They try to say Holocaust was only a hoax.\nUnfortunately, all the barbarism of the German SS, sadism, deceiving, the cruelty, was true.\nBelieve me. Often I feel I should ask from all those people why are they doing it. Wasn't\nthere enough our suffering? And now, on top of...on top those people claiming it should\nhave the last laugh? And a lot of followers? So I turn to you, all parents, to all the teachers,\nprofessors, scientists, preachers, priests, rabbis. Educate the children, the people, about those\nhorrors that the German nation under the Nazi system did to all other nations, not only Jews.\nI been witnessing that, nobody was excepted...exception. (Pause) Make the wrong right.\nBe understanding and helpful to those survivors. It's not right not to talk about it for shame\nor frustration. Some will say, \"It happened a long time ago--forty-five, fifty years ago. Let's\nforget it.\" But on the other side, they continue on thousands of places to preach two\nthousand years history about the Golgotha. Don't believe those so-called professionals\nwhose informations are coming from, to me, unknown sources who have the reason and own\ninterests. And who, for a lot of money, tried to persuade the world about the non-existence\nof the gas chambers. But would and could you, and you, and you, forget it, if you would live\nthrough all the horrors which changed your life, your career? We're tormented by\nnightmares. When you close your eyes, you relive the misery again and again. So you don't\neven go to sleep. And how about the millions and millions of babies, young, innocent\nchildren, people young and old? So, please! Don't minimize the Holocaust as a old story.\nBut try to work against it, that happenings like the Holocaust shouldn't have ground to\nhappen again ever. (Looking up) Finish. That's it.

        "A: My parents. My husb...my father was a teacher of Jewish history. My mother was a very\nnice woman. He was...she was a real Jewish mother, who worked and cooked and baked and\nhad a garden. So we had all the fruit and vegetable. And she helped all the poor, where they\nneeded. So I saw already at home what it means to be helpful to others. That's how I was\nbrought up.",
        "A: Yes, we had brothers. But I haven't a...didn't have so much contact with my brothers;\nbecause there, in a small town, little children went to learn Jewish history early in the\nmorning. Then we went to school. And then, as a only daughter between the four boys, it\nwas somehow different. I had my...my group of children; but sometimes we played, boys\nand girls, together. But mostly I had my own crowd of...either at, at school or after school.",
        "A: My childhood was a very nice childhood, because my father was um--like I told you that--\nJewish history teacher. And every night, I couldn't get asleep. You know, like you tell\nstories for children? He told me always the stories about the history, because he was\nstudying in Frankfurt-am-Main; and he knew and visited all the places that the Jewish\nhistory was around. And so he told me the travels and all the stories what happened; and that\nwas very interesting. And so, before I go to sleep, I crawled in his bed and he told me those\nstories; and then I fell to sleep. And they had to carry me out from bed. And um as a matter\nof fact...because this time wasn't a kindergarten when I was a little girl. So I always went\nwith my father to the school; and I was listening to the stories. And the children, you know,\nthey was spoiling me rotten. (Laughter) And um when I grew tired, so my father asked one\nof the children to take me home. Because I was just a child. I was a very bad eater. I was\nvery skinny; but I already, as a young child, always worried about the poor. And I came\nhome to my mother, and I said, \"You know, Mom, I saw...I been at my neighbor's pla...our\nneighbor's place. And they are so poor. They haven't got anything. And it's Shabbat\ncoming, and they haven't got meat and fat and sugar and coffee and tea. So I am not going to\neat, but please give them.\" My mother said to my father, \"We have so much trouble for her\nto put a spoon of food in her mouth, (laughter) and she says she's not going to eat!\" So I\nmanaged that this way, already as a young child, that we went to the families. I was talking\nwith the lady of the house while my mother put it in the pots the food; because they was very\nproud to accept it. And that was the start of my childhood, and that's how I grew up helping\npeople and helping the neighbors. And I always said I will be a doctor, because this is also\nhelping the chil...the people. And later in my life, um there came from Poland some Hebrew\nteachers. And they came to the place where we girls was playing. And he introduced us a\nHebrew songs and dances. And that's what happened, that they put us first in this way. That\nin...we just played around in the place where one of the children lived; but later he\ntransferred us--like Jewish scouts--in a place which they called [Ma'adon (ph)], which means\n[louder (ph)]. And there I started to get to know with the history and what they want to try to\nmake: that they should be in a Jewish state, we should have a home our own. And so it\nstarted my youth. And I was very much involved; and...because if they...1n a certain\norganization, they found out somebody's willing and able, naturally they use. And I didn't\nmind it. I was sent out to start a new organization of Jewish scouts. And as a young girl, I\nhad the idea that's the only way how you can start an organization, gather them under a flag.\nSo I was very capable. I must say, today I don't even know how I did it. But I approach the\nall the right sources. I approached the teacher who was a sewing teacher, and I asked her if\nshe would sew the emblem of, the scout's emblem, on the flag. I approached a man who was\nselling material if he would donate that for us. Which he did. Then I had the idea that, you\nknow, to have golden nails with their names, which they donate. And...and the man who did\nit, he was doing it for...like for charity; but the one who had the nail written in the pole, he\nhad to pay for it. So...and also I arranged a very nice evening with children--dancing and\nsongs and a theater. And so a lot of money came together.",
        "A: Yeah, all for the Keren Kayemeth [and Keren] Hayesod.' And you know what? I tell\nmyself I been very smart, because the collection of the money--I started with the generals.\nThere was three military generals. And I approached the one with the list if he was willing\nto support the nail of...the golden nail; and voluntarily how much he was willing to give.\nAnd every general was very generous. Then I approach the others. But on the top of the list\nwas a huge amount, so nobody was... You know how it goes. And so things like that, I did\nalready. They always send me to another place to organize a evening like for Keren\nKayemeth. So I did all those things before I started; and I postponed my finishing my\n' Keren Kayemeth [L'Yisrael], known in English as the Jewish National Fund, and Keren\nHayesod (English name unknown) were established by the Zionist Organization in 1901 for the\npurpose of purchasing land in Palestine for Jewish settlement.\nstudying as a kindergarten teacher, because I thought it's very important. Somebody should\ndo it. And then I finished there; because, in our town, wasn't able...I wasn't able to study for\nkindergarten teacher because there wasn't school. So I did it privately, by myself. I went\npracticing to another town, where it was a kindergarten. And then I did my...finished my\nstudy by myself, and I did the exams in Bratislava. This was the special town in Slovakia.\nAnd so I became a kindergarten teacher. But even as a young girl, during the holiday... I\nreally don't know how, how...where did I get all those ideas? I said to my--I had a girlfriend.\nI said, \"Look at the children running around, and there is not a kindergarten. At least during\nthe holiday, let's open a kindergarten.\" And I approached there, there was a...we called her\n\"Gleich Mamma.\"\u201d That was her name; and she was in everything. And we said, \"What\nwould you say...the children is running around the streets, and if we would open a\nkindergarten?\" She said, \"I am totally behind you children. I arrange everything.\" And she\ndid. Because when she went, two o'clock from home she went... You know, her social life\nwas...She went through the city, everywhere she had somebody. She talked with somebody.\nIf we ask her husband, \"Where is Gleich Mamma?\" And he said, \"Wait a minute. Now it's\nsix o'clock. Two o'clock, she was there. Three o'clock, she was there. Three o'clock...now,\nit's six o'clock. She will be in the shop there and there.\" (Laughter) He knew exactly her\ntimetable. And she arranged everything. So during the school holiday, we gathered forty\nchildren. And there was a man who wanted to get married. And he had built a house, but he\nmarried in two months later. So she arranged he should let the house for us. And sand pits,\nand somebody made us the furniture. And we two young children... was, I has then my\nbirthday in August, and the school holiday in our place is June and July, August. So I was\ndoing it before I was even fifteen.\u201d",
        "A: When the real war came closer, I still...1 had my kindergarten. It's true that all the doctors\nand the lawyers, they were stripped from their um possibility to work. Because it's already\nstarted the war. And um...but I didn't have even to wear a...a yellow star; because my school\nbelonged, the Kinderheim [NB: children's home] belonged to the inspectorate of the other\nschools. So I, I...well, they didn't...they wasn't so strict on me. So I didn't feel much in our\ntown of the persecution, so far as that they lost all their jobs--the lawyers and everyone. And\nthey started to take away the businesses, and they put Arierstaters (ph)] in. That means\nsomebody had their eye on that job, and he was member of that...was a Hlinka guard--similar\nlike SS, or something--and so they took away the business from the Jewish men. And in\n*\"Gleich\" means equal or equivalent. Perhaps she was given this name because she was like a\nmother to everyone? \u201cMamma Gleich\u201d may also refer to Margit Gleich, who was active in the\nMichalovce community and a patron of the Zionist youth movements (she is mentioned in the\nMichalovce memorial book, published in 1969).\n* Since she was born in 1916, this would have been 1931.\ncame, without any um restitution or something for the...for the Jewish man, and he [NB: the\nJew] had to go out and he [NB: the Aryan] came in. So that was bad for them. And\num...and for me, it was... I don't know if we have time for it, but there was a shoemaker who\nlived in our vicinity, what he had a shop on the way where I went to the kindergarten. And I\nmade all my shoes there. He made me beautiful boots. And, really, top job. But what I\ndidn't know, that he fell in love with me. A father with a few children who lived in our\nneighborhood! And um every time I went to the kindergarten, he came out from the shop\nand he said, \"How are you\" and \"Good morning.\" And I thought it's just neighborly. One\nday, he came to the kindergarten; and he said, \"I want to protect you. In this way: that I will\nmake one child, whichever child that is, is your child. Because first now they are taking the\nyoung girls. And as you have a child, I can make that you are exempted from this um\ntransport.\" And I said, \"But why are you doing it? I haven't gotten a child.\" \"Can't you\nunderstand?\" I said, \"No.\" \"I am in love with you. I want to protect you.\" I said, \"And\nlater, when the children will have to go?\" \"Don't worry. I will protect you always.\" And I\nsaid, \"You mean, I should be your mistress?\" He said, \"Do I have to make it clear for you?\"\nSo...because I, I couldn't believe my eyes. But that's what he wanted. Naturally, I didn't\nwant it. I told my mother; I said, \"Isn't that funny? He's our neighbor, and he's my\nbootmaker. And he gives me such proposition!\" So I... \"What did you say?\" \"I said,\n'Thank you very much. You are really very nice. You mean it well. But,' I said, 'T couldn't.\nYou have a wife and children. How could you ask for me that?\" The same night, they came\nfor me. The same night they came for me; because he was so angry. Because he was\nwaiting that I will naturally say yes. But I didn't know...um, I wouldn't even... I can't believe\neven when I would know where I am going I would agree to it. But this time, they said to\nus...which they deceived us, and there was nobody to say something differently. They said\nwe are going to work in the Bata factory. So I said to myself, \"What's so wrong to go to\nfactory? So we will go to Bata factory.\" That's what I thought. Nobody ever said that there\nis danger. And then it came that um they gather us, they gathered us like at night. But me, I\nwas so sure that they will...I will be excepted...exempted as a kindergarten teacher. So I\nwasn't worrying about myself. I worried about others; especially, there was fathers whose\ndaughter was hiding somewhere and they took the fathers instead. So I worried about the\nold fathers; and um run around and gave them help. And I did get excepted um papers. But\nwhat happened, there is always somebody greedy. They knew I have the papers. And one\nwoman, a teacher, she bought my papers. She paid twenty thousand crowns, Czech crowns,\u201d\nfor the papers. And when my father...",
        "A: In the inspectorate was a...a man who was doing the papers. She paid him twenty thousand;\nso she got my papers. And my father found out and he went to the inspectorate...because he\nwas also in...like teacher, you know. So they say, \"My dear man,\" he says, \"the times are\nchanging. If you bring me twenty thousand crowns, I take it away from her, even if she paid\n* Czech: koruna. Official currency of Czechoslovakia.\nit already. And I give it back to your daughter.\" But my father didn't have the twenty\nthousand crowns. He was crying like a baby, saying it to somebody who after the war told\nme... He was crying, \"They tear the nicest flower out of my garden, but I can't do anything.\nI haven't got the money.\" Anyway, when we came on the train...so from our hometown, we\nwent on normal trains. And we came there, and the girls was dressed like peasants woman.\nYou know, because they lived in little villages. And I had my beautiful wardrobe. So I\nopened my suitcase and I dressed them all up. And there was a policeman--what they called\nthem gendarme, a gendarmerie, because they was Czech. They... they had the quarters in the\nsame street that we lived on the corner. So they saw me passing by, and they was always\nvery friendly. And he thought...said, \"I never happened to see something, that somebody\nshould give away all the clothes!\" I had only what I had on me. The dress, the coat and a\nmuff, and a bag. All the rest I gave out. I dressed up all the girls, because... He said, \"Why\nare you doing that?\" \"Because,\" I said, \"we are going to Bata factory. I want the girls to be\nrepresenting nice.\" \"How could you be so naive?\" I was...nobody taught us any other way.\nAnd he wanted to help me; so he took me...he said, \"I am taking you to say once more to say\ngoodbye to your parents.\" And he took me there, and I said goodbye. And I said to him,\n\"How about if I would now run away?\" And he said, \"Try.\" I didn't. I didn't, because I\ndidn't know what, how...how will L.. If...1f not today, they will take me tomorrow; so\nsomething, I thought... So I didn't run away. And also, when they took us on the train, we\narrived to a place, Poprad. And there it was already, you know, different; because there was\num all girls was gathered and it was such a chaos. And he said to me, \"I am taking you on a\ntrain which goes on a different direction.\" And I had a kindergarten help...in the\nkindergarten a helper; and I said, \"But I am taking the helper with me.\" Because um she was\nhelping me; and her brother, who is the headmaster--yah, of the school--he asked me, \"Look\nafter my sister.\" And I promised him. So he said, \"I don't mind. Take her with you.\" And I\nsaid, \"Look, let's stay here. Let's not go back, because this train goes the other direction.\"\nAnd matter of fact, I told him, \"And how about if we are not going back with you, we will\ncontinue with the train?\" And he said, \"Listen. I'll leave it on you. But if I come back and\nyou are here, I have to take you back.\" So I begged her. \"Ilonka,\" I said, \"let's go on the\ntrain, and let's continue.\" He [NB: she] said, \"No. I am afraid what will happen to me. Let's\nnot go.\" And I...again, naive as I am, I promised. And my word is a word. So when he\ncame, he said, \"Are you here? So I have to take you back.\" And he took me back. But he\nsaid, \"Write a few words. I'm going to give it to your parents. I will try one more thing,\" he\nsays. \"I have a uncle in the Ministeria, in the ministry. I will write to him to send papers to\nyou that you are excep...exempted.\" And he did. Because it was that we are staying there\ntwo days; but to me...my bad luck, we went the same day. So, so much so I know, that he\ndelivered the letter to my parents. And in the letter, he said that I will be a nurse wherever I\nare going. So \u2018til my parents was alive, they thought I...wherever I go, lam aanurse. That's\nhow we came. And now it started. They put us in cattle tru... You know, you call it?",
        "A: Yah, and now it started the misery; because there wasn't possibility to breathe, we were in so\ntogether. And also the toilet question was also a question. I managed one thing; that\nbecause there was just a little window on top, you know, I asked the girls to lift me up.\nBecause I knew where we passing by there is a working camp for Jewish sol...they been\nsoldiers, but they had already a different uniform--not green, but blue. So in a...in Hebrew, I\njust said, \"They are taking all...us in cattle trains. We don't know where.\" Because he\nsurvived, and he told me that he told everybody about it. But they couldn't help us. We\narrived in the camp. And here came the SS with the dogs, with the scream...\"Raus! Raus!\nLos! Los! [Ger: \u2018Out! Out! Go! Go!\"]\" So beating us, hitting us. So this was the first\nintroduction in the camp.",
        "A: In... On...",
        "A: Now in in the first, first thing they didn't select us. No. The first thing, it was that they put\nus to a...a barrack. During the night, we...we didn't know what happened. Just screams.\nAnd we been there during the night. And as we traveled so long, we been very dehydrated.\nThe German woman prisoners--who consisted mostly of prostitutes and murderers and\nthieves--they delivered their tea, but they said, \"It's poisoned.\" They delivered the food, and\nthey said, \"It's poisoned.\" So here we been dehydrated and hungry, and we didn't know what\nto do. So I volunteered. I said, \"Listen, girls, we have to do something. We can't last so.\nWe are dried out.\" Because we didn't get water for days. So I said, \"I'm going to drink it. If\nI don't come back 1n half an hour, that mean it's poisoned. The same thing I will do with the\nfood. Then you will know it's poisoned.\" But it was bad...I ate and vomited it, because it\nwas so bad. I hold my nose up, because it was all rotten. But it was still a little bit warm. I\nsaid, \"Girls, Iam here. We have to drink it. We have to eat something. Otherwise we lose\nour [thanks (ph)].\" That's how it started.",
        "A: In Auschwitz. In Auschwitz there was red barracks. And it was a little bit normal, because\nthat was um beds--not bunks. And the next day, they took us; and we been standing in the\nfreezing cold. And some girls collapsed. I was saying, when they asked us \"Los! Los!\nLos!\"--I said, \"Girls, let's run. Let's run and let's be obedient. Maybe that will help us.\" So\nwhat happened, I was the first in the room; but when the girls collapsed...so I asked\nsomebody to help me to put them somewhere 'til they recovered from collapsing from cold\nand from...from stress. So that's why my number is not 2000, but 2,318; because so many\ntimes I run with the girls to help. I was really physically very healthy, sport-minded. And\nate the right foods--a lot of fruit from the trees what we had in the garden. I ate for months--I\ndon't know what it is, it's something which you can't understand. I ate only the fruit for\nmonths. And my mother... I came back from kindergarten, and I just said, \"Hello.\" And I\nrun on the trees. And she came out and she said, \"My goodness me. If somebody will see a\nkindergarten teacher...\" I pushed my shoes down and sometimes the skirt, and off I went to\nthe tree. And there I had my lunch, my breakfast, my dinner. And my mother said, \"I'm\ncooking the beautiful soup.\" And I said, \"No, that's what I feel I need.\" I didn't understand\nhow important was that. It was like... don't know why I did it. But that's what I did all\nthe...all the time just eating fruit. Fruit in season. And we had all the fruit for all the season\nin our garden. I remember once I climbed on the cherry tree, on the high branches up. And,\nyou know, it was the branches went swaying here and there. And Mother...my mother says,\n\"Please come down. The branches will fell.\" I said, \"Oh, no. They are strong branches.\nAnd...and here are the cherries the sweetest, the healthiest.\" She said, \"Please come down.\"\nSo alright. I ...1 had my lunch. Now I came down. \"But have something to eat.\" I said,\n\"No, this is my food.\" And, anyway... So the next what was they...like I told you before,\nthey undressed all what we had um...they put us...like I am saying there in the article.",
        "A: Yeah. They undressed everything what we had. Now they let us stand there naked. Then\nthey shaved our head with blunt scissors, so our head was all bruised--at least mine. And\nthen the man, laughing man, stood me on the chair and shaved everywhere what was hair.\nAnd then, they call it \"disinfection.\" They put us in big bins; and it was murky water. Ten at\na time. And we had to go in, and with our heads in. And then naked, wet, we stood in that\nfreezing cold wintry day \u2018til we got the remnants of Russian prisoner of wars uniforms,\nwhich was cotton top and cotton pants. And mine didn't have a button on top and a button\non the pants. So I had to hold on to...not to lose it. And then we got wooden clogs, which\nwe hever was use to it. And so ...and naked and barefooted... And then that's how it was.\nThe start. We...we thought looking one each other, we didn't recognize. We thought they\nare crazy. But we didn't see that ourself--we looked like crazy, too. Anyway, we went to the\nbarracks. And in our room, there was about six hundred girls; and some of the girls under\nshock. What happened, they went crazy. Or, what you call it? Under the shock. And very\nsoon, in the first day, we found out--because there is always that certain communication and\ncertain gossip going around--that those who are crazy, they get a phenol injection. You\nknow what's a phenol? Straight away, a phenol injection. And there was four girls. And\n[...I knew how to...I had experience; because I work ...worked like a um assistant to a very\nfamous doctor, and so I knew how to handle um oh crazy. But they weren't crazy. They was\nunder the shock. So I slept in one bed with four of those, which was really meant for two.\nBut I slept with them. And my influence on them was so good they recovered in a few days.\nOthers who didn't do that, they was dead.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE IN TAPE",
        "A: In a barrack in Auschwitz, and this... And there was, like I mentioned, about six hundred\ngirls; and there was in charge a German um woman who was a politisch [NB: political\nprisoner]. And he was there...she was there as a punishment, because in P_aszow she had\nhelped prisoners. Her husband was a famous doctor, but even so it didn't help. They\nbrought her to Auschwitz and they shaved her hair the same way like us. But she was not\nwell. Her legs were swollen. I don't know from what...what sickness it makes it. And so\nshe asked the girls who would help her. So I volunteered that I will. And the first... first\nday, because we needed to bring tea to the um for the people. So we went there. But the\nGerman prisoners, like I told you, they were prostitutes, thieves and murderers. And the\nrumors went that we are prostitutes too, and we are competition to them. So when I came to\nthe girls there for the drinks, so she says, \"We don't need any competition. And anyway, you\nwouldn't be able to carry the...the kettles.\" And I said, \"In case we are able to carry the\nkettles, would you not make any difficulties for us?\" And...but she said, they said, \"OK, we\nwouldn't. But you won't!\" So I said, \"Could you...\" And I pointed to one of the girls. \"...be\na partner to me, and we are carrying together?\" And usually they carry it four girls--two and\ntwo--because it's heavy. And I said, \"But I would like to carry it with you by yourself.\" So\nshe said, \"Alright.\" So... and I grabbed the kettle, because I told you I was strong. And later,\nwhen we went out of their view, so I said, \"And now you run, because I'm going to run.\"\nAnd so I was running. And it was a huge distance from where that food was given to the\nplace where we been. Because we was in Barrack 9. That was...two more barracks was\nthere, 10 and 11. And 11, it was the bunker where they killed politisch prisoners or\nwhatever. So and then she... she amazed, she was amazed. She said, \"I thought that you are\nall spoiled nobodies!\" And I said, \"No, we are not. We are decent human beings. And\nplease, in the future, let us have that food. Because whichever wrong that food is, what we\nneed something.\" So I got the respect from her. And she wanted to be...she was lesbian,\nwhich I didn't know. So she came and she wanted to make friends with me. But in our\ntown, in our country, we didn't know about what it means. But she started to pet me. So I\nsaid, \"Oh, you... Don't be angry, but I don't understand this thing.\" And I said, \"I appreciate\nif you leave me alone.\" And she was decent enough. She said, \"Would you like something?\nWould you like I bring you, I take you somewhere?\" And she really did. And she said,\n\"What would you like?\" And there was food, all the food what people was bringing. And I\nsaid, \"A little bit of a salt.\" Salt, because we missed salt. So she said, \"Don't be so silly!\nHere, you have a piece of speck [NB: bacon], too.\" And she gave me. And so I shared that\nwith all the others. But, you know, we were sucking on that skin so much that I broke my\ntooth on it. (Laughter) You know, because we been so hungry that that have it... So\nanyway, this was the first thing. In the morning, two o'clock, they woke us up with screams\nand with the sticks hitting us: \"Raus! Raus! Raus!\" Because it was the counting. And\nbecause they was so primitive, and so was the SS woman who came there too, thousand...\nThey were so primitive, they couldn't make the counting. So we had to get up two o'clock at\nnight in that freezing cold, bad climate. It was like a punishment from God, this climate\nthere in Auschwitz. Lot of people, they...they fell because they couldn't stand the cold,\nstanding on one spot. I was telling the girls to turn around--you know, like round, around,\naround. I...those... that mean movement on one spot, because you couldn't...you couldn't go\nout of the place. That's how it started. And then in the barrack, they started to say that they\nneed people for different work. Like in the kitchen and in the sewing rooms and different\ndepartment. And the girls volunteered then. And you know, everybody wanted a inside job,\nnaturally. And I was with that crazy woman, looking after them; and this um woman, the\nGerman woman, she said, \"Why don't you go also look for something? You are sitting with\nthose four crazy women. And look after yourself.\" And I said, \"What I am...I don't want to\nbe any time here. And otherwise, I want to go and work in outside and prepare myself.\nBecause I believe once it will be a place for Jews to go, and I want to prepare myself.\"\nMorning came, and the Kommandos was standing. And I was volunteering to go...like\nworking in the fields. But she knew better than I; so she slapped my face and pulled me in...",
        "A: Hmmm?",
        "A: That...that German woman who was in charge of our room, which she was from politisch\nreason there. So she knew about it, so she pulled me in. And she said, \"You are going to\nwork inside and help me and scrub the floor.\" I says, \"With what? You haven't got\nanything.\" She said, \"With your nails. But here you will stay.\" So I...1 took water and I\nscrubbed the wat...the dirt with my nails. But I thought, \"I am crazy. I'm going rather\noutside on the fresh air.\" Next day, the same thing. I did it three times. The third time she\nsaid, \"What you think you are going to? You are going to work for the fields to prepare\nyourself? How long will you last? They will beat you there. They will, you know, run you\nthere. And you won't last three days there. And I need you there; because look my feet! I\nneed somebody who will help me.\" So, and she said, \"Otherwise, tell me what you are from\nprofession that you don't want to go to the kitchen, or....\". I said, \"I don't want to tell.\" She\nsaid, \"Tell me.\" \"I'm a kindergarten teacher.\" So she said, \"I am a teacher, so I understand\nwhat you mean you don't want your profession. But come and help me.\" So let's go start\nmy...my first career. She said, \"Help me, because I am unable to do that.\" So I was going to\ncarry the food, the bread, the evening meal. And we always had to volun...ask for\nvolunteers; because us was a small number and for six hundred people to bring bread and\nthis, that was a hard task. Because came tired from it. But we had to have the food, but\nstraight away I used that that I am home for something good; because you can do good even\nwhere is impossible. So I approached the girls who are um working in so-called \"Revier\"--\nlike hospital. I said, \"Steal wherever you... whatever you could and bring it home to me,\nbecause I know what to use it for.\" And to those girls who are working in the sewing room,\n\"Bring all the rags what you can. Steal it. Put it in the pants and bring it home.\" So they\nbrought it home. And when the girls came home, I saw what it is. Now I understood why\nshe didn't want to, because she...they had terrible experiences right away. So I bandaged\nthem. So I gave them some medication what it was. And I was even, when I gave the food\nout, I didn't sit down to eat the food; because I was... saw so many I had to help. And there\nwas a interesting thing. There was a girl who was watching me doing that. And she said,\n\"My name is [Bluma (ph)].\" She lives in Israel. \"I am a daughter...and I am a daughter of a\nrabbi from Bratislava,\" where my husband was born. \"And, you see, I think that God send\nme watch over you while you are helping others. And now you are coming and you are\nsitting down, and you have that little food. Otherwise you won't have strength to do what\nyou are doing.\" And that's what she did. Every night, she said, \"Enough is enough. Now\nyou are going to sit down and have your meal.\" So that's where it started, that togetherness\nto help each other in the girls where the misery was. And the sadisms of the woman who\ntook the girls out in kommando, and often they did hurt unnecessary. Like...you know, the\ndemolition all the...or they didn't want that the civil population should know, being so close,\nand see Auschwitz. So they...they demolished some villages and they transferred them\nsomewhere else. But there was ruins. So they took some woman and watched that; they let\nsome woman go down and some woman on top. And they had them to demolish and throw\nthe bricks down. And down the girls was working. And if they didn't want to, they beat\nthem. \"Throw that bricks down!\" And they threw the bricks on their own friends; and often\nthey came half dead, or dead already. Or they carried rocks from one place to the other.\n\"Los! Los!\" So this...this was the start. And the girls became sick, and the girl became\nweak. And some were...some run to the electrical um... We, we had an electrical fence\nwhich was with um electricity. So if you touch it, you been dead. But some girls, they said,\n\"I rather that. I can't take it anymore. And I can't see any end to it.\" Because except that the\nwork, there was other things that you wouldn't believe it. There was fleas, artificial-like\nbreeded to that they should jump only on places like eyes, ears, nose and mouth. You you\ncouldn't help it. There was hundreds jumping on you. Then there was lice. Everywhere\nlice, crawling all over you. And then was lice who was crawling under your skin. And all\nthat, plus the beatings and the starving and the brutality. So a lot of girls choose another\ndeath. But we lasted there in this camp Auschwitz about...I would say, beginning of August.\nI can't tell you exact days that I come. And then because...you know, days and weeks we\ndidn't know. We didn't have that somebody says, \"It's Monday\" or \"Tuesday\" or... We didn't\nknow. The days were just passing without us knowing. And so they took us um on walking\nto Birkenau from Auschwitz. If Auschwitz was Hell, Birkenau was thought on the biggest\nSatan what can exist. There was um barracks from clay, which meant before it was for\nhorses. And the place for one horse suddenly became a lodging for thirty woman. Because\nthey put two planks across, and some woman was lying down. Ten down, ten in the middle,\nand ten on the top. And they couldn't even move. They could just lie like sardines, covered\nup with one blanket. And this is not enough. But the whole camp was with holes, because\nthey supposed to bring canalization there. But they didn't wait 'til they have the canalization,\nor they have water or they have anything. They brought us there in this stage. First of all, a\nlot of lice and this place. And it was muddy. And it was... You had that one... They... One\nthing, they took away the Russian uniforms and they gave us one dress. But nothing under\nit. 'Nother scarf, and the same wooden clogs. And they...in that you had to exist in rain, in\nshine. So the rain...1magine what it does--the rain and the shine--what it is to a little rag. It's\nfelling to pieces. And some girls was falling 1n that...in those holes. And if you fall in this\nhole and you been weak, you couldn't walk out of it. That was the end of her. And except\nthat it was, when it was raining it was muddy. And it was muddy; and so the girls had the\nwooden clogs. And when they walked in it and lost the clogs, they couldn't even take it out\nanymore; because it was \"Los! Los!\" So they run...so they run barefoot in the cold, in the\nrain. It was terrible. And also, there was only one place where the water was. It was one\nwell. When you took the water out in a...like a basket. You had to wind it up. But imagine,\none for so many thousands. And the people came home thirsty. So one over the other. And\nlot of girls, they fell in and that was the finish. And then you couldn't drink that water\nbecause it was like that. And later they made like the water in the back of the barrack. But it\nwas always a restriction of the water. Soon you arrived there, they closed up the water. It\nwas all sadistically, brutality. You know, just make us like really swines. Because you\ncouldn't wash yourself. You couldn't go properly to the toilet. There was just a hole, and\nover the hole a piece of plank. And you was sitting on the plank and there was... So, and a\nlot of people, one push the other. And if you fell in, that was the finish. And things like that,\nfor you to see and to...to...to be able to...to...to go on with the life, it's unbelievable.\nUnbelievable. So...and on the other side, like I said, people fell in those--\"graven,\" you call\nit. Like, you know, they dig ditches for the...the pipes what they wanted to put in. But they\nwasn't in hurry to put in. And often, they made...they call it \"Blocksperre\" [NB: \"block\nclosing\"]. There was a siren and everybody had to run to the barrack. And say the girl was\njust on the toilet. And she wanted to run, but there was that ditch. They fell in. And when\nthe siren was over, and whoever was found in those ditches, they took them straight away on\nthe trucks to the crematorium. Often, I did that I saw some friend of mine...they, they just\nfell in. So I run out to pull them out and push them back to... Because I thought [to] myself,\n\"Every day when you are alive, maybe...maybe there will be a chance that something will\nhappen and prolong the life. Maybe some miracle will happen and the war will come to the\nend, and then they will recuperate.\" By one of these such occasions when I did it, and the\nwhistle came up and I was there with the girls. So, naturally, I also went on the truck with all\nothers to be taken to the gas chambers. And, you know, fate... This woman who many\nmonths ago had experiences carrying the water with me and I didn't want to be her lesbian\nfriend...but she was just having a Kommando taken out to work and she was the kapo of this\nkommando. And she saw me on that truck and she knew. So she came up and she gave me\none big slap; and she pulled me down from the truck. And to the SS who was guarding, he\n[NB: she] said, \"I couldn't walk out with the Kommando because she is missing!\" And she\nwas, you know, pretending to scream at me. And when I came and she said, \"And now, run!\nRun for your life.\" And that's... and it saved me. Anyway, and then...",
        "A: OK.\nTAPE #2",
        "A: There is...there is a short story I want to tell you. When I was a young girl...and because\nbeing a only daughter, my father took me to a famous rabbi, who came to the city, to be\nblessed. When he blessed and put his hands over my head, he says \"This girl has a special\nmission in her life. She is chosen, and she is going to save hundreds and hundreds of Jewish\nsisters and brothers. And that's what her life will be.\" My father came home, told my\nmother. They said, \"What? Seven year old girl, what he is talking about?\" Um, but\nnaturally I didn't know about it. Only before I went away, so my mother told me. Imagine,\nwhen you've been...the rabbi told that I don't know why he was telling it. And um my sister\nsaid, \"Probably that's what you are doing for Zionism. That's what it is.\" But when I was in\ncamp, I felt something that's... Often I opened my mouth, and I say things and I do things,\nlike...it's not me. Like...I don't believe in...in...11 unnatural or something. But it was like\nthat. Because I undertook to save um my friends, and...and implanted in them to do that, too.\nSo I thought, \"Is it me doing that, or is something in me what is doing it?\" So I just show\nyou one sample. You see, because the girls was wearing one dress and it was in rain or in\nshine, so they used the blanket what they have to cover up. And they tore it up to put it\naround their chest or wherever. So they took all the girls who been in charge to a room they\ncalled sauna, where they usually had once in a while um shower. And they put a big table\nthere. And all the commanders of the camp from all over were sitting there. And they\ninvited all... Invited! (Laughter) I am talking invited! All the...all the woman in charge\nthere, even the charge--it wasn't that we wanted to be in charge. They pressed us in the\ncharge. And they...they said, \"You know what the women are doing? They are sabotage!\nAnd you... They are tearing the... the German property. And you are there not to prevent\nthem. So you know what the punishment is for that? The punishment for that you are going\nto go, all of you, to the gas chambers.\" Suddenly, something pushed me. And I stopped...I\nmade a step forwards, announce my number--because that was...we been only number--and\nI said to him, to the commanders, I said, \"I'm not wondering that they are doing that, because\nevery human being 'til he's alive is trying to make his miserable life a little bit less miserable.\nIf you...1f you would be in the same position, you would be doing the same thing. And if\nyou would give us new clothing after such a long time which they are wearing that one um\ndress--which from rain and shine it's going to pieces--you would do the same thing.\" So, he\nstarted to scream at me. He said, \"You are a...a [chuke (ph)], a nasty [chuke (ph)]. How dare\nyou talking to me like that!?\" And that 1s expression \"frech,\" which I can't um translate.\nIt's...you know, who has a big mouth [Ger: \"insolent, sassy, cheeky\"]. They call it \"frech.\"\nSo, and he screamed at me. So I thought...and the girls in the back, they pulled me back.\n\"Magda, don't do it. Don't do it.\" But I...and, and I tell myself and...and I said what I wanted\nto say. And to my surprise, one of the biggest sadists--which I didn't know he is such a\nsadist, I... found it out much later--he got up, and he said, \"Listen. She's not only a like big-\nmouth [chuke (ph)]. She has something in her head. She's right. We have to give them new\nclothing.\" Next day...and they discharged us, and the whole camp got new dresses. So, I not\nonly saved us three hundred, but saved the camp. Because they got a little bit warmer\nand...dresses. And this is what we did, what we helped each other. There is another case.\nOne day, I was watching that the SS man came to select the girls--\"left\" and \"right.\" And\nwho was \"left,\" she had to go to the gas chambers. And there was present a girl...with the SS\nman was a um girl present which was Report Schreiberin. She was the one who wrote the\nreports. And she had to make the...all the numbers who will go to the gas chambers. I was\npassing by; and I observed that she's writing something. And then she looks left and right.\nAnd she doesn't see any SS man; and she sends the girls back to the barrack. And so she\nsaved about three hundred girls from immediate death. How long they will be alive, this\nnobody could guarantee. But she did it. And I saw many times she did it. And I had...didn't\nhave even the opportunity to ask how you do it. But I met her after forty-five years, two\nyears ago, in Prague. I went to visit her. And she told...and I ask her, \"Tell me, [Gatka (ph)],\nhow did you do it? I watched you writing, and then you send them back.\" She said, \"Listen.\nWe had to do something, because this was no...no end what they did to us. So I took from\nthe [cart-a-take (ph)| the dead numbers, of the dead. And I pretend that I am writing. And\nnobody saw. And I send them, because the SS didn't check it later.\" Because anyway so\nmany other was going; so they didn't check if those three hundreds are in it or not. And\nthat's what she did many times. There was another um how the girls, they had only one way\nto help each other or to survive. By own help; we didn't have anybody to help us. We been\nhelpless young girls to thrown in such unbelievable situation, which I don't know Dante\ncouldn't um couldn't find out such situation what we been in. Sick and fighting with every\nminute. Because one minute you been alive, the next minute you been dead. So one more\noccasion, I tell you: that I was working in a charge, like um a little helper there. And we had\nto put the whole barrack on, because a doctor--by the name [King (ph)], and she...her name\nis Anna, she lives in Australia--and um they had to select the woman out. But she gave me a\nhint, while he was turned around, that \"I am going to talk to him, and you girls try to pull the\ngirls in. They should run in the barrack.\" So she turned facing him from the front, and she\nstarted to talk to him. She was very...a very clever representative woman. And she was\ntelling him all different stories; and while the stories she was telling him, I was telling the\ngirls to run, run, run, run back to the barrack. One--which is remarkable and I never forget,\nbecause I didn't overhear all what she was telling him because I was concentrating more girls\nto go in--so she said, \"You know...\" And she named the...the... how far he was\nOberscharsturmfthrer, or whatever. You know, he was in... How many...he had on. And\nshe said, \"You know who is ...who is responsible for all the war?\" And he was surprised,\nand said, \"Who?\" And she said, \"The bicyclists and the Jews.\" And he said, \"But why the\nbicyclists?\" And she said, \"Why the Jews?\" You know, and he was laughing, \"Ha, ha, ha.\"\nYou know, it's a big joke. And meantime, the selection was over and the camp was saved.\nYou see, that's how we could do. There was no other way. Just by tricking and being\ncourageous. And our motto was: \"We are just going once through the chimney, sooner or\nlater. But 'til we arrive, we have to help each other.\" And that's how we helped each other.\nAnd often there was cases, like ... Like I told you, people were sick, you tried to help them.\nYou had tried to steal some medicine and give them. But then I myself fell into it; because\nbeing always in touch with those sick people, I also got typhoid. High fever. My tongue\nwas like the... Did you ever see a chicken stomach from inside, when you open it, how\nrough it is? So rough was my tongue. I had high temperature. I couldn't eat. And my\nstomach, I had to run. And no medicaments. The only thing what I wanted is tomato.\nWhere to got tomato? But then a group of girls was working for the Germans--they call it\nRajsko,\u2019 in a garden. And endangering her life, she brought a tomato in under her dress.\nBecause we been so flat anyway. So you didn't... And she brought a tomato, and with that I\nrubbed my tongue. And then what I was asking, it was lemonade. Where to get lemonade?\nBut one girl was working in the SS canteen, for the SS. She was... And so the girls told her,\n\"Can you steal a bottle?\" She said, \"I can't, but I will. If they catch me, I know I'll go to the\ngas chambers. But maybe, if I'm lucky, I...1 save her.\" So she did. And she managed to\nsteal a bottle, and she brought it and I was drinking that. Another girl, she said, \"I can't give\nher any medication. But I can steal some tablets to strengthen her heart. That's all what I\ncan give.\" So that's what was. And the other thing was because I became blind, and I\nbecame bli...deaf and I couldn't walk. So how can I...",
        "A: How can I op...",
        "A: And how can I existed? So one of the girls told to the other girl, \"Can you, after work, do a\nnight duty? And so Magda could rest under the name that she is doing night duty. I'm going\nto steal potatoes. And when you come home, I will cook potatoes so you can strengthen up.\nAnd so Magda will be lying as she is on night duty.\" And as high temperature I had, she was\ntelling me that hundred times: \"You are on night duty, you are on night duty, you are on\nnight duty. And when the SS man comes and he probably will see you in bed like the others,\nthen you tell...you can jump out from bed if he wants you to.\" And there was a special SS\nman, who was the biggest sadist what you can imagine. And he just couldn't see some nice\ngirls and they didn't...he didn't want them to survive. And by off chance, all the girls caught\ntyphoid. And the girls was lying, because they couldn't get up. And he came and they was\non bed. But we didn't expect him to come, because he had no reason to come there.\nBecause there was SS man in charge of our barrack. So he came. And all the girls--young\ngirls, beautiful--yesterday they was healthy, but today they caught the typhoid and high\ntemperatures. So they was in bed. They all went to gas chambers. When he came to me, so\nI... You know, the sur...surviving is such a power that I said, in very quick German, that \"I\nam on night duty, but if you want I jump out from bed...\" So he said, \"Shut up! Hold your\ntongue! You bloody Jewess!\" But that saved my life. Saved my life. But I still couldn't\nwalk, and I couldn't hear. So when the counting was, so they just dropped. Like, like a sa...\nlike a doll, because I was limp. But um...and in this time, charge, you know, of barracks was\na German woman, a prisoner. And she said, \"I can't cover up for her. I must send her into\nthe gas chambers like these others. She can't work. She's no good for nothing.\" But one of\nthe girls says, \"Listen, I tell you what. I can sew. If you bring me needle, thread and\n> Part of the Auschwitz I complex.\nmaterial, I will sew you beautiful dresses, whatever. Just give her a chance to...to...to be\nali...to get better. And she will get better.\" So she said, \"Alright. But you look after her. It's\nyour responsibility. If some SS man comes and sees her and he says, 'To the gas chambers!,'\noff she goes.\" So she said, \"I will take that chance.\" So she sewed her, and she let me stay.\nAnd so it was one more day and one more day. But what happened, there one day they\ndecided that new arrivals are coming and they need the space. So they told us we have to go\nout from the camp. And there was a big empty paddock with nothing on, just snow and\nfreezing. And there we had to stay all day. I couldn't walk. So two girls from each side,\nthey took me here by my hand and they carried me. And my head, legs was dangling; and\nthey carried me and they pinched me that when SS man came I shouldn't say something.\nBecause I didn't see. I didn't hear. I just could talk. So they pinched me so I knew I should\nbe quiet. And so they carried me like that outside; and one of the girls...and this is how we\nhelped each other. She managed to get a bottle somewhere and she put tea in the bottle; and\nin that um what we got the food, it was a round dish. She put the bottle in the dish, and she\nput it here. As I said, we been so flat so it didn't made any difference. Can you imagine that\nI was so flat I didn't have anything? Nothing, just bones. Nothing, just bones.\nNothing...breast, no. Anyway, so they took me there. And there was a rock. They put me\non the rock. And from time to time, they gave me a sip of water I shouldn't freeze to death\n[on the] rock. And then they carried me a little bit around, and put me on the rock again.\nNow what happened: on the way back, they...a lot of girls froze to death there. And they\nwas dead or half-dead. And the rest, when we came in, they selected seventy percent out of\nthe girls--good or bad--to the gas chambers. Lucky, the girls from both sides which carried\nme, they been in better shape so they didn't saw me in between. Which saved me. And now\nwe knew why they did it, because new arrivals from all different part of the world came.\nFrom Belgium, from France, from Holland. And so they needed the space. That's how they\nmade the space. First they tortured them to death, and then they send them to the gas\nchambers. And um that was our existence. That was our existence. And I, by off chance, I\nhad...I was in charge from time to time in all nationalities I had. Jewish and non-Jewish.",
        "A: First I was the... How you say? A vice...like a vice, vice president you have. So it was a\nblock oldest [NB: Blockaltester], and I was either the...like the vice um oldest or I was just\num helping to bring the food, and block...",
        "A: Yeah. That was for a while I was doing that. And funny thing, the way I tried to handle\npeople... One of the girls who didn't know, she said, \"Magda, you handle always people\nlike... like they would be in the kindergarten. Like you would be a kindergarten teacher.\" I\ndidn't tell anybody I am. But I tried to help them. I tried to talk to them, and encourage\nthem. When what happened one day, you know, they selected people and they didn't send\nthem straight away to the gas chamber. They collected them in one of the barracks, which\nwas Number 25. And when it was full--and also outside the barrack, because it was a big\nfence built around them. Because from beginning, it wasn't a fence and some girls they run\nthrough the fence. Even it was um like nails on the top, but somehow they run through.\nBecause they wasn't really so bad, so they run through. So they made a fence all over. So\nnow they let also on the floor sitting those girls awaiting 'til the trucks will come. And it was\nhot and no water, and their face was swollen up. And it was just...their their eyes was....it\nwas just two spots and a nose. And it is... it is... I tell you, the heart was breaking. And I\nwas...I, I saw it. So I volunteered. I said, \"Let me go in.\" I asked. \"I am going to to give\nthem water.\" They said, \"Are you crazy? If SS man sees you, you go!\" _ \"So I go with them.\nBut I can't see those people suffer before the last minutes, being so swollen and and dying\nfor a...for a drop of water, in that terrible heat without having anything on their head or\nprotecting.\" So I took, you know, a dish and a cup; and I went from one to one. And I said\nto myself, \"If I die with them, I die. But I can't...can't see it. At least, the last moment.\"\nThey been so grateful. They knew they are going to die, but they said, \"At least we have a\nlittle water.\" And you know, the selection was done in a terrible way. Like sometimes it\nwas a Sickness which is not even a sickness. It is just like a scratching. You call it \"kretze,\"\nyou know? It was also an implanted thing. But they knew about it. So they let the woman\nundress totally naked; and when somebody had a little mark of scratch, in they went to the\ngas chambers. Then later, I...1 became a block oldest. And in every barrack, there was a SS\nman responsible for that barrack. And he had the right every day to make selection himself.\nEven so that many people went to work, but some was staying home because either they\ndidn't needed them or they was not well; so they was at home. And that SS man made the\nselection again. So I said, \"How could I stand by and see him selecting the people, my own\nfriends and bro...and sisters?\" So I arranged the girls so that in the front and in the back was\na strong girl, and everywhere; and in the middle was the weaker ones. And I pushed the girls\ntogether. 'Cause usually you had to stand so that you can go through, here and there, and\nhere and there. And he said, \"Do you think I don't know why you're pushing the girls so\nmuch in together? So I couldn't walk through, I shouldn't see that they are sick or weak\nwoman which I have to send to crematorium.\" And I said, \"Yes, that's why I did it. But I'm\ngoing to tell you something. They are not so sick that a few days at home wouldn't...they\nwouldn't recover. They just need a little rest.\" \"So, and what are you going to do?\nHow...how you want to do that?,\" he says. So I said, \"I tell you how. (Pause - drinking\nwater) I want to do something good for Germany.\" \"What you mean, 'good\"?\" (Pause) I\nsaid, \"You know how many um shoes are lying around, and how many dresses are discarded\neverywhere? Lying around in heaps, and not...nothing happen to them. And those can be\nrecycled.\" \"What you mean, 'recycled\"?\" I said, \"Washed and dried. And those girls can do\nit. All the shoes,\" I said, \"could be gathered and washed and dried and band together. And\nwhile they are doing that, they will recover.\" \"Where are they going to do it?\" I said, \"In the\nback in the barrack, there is a wash room. And they can wash there. I will look after them. I\nwill get some string where they will dry the clothes, and they will dry the shoes. And it's\nrecycled, you can use it again. And the good things, you can send to Germany. That's a...a\nservice, isn't it? Give me that chance!\" And he says, \"Have it. If you want to bother with\nthat, go on. Bother.\" I said, \"Thank you.\" And I established that, that they was in the back\ndoing what I said. And I tried to...you call it \"organize\" food. I said to the girls, the... Next\nto the kitchen, 1t was um onions and potatoes. And woman was peeling it; and there was a\nfence clo...around it. Not Jewish girls do that, because it was too good for Jewish girls.\nJewish girls would survive there. So they gave it to the Polish girls. But you know, one way\nor another, you make a eye contact; and when nobody sees... So we told them, \"Throw\nsome potatoes close to the fence. And in the evening when nobody's there and the SS man is\nout, so we will pull that before...between the fence out, the onions and the potatoes. And we\nwill in this way help each other.\" And some of the girls could do miracles. They could cook\nfrom...from nothing. From nothing. They could um peel the potatoes; and they found some\ndish and they made holes in it and they (laughter) mashed it up. And then they, somewhere\nfrom the kitchen--also from...from Polish girl--they got flour. And they mixed it up and they\nboiled it. And it was food. Additional food. So you see, little things like that made a\ndifference in helping, somehow. And some girls who worked outside and digging the\npotatoes out, sometimes... Again, it was dangerous. If they catch you with one onion, one\npotato: death. But they did it. They brought the potatoes. Everyone brought one potato or\ntwo, and so they helped somehow. How long, nobody had a guarantee; because came the\nselection was so often happening. So often. Some...and if...1f 1t wasn't...1f 1t wasn't then, they\npunished you this way or the other way, or...or beat you up. I tell you a sample. A nice girl--\nshe was blond and blue eyes--and she was working. SS man came to her. \"I show you blue\neyes!\" And he took the revolver...not the revolver, the big one. How you call that?",
        "A: The rifle. And beat her so long that he beat her to death. And he says, \"Now you can have\nblue eyes!\" And things like that happened very often. Or they say, \"Would you run there\nand there. And bring me that, my cap.\" And while she was running and doing the order, he\nshot her. For nothing. So like ...like I told you, I was from time to time chosen from one\nfunction to another. I didn't want to; but when the SS said, \"You are going to be block\noldest,\" there was no excuse. You said, \"No,\" right... So you been. And now it depended on\nyou. You could...and you tried to do the best you could. Not everyone could. A sixteen year\nold girl in charge for thousands hungry, tired, sick girls, to keep order... Because order has to\nbe, you know. The German order has to be. And if it wasn't, so she went to the gas\nchambers because she couldn't manage. But they didn't consider that she's sixteen years old,\nand how can you manage? Not everybody could manage. And cases like that was many,\nmany. And um I had um... When I came in charge, so I had Czech not Jewish girls from\nBeneS--he was President of Czechoslovakia.\u00b0 The whole family came there. Then I have\nPolish woman, non-Jewish woman. And that costed me terrible much, because they had\ntyphoid and they had diarrhea. And being on the third bunk, how can you run down with\ndiarrhea to get to the toilet who was so far? It's impossible! So, first of all, um with the girls\nI choose from the girls on the new arrivals a few who would be my helpers. So I said, \"We\nhave to do something.\" So we steal some ...it was wooden boxes. And we cut a hole in, and\nwe put a like...what you...what you carrying food in it...a bucket. We put the bucket in so\n\u00b0 Edvard Bene\u2019 was the democratically-elected President of Czechoslovakia until he resigned in\nOctober 1938 just after the Munich Conference.\nthey could relieve themselves. But some couldn't even walk down. So what they did, the\npoor girls, in that dish--which is not even nice to say--what they had for food, they finish\nthemselves there. And they threw it through the window out; because windows was broken.\nThere wasn't windows, good windows. So they threw it out. But imagine, then came the\nsun. And that was terrible. So I found out that in back of the barrack, there is a certain clay\nwhere the gypsies used to make their houses to cover it from. So I said, \"A good idea!\"\nThen I approached one day a man who delivered all...for the Kommandant woman. And\nI...when nobody saw me, I said, \"Please bring me two whitewash, and two...\" How you say?\nWhere the beer is in.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Big kegs, big... How you call them? I don't know the expression in this moment. He said,\n\"How you want me to? Where do I get it?\" I said, \"I don't care.\" \"How will I get it in?\" I\nsaid, \"You're delivering for the kommandant. So if...1f somebody asks, it's for her.\" \"But\nwhat happen if they say, 'It's...it's not for her?\" \"Then you tell it's for me. Then I have the\nresponsibility.\" But, somehow, he went through. He put it down. The girls quickly grabbed\nit and took it in. And during the night, the one group... Yah, we steal some um leather and\nsticks, and rags which we covered the stick on. And they did that outside with that mud,\nwhich had the color of um...nearly color of the bricks; and the windows, and inside the girls\ndid it with the whitewash. I thought I will disinfect the barracks. And I had already that\nhere, and maybe it will help a little. But I didn't realize what I am doing. In the morning,\nthey got up and here is the barracks standing with white windows. Can you imagine that?\nOh! They run. You know, they say, \"We are going to shoot you, hang you, because you are\ngoing to give signs for the...for the Americans: 'So here is a camp.' You know what you\ndoing? You are doing the worst thing, and for that is punishment. Not in the gas chambers,\nbut punishment. First punished, punish and then hanged too. But first you will get it.\" So I\nthought, \"What I am going to do?\" And meantime, I... that SS man who...you know, who\nwas in my barrack when I did the ...what I did with the washing, he was in another barrack.\nAnd by one occasion, when he was in my barrack, some girls was so grateful. So from rags,\nthey made me two dolls. You know the...I don't know if you know in America, but in\nEurope it was like um long legs, long hands, with black velvet. And here it had the pointed\num head, and the face was white and pointed. And it was such a doll. And they made me\nthat. I don't where they got the material and whatever, because the impossible was possible.\nAnd they put it on my bed. And I said, \"My goodness! What I am going to do with that?\nThey found it, so then I am in trouble and they are in trouble: where did they get it.\" So I\nthought myself, \"Be smart. Give it to him as a present.\" So I ...when he came in, I said,\n\"You are probably going one stage home. Take it to your wife as a present. She will be very\npleased.\" He said, \"Oh, that's beautiful. That's a good idea! I really was thinking what to\nget to my wife. That's what I am going to take.\" And he forgot to punish me. So...but what\nnow I use the opportunity. So I approached him, and I said, \"You know what, they want to\nhang me, but first to punish me and...and get...beat me up and so on. But what I did, I do it\nfor some hygienic reason.\" And I said, \"And I did for you, too.\". \"How you mean?\"\n\"Because you and the other SS who are coming to the camp, and they are approaching the\nbad barracks where the typhoid is, they will get it, too.\" She [NB: he] said, \"Don't tell\nanybody. Just recently five SS man died on typhoid.\" First I thought myself, \"Oh, let them\ngo. Why only us? Let them be ill, too.\" But on the other side, he said, \"Hold on.\" So I hold\non; and he went to the SS men commanders. \u2018Cause that was the woman commanders. The\nman commanders; and he explained that \"What she's doing is really for...\" Not on...not for\nus, so much as for them, because they are coming to the barracks. So they was talking in\nfavor of me. And now they came back, and you know what? \"The commander says that you\nare in charge. And you will have to tell all others that they have to do the same thing what\nyou doing...what you did.\" \"Oh, my God. Did I have...did I need that?,\" I said. But I was\nrunning around; and when I came to the barrack where that was the 25th barrack--where all\nthey was selecting to the death--so he said, \"Are you crazy?!\" Because there was a huge\nwall around, and you know how much work it has to do to paint that, too. So he said, \"Are\nyou crazy?! I'm going to...to listen to a bloody Jewess, she has crazy ideas?\" And I\nsaid...announced my number, I said, \"Would you be so kind and ask the commander?\" He\nlooked at me. He didn't say a word. And so... But what happened: now the women was\nvery mad at me. And they wanted to kill me, and now the men saved me. They have to\npunish me somehow. So what happened: in this stage, the experimental barrack opened in\nAuschwitz, in Barrack 10.\u2019 So they said, \"Alright. They saved your life. But in you go, in\nthe experimental block...barrack. But you will be in charge of the barrack.\" So I ask straight\naway, \"But could you give me also help, because I can't manage.\" \"Ah, take yourself!\" So I\nsaid, \"Sixteen girls.\" And I quickly named girls which are... they working outside, and I\nknew they won't last long. So I took those girls with me. And I went to the that barracks,\nwhich was the windows--that was the only women barrack in the men camp. So they\nclose...the windows was all with shutters and wire wiring. So we couldn't look out, and they\ncouldn't look in. And we been closed up. And a SS woman was there all day with us. And\nthe food was delivered \u2018til the door and--by men--and the woman took over. But when I\narrived there...so Hauptsturmfthrer Doctor Wirths,\u00ae whose brain child this idea was, he came\nand he said to me... I was blond and short cropped hair. My hair grew a little bit. And I was\nslim, naturally. And he said, \"You are not Jewish, are you?\" And I said, \"Yeah, I am\nJewish. Like all others.\" 'There must be a mistake.\" He said, 'There must be a mistake.\nYou don't act like Jewish. You don't look like Jewish. You don't behave like Jewish. You'll\nstand up for yourself. There is a mistake.\" And he said, \"And what are you from\nprofession?\" I said, \"Kindergarten teacher.\" \"That proves it!\" (Laughter) Incredible! That\n\u2019 According to the Auschwitz Chronicle, this would have been at the beginning of April 1943.\nSee Czech, Auschwitz Chronicle, 1939-1945, pp. 366-387.\n* SS Oberstiirmbannfiihrer Eduard Wirths, born 1909. Garrison physician in charge of all medical\npersonnel at KL Auschwitz from 06 Sep 1942.\nproves it! Why? Why does that prove it? So now I saw that he wants this way. So I said,\n\"If you want that to be a hospital, then we need blankets and then we need bed covers, sheets\nand towels and soaps. And even nightgowns.\" I told myself, \"Now he's going to give me a\nkick in my pants!\" But he said, \"Alright. You can have everything, and it will be delivered\ntoday. But the nightgowns will come tomorrow.\" You see? And now, because I managed\nto do that, so every SS man told that I am his proteg\u00e9e. I didn't do anything for him, and I\ndidn't even try to make a nice face opposite. But that was written I am his proteg\u00e9e. And um\nnow I tell you, you know, because it's a tragicomedy. Those girls was there in the barracks\nto choosen for the experiments. So I thought to enlighten their life a little bit. I said, \"As the\nnighties come, you are not going to pick and choose. If it's a small nightie and a big woman,\nshe has it or worse. And they can't exchange it.\" And then they are walking down from the\nstep down. So imagine, with those miserables as they been, it was a laughter. Because a tall\nwoman had a nightie coming here (showing hand on thigh) and (laughter) and a small\nwoman had a nightie coming there (showing hand on ankle). So I said, \"Don't laugh! This\nis the fashion parade.\" And then it gave me idea that, matter of fact, now where we are\nclosed up--because the SS woman went away. Um, she was there 'til lunch time counting,\nand then she went. So we been locked up. So I said, \"Is there anybody who is um like a\nlittle bit in the theater, or knows something? Dancing, acting, whatever. And we will make\ntheater in the evening.\" And that's what we established, a little group. And nobody was\nthere. We was sitting down, and somebody was performing. But I tell you what. I didn't\nlast there long either. Why? Because I... First of all, I must tell you that that um about the\nexperiments, closer I can't tell you. Because I wasn't a nurse. I just checked which\nexperiments are the least dangerous, there I will put more people. So the sterilization was\nnot so dangerous; because a doctor said to me that is his idea, and that Dr. Clauberg\u201d stole\nthe idea for him before he finished it. So he...even if it's not pleasant, what they still will be\nable if they survive, to have children. But they didn't survive, from other reason. But then,\nnaturally, they made also a very bad experiments. Brutal experiments, without any\nanesthetic. Terrible! And the girls suffered. And the radiation they made. And I tell you,\nit's terrible. And when they finished with the experiments, they send them to Birkenau\nwhere they didn't last long. Because now they been sleeping in bed and had a blanket and\nhad a towel. And they even if they suffered, but they had a little bit and like could look after\nthemself. And there was nurses which could help them a little. But that, they didn't survive.\nSo even, like I said, the sterilization wasn't so bad. But they didn't survive when they...\nWhen it was the experiments was ready they sent in; and they are not needed anymore, and\nthen send them away. What...",
        "A: No. I tell you one case. Um they picked some woman which they made mask. And they\nsaid...they said the Jewish race is minor below the Aryan race, and they want to prove it\n\u201d \u00a7S Brigadefuhrer (honorary) Dr. Carl Clauberg, born 1898. Physician in charge of the\nsterilization experiments on women at KL Auschwitz from April 1943.\nsomehow. So they took the mask, and then they said they are going to send them to a\nsanitorium where they will have a good life and the doctors will making certain experiments\non it. They closed the women up in a room, and they give the key to me because I was in\ncharge of this barrack. Like I told you, the proteg\u00e9e of Dr. Wirths. But suddenly... And\nthey supposed to come at nighttime, twelve o'clock, to pick them up. Suddenly a girl\npick...um knocked on the door. She said, \"Please, let me out. I don't believe they are\nsending us to the sanitorium. Because how can they make to prove that our brain is not\ngood? They have to kill us first. So this is not a sanitorium. It is a certain camp where they\nwill kill us first, and then from our brain they will make the experiments.\" So she said, \"Let\nme out.\" So I let her out. Another one knocked. She said, \"I have a sister here. I want to be\nwith her. Please let me out.\" I let her out. Closed the door. I didn't think what will be the\nafter effect of it. I let her out. And, naturally, when they came, they didn't think that the um\namount is not proper. But when they put them on the train coming to that camp where they\ndid that--they killed them and they made. Later I found out. But after the war I found out;\nnot during the war. So they counted up two are missing. And they said, \"You know what\nyou did? This is sabotage! What right did it give you to take the girls out? You know what\nyou are going to get for it? You are going to be punished, and you are going to be hanged or\nshot!\" And in 11, Barrack 11, was a man named Jacob who was the hangman. But he was a\nJewish man and a very good-hearted man. But sometimes, he couldn't help it. He had to do\nit. Otherwise, they kill him. And he send a message to me. He said, \"Magda, I will do it in\nthe quickest way.\" So I was prepared. And they send me to the Politisch Abteilung. That\nmeans the \"Politisch [NB: Political] Department.\" A woman came to pick me up. And there\nwas Aumeier.'\u201d He was a small man with a husky voice, who was a brute. Who came under\nhis hand, with his own hands he murdered him on the spot. Whoever it was. And she said,\n\"Goodbye, Madga. I know you are not going to survive that. Because he will tear you to\npieces like he does with the others.\" What can I do? So we said goodbye. But I came in;\nand he said, \"What are you thinking, Staatskriminal ...?!\" You know, and made him... I\nsaid, \"I did what I was asked for, and I think I did a good thing.\" He say, \"What!?!\" And he\nscreamed, but he didn't touch me. I can't believe it, even today not. He didn't touch me. So I\ntold myself, \"Who did it?\" Then I thought, \"That's the work of Hauptsturmfuhrer Doctor\nWirths. He did it. He wanted to frighten me. And he wanted to please the woman [NB: SS\nwomen commanders], you know? But he didn't kill me. And what happened once, with\nHauptsturmfthrer Wirths, there in the barracks was... in the um experiment barracks, was a\nlot of Greek girls. And I tried to help them; well, because either you try your best or you you\ndon't care. But I cared. Wherever I could, I helped. So they were so grateful that, again I\ndon't know where they got it, they made me two pillows. Hand-made pillows. And they put\nit on my bed. The same story. What do I do with two pillows? If somebody sees tt:\n\"Where did you get it? Who made it?\" So they will be in trouble. I will be in trouble. So\none day, Hauptsturmfthrer Wirths came in. And he left the door open and his car was\nstanding before. I ran for one minute out. I threw the pillows in, and I run back. And I\ndidn't say a word. He didn't say a word for weeks. But then he came and he asked me the\n'\u00ae SS-Hauptstiirmfiihrer Hans Aumeier.\nsame question. \"What did you do? Didn't you do what, now what this for that punishment\nfor what you did?\" I said...I said the same thing to that, to him. And he just said so much:\n\"The pillows was very nice.\" So much is said. And I came to the barrack, and the girls\ndidn't believe I am alive. And you know, I don't know if you know this 1s [tilam (ph)], you\nknow? The girls was praying [tilam (ph)] for that that I survived; because they loved me so\nmuch and I helped them so much. But that didn't help me for long. Because one day Grese--\nthe \"Angel of Death\" they call her, but I had experience with her before--came to pick me\nup. And \"You are coming with me.\" And I said, \"Where I am going?\" She said, \"You are\njust coming.\" I didn't know where I am coming. And I don't know...you know what's a\nbunker is? Yeah. There was a bunker under the earth which was so big that four woman\ncould stand next to each other like sardines. My punishment was... The woman couldn't\nstand it that the men saved me again, so they wanted to punish me. So I had the punishment:\nseven nights to stand there all night, then to be on the call-- the Zahlen Appell [NB: Census\nroll call]--and then punishment was to clean all the la...toilets or latrines. I wouldn't survive\none day, because standing there and then the roll call for hours. I...[ was... You know, one\nminute I would be finished. And now to clean all the toilets. But, you know, there was a\ncertain um... You know, news travel. And the men who was working in the camp, they\nfound out while I got this punishment. So they came to my rescue. They said, \"You lie\ndown here, and we will do your work. When SS man comes, then you will get up. Pretend\nthat you are working.\" And that saved my life. You see, this is what I mean, helping each\nother. That was only the way that some, some--meaning from twenty thousand of us, a few\nhundred--survived.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nTAPE #3\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Yeah. I met Irma Grese in beginning of my life in concentration camp. I mean, in Birkenau.\nFrom beginning...um it was...1t must be August, September '42. And I was a Stubendienst --\na helper. Not in my...stuben oldest, just like a little helper who went...carried the bread and\nthe food. And I went to um... and I needed always volunteers to that. People who was\nworking; and I asked them nicely, \"Listen, I know it's very hard, because you're working\nhard. But if we don't get the food, the bread, you won't have any. And we can't...for so\nmany, those few girls, they can't manage to... We've haven't got even time, because then it's\nthe roll call and everything. So, please come.\" And I was talking to them on...where Grese\nwas there, because she was in the...in the...where the bread was given out. She was in charge\nas a SS woman. She looked a chubby woman, young woman. In my eyes, she was about\neighteen, nineteen; with long blond pleats...plaits, chubby. And she didn't even have the hat\non. And while I was talking, I was telling the girls, \"Look girls, um I know it's very hard, but\nplease do it. And I will myself carry as much bread as you. So let's do it nicely and\nquickly.\" And while I was doing it every day, she called me and she said, \"What's your\nname?\" I said, \"Magda.\" And she said, \"I'm watching you, because you are talking to the\npeople and you carry the bread. You are different like the others. You taking so much\nenergy and time to...to encourage the people.\" And I said, \"I will do it to the last breath of\nmy life. If I can help, I do it.\" And...and I said, \"And what's your name?\" I forgot I am\ntalking to the (laughter) SS woman. And she said, \"My name 1s Irma.\" And I again said,\n\"Nice to know you.\" Then later, I said, \"My goodness! What are you, crazy? You're talking\nto SS woman!\" But that did it, that I said to her. And um so, for a while she was there and I\nwas...and she, every time she was talking with me and asking me something. And she\npretended, that woman...you know, deceiving me. She said that she didn't...part maybe was\nright. She said, um, \"I was um living in a small place, and suddenly they asked for\nvolunteers. But I didn't know where they are taking me. So I volunteered, and here I am.\"\nBut later, I found out they first they took them to a place to brutalize them and prepare them\nto be brutal; and then she came. But that I didn't know then. Anyway, so we been in contact\nlike that; and suddenly we lost touch about each other. She went her way, and I went my\nway. And later I found out that she was wanting to be somebody, suddenly. And then one\nday I met her, and she was slimmed down. She had her hair up and very nicely the cap on.\nShe had boots shining like glass, or silver or whatever. And she had...in her boots, she had a\nwhip and she had a belt with a pistol who was shining also like silver. And she said, \"Hello,\nMagda.\" Nobody called me Magda, because I was for everybody number. And I said,\n\"Hello, Irma.\" And I said, \"Oh, but now you look dressed!\" And I said, \"Shining like that,\nand like a real SS woman. I hope I will never see you brutal like the others.\" She didn't say\nanything. She didn't say, \"This is not your business,\" or...or \"How dare you.\" She just\nlistened and went away. Later, I found out that since she is like she is, she's riding out on a\nhorse and going out to the Kommandos and with that whip she's whipping the girls. And\nmostly she's whipping on the breast, because that 1s very sensitive part. And often it breaks\nit. And what is the end? Death. But I didn't know. I found it out much later. And then,\nwhat happened: the...I was working in a office [at] one stage. I was so happy to work in the\noffice, not to have that responsibility and to see the...all the cruelty. Because there I was\nworking on the [karteaustaschs (ph)]. You know, the Germans are punctuality plus! And I\nlearned the, the... I had anyway a nice writing as you saw; and now even I made it even\nnicer. And I was happy. But one day, I heard the news that the Hungarian arrivals are\ncoming from Budapest and from Hungary. And one day I was called up by the commander\nreplacing the commander-in-charge. And he...she said, \"You will be the Lageraltest in the\nnew camp where the arrivals are coming.\" So I said, \"Oh, I am so happy here in, in where I\nam.\" And she laughed. She had teeth standing out like that, you know. She said, \"Oh, ho,\nho, ho.\" She said, \"Oh, you are happy here, are you?\" She said, \"But you are taking that.\nYou will be in charge.\" And I said, \"I don't know how to be a Lager oldest.\" I said, \"I never\nbeen one.\" And she laughed with her teeth, and she said, \"Where could you be? There was\nnever a camp...where there was a camp.\" And the other reason was, I said because for the\ntime being I heard that in this camp are men on one side. And I'm so afraid that I got\ninvolved...I will get involved with some man for what is punishment there, and I don't want\nthat. She said, \"About that, you don't have to worry. We will watch you carefully.\" Nothing\nhelped me. So...and there was the report um writer which I knew, and I approached her. I\nsaid, \"Please, [Gatka (ph)]. Don't let it happen. I know how can you help all thousands and\nthousands people? And when we really would, by any miracle survive, how many enemies\nwill I have? \u2018Cause you can't help by the thousands. Somebody...I, I didn't look nice or\nwhatever.\" So she said, \"Look, this is not that the SS wants you. But the underground wants\nyou; because they know that you will try the best to save people, as many as you can. And if\nthere another woman comes there which 1s a sadist, she will have the pleasure to do it. So\nthere is no way. They choose you. The underground choose you. You have to take. And\nit's up to you how you will manage.\" What can I do? So they took me to the camp. And the\nLagerkommandant, Kramer'!--which was a man of six foot six, with hands like that--he said,\n\"Here you will be Lageraltest.\" And I looked in. There was empty barracks, nothing in it.\nNot bed, no straw sack, no blankets, nothing. And I said...clapped my feet and announced\nmy number, and I said, \"Lagerfthrer, please. Here you want me to be, that next day or the\nThursday you can call all the woman 'Jewish swines.\" Because they're...where can they...\nthey will sleep on top of each other, and they probably won't be able to go to the toilet and\nthey will make on each other!\" So I said, \"Why don't you send them straight away to the gas\nchambers?\" And I said...and he said, \"Why you worrying so much about the other people?\nWorry about yourself, that you take care of yourself!\" And I...but wonder of wonders...\nNow I tell you, I don't know who was talking from my mouth. I said again, that ceremony...I\nsaid, \"If you, in reverse, would be in charge and you will be a Lager oldest; and the prisoners\n'' SS Hauptsturmfiihrer Josef Kramer was Kommandant of Birkenau from May 1944, when the\nHungarian Jews began arriving, until December 1944, when he was transferred to KL Bergen-\nBelsen by Rudolf Hoss.\nwould be your fellow Germans and you wouldn't help them, I would call you 'Coward.\"\nAnd I said it. I said, \"My goodness! Magda, are you crazy? Whom you talking? This is the\ncommander who whenever somebody he doesn't even like or who is just in his way, he grabs\nit by his neck, squeezes it a minute, throws them like a doll. And he is killed. And you\ntelling him what is?\" But I stood straight, and I said, \"Be strong, and don't move from this\nspace.\" And he looked at me, and he saw I am not shaking. I am not crying. I am not\nbegging. He says, \"You know what? You are right. Tomorrow you will have what you\nwant.\" So I said, \"I want beds. I want straw sacks. I want blankets. I want um a utencils to\neat; and I want spoons.\" \"OK. Have it.\" And I said, \"And I want some woman who...who\nwill be in charge. In every barrack is thirty barracks, and I want some thirty girls which I\ncan have which I want.\" He says, \"Have them! Just tell them which one you want, and have\nthem.\" So again, miracle [of] miracles, they thought--you know, the news traveled--that I\nam the protegee of Kramer. But that's nothing. Never mind. I couldn't do...I couldn't just\nsave everybody. I can't... couldn't, but where I could. I was running up and down from\nmorning to evening. Where I could, I explained, I begged. I...I ...1 watched the...the...the\ngirls in charge. I said, \"You try your best. If not, I personally punish you.\" And I did. I\ncame in; and I saw that the girls didn't take care that they should have the proper kind of\nfood. And they was a little bit [leger (ph)] on it. So I called them to the front whereI __..\nAnd I said, \"You are going...\" There was water for in case there will be fire; so it was from\nthat it would be taken, the water. \"Around that water,\" I said, \"you are going to jump.\nBecause you are here for helping, not for making yourself comfortable. You saw me\nrunning from morning 'til evening to the camp Birkenau. You saw my feet um swollen like\nthat. You look at my face, how it's swollen. You I picked and choose, and I took you out\nfrom maybe you wouldn't be alive. So you do your duty. And now this was a punishment. I\nknow you are my friends, and I know you will be angry at me. But you will remember,\nbecause it's still better like a SS man would come in and something is not in order.\" So that\nwas it. But this why I said I was so strict on my own friends. But one girl um who who was\na...she could write poems, she got a paper and she wrote a long poem about me, to me. That,\nyou know, she appreciates that she knows what I am doing and it was wrong for them to be\nnegligence, a little bit. But, you know, persons 1s like that--1f he can make himself the life\neasier, he is. But not with me. So one day Commander Kramer came... Because here was\nthe women camp, there was a road and the next after the road was the main camp. And often\nthe woman husbands was in the camp. And they just arrived. So they screamed over to each\nother. Or sometimes the man, if he had a chance to get something extra, so he put it in a\npiece of paper um in in a rock and he threw it over. So...and he [NB: Kramer] found out that\nthey are doing it. So he put me in charge that I have to...Sunday when SS are not in, I have\nto watch it shouldn't happen. So I have to watch next to the um fence. I have to walk up and\ndown. But naturally I said to the girls, \"When I am up, down you can talk. And...but watch\nif you hear some automobile or whatever coming, or SS man.\" So the little runners which\nwe have watch it. One day Kramer came. All the girls disappeared. And he said, \"What\nare you doing here?\" I told myself, \"You know, you put here in charge.\" So I said--\nunbelievable--I said, \"I am...I want to go to the theater, and I am thinking what I am going to\nwear. I haven't got a dress. I haven't got soap. I haven't got a mirror. I haven't got perfume,\nand all those things which needed to the theater. That's what I am here standing and thinking\nabout.\" And you...would you believe? And he said, \"You are right! Tomorrow morning, I\nam coming to pick you up. And I take you there, and I get you all what you wanted.\" And I\ncame to the girls and I told them. So, you know, the tragicomedy...they started to laugh.\n\"Magda, are you crazy?!\" I said, \"What could I tell him? Should I tell him I do the duty?\"\nAnd I thought...I said a very bad expression. I said (laughter)...you know, and I said, \"I am\nnot going to satisfy that 'I am doing what...what you told me to be here,' because then I am a\nlittle crawling rat.\" And I said, \"No, I am not telling him. I am telling him the impossible.\nTomorrow he will forget it, anyway,\" I said. But you know, in the morning the runner came.\n\"Magda...Lageraltester, to the front! Lager Commander Kramer wants you.\" So I...I arrived\nthere. I announced myself. He said, \"So here Iam.\" And I said, \"But I need fifty people for\nthis.\" \"Fifty people?\" And I said, \"Yes. Fifty people or nothing.\" So he said, \"Have them!\"\nSo quickly I said to the runner, \"Bring the fifty people in the fifth...by the five, five, five...\"\nWhichever, whoever was the first fifty; and we went to the place that all the clothing was\ndone. I never been there before. I was standing outside. And I left the message through that\nthey should prepare little...um it looked like... How could I say? Like a big box, and in the\nfront was two sticks and here through; and you could um carry it like...you could wheel it.\nIt was um... How could I say? You know what I mean? So I said, \"Get me five of those\ntrolleys, or whatever you call it. And give the message all over they should put there soaps,\ntowels, medicines, blankets, clothings, sweaters. But pile it up to the full capacity.\" And\nthat's why I needed fifty; because to every one, ten woman would be able to to wheel it.\nAlright. It was all prepared. Suddenly Kramer came, and you know he brought me antique\nlittle um...like in on the boudoir you have it. It is a mirror coming here and back; and here\ntwo...two drawers. And he showed me. \"Here you have the soap, the perfume, the lipstick,\nthe comb, the brush. Everything.\" And on his hand, he had a most beautiful silk dress.\n\"And here is the silk dress. Do you like it? So now you have everything, and you can go to\nthe theater. Are you satisfied?\" I said, \"Very much so.\" And he pretended not to see the\nfifty woman. And he...I said, \"I take it.\" He said, \"No, I take it. I told you I bring you, so I\ntake you 'til your camp. And then I give it to over to you.\" And he came 'til the door, 'til the\nthe place of the camp. And then he said to...they're in charge, \"Let the woman through, the\nfifty. And when they are ready let them...the empty, and one with them is going to deliver\nthose back. And here now you can go to the theater.\" So quickly we wheeled that in in one\nof the barrack where I've been. It was a big foyer there empty, and I said, \"Unload quickly\nthe things, and um select the soaps.\" And all...all the girls I...I took which was there, the\nlittle runners, \"Come on, quick. Put the soaps here, the sweaters there, and then go outside.\nDon't say anything, but put the people in the rows, always by the fifty. Bring them in and\ndischarge them, this...give everybody.\" And I said, \"Everyone has to save it on the bed who\nwith him. The soap, the towel. One gets the towel. One gets the soap. One gets the...\" You\nknow, and like that; 'til we emptied everything. And nobody should know about that. It had\nto be done very quickly and very quietly. No SS man saw it. This was the second thing.\nThe third thing what he did: one day I should come to the front. The Lagerkommandant is\nthere with his black car, and he wants to discuss certain things with me. So I come there.\nGrese 1s...she became the Lagerfiihrer of our camp. The other side is Mengele; and here in\nthe middle with the car is Kramer. And he says, \"Lageraltester, come and sit in the car. I\nwant to discuss with you some matters.\" And I said, \"But um Kommandant, please. I am\njust a bloody Jewess. Here is Dr. Mengele. Take him in the car.\" \"Let him bloody walk.\nAnd you come and sit in the car.\" Grese heard that. She didn't believe her eyes. But you\nknow, my status symbol went high; because she thought who knows what I have with the\nKramer. But I still said, \"No, I better don't sit in. It wouldn't look nice.\" But, you know, this\nwas a old car which outside it had like a stand on it. I don't know if that cars are still in. I\nsaid, \"I better stand on it outside.\" And I forgot one thing. I forgot that I had the ring which\nthe War...Warsaw uprising people made. And they brought it in, in some miracle way. And\nwhen they heard about me, how I am to the people, they donated me. And that was also not\na easy thing to bring in, and I just got the ring on. So...and while I was, while I was standing\nI leaned with my hand on the car. And he said, \"What! You are wearing a ring of the\nWarsaw Ghetto uprising before me?!\" And he grabbed a pistol. \"I am going to shoot your\nhand with the ring up!\" And I said, \"I am in your charge. Whatever you want, you can do. I\nam just a bloody Jewess.\" He looks at me and said, \"Ah!\" He said, \"Ah, get away!\" And he\nput the revolver back. And all that, Grese saw. So, you know, these are the unbelievable\nbelievable thing. So now about Grese: like I told you, she became Lagerfthrerin in our\ncamp. And our contact was still the old contact. When I became there in the camp, I\ngathered all the doctors from the camp, they should come to me. And I said to..., \"Now Iam\ngoing to divide you. In every barrack will be how many you are, two or three.\" I can't\nremember, but minimum two. \"And you are watching, and you are going to help those\npeople. I am going to try to get some medicines, whatever. We can't do miracles, but\nwhatever. But you watch; and especially watch the mostly for an epidemic.\" And they said,\n\"And what we are going to do?\" So I said, \"What I am afraid is scarlet fever. And what you\ndoing with them, straight away came...come to me and tell me about it. And that person\nwho has that, put in the...\" Back of barracks was a room which supposed to be a washroom,\nbut they didn't finish it. \"So that will be the quarantine.\" So, suddenly, all the doctors came\nthat \"We found two,\" \"We found three.\" \"But now how to...we are to do with the\ncounting?,\" asked me the girls. So I said, \"Leave it to me.\" So it was summer...hot. Hot!\nThe sun was incredible shining, you know? Like I said, if it was as Satan...Satan was there\nin this place, in...1n Birkenau. So I approached Grese; and I said, \"Irma, look. Why should\nyou run around in this hot weather and do the counting? I am going to do the counting for\nyou, and you be comfortable. Sit down here in this room. And the report writer, and I will\nannounce her and she will count it up. And when it's all right, then you...\" \"You are right.\"\nBut she said, \"And what will do the Lagerkommandant in from the camp to mine camp?\"\nAnd I said, \"Are you Lager um Fuhrer of this camp?\" She said, \"Yeah.\" \"Then you do what\npleases you the best. And she has nothing to say in your camp.\" And she sat down. And I\nsent the runners down, and they put the legs down on the bed, you know? So it was easy to\ncount. And they counted, you know, like this. They didn't go out, because then it would be\nmissing. So nobody knew about it. And nobody should know about it. It was kept secretly.\nAnd so I did the counting for six weeks, 'til the scarlet fever 1s over. The worst part is six\nweeks. I did the counting, and Grese agreed with me. And it was always the counting right,\nso she didn't have any excuse. And that we saved thirty thousand people. Why I am saying\nthat, because there was a little camp across or across the road. They called that camp\n\"Mexico.\" It was B...zwei...drei, three.'* And there the scarlet broke out, and there wasn't so\nprepared. And eight thousand five hundred--healthy or not healthy--all went to the gas\nchamber. So that's what it is what I am saying. That you could be in function which was not\nvery pleasant--because always a Damocles [NB: Sword of Damocles] was hanging over\nyour head--but you had the chance to save people. I saved the people some other way, too.\nMengele came to select and often I had to be present. And he did it in the most unbelievable\nway. He was whistling the Donau Waltz. And he said (humming a bar of the Blue Danube\nWaltz), that means that went to the left. (Humming the subsequent bar of the Blue Danube\nWaltz), was to the right. (Humming from Blue Danube Waltz) And that was left, right, left,\nright--healthy, sick, that's how it came. He didn't touch anybody. He didn't! But he just\npushed them to the gas chambers good or bad. So what happened: when he finished um like\nthe selecting and he went away, so I run to the door. And I don't know, I couldn't...I couldn't\nsteal them all. But I just came like...like I would be in charge of it, and I cut a certain part.\nAnd I said, \"Turn backwards, and with me march.\" Nobody knew. Nobody knew. And I\nsaved that woman. Sometimes it was twenty. Sometimes fifty. Sometimes hundred.\nSometimes two hundred. And back to life. How long, I don't know. But the most um thing\nwith Grese was, that like I told you, before me she was good as gold. So much so that even\nshe introduced me her boyfriend. She had the boyfriends galore. She had the boyfriends,\nevery day somewhere else. Matter of fact, to point out, one day she came and she said,\n\"Magda, I have in the main camp a man. He's a prisoner, and I fall in love with him. And I\nwould love to visit him.\" So I said, \"Now, why don't you? You are in charge. Go to visit\nhim.\" She said, \"No, that wouldn't look nice. Because what I am doing there?\" So she said,\n\"But you come with me.\" I said, \"I?\" I said, \"Why?\" \"Because then I make it official. You\nare coming. We have some...something to finish up. And I put you there in the un like in\nthe schreibstube.\" In the... where the papers are done. \"You will be waiting there for me, so\nthey think you have some... Nobody will check.\" So I said to myself, \"Oh, you give me\n[there (ph)] occasions!\" So I sent right away my runners; and I said, \"Woman who has\nhusbands in the other camp, write quickly. We will organize some paper and pencils. Write\nquickly a few words and give it to me; because I am going, say two o'clock or three o'clock,\nand I take it with me.\" So I took the letters and I been there. And I asked the man in charge\nthere who was the writer... I said, \"Look, you have the number of the barracks. Please do\nme a favor. When they catch you, I am. But they won't probably ask you, because you just\ngoing like on official business. Take it to them. It's a letter from their wife, and if they...\nTake paper with you and pencil. They just have to write one or two words, because we\nhaven't got more time.\" And so I was a delivery man. A postman. Just because she had that\nfantasy on a certain man. So I show you that unbelievable. She needed me, I should go with\nher. So it was for a while I did it. And she even introduced me another boyfriend, what I\nthink about him. If I agree with him. She had every day another one. I don't know why she\ndid it. But she asked me, \"What you think?\" And he was a good looker--a tall, broad-\n'? Camp B3 was part of the Birkenau complex. The term \"Mexico\" was coined in the Spring of\n1944 because the prisoners assigned there wrapped themselves in blankets.\nshoulder. And he didn't look like a cruel man to me; but um yet you never know. So things\nlike that she did. But one day she was in camp, and suddenly the words was coming, the\nrunners: \"Magda, please! Come quickly! Quickly! Grese got...Grese got...Grese got\ncrazy.\" \"What is she doing?\" She's...with the whip, she's whipping the woman through the\nbreast. And it's opened all the breast, and it's blood running and the woman are crying.\nCome quickly!\" So I said, \"Oh, my goodness! That vicious, vicious, vicious witch! She had\nto do it when I am turned away?!\" So I came there, and I saw. And I said, \"Now you can be\nproud of yourself! What did you do? You know what you did? Imagine somebody would\ndo that to you!\" And I said, \"And if I don't get quick help for them, tomorrow they are\ngoing...or in an hour in gas chambers. Because they will get infected.\" So I quickly sent\nsome to the Revier, and they should at least give them First Aid. And she lifted the whip on\nme. So I said, \"Go ahead! Whip me! You like to do it. You like to do it for woman,\nespecially on the...on the bust. Do it to me!\" She looked at me, that I am standing there.\nShe put the whip down; and I said, \"I am offended!\" And I walked away. Would you\nbelieve it? I didn't believe it myself. And half an hour later, she came. And I pretended that\nI am offended still. And she said, \"Forgive me.\" She said, \"Forgive me.\" And the girls\nheard that. She said, \"Magda, I don't know, what you have a sypo...hypnotic um power\nover her or something?\" She [NB: I] said, \"I don't want you to see it once more again, what\nyou did before.\" I didn't. She did it somewhere else, but not before me. Imagine. Imagine.\nSo this so far I can tell you, she was the worse sadist ever been; and she wanted to be in very\nhigh. You know, that how good she is, how brutal she over does all everybody. And she\nlooked million dollars, because she was very pretty. And especially now, being always\ndressed--everyday immaculate shirts. A matter of fact, a cousin of mine was...I put her in\ncharge to work to wash her clothes, because in this way she was saved and she helped her.\nAnd everybody was happy. So every day, she was washing and ironing her shirts. So she\nwas starched collar and beautiful. But um...but then people said what she can do, she was\nterrible. She was terrible. But um that's how we existed together.",
        "A: I... knew. I knew. I knew about her lesbianism, because she wanted approach some of the\ngirls in the...in our camp too. But I, I heard about it. So I said, \"You can cleverly avoid it,\nbecause she has plenty other German woman and other woman. But why should she use a\nJewish woman to...\" And especially she liked dark-haired woman. She approach; and she\ntold me that Grese came and she told her. But, you know, you can um you can say it in such\na way it's too obvious. But I said, \"You be very diplomatic about it, not to offend her much.\nBut you just say that you don't know. Because you don't know that, because we don't know.\nWe never heard about it. 'And there many others who'd be willing, because you are so\nbeautiful.\" And so I know...I knew about it. But um luckily she didn't try with me; and like\nI told you, I warned the girls because I heard she is. She was having affairs one after the\nother, and even prisoner. It didn't matter. And one I was there...(laughter) That was a funny\npart. When we been in the experimental block, from some...from no reason whatsoever--\nbecause she wasn't in charge of that--she came and she said, \"Magda, came with me.\" I said,\n\"Why?\" \"Because I like a man in this...J know in barrack. And um I want to see him.\" But\nyou know what um the coincidence is and the irony is, when they delivered the food... I\nmust say something. I managed from Hauptsturmfthrer Wirths to ask that the girls had all\nday locked in, and they can go out and either to collect herbs or collect flowers and be a little\nbit on the fresh air. And he said, \"By all means.\" You know? And so the girls went out, and\na herbalist came and they collected herbs. And also they...also they always brought some\nflowers. And they been an hour or so outside in the fresh air; and the food, when they\ndelivered, the men--because they saw the girls out, so everybody picked one--and they... In\nthe kettle, when they lift it up between the food, they put a little either packets of some\nspecial food, or just a letter or a little present. And so a man send me letter on little parcel,\nand to...directed to me. And this is the man she picked (laughter) for liking. He wrote me\nlove letters which was... Yeah, love letters! He saw me just walking by. I didn't...I didn't\neven see him. He saw me. But then I found out that who he is, because signed the name and\nwe found out. And one day, she said, \"I want to go to this and this.\" And now we faced\neach other with this man who was writing me those love letters. And she said, \"You wait\nhere, Magda. I am going with him. And I will try if I can... You wait here outside.\" She\nwas waiting...I was waiting outside, and... But nothing came out of it. I don't know how he\ngot out of it; because he...he was um he was a Polish man, but he supposed to be um\nreleased. So maybe that's why he, he um... I don't know how or what, 'cause I didn't um go\nin detail. But um when she came out; and then in the next letter, he wrote me that she\nwanted him...to go with him. But he... (laughter) he just didn't feel for her nothing, so... So\nhe just wrote me. I, I don't know if they went; probably they went. I don't...but what, what\nthat made difference? He was...he writes me. Alright, I took his word. But I took with\nreserve his word, because he just wrote me letters. So never he mentioned anyway. So I tell\nyou those... those things, you see, incredible. Unbelievable. This was Grese. This was\nGrese. She could talk to me like...like a friend; and the next minute she was a devil.\nThat...that's what she was. A real devil. A sadistic devil. But she was so pretty, you know?\nThat's why they called her \"Angel of Death.\" That's about Grese; because I think that covers\nit, more or less. Now...",
        "A: I want to tell you about a French woman, because that has also something to do with the\nexperimental block. One day, arrival of um...",
        "A: No. No. I been in Birkenau.",
        "A: I am in Birkenau, and I am going to the \"Revier\"--so-called Hospital--with some woman to\nget some medication. Because we didn't dare to leave them here...there for long, because\nsoon as the \"Revier\" was filled, they went over to the gas chambers. So we are there, and\nsuddenly we heard woman singing the Marseillaise. And every...after two woman a police,\nan SS man with the... How you call it? I forget.",
        "A: With a rifle. And the whole camp had to turn to the face away from them, so not to get in\ntouch with them or they were afraid we will make a revolution. Ho, ho, ho. But this\nis...suddenly the...the girl who was in charge, the report um writer, she was looking for me.\n\"Magda, Magda! Where are you? I need you.\" I said, \"Why you need me?\" \"I want you to\ntake those French woman over. You will be in charge.\" I said, \"Oh, my goodness, leave me\nalone! I am now in so hidden. I want to have a little peace. But what you want?\" \"They are\nFrench woman. They are all politisch. They are writers. They are um doctors. They are\nnurses. They are professionals. They are... they all have red triangle, because they are\npolitisch. You want them to to get somebody who won't be able to handle them, and they\nshould die or or take them to the chambers?\" So she said, \"You take them.\" But I said, \"I\ndon't know French.\" You know, excuse. She said, \"Oh, my God, you don't know French!\nYou know 'essayez-vous,' or a few words. (Laughter) I know that you went to gymnasium,\nso what you telling me? And the rest, I leave it to you.\" Anyway, nothing helped. I went in\ncharge. First thing, I said, \"Who is speaking German here?\" So it was Maria Elise. She was\na journalist, and she spoke German. And I explained to her I didn't volunteer for that, and I\ndon't want that position. \"And it's not a pleasure. And the whole life here is not a pleasure.\nBut I am going to try to make your life as easy as possible, with your help. We have to\ncommunicate. We have to manage to help each other, because typhus is raving. Um\nflies...lice are there. Everything. Try...um take the hygienic as possible, with all the little\npossibility as it is.\" Because I...for example, when I didn't.... couldn't wash. So at night\nwhen the kettles from the tea was empty, so I emptied the left-overs from all the kettles and\npoured for that what was there. From that I washed myself. Somehow, I had to wash\nmyself. Because I knew how important is. And wet. Naturally, I didn't have a towel, too.\n(Laughter) Anyway, so I told...I told her everything, to explain to them. When is the roll\ncall, then roll call. When is to take food, then is taking the food. Not to hesitate, because\nthen they make life harder and I don't want to scream at them. I don't want to be cruel to\nthem. And so they have to help me. So they did. What I did the first day, I said to them,\n\"Tomorrow I am going to wake you up a little bit earlier because we are going to do\nexercises, because I believe that in healthy body is a healthy spirit. And the moral [NB:\nmorale] is very important.\" And I got up with them. And the rest said \"Magda, that crazy\nMadga! She thought that...(laughter) She's doing exercises. She's getting up earlier. She\ncould be in bed a half an hour!\" So I said, \"Never mind. Never mind. Let me be crazy,\" I\nsaid. \"I'm doing it.\" So...and the girls was very appreciative. And so much so that...that\nMaria Elise, she said ...after a while she said, \"Tell me, Magda. How could you survive\nbeing so human under such unhuman circumstances? I don't believe I could. I don't believe\nI could.\" So anyway, now I just give you a little backwards, forwards. After fifty years I\nfound out her name is Maria Elise Cohen, and I found out her address. And before I went\naway, I wrote her a letter. Because, you see, it works and I have to run backwards and\nforwards. It...1t takes two to tango. It's always working. You help somebody, it gets back\nto you. But I come back to that later. Just remind me; because I want to tell you when I was\nin the Barrack 10, the experimental block. So one of the girl...woman, of the French woman,\nwas chosen to be a doctor for these experiments. But she was the only one who refused to\ndo unnecessary operations. And she said...you know, like when we promise so to be a\ndoctor, so we are helping the others. And she's not going to do any operation which makes\nwrong. And not anesthetic...without anesthetic. If she can repair something which a woman\nhas, that she do. But not to make terrible things what they do. So they said, \"And you know\nwhat you are getting for it?\" \"Whatever I getting, I am taking it.\" So they said, \"All right.\nNow you are going to be placed in the Straf bunker... kommando.\" Which means a\n\"punishment kommando.\" But her being a doctor--tall and slim--she wouldn't survive a day.\nBecause those sadists would just make a toy out of her, because she was so clumsy probably\nin this work what she has to do there. So I got in touch--and it was always ways,\nunbelievable ways--to this woman who was in charge of report writer. And I said, \"Look,\nthis woman, Doctor Adelaide Hautval, is on the way to go to this Kommando. Please\ntransfer her quickly somewhere else, because she won't survive.\" So she transferred her...on\nthe way coming, she transferred her to that Revier. But the next day went a transport with\nFrench woman to Ravensbriick. So she added her quickly so nobody knew about her\nexistence. I didn't know about her existence for many years. Once I been 1n Israel, and there\nis a forest on honor of people. And I said to my husband, \"Let me have a look there at trees.\"\nHe said, \"There are hundreds of trees! What are you going to look for?\" I said, \"Never\nmind. Just let me for one minute.\" Because, you know, men are sometimes so impatient.\nAnd the first tree I see 1s Dr. Adelaide Hautval. The tree is donated from France on her\nhonor. I said, \"B\u00e9la, B\u00e9la, come quickly! Make a picture here.\" And he made a picture of\nme, and there was Adelaide Hautval. So meantime, I got her address from Dr. Lore Shelley.\nI don't know if you heard about her; because she wanted to know our experimental block\nand I helped her. And so I asked her, \"Do you by any chance know the address?\" So she\nknew. So I wrote Adelaide Hautval, and I sent her this picture. And she was very pleased\nwith that picture. And she said that \"I was surprised, because you looked so well. So I wish\nyou everything the best in the future.\" And so...so we been in contact with each other, and\nunfortunately she died. But the family of hers send me the announcement of her death, and\nso I sent my sympathy. So you know, it's going backwards and forwards. It's...somehow it's\nentwined. And now if you want to know further on, I was there in the...1n the Lager C:'\u00b0 and\nsome women went on transport. They was chosen people who had good hands, in certain\nfactories. Who had good eyes, I had to bring always to the front because some specialists\nfrom this factory and this factory came. And I had to um send out runners: Who had good\neyes? Who can see well? Brought them there. And he selected so many, and they went--\nwho had good hands, they are good with the fingers. And so lot of transport went; but\nunfortunately, a lot of people went to the gas chamber. Which I couldn't, by all my strength\n'S This was the women's camp designated as B2c in Birkenau.\nand influence, I couldn't... Because Eichmann was here. Not I was the one who dictated\nthe...the running of world. Eichmann did. Anyway, so the Lager finished abruptly; and\nKramer came for me and he said, \"Now, come with me. I am going to take you and you are\ngoing to work hard.\" I said, \"Like all others.\" \"No, you are going to work harder.\" So I\nsaid, \"This is my fate. I am going to work.\" And imagine, he took me to the kitchen, and--\nthe lager kitchen--and he announced to the SS woman um...um Schultz... No, I don't say the\nname because maybe it comes back. And he said, \"Here I bring you a new kapo of the\nkitchen. She will be in charge.\" And she said, \"Fine.\" Franz. Did I said Franz before?\nFranz. Because we called her \"Franzka.\" Franzka. And um she had a sister there, too. She\nwas working somewhere else. And um I knew that there is a kapo, a German woman, who 1s\na lesbian friend--you know, because you knew those things--of a Lageraltester. A German\nwoman with a red triangle. And I said, \"If I take the position of her lesbian friend, how she\nwill handle the other woman? Because she will be mad; and mad on...on innocent people.\"\nSo I said to her, Franz...I said, \"Listen, I am not good in those things. I wouldn't even know\nhow to manage those things. She is doing a very good job.\" But I said, \"I would rather do\nthe counting out, the Lager office work. I'm good in that. I will count on the food. How\nmuch, so many.\" So she said, \"But what will the Lagerkommandant Kramer says?\" I said,\n\"He will be satisfied.\" Like he would tell me, you know. I said, \"He will be satisfied.\" So,\nin this case, he said, \"Go and do the counting.\" And I was in the counting; and another\nwoman who used to be in the kitchen in the C, she was suddenly here and she didn't have\nwhat to do. She said, \"Can you help me somehow?\" So I said to Franz, to this SS woman\nFranz, \"Listen. There is so much work. It's two camps to handle and a little bit too much for\nme. Could I have another help?\" \"Ah, have how many you need!\" \"No,\" I said, \"one will\ndo. And now I can count wonderful.\" People didn't know why they suddenly got double\nportions. (Laughter) Because I counted so many. But it didn't last long. With me, it never\nlasted. I felt very comfortable there. You know, we...we did the counting, and...and I was\nhappy to know that people are happy. Suddenly, they called my number to the front. When\nyou call the number to the front, that meant that you are going to the Politisch [NB: the\nPolitisch Abteilung] and probably did something terrible, and they are going to kill you. All\nthe girls said goodbye. They kissed me, hugged me. And I went to the front; and here again\nKramer with his black car. And he said, \"Sit in the car.\" I sat in the car. So now, he said,\n\"Tell me what did you...\" It's a German expression: \"ausgefressen\" [Trans: \"chewed out\"\nor \"finished\"; colloquialism] Which means, \"what did you do wrong?\" What is special,\nmore than wrong. And I said, \"I did always to the best of the people and the running of the\ncamp.\" And he repeated it hundred times, and hundred times I said the same thing. And\nnow when we went to...in the car, so if he would go straight then that means he would take\nme to the crematorium. Suddenly, I see that he wents in. And that was again to the Camp C,\nwhere I was. Why I was afraid that when he said that \"What did you do wrong,\" because I\nstill had the letters which I didn't have time to deliver. And I thought they found the letters,\nand now the punishment will be gas chambers. But no...because he said, \"Step out. [Ranken\n(ph)].\". And he said once more, \"What did you ausgefressen?\" And I said, \"I did to\neverything to the best of the camp and the people.\" \"Is that so?\" \"Yes, that's so.\" \"So here\nyou will be Lageraltester again, but you will have a Weberei.\" That means, a Weaving\n[Room]. They...they will be weavers in the camp. So I became again Lageraltester.\nTAPE #4\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Yeah. As I mentioned it before, I was um returned by Kommandant um Kramer to Lager C.\nAnd there was a Weberei. We been for a while there. And in another Lager, in another\ncamp next to us a... It was emptied the camp. And there was a Lagerfthrerin, her...her name\nDanz, was her... And she was a terrible brutal woman. But the camp was emptied. And also\nthe girls, whom she was working with, um was free. So she thought she will put me down,\nand she will put the other girls on and herself. And she is push...and she pushes Grese out,\ntoo. So, yah. She came to the camp; and she says, \"Magda, you are not Lageraltester\nanymore.\" And she was watching me what I will say, I will beg for it. But I said, \"That's\nalright.\" So she said I will be um somewhere in a barrack. I accepted it. And the other girls\ncame on, with her together. But she was even more brutal than...than Grese; because she\nwas running like crazy all over the camp with the whip, and whipping left and right. I was\nvery sorry that is happening, but I had no way to stop her from it. But there was a German\num prisoner, and who was really a...with a black triangle which he was a thief sometime.\nBut he was sitting many years there. And he was saying there to a young girl, who he\nsometimes he rested in...1n her barrack; because it was the last barrack on the camp, and he\nused to come with the kommando there. And he had different privileges, so he asked if he\ncould rest there. And he told to that girl, \"I will fix her! Madga is coming back, and that's\nit!\" So it was really lasting three days. And after three days, I was back. Back again 1n the...\nlike...like Lageraltester. But it didn't last um very long, because it was coming already close\nto the march of January 18th [1945], when the death march started. But...and may I...?\nBefore I go with the death march, I have a few interesting things which I forgot. First of all,\nin Lager C--the first time--it was in one...1n two barracks was concentrated all the young girls\nwho was from fourteen 'til about seventeen. And in one of the barracks--and Mengele who\ncouldn't, you know, stand such beautiful girls, Jewish girls, being there. So just when one of\nthe barracks was emptied, either part went on transport or the other part into the crematoria,\nhe asked to transfer all the barrack from one block to Block 3. And there, at night, they\nsupposed to come for them to be gassed. He put there, in the front of the barrack, a post\nman. Not a post man--a SS man who was...he didn't have a big...a big function, you know?\nJust a ordinary man, who should um be there on watch. When I heard what happening, so I\nwent together with the report uh writer of mine. And I said, \"What can we do to save those\nchildren? After all, from no reason whatsoever, from there one day or 'nother they should be\ngassed. This is our future, if there will be a world. We need that generation!\" So I said,\n\"You know what? We are going to approach this man. And we will have a little chat with\nhim.\" Because it was already after the \"appell,\" the counting; and in the camp was no other\nSS man but him. So I started to talk with him. And I said, \"How are you\" and so so. And he\ntold me that he is going...tomorrow morning he is going to the Siberia, to the front. I came\nwith the news together, and said \"Oh, here is our chance. We have to do something.\" So she\nsaid, \"What?\" \"We have to get somewhere a bottle of schnapps and make him drunk.\" So\nwe found a bottle of schnapps. Matter of fact, at that girl's place where the German with the\nblack triangle used to rest. And he left a bottle, so next day he should drink. We...we\nsearched all the barracks 'til we came to that barrack, and there we find. So I said, \"Gerda,\n...\"\" She was...that was her name. \"...Go there with a cup and tell him, 'Have a little um\ndrink. Tomorrow you are going to the front. Be a little bit merry.\" So he had a little drink.\nAfter a while, I went and offered him a little drink. Again, Gerda. The fourth time, I gave\nhim the whole bottle. I said, \"Look, be merry! What...you know what happens. Forget the\nworld.\" He was already a little bit tipsy, so he didn't need much. And when he drank the\nbottle, he fell asleep. You know, he slammed down and fell asleep. I said, \"Gerda, that's our\noppor...opportunity.\" I went to the back of the barrack--which I told you there supposed to\nbe like a wash room, but wasn't. I knocked on the door. They opened the door, and I said,\n\"Shhhh...\" And I put the girls down in the five, about hundred a time. And then I just went,\nand I put the girls in every barrack. I said, \"You have hundred girls more tomorrow on your\ncounting, and don't say anything.\" And so by the hundred I took them, and I divided them\nall over the camp. And we left. When everybody was divided, we just left the barrack,\nclosed the door; and we went to bed. 'Til today, we didn't know how it is possible that\nnobody was claiming the girls and nobody claimed anything. If they killed the man, or they\nsent him to the Siberia anyway. What happened, we don't know. But one thing I know:\nthat in this way, we saved the eight hundred girls. And the eight hundred girl... Yah, just\nwith that thinking how can we overcome and play out at Mengele. Because I was so mad at\nhim that he did it. Anyway, but um later it was very interesting that... Um now I have to\njump ahead. On that death march when we been already um going towards Malchow,\u201d but I\nwill come back to it. So an SS man, in a orderly manner, approached me. And I don't know\nfrom what reason he asked me, \"What are you from profession?\" I said, \"My goodness me!\"\nI said, \"We are going to Malchow. What do I need to have profession?\" \"No, no. I need,\nbecause I have forty young girls here. And I want you to be in charge of the forty girls.\"\nAnd that was a part of those forty girls. Where the other girls are, I don't know; but I just\nrecently heard that they are still... A few of them, I don't know where else or how many, are\nliving in Israel. So this is the one thing which I thought I will mention; because it was not\nsuch a easy thing. How when we went to sleep 'til we woke up, we thought, \"My goodness!\nIf they found out...\" But they didn't, thanks heavens. Then (cough) the other thing which I\nforgot. In Birkenau, one um day I was called again to the front. Always called to the front.\nAnd the Lagerkommandant said to me that a Russian um village is coming here as an\nexchange for the Russian...for the German generals. \"And we found in the papers that you\nare a kindergarten teacher, so you will take over this whole um Russian village except the the\nwoman between eighteen 'til thirty-five. The rest--the little babies, the pregnant woman, the\nwhole, the old ones--belongs.... Um, you will take them over.\" So I again open my mouth;\nand I said, \"In this case, if I have to take over Russian village who has to be exchanged for\nRussian general, so I want.\" And I put conditions. I said, \"I want them to be bathed daily. I\nwant them to have not to stand on the app...on the counting. I want to pick um sixteen girls\n'* Subcamp of Ravensbriick, located near Mecklenburg.\nout from the Russian woman to be my helpers. I don't want to them to stand \"appell.\" And I\nwant them to get the food of the German SS.\" You know, I was waiting; and I was thinking,\n\"Madga, you crazy?! What you are...(laughter) What you are asking? Who are you to\ndemand?\" And he said, \"OK. You get it.\" And so I got the Germa...the Russian village,\nwith the little babies to the old woman. And, naturally, didn't take them long to find out that\nthe...how the other people lived and how they lived. So they um...really, they admired me;\ncarried me around, took me to the...to the room. And they said they will take me to\n[batushka (ph)] Stalin. They take me to Russia to show me to Stalin. Thanks very much. I\ndidn't know then (laughter)... I didn't know what Stalin is, anyway. And so they stayed with\nme, and they was very grateful. One thing, which is a cruel thing of the Germans; that one\nday they gathered all the children from about um four or six, and they send them to\nGermany. And matter of fact, Grese, you see--who always was telling me things... She said,\n\"You know where they going? They are going to Germany, and they will be um...they will\nbe given away to um the farmers, who hasn't got children, for adoption. In a few years, they\nwon't even know they are Russians. And they, the parents, will have a new genera...new\nchildren.\" Anyway, and um also anoth...another occasion, Grese told me, \"You know why\nwe are putting Jewish woman in charge? With all the strength which you wouldn't want to, I\nknow. But imagine, if the war will be over and the Germans are losing, so they won't...they\nwon't remember the SS. But they ... Because they don't see them so often. But they will\nremember those girls with whom they been everyday, and who had such a hard position,\nwhen they are so hungry, thirsty and tired. And now comes a woman in charge; and maybe\nshe raises her voice or demanding. Her, they will remember! And that's what we want. We\nwant to be unknown. If we either um not succeed, but we do succeed.\" I tell you, she said.\nAnyway, this was the other thing. And now um coming back, um... So that was the\nRussians. I really did...um we went to [bombard (ph)], and they had a beautiful food. And\nimagine, the whole camp was saying, \"Magda is crazy! What she is doing, nobody can do\nthat like her! Demanded Russians should get the SS food, for the SS man!\" But anyway...\nThen we went on the march, which you heard it so many times displayed. So I'm not going\nto details, only...",
        "A: You want to...?",
        "A: Yah, so when we went on the march. So um before we went, so they broke in the kitchen.\nAnd the girls, they took what they could; because they knew what...they didn't know how\nlong the march will be and where they are going. So they took some um salami, bread,\nmargarine, sugar and salt. And they went; but naturally who... The..the SS men was\nrunning away, because they knew the Russian are coming close. So they...yah, they was\nrushing us with all the speed possible, because they didn't want to be caught by the Russians.\nAnd anyone who...who moved down to fix her um shoes or bend down for something, they\nstraight away um put her to death. And my aim was: \"Girls, we in the front.\" Because in the\nback, they was shooting everybody. And um the girls was carrying the...that we found there\nsome rucksacks in the store room; and they, in the rucksacks they put the food. But it was\nheavy to run and to carry; so slowly, they threw most of the food away. And what I asked\nthem to keep is margarine and sugar, because this time we thought that this is the source of\nenergy. And so we marched, and we came to Ravensbriick. Ravensbrick...um we been put\non the floor, and there were just a huge tent. And in that tent, we been in without food, on\nthe floor--nothing, no mattresses, no blankets. The situation was terrible. I don't\nthink...many, many um lost their life. And I was very sick there. But, you see, again the fate\nwanted something. So I told you about the French woman who was so grateful to me, and\nthere was in Ravensbriick. Because they was, like I told you, intellectuals; and they was\nworking there in the offices. They found out that the Birkenau girls arrived. So... and they\ncame to the tent, and they looked for Magda. So they found me. They took me to them, and\nthey really brought me back to health. And they...they let me have [butna (ph)] wash. There\nthey feed me. They been...they gave me medicament. And so, 'til we had to march, I just\nwent to the roll call there. Otherwise, I been always in their barrack. (Cough). When it was\nthe time to march farther on, I was good again. But on the march, (cough) suddenly the\nGermans, they drove us to a empty um...like where the trees are. What is it? A...(cough)\n(Pause) Not a mountain, but where are the trees....",
        "A: Woods. They...they... Yeah, thank you. In the woods, and there was nothing. It was snow\nand freezing...just was an empty...empty barrack there. And they put us there, and they went\naway. And we been finishing nearly with that little margarine and sugar, which I every day\nmade a little bowl. And I divided to everyone which the group which I had. Like a hand\nwith the little chickens. I had always around me, you know, like a harem. Whom I couldn't\nhelp everybody, but whom I could. So it was getting to end, and we been very hungry. And\nI was um, you know, dozing away in the weakness. And suddenly I had a dream. And in the\ndream, my mother came. And she had a big dish, with fresh beautiful um cakes what you\nmake for Saturday, you know? From butter, butter and milk and little...round little cakes--\nlike roll-types. And I want to grab one in my dream, and she is pushing it always away.\nAnd I said Mom, \"I'm so hungry. Why you taking it away?\" She said, \"Because I want your\npromise.\" And I said, \"What is the promise?\" \"Promise me when you marry and you will\nhave children, you will bring them up as Jewish children.\" And I, in my dream I said, \"My\ngoodness, Mom! Where I am alive? Where I am married? Where I have children? What\nyou want that promise, when I am so hungry?\" She said, \"You can't have it 'til you don't\npromise.\" And so I said, \"Alright, I promise.\" In this moment, somebody's touching my\nshoulder. And I open my eye. And the Russian woman--like I told you, they been very\ngood--and they already heard that in the woods are people from the um from Ausch...from\nBirkenau. And they...and when she heard, she was working like a nurse in the SS hospital.\nShe made a big bowl of peeled potatoes, like potatoes in the peel. She wrapped that all over\nin blankets, and she was going through the woods and was looking for me. And she found\nme. And she said, \"Magda, I brought here food for you.\" And this was when I was just\nreaching with my hands in my dream. And here I have my hand like that, and she is petting.\nAnd I open it, and here she offers the fresh boiled hot potatoes. And we been...you know, it\nwas the biggest delicacy. And that really saved our life for a while again. And so I say that\nit's never...like when you do something good, you never know when you are getting um\nrepaid with some goodness again. And that was it. Then um we marched, um and we came\nto the place Malchow, like I said. So I had the forty girls there. But meantime, there was a\ngirl who knew me um a few years ahead and she knew how I was. So she said, \"The forty\ngirls can hand to somebody else. But there is um many like thousands um woman, and they\nneed somebody to take care of them.\" So I was exchanged, and I became there again block\noldest. And again I was explaining the girls that we have to keep together. We are to help\neach other, and we will survive. \"And...and I will try to do everything you should get food,\nand I will make sure that everybody...nobody is left over. I divide the food evenly.\nWhatever I have, you have.\" And so it it was for a while. And suddenly the news came that\nDanz is coming here. So...and I saw her again with the whip running around the camp. So I\nsaid, \"Oh, my goodness! What could we do to stop her?\" But she made the decision herself.\nThey needed a a woman who would um divide people to go to work; and they called\nArbeitsdienst--\"working in charge,\" or something.'\u201d So um everybody wanted to be in that\nposition, because it's not that bad position. I didn't. And she choose me. She choose me. So\nwhen she choose me, I [NB: she] said, \"You know why I choose you? Because I have a\nrespect for you.\" And I said, \"Do you?\" \"Yes. You remember when I put you down as from\nLageraltester, and pushed you down and you wouldn't be maybe alive now. And you didn't\nfor one moment say \"Why,\" or beg at me that I should give you the position or nothing. You\njust accepted and you been proud standing there. And...and I have respect from you, that\nyou weren't afraid and you didn't ask or you didn't bring me or you didn't want to bribe me,\nthat all...that I should put you on. So I.... am picking you for that position.\" So I said, \"Now\nI have the chance!\" There was, you know, in all positions like that camp or prison, there is\nalways that you are looking... reading from the palm and all things. So while she got\nacquainted with me again, she told me all her story: about a brother she has in Siberia, and\nhow she's worrying about him and all those things. And I listened, and I said, \"Now is my\nchance.\" I looked for one of those girls who was also reading for my palms, and I told her\nthe story about the Danz and her brother, and that. I said, \"You have to be very careful.\nWhat you know the facts, but you don't have to make it obvious. You have to just slowly,\ngradually... Because you have plenty time; because while you are occupying her, she's not\ntrying...running around with the whip around.\" So she went around. And she um told her\nthis and that. But it finished up that, \"Oh, your brother is worrying about you.\" \"What you\nmean?\" \"Because he is in the Russian front.\" \"How you know?\" \"I can see it in your hands.\nAnd he is worrying you.\" \"What you mean, \u2018he is worrying you?' You mean he's worrying\nthat the war is to the end, and that I am like I am, doing that to the prisoners, and he 1s afraid\nthat maybe I will get the punishment for it?\" And she said, \"I don't know what you mean,\nbut that's what is written in your hand. That he is very worried, and he is really thinking on\n'\u00b0 NB: Labor Service.\nyou with all his heart. And he loves you so much, and he's caring for you and he's scared for\nyou.\" So, that did it. Next... And I was keeping away, meantime; I didn't want to know.\nAnd then she calls me, and she said, \"Magda, this woman is wonderful. Do you know what\nshe told me?\" And that and that. So she said, \"You think I should stop going hitting people\non... on the...with the whip?\" I said, \"I don't know.\" I said, \"I don't know. Um, is that your\nbrother's wish?\" She said, \"It seems to be.\" So I said, \"I leave it to you.\" But it left her this\nway; but I thought maybe she would think it over, because... So I found somebody else.\nThere is...was a...is a girl, she lives in Melbourne. She's a very good portrait artist, not a\nprofessional but.... And I came to her the next day, before she has a chance to reading her\nwhipping again. And she said...I said to her that, um, \"Oh, I have a very good um portrait\nwriter ...um painter, who thinks you would be very good um to make a portrait about you.\"\n\"She...and she thinks I have the face for it?\" \"Definitely!\" I said, \"Definitely. Would you\nlike her to come, and...and she will make you a nice portrait. It, it...she doesn't want\nanything. Doesn't cost you anything. You just have to sit and see. If you like it, good. If\nyou don't like it...\". But I knew she would like it. So that was it. I kept her from the street\nagain. And I said to her--Edith is her name--I said, \"Don't rush with the...(laughing) with the\npainting. But always show her your progress, because then she is interested.\" And one day\nshe told me, \"You know, this girl. She's very good. She's doing a wonderful job. I wonder\nwhen she finish? I am really anxious to see how it will look.\" And anyway, then I said,\n\"You know, you better make it now quicker. Because um that would not be good.\"\nAnd...and so she finished the um portrait. And she was very happy with it. And you know\nwhat? She never used the whip again. And I was very happy because, you know, such a\nwhip. It wasn't just a whip. With inside, it was uh like...like iron, you know, a certain thing.\nIt was...outside it was leather, but inside... When you got whipped with it, it really hurted.\nAnyway, and meantime the war was getting closer. And again they was rushing us out from\nthe camp and they wanted to us to go closer...um deeper in Germany. And on the way, it\nwas...the population was moving backwards and forwards with their baskets and with their\nfurniture and everything. And suddenly some Russian girls arrived. Because they found out\nthat we are marching, and...and they thought I will be there. And they knew that the Russian\nare coming close. So suddenly they been there. And they said, \"Magda, we came to save\nyou. And we are going. We are partisans. We been partisans, and we know how to hide a\nperson in the woods. We will make like a little hut for you, and we will hide you. Because\nwhen the Russian will come--which we have heard that they are very close--there, first of all,\nthey will rape you all...um like not one, but all. And then if somebody pointed that you been\nin function, then they will kill you. And I want to have a chance...we want to have a chance\nto explain who you are, and then we take you out.\" So first, I...1 was arguing; because I was\nthe hand with that little chickens. So I argued, and I said, \"I want to take girls to hide.\" She\nsaid, \"Magda, you ask the impossible! How...then we had to make a real...not a [place to]\nhide, a bungalow. A bungalow! So we can't do.\" Anyway, on the end, three. Three we\nmanaged, and they really hide us in the woods. They made branches, and so we been inside\nlike in a cocoon. And the Russians soon arrived. Meantime, before they arrived they um\nstopped in a... Uh where ...where they made um flour. No, how you call it?",
        "A: In a mill. And in the mill, they was... They run away, the Germans; but there was a store\nroom of everything what you think. In the cellar: food, meat, everything. They had supplies\nfor years there. Anyway, so they always brought us something to eat. Meantime the\nRussian arrived. And they settled in this mill, because it was so big. And they settled in; and\nthe girls, they used the opportunity to slowly brought them to the idea that...about me, and\nthat how now they was explaining how I was to them and like a mother, like a this, like that.\nAnd when that was explained, so they came to pick us up. And when they came to pick us\nup, so they put us to the head table. And, you know, was like personality plus I was. And\nwhen I wanted to help to cooking, you know, how because there was a lot of... So he said,\n\"No.\" You know the Russians said, \"Nyet.\" You know how they said, \"Nyet. You sit down.\nYou have the celebrity. You did a very important thing for our Russians. Now the...let the\nothers work.\" So that was that. But naturally they had to continue their journey; and we\ncontinued, too. And then we came to a place, and um where all the Czechoslovakian people\ngathered. And now they started to bring them with the trucks back to Czechoslovakia, 'cause\nit wasn't very far. But I can't tell you the place, which is not important. Anyway...but what\nhappened: there was a lot of Hungarian girls, and the Hungarian girls went on the\nrampaging, you know, in the houses and... How you call it? Um, stealing the jewelry and\nthen the bed and carpets and everything. So the Czech girls, they said um they are very\nupset about those girls and they don't want with those girls to go home. First of all, the\nRussians wanted them to send to Siberia and to work, or to the harvesting. So and they came\nto me: \"Magda, listen. They are sending us to harvesting! We want to go home, and see\nwhat...if somebody is alive. And we work enough. We don't want again.\" So I went to the\ncommander; and I spoke by the time, you know, very well Russian. And I told them, \"They\nare not your enemies. They... they been Jews. That's why the um Hungarians threw them\nout. Now you want them...to send them to work to Russia, because they are enemies of...of\num...like of the Russians. Like they are like friends with the Hungarian! They are not\nHungarians. They are Jews who suffered because they are Jews.\" So they...he said, the\ncommander, \"Yes, you right.\" Then they wanted to send the girls to work in the meat\nfactory. So again they came. \"Magda, what we are going to do? They send us to the meat\nfactory!\" So I again went to the commander. And I said, \"Look. They are girls who live\nthree, three and a half years, two years concentration camp. And now you want them to\nwork here? Isn't that enough German woman here who was living here in comfort? Take\nthem!\" And he said, \"You're right!\" And so I saved those also. But then they didn't want to\ntake the Czechoslovakian girls home, the Jewish girls. So a woman, like a older woman,\nfrom my hometown, she said, \"Magda, you have to do something or they will leave us here.\nThey will take the Czech people, and be...leave us here under the Russians and between the\nGermans. What will be our fate, I don't know. You have to do something. You have to go\nto the Committee of the Czechoslovakians.\" And... and I said, \"Please leave me out. I was\nsweeping enough. Let somebody sweep.\" And, you know, that's a song like that... (singing)\n\"that I sweeped already enough.\" Anyway, so she said, \"But this is the last time you have to\ndo something.\" So I went there...(laughter) I went there to the Committee; and I said, \"I\nheard that you are sending away the Czech girls, but you are not sending the Jewish girls.\"\nAnd...and he said, 'We haven't got enough trucks.\" And I put my hand on the table, and I hit\nthe table so that the papers all jumped up. And I said, \"If I would be a cousin of President\nBene\u00a7S, then would be trucks for me. But because I am not, I am only a Jewess who was a\nvery good citizens for the Czechoslovak Republic. We been honest and right citizens, and\nyou threw us out like rubbish. And now, after the war, you don't take us back? This 1s not\nfair.\" And he got up; and he says, \"I am the cousin of President Benes.\" And I said, \"Then\nyou are going home. But we are going to stay here?\" And he looked at me and he says,\n\"The first trucks which arrive, you will be on it.\" I came there; and they say, \"Oh, Magda,\nyou saved us again!\" And that's how it finished up. And that goes the story now, which 1s\nnot important, how I meet my husband.",
        "A: You would like to hear it? So we arrived in Prague, and I announced right away I want to\nPalestine. I didn't...I didn't even think on B\u00e9la, or something. But I thought, \"I am going to\nPalestine. I'm not staying in this place where they threw me out like dirty linen.\" So while I\nam signing all the papers I am going to Palestine and everything, from far away--because it\nwas a huge room and there was hundreds of people there--somebody screams. I know he\nwas a doctor, and I know from what town he is. And I don't know how he knew; but he says,\n\"Bela is alive!\" B\u00e9la is alive. Fine. And um...and he said, \"You should go after him.\" But\nhe screamed that over hundreds of people, you know. (Laughter) He screamed, \"Ah...\"\nAnd I...you know, I listened to that. And so I...he told me, while...while he told me that I\nshould look after him. And he told me that he has a sister in a certain place, the first thing I\nshould go there. When he came home, then...",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: B\u00e9la! When B\u00e9la came home to Prague, so girls told him on the station, \"Magda is home in\nher home town.\" Everyone told him that Iam home. They saw me here. They saw me\nthere. They saw me there, and they saw me there. So as he heard that I am home, so off he\nwent to my hometown. Meantime, because he said the first thing I should go to his sister's\nplace, so I went there. I am coming there; and they said, \"But he is looking for you in your\nhometown!\" Anyway...so I was there a few days, and then I went to my hometown. I'm\ngoing home, and he is coming back. (Laughter) When he came back and found that I went\nhome, so he wrote me a letter. And I should straight away come, because he... So...so I\ncame back to _ilina, was the name; but I felt very awkward to live at his sister place, who\ndidn't know me ever. And...and I had there some friends from my hometown, so I went to\nlive there. I thought, ''Til B\u00e9la comes home, I don't want strange people.\" But his nephew,\nwho was twelve years old, he came to pick me up. And he said, \"You know, Magda, my\nuncle loves you very much.\" (Laughter) He 1s...he was a tall boy for twelve. And he says,\n\"And he is the best man on the world. So please don't run away from here, because he will\nbe very unhappy. So come with me, and wait till he 1s coming home.\" And that child didn't\nmove 'til I didn't go with him. And he was going with me to swimming, to exercise, to um\nthe pictures, whatever, 'til B\u00e9la did came home. And so then I...that night I stayed at their\nplace, and at night B\u00e9la came home. And then he saw me, he grabbed me in his hand, run\naround in...in a...in the... Because he was happy. And that's we...how we met; and the rest is\nnot so important anymore. But that's how we met anyway. And um that, matter of fact, I\nthink finishes up. Because there was so many other stories, which I go away for hours. But\nI think the most you heard. You heard enough.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. When, when we...when we met then, then I said, \"I'm not going to stay here. We\nhave to move away from here.\" So we went first up to Prague, and we booked in the hotel.\nHe, meantime--that's why he went away, because he wanted to earn a few...few crowns that\nhe would have. And because for those who been in camp, there was a possibility to get\nsomewhere...like to settle, to start. A new start, because we didn't have a penny. So, so we\nwent. But B\u00e9la, being as he was--broken down, lost his wife and child--and something broke\nin him. He didn't have that really business sense, or... So he didn't pick a big factory, or big\nshop or whatever. He picked a little...in a little town. On the end of the town, a little house\nwhich used to here have a woman whose husband was working and she was doing the\nrepairs and meantime she was selling something. A little... So when...when I saw that what\nhe choosed--because he wanted away from people, you know? He suddenly didn't want to\nsee many people. So I...I told myself, \"That little place! Couldn't he pick something bigger,\nthat we should have a chance?\" Because it was all empty. We had to run away for material,\nand...and get things done. And ...and you know that place had stairs like that. Spiral stairs.\nSo I had run up and be in the shop and cook. And...and...and sometimes customers came in,\nand...and I was running down. And I said, \"Don't worry. You can't touch anything, because\neverything is on wire. And when you touch anything, it's...(laughter) it's um ...the bells are\nringing upstairs. So, and tell 1t to everybody,\" I said. Sometimes I had to go up; but I know,\nand then I know. And, you know, you can tell people and they believe you. And they\nbelieved me. Anyway, so they didn't touch anything. And um so we started to work it up.\nBut, you know, because really with hard work and with friendliness, with our personality, we\nbrought people from...from the town to the end of the town. And so we started to do a little\nprospering. And then I was um pregnant with my first child...was our first child. And when\nI was in hospital even... This time, in Czechoslovakia, they made, you know, from feathers a\nlittle...like um feather [bed] and this is like--like I said--like a wurst, and here it gets over and\nyou have to attach things. And the baby is inside; and here is lace around. And when Maya\nwas born, so baby...B\u00e9la made it up and brought in. And there was a woman who didn't\nhave that thing, and she liked it very much. So B\u00e9la said, because he was so happy, he will\nmake [for] her. But then it come to pay, because he didn't have it for nothing. So worked\nout that her husband is a very high um in this business to checking everything; and...so he\ndidn't want to pay. And when B\u00e9la demanded he should pay, so he send a committee and\nthey gave us a punishment. A financial big punishment. Imagine! I said, \"B\u00e9la, you see\nhow it happens. When you're good and good-hearted, somebody--not that he doesn't say\nthank you because you made it for his child. He makes us all our saving and our hard work\nwent on...on it.\" And here we been, and somebody on top of it was jealous because we\nbrought all the customers there. He wanted that shop. So they took away the shop. So then\nI went again to Prague to demand that what happened, and with no reason they took it away.\nSo we gave another shop. But now was the question that they wanted...it came a change,\nand they wanted B\u00e9la to be a member of the Communist Party. He didn't want to be. So\nthey closed him out from the party, without being in the party. And they said...again they\ntake all the business away, because if he is not a member... So I said, \"What you mean?\"\nThey said, \"You can have it, if you divorce him.\" So again...so we had a lot of bad luck like\nthat. The fate wanted to see how much I can endure. And naturally then we got another\nlittle... I was running after this member and this member, and we got another little business.\nBut B\u00e9la had to travel, and it didn't bring much money.",
        "A: And then I decided...I said, \"Look. You...you are not a communist. And whatever will be,\nthey will find out a reasons of you.\" And they was...did find out. They said that he wants to\noverthrow the government; which I said, \"I didn't know he was so smart.\" (Laughter) I said\nthat to that man who...who said it. \"I didn't know my husband is so smart.\" You know, I\ncould always talk. But um...but that didn't help me. And then Israel started, so I said, \"We\nare going to Israel.\" All my life, I wanted to go. All my friends and relatives said, \"In this\ntime, beginning with a baby of one and a half and three, you are going to Israel? You know\nwhere you will live? In tents on the sand.\" I said, \"I don't mind. Israel was um born, and we\nbelong there.\" They said, \"But you can't...you can come with us first to Australia, and then\ngo to visit Israel when you made already money.\" And I said, \"If everybody would say it,\nwhere would Israel be?\" So I think, \"I'm going:\" and we went. And naturally we was being\nin the camp in the tents. Wasn't the best thing. So the only thing was that I...I uh said that I\nwant a kindergarten job. So I went to the directress, and I said, \"Would you give me a\nkindergarten job?\" And she said, \"Can you speak Hebrew?\" I said, \"A few words.\" But he\n[NB: she] said, \"So how do you want to be a kindergarten teacher?\" I said, \"Did Danny\nKaye talk with all the children, with all the nations which he didn't know the language? So I\nwill be!\" So she looked at me. \"I give you a chance. I go in that camp, and I take all the\nteachers out and the helpers. And you go in. If you survive ten minutes, you get it.\" I went\nin; and in ten minutes, the children was on the floor and on top of me. And we been\nlaughing and giggling. So she say, \"Ah, have it!\" She made, \"Oh, have it.\" So that's how I\ngot ajob. And I need a job most of it because the food wasn't made for Europeans. It was\nmade for Africans. And for a little baby of one and a half, she started to get sick. But then\n[...as I was on the staff, so I got the food of the staff. And, you know, a mother is never\nhungry when it comes to it. And I said, \"Could I take the food to her home, when I will be\nhungry?\" She said, \"By all means. Take it!\" And so I brought the food home, divide it\nbetween the children and B\u00e9la, and what was left was mine. I was so skinny...",
        "A: Um first...and then we went to live in um Holon. And then again I put um my furniture out,\nbrought a kindergarten in; and then again the kindergarten out and the furniture in. And B\u00e9la\nhad to go always to the military service, which he didn't like very much because he wasn't as\nyoung anymore. And one stage, he was there for a month. And it was terrible; and they\nbeen attacked and then it was it was wet and everything. And meantime, my cousins from\nAustralia send the papers. \"Come to Australia.\" And B\u00e9la came home. He said, \"Send the\npapers.\" My cousins wrote, \"You have to wait anyway for two years, so...so then send it\nquick as possible.\" We send the papers; but a fluke luck, in six weeks we had the papers to\nmove. So that's...1n'65 we went to Australia. But again, without a penny; because the place\nwhat we had we sold, and that was just enough for our journey. We arrived again penniless.\nSo, again a hard time. Hard time all the time. But I never lost faith. We brought our\nchildren up in a very good way, and they are...they... Because they had to work. They had\nto help me to clean to the place where the children... And they helped. They had to wash the\nfloors. And the neighbors said they know better the bottom of my children than the faces.\n(Laughter) And that's happened.",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: Yah. Must still be a little wet. Yeah. Can I take my glasses?\nPAUSE",
        "A: (Reading from paper) My number is 2318. Under this number, I survived and endured\nunbelievable dehumanizations, beatings, screams. I suffered all kind of sicknesses. I had\nmalaria. My Lager sisters took me to the Revier (kind of hospital), so I could at least rest a\nlittle. But rats been running around me, biting on my toes. So I asked my lager sisters to\ndischarge me rather to the barrack. The same day, unfortunately, the whole Revier been sent\nto the gas chambers. I had typhoid, and all different sicknesses. As a consequence, I lost my\neyesight, my hearing. I couldn't walk. I was many times close to be sent to the gas\nchambers. By one occasion, I was one the track together with other victims on the way to\nthe gas chambers. Against all the odds, I lived through three and a half years; first in\nAuschwitz, then in Birkenau. My hair been cut many times, with blunt scissors so after my\nhead was always bruised. On a chair, (looking up) I was telling you already that, (reading\nfrom paper) um while laughing men been cutting or shaving everywhere where hair was. On\nSS order, all my possessions were taken away. And I was dipped in murky water in large\nbins, ten at a time. Then I stood wet and naked, shaking in the wintery cold \u2018til I got\nremnants after the Russian prisoner of wars. Cotton pants and top. On mine, all the buttons\nbeen missing; so I have to hold the top and bottom with my hands, not to lose them. And a\npair of wooden clogs. Before I start to tell my story, I wanted to mention this part as a start.\nBecause there are people, some writers, professors, scientist, who from unbelievable reason\ntry to deny that the Holocaust existed. They try to say Holocaust was only a hoax.\nUnfortunately, all the barbarism of the German SS, sadism, deceiving, the cruelty, was true.\nBelieve me. Often I feel I should ask from all those people why are they doing it. Wasn't\nthere enough our suffering? And now, on top of...on top those people claiming it should\nhave the last laugh? And a lot of followers? So I turn to you, all parents, to all the teachers,\nprofessors, scientists, preachers, priests, rabbis. Educate the children, the people, about those\nhorrors that the German nation under the Nazi system did to all other nations, not only Jews.\nI been witnessing that, nobody was excepted...exception. (Pause) Make the wrong right.\nBe understanding and helpful to those survivors. It's not right not to talk about it for shame\nor frustration. Some will say, \"It happened a long time ago--forty-five, fifty years ago. Let's\nforget it.\" But on the other side, they continue on thousands of places to preach two\nthousand years history about the Golgotha. Don't believe those so-called professionals\nwhose informations are coming from, to me, unknown sources who have the reason and own\ninterests. And who, for a lot of money, tried to persuade the world about the non-existence\nof the gas chambers. But would and could you, and you, and you, forget it, if you would live\nthrough all the horrors which changed your life, your career? We're tormented by\nnightmares. When you close your eyes, you relive the misery again and again. So you don't\neven go to sleep. And how about the millions and millions of babies, young, innocent\nchildren, people young and old? So, please! Don't minimize the Holocaust as a old story.\nBut try to work against it, that happenings like the Holocaust shouldn't have ground to\nhappen again ever. (Looking up) Finish. That's it. Hmmm?",
        "A: OK.\n"
