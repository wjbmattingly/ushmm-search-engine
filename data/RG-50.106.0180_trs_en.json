        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Helen Schwartz, conducted by Gail Schwartz, on March\n1, 2010, in Silver Spring, Maryland. This is a post-Holocaust interview, and so |\njust wanted to give out some of your information first. You were born Hela\nKirschner, April 8\", 1925, in L\u00e9dz, Poland. You were in the L\u00e9dz ghetto from\n1939 to August 1944. Then you were in Auschwitz from August 1944, and then to\nStutthof, to Proust, and many other places. And when you were on the march,\ntowards the end of the war, you were liberated March, 1945, near Gdansk.",
        "Answer: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. So let\u2019s talk now, what happened after that. What \u2014 where did you go after\nliberation?",
        "A: After the liberation, there was a small group of women, and we were liberated by\nthe Russians. They took very good care of us, they supplied us with food, with\nclothes, because we were almost clothes-less. Nothing that we had on was a sack.\nNo shoes, no nothing. The Russians supplied us with everything they could, but it\ndidn\u2019t take us long \u2014 w-we stayed in a group, maybe eight or 10 women \u2014 girls\nmostly, young women. And must be we ate too much food, or the dirt, because we\nwere invaded by \u2014 by lice, and two days, three days after, everybody fell sick. And\nby being sick, the Russians were afraid to come near us, and we didn\u2019t know what\nMarch 1, 2010\nwas wrong with us, because we probably had high temperature, and none of the\ngirls was probably normal, and didn\u2019t know what happening. But when the Russians\ndidn\u2019t come near us, we kept on asking, why don\u2019t we get any help, or anything, to\nmake us well? And we were told, either there were nurses, or they were \u2014 I\u2014 Is \u2014 to\nthis day I don\u2019t know who the people were who took care of us, that we have typhus\nfever. And nobody want to come near us, because they were afraid, the military,\nthat they might get sick, too. There was one woman who had a daughter my age.",
        "Q: You \u2014 you were 20 years old at the time.",
        "A: Yes, I was 20 years old at the time, yes, I \u2014 and there was one woman, as I say,\nand she spoke a little Russian. She ran out to get help, so we can go to a hospital.\nSoon after, a wagon with a German came, horse and wagon, and they put us all ona\nwagon, and supposingly we went to a hospital. But it wasn\u2019t a hospital, it was a\nschool converted into a hospital, because there were many other women from other\nareas, which I \u2014 I \u2014I still don\u2019t know where they came from. And they put hay on\nthe floor, and we were laying on the hay, with no pillows, with no nothing, but all\nwe wanted is help. The Russians did a lot for us.",
        "Q: A-Are you still near Gdansk, still, at the time?",
        "A: Yeah, that was, yes, near the area where I was liberated. I can\u2019t account the time,\nbut after a while, they took us to another place, which was better than the hospital,\nMarch 1, 2010\nthe school hospital. And at that time we saw already Russian doctors, Russian\nnurses. But the Russians were so bitter, so upset, that they couldn\u2019t even \u2014 even\nstand if a German ca \u2014 if German woman or man came to help, to be on the same\nfloor at the time when they were there. Because the Russians suffered a lot too,\nfrom the Germans. And supposingly, I have no idea, but we tried to figure out why\nthe Russians were so mad at the Germans, that after, when we came back to\nourselves, when we \u2014 we \u2014 we were sick for two months. So I cannot count the time\nwhen we felt better, but I assume maybe a month, maybe six weeks. We kept on\nasking why the Russians are so mad at the Germans. And they said, they killed our\nparents, our sisters, our brothers, just as much as they killed your sisters and\nbrothers. But, after two months, we were released, and we were told \u2014 we were\nasked where we want to go. So I said, I want to go back to Lodz to find out who\nsurvived. And Red Cross took us over at the time, and they brought us back to\nLodz. L6\u00e9dz was just as bad as the place we came from, which, I don\u2019t know the\nname of the place, but was near Gdansk. We didn\u2019t have anybody, but I found a\nplace which was for me to stay, with some other people. And every day we went to\ncheck the list of the people who survived, and who came from L\u00e9dz. So I found my\nsister and my brother also survived. But my sister came after to Lodz, but my\nbrother remained in Germany because he was liberated by the Americans, and that\nMarch 1, 2010\nwas German territory. And where we were liberated was the Russian territory,\nbecause England, Russia, everybody took a p \u2014 a \u2014a part of, I think the country.\nShortly after I was reunited with my sister, because knowing \u2014 she probably\nchecked the list where she was, I checked the list where I was, and we got reunited,\nso I was with my sister shortly after.",
        "Q: Is this still in L6dz, are you \u2014",
        "A: And that was still in L\u00e9dz, yes, and we couldn\u2019t get in touch with my brother,\nbut people who I don\u2019t know what \u2014 they were not sick, or they were hiding, used to\ncom \u2014 communicate, go places. So we sent the message, through this person, to my\nbrother, who was in Ainring, near Feldafing, in Germany, that we both survive.\nWe are only two sisters, and we survive. So he sent back a message with somebody,\nnot letters, because at that time that was too early for mail, and 1t was such a mix-up\nthat it\u2019s hard to describe, but everybody just want to know who survived. That was\nthe most important thing. So the brother sent back the message, and he said, I\nsurvived and I am in this particular place, which was Ainring, by Freilassing. If\nyou could, come back to Germany, so we can be all together. Shortly, when we felt\nwe can travel, and the travel wasn\u2019t that you took a ticket and you went on the train,\nor \u2014 or airplane. What \u2014 travel, you had to find somebody who took you from one\nplace to another, until we reached the border of Poland and Germany, and then\nMarch 1, 2010\nsomebody else would \u2014 took us to the place where my brother was. We \u2014 we \u2014 we\ndid survive the trip, and we came back to Germany, which nobody liked to be in\nGermany, but we had no other choice, because we couldn\u2019t stay in pol \u2014 in portla \u2014\nin \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, in portla \u2014 we couldn\u2019t stay in Lodz because nobody was there. And\nthe place which we lived was torn down, because di \u2014 the place where we used to\nlive was very close to the gates where the ghetto started in L6dz. So we reunited,\nand we stayed in Ainring, with my brother and my sister. We stayed there from \u201945\ntil I came to the United States in \u201949. There I met my husband, and we got married.\nMy sister met her husband in the four years, and my brother got married. So we all\ngot married in Germany, and from Germany, the first chance anybody had, they\nwant to go away from Germany. So we all registered to America, to \u2014 to Canada,\nto Israel, and whichever came first, we \u2014 we went.",
        "Q: Were you in a DP camp?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: All this time, these four years?",
        "A: All those four years, yes. Some people went to live privately, but we went \u2014 we\nwere in a camp. And we were by the Americans. So my husband registered for all\nthe places which were available to go. He was a tailor, and my sister and her\nhusband and my brother \u2014 so the first to leave Germany was my brother, becauseMarch 1, 2010\nby choice, I don\u2019t know exactly how it worked. And he went to Canada. And we\nwere supposed to go shortly after. Then, my sister and her husband went to Israel.\nAnd when they came to Israel, they came right into the war, because they came in\n\u00b048, from \u2014 from the ship, my brother-in-law was taken to the army, and my sister\nwas left all by herself, and very, very sick and discouraged, because we left one\nwar, and came right into another war. And I stayed on in Germany, because I had a\nchild. I ha \u2014 I was the first one to have a child from my brother and sister.",
        "Q: But your brother and sister were older than you, or \u2014",
        "A: Yes, I was the youngest in the family, but I had a child the first. My child was\nborn in \u00b047. I married in \u201946, a year later I had my daughter. And with children,\nnobody was very happy to take. Israel didn\u2019t want anybody with children. They\ntook only young people, because there was a war, and they wanted people to go to\nwar with no children. And by that time, my brother was already in Canada. And he\nsaid, be patient, wait, and I\u2019m trying to get you to Canada. That was my brother.\nMeantime, there was a opening to the United States. And we were very happy. At\nthe time, it was HIAS who was working to \u2014 to bring the people to the United\nStates. But there was a nice family in Portland, Maine, which at that time I didn\u2019t\neven know what Maine was, and they needed somebody to work in a clothing\nfactory, and my husband signed up as a tailor. So, we were chosen to go toMarch 1, 2010\nPortland, Maine, and we were very, very happy. Came to Portland with a two and\na half year old child. And the man who signed up for us to come to Portland, I \u2014\nwas one of the nicest people. He supplied us with an apartment. My husband was\nright away paid 40 some dollars a week, which I thought I am a millionaire, because\n40 \u2014 40 some dollars at \u2014 in \u2014 in 49 was a lot of money. And we were very happy\nto be in America. So my sister was in Israel, my brother was in Canada, and I was\nin America. We were not happy about it, because we want to be together. So I was\nthe one who was saying, I\u2019m going to start doing something. Maybe I can bring you\nto America. My sister said, oh I would like you to come to Israel, and my brother\nsaid, you \u2014 I would like you to be in Canada. But, it took a long time, and\neverybody already had settled in the places where they were, so my husband didn\u2019t\nwant to leave Portland, Maine, and my sister didn\u2019t want to leave Israel, and my\nbrother didn\u2019t want to leave Canada, so we were all separated. In Portland, I had a\nbeautiful life. The people were so nice, and they were not all Jewish. Even the\nGentile people, they accepted us like we were somebody special. They came \u2014 they\nwas quite a few families who came to Portland, but they didn\u2019t stay on, because at\nthat time, the people who came to Portland, they were single people. And for\nsingle people there wasn\u2019t really much to do in Portland. And the majority left,\nafter a while. But three, four \u2014 four families were left in Portland, who hadMarch 1, 2010\nchildren. And I came in \u00b049, in \u201951 my \u2014 my son was born in Portland. And I\nalready had two children, and life was beautiful. And I realized what a beautiful\nplace is to be in America. And as the years went by, I had another son, who was\nborn in \u201957, and this was that, and we were all settled in Portland. After my \u2014 after\nfive years, my husband worked for this man who signed it up for us. In gratitude, he\ndidn\u2019t want to leave him, but he always want to be on his own. So, after five years,\npay him back what this man did for us in Portland, we opened a little shop for\nourselves, which was a tailoring, clothing, like Mom and Pop shop. And I helped\nmy husband, and we were there for \u2014 for almost 40 years, until my husband took\nsick, and my husband died in 2000. After when I \u2014 and my kids, meantime got\nmarried and moved away from Portland. After 2000, I was left by myself, and very\nfew friends in Portland. I stayed on for another year in Portland, in Maine, and\nmy daughter who lived in Virginia at the time, said \u2014 and my son settled in New\nJersey, and already had families, and my daughter had families. They ask me,\nwhere do I want to go to be again together? So I decide I\u2019m gonna come near my\ndaughter. And near my daughter, I didn\u2019t want to be in a single home again, so I\nhave chosen to be in Leisure World, which I have no regrets, I\u2019m very happy, and I\nmade some new friends and I been living \u2014 it\u2019s been nine years since I came to liveMarch 1, 2010\nin Leisure World, and I hope, God willing, that I will have a few more years, and\nenjoy life in Leisure World.",
        "Q: Can we go back a little bit now, and I can ask you some questions?",
        "A: Yes, ma\u2019am.",
        "Q: Thank you for telling me your story. When you were liberated in \u201945, you\u2019re 20\nyears old.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did that mean to you? Do you remember what your feelings were, to get \u2014",
        "A: A feeling \u2014 it\u2019s very hard for me to describe. Like, you take a child, which I was\n\u2014 20 years is not a baby any more, but like you take a child who came out of the\nwoods, and lost. That\u2019s how I felt, with no parents, and before I united with my\nsister, life wasn\u2019t worth living. And I kept on asking, why did I survive, and what\ndid I do to \u2014 for me to survive and not others, or my parents. It was very hard. But\nwhen I re \u2014 reunited with my sister and brother, then life became a little better.",
        "Q: You were 14 years old when the war started.",
        "A: Yes, ma\u2019am.",
        "Q: So you really lost a good part of your childhood.",
        "A: I had no \u2014 [had no, like they say now, a young \u2014 how \u2014 how do they call it?",
        "Q: You mean, the teenage years?\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: Teenage years.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have teenage years.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 at that time, I didn\u2019t even know what that means, teenage years.",
        "Q: Right, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Because when we were in the ghetto, life was terrible. And thanks my brother,\nwho \u2014 he used to \u2014 I can say it now, he used to steal potato peel, and bring it home.\nSo my mother cooked it, every day she made something else. Some people were not\nas fortunate. But my brother was a fireman, and he \u2014 in the ghetto, he was \u2014 well,\nwe were working. I was working too, in the ghetto. But I was working in a laundry\nwhere \u2014 what the German who stayed in the ghetto, we washed the clothes for the\nGermans. And I never had done anything, because I was youngest at home, but I\nquickly learned how to iron, how to fold up the shirts, how to \u2014 the socks, and\neverything, because that was a special place, and not everybody was fortunate to\nwork in the ghetto, in a place like that. So I could get a portion of a little water soup,\nsupposingly, but it was more water than anything in it. But my parents worked, and\nmy sister, my brother worked. We all work. So that kept us alive. And having\nparents, that was another plus that we survive. In the ghetto, oh, I hate to go into it,March 1, 2010\nbut life in the ghetto was unbearable. Kids my age, very few survived. I was\nfortunate to survive because I \u2014 as I said it, I had my parents. And I didn\u2019t have\nmyself to fight every day, for that little piece of bread, because my mother used to \u2014\nmy mother used to ration. She didn\u2019t eat.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But she gave it to us.",
        "Q: Yeah. Right.",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t want to talk about it.",
        "Q: How did you find out what happened to your parents?",
        "A: If you \u2014 anybody \u2014 if anybody went to the museum, up \u2014 upstairs in the museum,\nthere is a cattle train. Leaving the ghetto, we all went on those cattle trains,\nsupposingly that we are going to another \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 place of work, better circumstances, everything better, so we all were happy to\nleave the ghetto, and to go \u2014 we thought we are gonna go with that train. But when\nwe saw those cattle trains, we looked at each other, and I \u2014 I went to my father and I\nsaid \u2014 I didn\u2019t go to my father, because we all stayed together \u2014 and I said, Dad,\nMarch 1, 2010\nwhat \u2014 what is that cattle train doing here? And he said, oh, they probably just\nstaying here. And the train for us is gonna come soon. The train for us never came,\nand we went on this cattle train. A night and a day after, when we embark from that\ncattle train \u2014 I don\u2019t even think it took a minute, and it was so bad, because half of\nthe people probably were dead, who were in that train overnight. The smell, and\neverybody relieved themselves standing. You couldn\u2019t even sit down or lay down or\nwhatever. Everybody was in standing position. So, when they opened the door, we\nwere happy to run out as quick as we could. And they made us to run out, but we\nstepped over other people. Mine father said that the best place is to be in a corner,\nbecause when we were on it, he direct \u2014 my father direct us to go to the corner,\nmaybe there is gonna be better, so we all stayed in the corner. But when we came\nout, we had to kind of haul over the people who are laying on top of each other.\nAnd when we reached the outside, within a split of a minute, or a second, it went so\nquick, mine parents went one way, and my sister, my brother went the other way.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay, girls, women were separate, and men were separate.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they said that because we want to run back to my mother\u2019s side, my\nparents\u2019 side, they said, no, no, no, they go to work. You gonna see them tonight.March 1, 2010\nSo my mother said no, don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t go, go to work. I see you tonight. But soon\nafter we walked away from the cattle train, we saw the people on the other side,\nwhich looked to us like crazy, and we thought that we came to work in a crazy\nhouse. And being young, I \u2014 I \u2014 I didn\u2019t realize, I \u2014 we didn\u2019t know where we are \u2014\nwe are going, and we didn\u2019t know that such a thing exist like Auschwitz. We never\nhear the word Auschwitz, and that was another thing which the \u2014 the \u2014 the\n[indecipherable] from Auschwitz, which was a Jewish man, oh, I forgot his name.\nHe never said the truth, where we are going. And our transport was the last one\nleaving the ghetto, except the people who were hiding, and didn\u2019t want to go. And\nthe one who were hiding, cleaned up the ghetto. And we didn\u2019t know about it,\nokay? So, that was the last time, on that cattle train, that I saw my parents.",
        "Q: When your children were growing up \u2014",
        "A: Uh-huh?",
        "Q: \u2014 did you tell them your story, or did you wait?",
        "A: No, I did not tell them, no, no.",
        "Q: Because?",
        "A: I\u2014I-\u2014I was talking \u2014 I was telling my children very little, because when they\nwere young, I didn\u2019t want to tell them the truth, because I was afraid that they might\ngrow up with anti \u2014 anti \u2014 anti-Semite feeling. And I didn\u2019t wanted that to mineMarch 1, 2010\nchildren. When they were old enough, people used to write books. I was suggested\nto write a book too, but I never want to talk about it, write about it. So, I used to get\nthem a book, and I said, read that to me. And I felt, as long it\u2019s not their mother and\nfather, it won\u2019t hurt them as much. But when they understood, they didn\u2019t ask any\nquestions, no. And I have very intelligent children. My daughter\u2019s a social worker.\nMy son is working for the court, he is an attorney. And my youngest son is a doctor.\nSo, I did very well with my children.",
        "Q: When your children were your age, when things started to get bad, like \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 for instance, you were 14 when the war started.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When your children turned 14, did that trigger any responses in you, when you\nlooked at them and thinking well, when I was 14 \u2014",
        "A: No, no. I was happy that I could \u2014 that they had everything, I could give them\neverything. No, no, no, I \u2014 I never \u2014 my feeling, I never gave \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to\nsay it. I never expressed that. I never \u2014",
        "Q: No, but I meant inside. Did you feel inside \u2014",
        "A: I was happy that my children didn\u2019t have to go through.",
        "Q: Yeah.March 1, 2010",
        "A: That I am living in a beautiful country. And I was always hoping that never,\nnever again would I live through any war.",
        "Q: Were you overprotective of your children, do you think?",
        "A: Yes, oh yes, oh yes. Mine children never had a babysitter, because I didn\u2019t trust\nanybody. Oh yes, this I got to admit.",
        "Q: What were you afraid of? What would happen if you had a babysitter?",
        "A: That \u2014 always my thought that I might come back, because I was working, but I\ntried to be home when the kids were home from school. But always my thought\nwas, because in the ghetto, they used to go around and pick people. So, let\u2019s say if a\nsmall child was left home, and the parents were working in the ghetto, they came\nback, and they found no child.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I was protected, and I don\u2019t want to go into the ghetto, because we were hiding,\nand it was unbearable, okay. The ghetto life \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t want to talk about it\ntoo much.",

        "A: Because what I knew at the time about United States, it\u2019s a beautiful country.\nFreedom. Everybody can live the way they want to live. And everybody can be rich.\nThat was \u2014 that\u2019s what they said.",
        "Q: So, when you put your foot down on American soil for the first time.March 1, 2010",

And we used to have customers who used to say \u2014\nmy husband\u2019s name was Adam, they used to say, Adam, is that all\u2019? You should\ncharge more. My husband used to say, I should charge nothing, because I want to\ngive back to America, what America gave to us.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 being young, I ca \u2014 my mother was religious more than my\nfather. Maybe because I didn\u2019t come from a very Orthodox home, but God was\nalways with me. And I used to say, to myself, why couldn\u2019t I have my parents?\nWhy did they had to go, the way they went? I always said, would be so nice if I\ncould have a grave to go to.

So I think of the people, they probablyMarch 1, 2010\ncouldn\u2019t do. Maybe they could do something, but they couldn\u2019t stop the war. They\nstopped the war when time came to stop the war, yes. Maybe they could stop it a\nlittle earlier, but that\u2019s life. No, I\u2019m not angry. No. I think about it, because every\ntime when I watch television, and see what\u2019s going on in the world, I think back of\nmyself, and I say, why don\u2019t I do something. But I can\u2019t. But, I give to DACA. I do\neverything in mine power to help. And thank God for that.",

        "A: I wish I wouldn\u2019t, but I don\u2019t get back what I lost. And that makes me feel better\nwhen I say to myself, I lost so much. Money 1s not everything. If I could back \u2014 buy\nback with the money, I would have. So, money is \u2014 is okay, but I don\u2019t live by the\nmoney. Money is not everything for me.

But I always am thinking, even at my age now, which I\u2019m older now than \u2014\nwhen I first came, I was so happy, because I was always thinking, what to do, what\n\u2014 wh \u2014 how can I pay back? I always want to pay back to the beautiful America. So\nthey said, oh, why not volunteer for the museum?",

        "Q: What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?",
        "A: It didn\u2019t help me personal, because I couldn\u2019t bring back anybody. If we could\nswitch, and bring back the people who were lost, probably I would feel good about\nit. But it \u2014 as I say, I don\u2019t think I have hate in myself. And I\u2019m happy about it, I\ndon\u2019t want to hate. I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2014 I have white friends, black friends.

I feel everybody\nshould have the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 their rights, but what you see on television can only\naggravate you, but you have no power of doing anything. And that word always\nbothered me. I am \u2014 I was powerless. And when I came here, and I was near the\nWhite House, I said, oh someday I\u2019m gonna say it, what I feel. But, you know, as\nyou get older, you get slower and you mellow, and \u2014 and you are different person\nwhen you old, or when you\u2019re young.

I did a few times, three or four\ntimes, and I came home and I said no, I\u2019m not gonna do it any more.

So the star in beginning was like \u2014\noh, like a little game. And maybe because my parents didn\u2019t dwell into us as much\neither. My father, there was a time before they closed the ghetto, that you could go\nanyplace you wanted. You could leave the ghetto. And the only place you could go\nwas to Russia. So my father said, I don\u2019t want to go to Russia, they \u2014 my father\nwas a very intelligent man, he spoke a few languages, and at the time I thought he is\nthe smartest in the world, but it turned out he wasn\u2019t as smart, because he made a\nmistake of staying on, not to go anyplace. So my father said no, I\u2019m not going to the\nRussians. And we kids used to say, oh why not? Anot \u2014 another place, excitement.\nAnd he said oh no, the Russians are not as intelligent, not as educated as the\nGermans are.

When I am working, I don\u2019t want it that they should have\nappearing that their grandparents are different. I didn\u2019t have any grandparents.

        "A: Yeah, he had three \u2014 there were nine children. So three, with him, four brothers\nsurvive. But none of the sisters, and the sisters and brothers children, nobody\nsurvive. And he always \u2014 he was always talking because one of his sisters gave a\ncouple boys, two children \u2014 she had two boys, and she gave them away to a Pole.\nAnd she gave him whatever, gold or whatever, money. And he \u2014 he was supposed\nto keep the boys as non-Jews. And that\u2019s what my husband was always talking\nabout. Not talking to anybody, but he always used to say, oh, I will never forget the\nscene when I saw the two boys, when the Poles brought them, when the Germans\ncame to collect the kids. And he couldn\u2019t do anything. Okay, my husband was\nworking also in \u2014 in \u2014 in the ghetto. I didn\u2019t know him at that time.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But he says that he saw the Poles who held the two boys, bring them to the\nGermans, and they threw them on the wagon. And he saw the boys, but couldn\u2019t do\nanything. And that was haunting him always.",

        "A: Very little.",
        "Q: Very little.March 1, 2010",
        "A: Very little. But it came up like we were talking about boys, children, when I had\nmine boys, he used to say, oh my sister\u2019s boys would be 20, 30, whatever. That\u2019s \u2014\nand he was saying \u2014 I will never forget.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because it bothered him that he saw them \u2014",
        "Q: And couldn\u2019t help.",
        "A: \u2014 and couldn\u2019t help. That\u2019s what was always on his mind.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Not the parents, not other things, but the two boys the sister gave to that Pole.\nThat\u2019s why Poles \u2014 and my husband felt the same way, Poles were just as bad as the\nGermans, maybe even worse in it \u2014 in some instances. But before I was liberated,\nthere were Poles who went \u2014 oh, I forget the name \u2014 which the Poles converted into\nGermans. And they went \u2014 and they were helping the Germans, and they were\nsoldiers. So I had a \u2014 a easy time before the liberation, that one of the Poles \u2014 and I\nknew, because I could hear the Polish language from far away. We never were close\nto anybody. And I knew, I \u2014 I used to say, oh they speak Polish \u2014 because you\nexpect the Germans to speak German. And at the very end, they said, whoever can f\n\u2014 hide, this was the last hide.",
        "Q: Oh, mm-hm.March 1, 2010",
        "A: Because maybe they were afraid that after the war somebody will point a finger\nand say, oh, you were a soldier. So, they said in Polish, whoever can hide, well, it\nwon\u2019t do any good to say it in Polish, but they said it. And that\u2019s all I heard about\nthem, but they were worse. As I say, we can talk and talk and never come to an end,\nbut \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Answer: Yes.",
        "A: After the liberation, there was a small group of women, and we were liberated by\nthe Russians. They took very good care of us, they supplied us with food, with\nclothes, because we were almost clothes-less. Nothing that we had on was a sack.\nNo shoes, no nothing. The Russians supplied us with everything they could, but it\ndidn\u2019t take us long \u2014 w-we stayed in a group, maybe eight or 10 women \u2014 girls\nmostly, young women. And must be we ate too much food, or the dirt, because we\nwere invaded by \u2014 by lice, and two days, three days after, everybody fell sick. And\nby being sick, the Russians were afraid to come near us, and we didn\u2019t know what\nMarch 1, 2010\nwas wrong with us, because we probably had high temperature, and none of the\ngirls was probably normal, and didn\u2019t know what happening. But when the Russians\ndidn\u2019t come near us, we kept on asking, why don\u2019t we get any help, or anything, to\nmake us well? And we were told, either there were nurses, or they were \u2014 I\u2014 Is \u2014 to\nthis day I don\u2019t know who the people were who took care of us, that we have typhus\nfever. And nobody want to come near us, because they were afraid, the military,\nthat they might get sick, too. There was one woman who had a daughter my age.",
        "A: Yes, I was 20 years old at the time, yes, I \u2014 and there was one woman, as I say,\nand she spoke a little Russian. She ran out to get help, so we can go to a hospital.\nSoon after, a wagon with a German came, horse and wagon, and they put us all ona\nwagon, and supposingly we went to a hospital. But it wasn\u2019t a hospital, it was a\nschool converted into a hospital, because there were many other women from other\nareas, which I \u2014 I \u2014I still don\u2019t know where they came from. And they put hay on\nthe floor, and we were laying on the hay, with no pillows, with no nothing, but all\nwe wanted is help. The Russians did a lot for us.",
        "A: Yeah, that was, yes, near the area where I was liberated. I can\u2019t account the time,\nbut after a while, they took us to another place, which was better than the hospital,\nMarch 1, 2010\nthe school hospital. And at that time we saw already Russian doctors, Russian\nnurses. But the Russians were so bitter, so upset, that they couldn\u2019t even \u2014 even\nstand if a German ca \u2014 if German woman or man came to help, to be on the same\nfloor at the time when they were there. Because the Russians suffered a lot too,\nfrom the Germans. And supposingly, I have no idea, but we tried to figure out why\nthe Russians were so mad at the Germans, that after, when we came back to\nourselves, when we \u2014 we \u2014 we were sick for two months. So I cannot count the time\nwhen we felt better, but I assume maybe a month, maybe six weeks. We kept on\nasking why the Russians are so mad at the Germans. And they said, they killed our\nparents, our sisters, our brothers, just as much as they killed your sisters and\nbrothers. But, after two months, we were released, and we were told \u2014 we were\nasked where we want to go. So I said, I want to go back to Lodz to find out who\nsurvived. And Red Cross took us over at the time, and they brought us back to\nLodz. L6\u00e9dz was just as bad as the place we came from, which, I don\u2019t know the\nname of the place, but was near Gdansk. We didn\u2019t have anybody, but I found a\nplace which was for me to stay, with some other people. And every day we went to\ncheck the list of the people who survived, and who came from L\u00e9dz. So I found my\nsister and my brother also survived. But my sister came after to Lodz, but my\nbrother remained in Germany because he was liberated by the Americans, and that\nMarch 1, 2010\nwas German territory. And where we were liberated was the Russian territory,\nbecause England, Russia, everybody took a p \u2014 a \u2014a part of, I think the country.\nShortly after I was reunited with my sister, because knowing \u2014 she probably\nchecked the list where she was, I checked the list where I was, and we got reunited,\nso I was with my sister shortly after.",
        "A: And that was still in L\u00e9dz, yes, and we couldn\u2019t get in touch with my brother,\nbut people who I don\u2019t know what \u2014 they were not sick, or they were hiding, used to\ncom \u2014 communicate, go places. So we sent the message, through this person, to my\nbrother, who was in Ainring, near Feldafing, in Germany, that we both survive.\nWe are only two sisters, and we survive. So he sent back a message with somebody,\nnot letters, because at that time that was too early for mail, and 1t was such a mix-up\nthat it\u2019s hard to describe, but everybody just want to know who survived. That was\nthe most important thing. So the brother sent back the message, and he said, I\nsurvived and I am in this particular place, which was Ainring, by Freilassing. If\nyou could, come back to Germany, so we can be all together. Shortly, when we felt\nwe can travel, and the travel wasn\u2019t that you took a ticket and you went on the train,\nor \u2014 or airplane. What \u2014 travel, you had to find somebody who took you from one\nplace to another, until we reached the border of Poland and Germany, and then\nMarch 1, 2010\nsomebody else would \u2014 took us to the place where my brother was. We \u2014 we \u2014 we\ndid survive the trip, and we came back to Germany, which nobody liked to be in\nGermany, but we had no other choice, because we couldn\u2019t stay in pol \u2014 in portla \u2014\nin \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, in portla \u2014 we couldn\u2019t stay in Lodz because nobody was there. And\nthe place which we lived was torn down, because di \u2014 the place where we used to\nlive was very close to the gates where the ghetto started in L6dz. So we reunited,\nand we stayed in Ainring, with my brother and my sister. We stayed there from \u201945\ntil I came to the United States in \u201949. There I met my husband, and we got married.\nMy sister met her husband in the four years, and my brother got married. So we all\ngot married in Germany, and from Germany, the first chance anybody had, they\nwant to go away from Germany. So we all registered to America, to \u2014 to Canada,\nto Israel, and whichever came first, we \u2014 we went.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: All those four years, yes. Some people went to live privately, but we went \u2014 we\nwere in a camp. And we were by the Americans. So my husband registered for all\nthe places which were available to go. He was a tailor, and my sister and her\nhusband and my brother \u2014 so the first to leave Germany was my brother, becauseMarch 1, 2010\nby choice, I don\u2019t know exactly how it worked. And he went to Canada. And we\nwere supposed to go shortly after. Then, my sister and her husband went to Israel.\nAnd when they came to Israel, they came right into the war, because they came in\n\u00b048, from \u2014 from the ship, my brother-in-law was taken to the army, and my sister\nwas left all by herself, and very, very sick and discouraged, because we left one\nwar, and came right into another war. And I stayed on in Germany, because I had a\nchild. I ha \u2014 I was the first one to have a child from my brother and sister.",
        "A: Yes, I was the youngest in the family, but I had a child the first. My child was\nborn in \u00b047. I married in \u201946, a year later I had my daughter. And with children,\nnobody was very happy to take. Israel didn\u2019t want anybody with children. They\ntook only young people, because there was a war, and they wanted people to go to\nwar with no children. And by that time, my brother was already in Canada. And he\nsaid, be patient, wait, and I\u2019m trying to get you to Canada. That was my brother.\nMeantime, there was a opening to the United States. And we were very happy. At\nthe time, it was HIAS who was working to \u2014 to bring the people to the United\nStates. But there was a nice family in Portland, Maine, which at that time I didn\u2019t\neven know what Maine was, and they needed somebody to work in a clothing\nfactory, and my husband signed up as a tailor. So, we were chosen to go toMarch 1, 2010\nPortland, Maine, and we were very, very happy. Came to Portland with a two and\na half year old child. And the man who signed up for us to come to Portland, I \u2014\nwas one of the nicest people. He supplied us with an apartment. My husband was\nright away paid 40 some dollars a week, which I thought I am a millionaire, because\n40 \u2014 40 some dollars at \u2014 in \u2014 in 49 was a lot of money. And we were very happy\nto be in America. So my sister was in Israel, my brother was in Canada, and I was\nin America. We were not happy about it, because we want to be together. So I was\nthe one who was saying, I\u2019m going to start doing something. Maybe I can bring you\nto America. My sister said, oh I would like you to come to Israel, and my brother\nsaid, you \u2014 I would like you to be in Canada. But, it took a long time, and\neverybody already had settled in the places where they were, so my husband didn\u2019t\nwant to leave Portland, Maine, and my sister didn\u2019t want to leave Israel, and my\nbrother didn\u2019t want to leave Canada, so we were all separated. In Portland, I had a\nbeautiful life. The people were so nice, and they were not all Jewish. Even the\nGentile people, they accepted us like we were somebody special. They came \u2014 they\nwas quite a few families who came to Portland, but they didn\u2019t stay on, because at\nthat time, the people who came to Portland, they were single people. And for\nsingle people there wasn\u2019t really much to do in Portland. And the majority left,\nafter a while. But three, four \u2014 four families were left in Portland, who hadMarch 1, 2010\nchildren. And I came in \u00b049, in \u201951 my \u2014 my son was born in Portland. And I\nalready had two children, and life was beautiful. And I realized what a beautiful\nplace is to be in America. And as the years went by, I had another son, who was\nborn in \u201957, and this was that, and we were all settled in Portland. After my \u2014 after\nfive years, my husband worked for this man who signed it up for us. In gratitude, he\ndidn\u2019t want to leave him, but he always want to be on his own. So, after five years,\npay him back what this man did for us in Portland, we opened a little shop for\nourselves, which was a tailoring, clothing, like Mom and Pop shop. And I helped\nmy husband, and we were there for \u2014 for almost 40 years, until my husband took\nsick, and my husband died in 2000. After when I \u2014 and my kids, meantime got\nmarried and moved away from Portland. After 2000, I was left by myself, and very\nfew friends in Portland. I stayed on for another year in Portland, in Maine, and\nmy daughter who lived in Virginia at the time, said \u2014 and my son settled in New\nJersey, and already had families, and my daughter had families. They ask me,\nwhere do I want to go to be again together? So I decide I\u2019m gonna come near my\ndaughter. And near my daughter, I didn\u2019t want to be in a single home again, so I\nhave chosen to be in Leisure World, which I have no regrets, I\u2019m very happy, and I\nmade some new friends and I been living \u2014 it\u2019s been nine years since I came to liveMarch 1, 2010\nin Leisure World, and I hope, God willing, that I will have a few more years, and\nenjoy life in Leisure World.",
        "A: Yes, ma\u2019am.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: A feeling \u2014 it\u2019s very hard for me to describe. Like, you take a child, which I was\n\u2014 20 years is not a baby any more, but like you take a child who came out of the\nwoods, and lost. That\u2019s how I felt, with no parents, and before I united with my\nsister, life wasn\u2019t worth living. And I kept on asking, why did I survive, and what\ndid I do to \u2014 for me to survive and not others, or my parents. It was very hard. But\nwhen I re \u2014 reunited with my sister and brother, then life became a little better.",
        "A: Yes, ma\u2019am.",

        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 at that time, I didn\u2019t even know what that means, teenage years.",
        "A: Because when we were in the ghetto, life was terrible. And thanks my brother,\nwho \u2014 he used to \u2014 I can say it now, he used to steal potato peel, and bring it home.\nSo my mother cooked it, every day she made something else. Some people were not\nas fortunate. But my brother was a fireman, and he \u2014 in the ghetto, he was \u2014 well,\nwe were working. I was working too, in the ghetto. But I was working in a laundry\nwhere \u2014 what the German who stayed in the ghetto, we washed the clothes for the\nGermans. And I never had done anything, because I was youngest at home, but I\nquickly learned how to iron, how to fold up the shirts, how to \u2014 the socks, and\neverything, because that was a special place, and not everybody was fortunate to\nwork in the ghetto, in a place like that. So I could get a portion of a little water soup,\nsupposingly, but it was more water than anything in it. But my parents worked, and\nmy sister, my brother worked. We all work. So that kept us alive. And having\nparents, that was another plus that we survive. In the ghetto, oh, I hate to go into it,March 1, 2010\nbut life in the ghetto was unbearable. Kids my age, very few survived. I was\nfortunate to survive because I \u2014 as I said it, I had my parents. And I didn\u2019t have\nmyself to fight every day, for that little piece of bread, because my mother used to \u2014\nmy mother used to ration. She didn\u2019t eat.",
        "A: But she gave it to us.",

        "A: If you \u2014 anybody \u2014 if anybody went to the museum, up \u2014 upstairs in the museum,\nthere is a cattle train. Leaving the ghetto, we all went on those cattle trains,\nsupposingly that we are going to another \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 place of work, better circumstances, everything better, so we all were happy to\nleave the ghetto, and to go \u2014 we thought we are gonna go with that train. But when\nwe saw those cattle trains, we looked at each other, and I \u2014 I went to my father and I\nsaid \u2014 I didn\u2019t go to my father, because we all stayed together \u2014 and I said, Dad,\nMarch 1, 2010\nwhat \u2014 what is that cattle train doing here? And he said, oh, they probably just\nstaying here. And the train for us is gonna come soon. The train for us never came,\nand we went on this cattle train. A night and a day after, when we embark from that\ncattle train \u2014 I don\u2019t even think it took a minute, and it was so bad, because half of\nthe people probably were dead, who were in that train overnight. The smell, and\neverybody relieved themselves standing. You couldn\u2019t even sit down or lay down or\nwhatever. Everybody was in standing position. So, when they opened the door, we\nwere happy to run out as quick as we could. And they made us to run out, but we\nstepped over other people. Mine father said that the best place is to be in a corner,\nbecause when we were on it, he direct \u2014 my father direct us to go to the corner,\nmaybe there is gonna be better, so we all stayed in the corner. But when we came\nout, we had to kind of haul over the people who are laying on top of each other.\nAnd when we reached the outside, within a split of a minute, or a second, it went so\nquick, mine parents went one way, and my sister, my brother went the other way.",
        "A: Okay, girls, women were separate, and men were separate.",
        "A: And they said that because we want to run back to my mother\u2019s side, my\nparents\u2019 side, they said, no, no, no, they go to work. You gonna see them tonight.March 1, 2010\nSo my mother said no, don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t go, go to work. I see you tonight. But soon\nafter we walked away from the cattle train, we saw the people on the other side,\nwhich looked to us like crazy, and we thought that we came to work in a crazy\nhouse. And being young, I \u2014 I \u2014 I didn\u2019t realize, I \u2014 we didn\u2019t know where we are \u2014\nwe are going, and we didn\u2019t know that such a thing exist like Auschwitz. We never\nhear the word Auschwitz, and that was another thing which the \u2014 the \u2014 the\n[indecipherable] from Auschwitz, which was a Jewish man, oh, I forgot his name.\nHe never said the truth, where we are going. And our transport was the last one\nleaving the ghetto, except the people who were hiding, and didn\u2019t want to go. And\nthe one who were hiding, cleaned up the ghetto. And we didn\u2019t know about it,\nokay? So, that was the last time, on that cattle train, that I saw my parents.",

        "A: I\u2014I-\u2014I was talking \u2014 I was telling my children very little, because when they\nwere young, I didn\u2019t want to tell them the truth, because I was afraid that they might\ngrow up with anti \u2014 anti \u2014 anti-Semite feeling. And I didn\u2019t wanted that to mineMarch 1, 2010\nchildren. When they were old enough, people used to write books. I was suggested\nto write a book too, but I never want to talk about it, write about it. So, I used to get\nthem a book, and I said, read that to me. And I felt, as long it\u2019s not their mother and\nfather, it won\u2019t hurt them as much. But when they understood, they didn\u2019t ask any\nquestions, no. And I have very intelligent children. My daughter\u2019s a social worker.\nMy son is working for the court, he is an attorney. And my youngest son is a doctor.\nSo, I did very well with my children.",

        "A: That \u2014 always my thought that I might come back, because I was working, but I\ntried to be home when the kids were home from school. But always my thought\nwas, because in the ghetto, they used to go around and pick people. So, let\u2019s say if a\nsmall child was left home, and the parents were working in the ghetto, they came\nback, and they found no child.",

So I think of the people, they probablyMarch 1, 2010\ncouldn\u2019t do. Maybe they could do something, but they couldn\u2019t stop the war. They\nstopped the war when time came to stop the war, yes. Maybe they could stop it a\nlittle earlier, but that\u2019s life. No, I\u2019m not angry. No. I think about it, because every\ntime when I watch television, and see what\u2019s going on in the world, I think back of\nmyself, and I say, why don\u2019t I do something. But I can\u2019t.

If I could back \u2014 buy\nback with the money, I would have. So, money is \u2014 is okay, but I don\u2019t live by the\nmoney. Money is not everything for me.

        "A: No, not at all. Because Poland said, that if you come back, if you have property\nand you come back and you live in Poland, you gonna have all privileges. I said,\nyou have the property and everything, I don\u2019t think we want to. But the Germans,\nwhen I get mine check, I say, it\u2019s nothing in comparison what I lost.",

So the star in beginning was like \u2014\noh, like a little game. And maybe because my parents didn\u2019t dwell into us as much\neither. My father, there was a time before they closed the ghetto, that you could go\nanyplace you wanted. You could leave the ghetto. And the only place you could go\nwas to Russia. So my father said, I don\u2019t want to go to Russia, they \u2014 my father\nwas a very intelligent man, he spoke a few languages, and at the time I thought he is\nthe smartest in the world, but it turned out he wasn\u2019t as smart, because he made a\nmistake of staying on, not to go anyplace. So my father said no, I\u2019m not going to the\nRussians. And we kids used to say, oh why not? Anot \u2014 another place, excitement.\nAnd he said oh no, the Russians are not as intelligent, not as educated as the\nGermans are. My father felt the Germans will do no harm to us, because he was\ngoing back before the first war, and I think the first war, the Germans were better\nthan the Russians. I don\u2019t know the history as well. And when the father said no,\nwas no.",

        "A: No, no, not high school. Like \u2014 like junior high school.March 1, 2010",
        "A: Because when I came to this country, and I tried to go to night school, but the\nsame thing, I couldn\u2019t go, because I had a child \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and didn\u2019t want to leave the child.",
        "A: And my husband was working, so he had the priority, so I said, you go to night\nschool, and I will be okay. So I was tested from a very nice gentleman, who was a\nteacher in high school, and he said the ability at the time, I had like high school. So\nI don\u2019t know \u2014 I don\u2019t know where it came from. But as little school I had, it was in\ncomparison to high school.",

        "A: Ah boy, I hope it never does. But I think the world learned a lesson, that no\ncountry will allow that something like that should happen again. Iran is a trap. \u2019m\nnot a politician, but a little I\u2019m listening to everybody. I think he 1s more \u2014 how\nshould I say? He is more mouth than \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 action, yes. And it might turn out that I am right, because what my sister told\nme about the war with Israel, with the Arabs at the time, they knew nothing. Okay,\nthat was in \u201948 \u2014 okay. Okay.",
        "A: The Arabs.",

        "A: Coming home. I loved it. I would go more times, but since I had the back\nsurgery, I cannot walk. I walk, but I cannot go to Israel without walking, and I\ndon\u2019t want to go in a chairs, or \u2014 you know. The last time I was \u2014 I think it was in\n06, yeah. Because \u2014 because my husband and I were planning to go together again.\nThat would have been the fifth time. I was four times with my husband. And since\nwe were talking about it, I said, okay, I go by myself. It wasn\u2019t like I was with my\nhusband, but I was happy to see Israel. And every time, looks a little better.",

        "A: And that\u2019s why I don\u2019t know anybody in here. When you told me about\nsomebody who was from L\u00e9dz, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m surprise.",
        "A: Oh darling, we could sit here probably for days, and I wouldn\u2019t cover\neverything.",
        "A: Because when I talk about the ghetto, I \u2014 I \u2014I really get sick. It \u2014 it \u2014 it was five\nyears of a experience that I don\u2019t wish it, like they used to say, on a dog. So. And\nafter the war, everything was beautiful. Maine is a beautiful country \u2014 not country,\nbut place to live in, and America\u2019s a beautiful country to be in, yeah. I\u2019m very\nproud to be an American. I am. I consider myself an American.",

        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah.",
        "A: Oh yes, we had Hebrew schools, we had synagogues in Portland, oh sure. Mine\ndaughter is \u2014 my kids, my boys and my daughter are better in Hebrew than I am,\nbecause I lost the years which I have learned, and when I learned when I was a little\ngirl, was Yiddish.",
        "A: And Yiddish is not Hebrew. So they are wonderful in Hebrew. When comes a\nholiday, and I always am with my children, when my daughter takes the siddur and\nshe reads it, I say, oh God, it\u2019s so beautiful. And I shep naches from my kids, yeah.\nMy kids had the utmost of everything I could give it to them, because, as you asked\nme, all I could do, what I didn\u2019t have, I\u2014 I was happy that they had that.

        "A: And that\u2019s why I \u2014 I cannot talk, because every time I say mother, father, I\nchoke. I don\u2019t know it\u2019s me, or \u2014 or \u2014 I don\u2019t know it\u2019s normal or not normal, but\nthat\u2019s what I am.",
        "A: What I want to \u2014 and I always tell my grandchildren that I\u2019m proud of them.\nThat my kids, their parents, gave them as much goodness as I gave mine kids, and\nthey inherited something good, and they should be proud of their parents, and\ngrandparents. That\u2019s what I tell them. They know about it, and they are very proud\nof their grandpa \u2014 grandma was everything for them. And Grandma\u2019s still\neverything for them. And they are for me, too.",

        "A: No, I don\u2019t wanted them to.March 1, 2010",
        "A: Because on this tape, I\u2019m talking and crying, and I don\u2019t wanted them to see\nthem cry \u2014 me crying. When I am working, I don\u2019t want it that they should have\nappearing that their grandparents are different. I didn\u2019t have any grandparents. I \u2014 I\nhad my grandparents, but when I was little. I \u2014 I \u2014 I hardly remember them.",
        "A: Ab \u2014 yes, yes.",
        "A: Not far from L\u00e9dz, Tuszyn. That was like a small little town near L\u00e9dz.",
        "A: And I met them in Germany.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: The same thing. He went through camps.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, he had three \u2014 there were nine children. So three, with him, four brothers\nsurvive. But none of the sisters, and the sisters and brothers children, nobody\nsurvive. And he always \u2014 he was always talking because one of his sisters gave a\ncouple boys, two children \u2014 she had two boys, and she gave them away to a Pole.\nAnd she gave him whatever, gold or whatever, money. And he \u2014 he was supposed\nto keep the boys as non-Jews. And that\u2019s what my husband was always talking\nabout. Not talking to anybody, but he always used to say, oh, I will never forget the\nscene when I saw the two boys, when the Poles brought them, when the Germans\ncame to collect the kids. And he couldn\u2019t do anything. Okay, my husband was\nworking also in \u2014 in \u2014 in the ghetto. I didn\u2019t know him at that time.",
        "A: But he says that he saw the Poles who held the two boys, bring them to the\nGermans, and they threw them on the wagon. And he saw the boys, but couldn\u2019t do\nanything. And that was haunting him always.",
        "A: Very little.",
        "A: Very little. But it came up like we were talking about boys, children, when I had\nmine boys, he used to say, oh my sister\u2019s boys would be 20, 30, whatever. That\u2019s \u2014\nand he was saying \u2014 I will never forget.",
        "A: Because it bothered him that he saw them \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and couldn\u2019t help. That\u2019s what was always on his mind.",
        "A: Not the parents, not other things, but the two boys the sister gave to that Pole.\nThat\u2019s why Poles \u2014 and my husband felt the same way, Poles were just as bad as the\nGermans, maybe even worse in it \u2014 in some instances. But before I was liberated,\nthere were Poles who went \u2014 oh, I forget the name \u2014 which the Poles converted into\nGermans. And they went \u2014 and they were helping the Germans, and they were\nsoldiers. So I had a \u2014 a easy time before the liberation, that one of the Poles \u2014 and I\nknew, because I could hear the Polish language from far away. We never were close\nto anybody. And I knew, I \u2014 I used to say, oh they speak Polish \u2014 because you\nexpect the Germans to speak German. And at the very end, they said, whoever can f\n\u2014 hide, this was the last hide.",
        "A: Because maybe they were afraid that after the war somebody will point a finger\nand say, oh, you were a soldier. So, they said in Polish, whoever can hide, well, it\nwon\u2019t do any good to say it in Polish, but they said it. And that\u2019s all I heard about\nthem, but they were worse. As I say, we can talk and talk and never come to an end,\nbut \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 how long was I talking? I\u2019m surprise about myself.",
        "A: I said I\u2019m not gonna say anything, but I said it, right?",
        "A: Okay. You\u2019re welcome.\nConclusion of Interview\n"
