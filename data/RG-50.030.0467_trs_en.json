        "Q: This is Arwen Donahue. It\u2019s January 10\", 1996 and I\u2019m here with Mr. Robert Holczer in Paris,\nKentucky and this is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview tape one, side A. And\nMr., Mr. Holczer, if we can just begin by you telling me your name at birth and the place of birth\nand your date of birth.",
        "A: I, my name is Robert Holczer. I was born in Budapest in 1929, August 31.",
        "Q: And, will you tell me something about your mother and your father, their, therr names and their\nfamily backgrounds?",
        "A: My father was, my father\u2019s name is Lajos Holczer. He comes from a very poor working class\nfamily, a Jewish family that was almost totally assimilated into the Proletarian environment. They\nlived on the outskirts of Budapest in a tenement without any water and electricity. My grandmother\nwas practically the sole supporter of the family until the children got a little bit older because my\ngrandfather was a, what you would call a /umpen proletary (ph) person who did not really care too\nmuch about father responsibilities. The, so my father was the oldest one who made it into adult life,\nthere was somebody else ahead of him but died of tuberculosis. And he has always been a great\nsupport to his brothers and sisters. He was a working man, he has always worked for other people.\nEventually, he became kind of a, an amateur druggist, worked for companies but he did not have a\nformal education and after the war, he joined a co-op. He rose to kind of a mid-level managerial\nposition but he basically was always just a working man. He never went beyond the second grade\nand he taught himself how to read and write and everything else. He had exceptional qualities in\nmath and law. My mother\u2019 comes from a small northern Hungarian town, Vacz. This is where the\nDanube turns suddenly south and she comes from a middle class family, Orthodox, very religious.\nShe had a brother and a sister, both of them who died in World War II. The sister was deported, the\nbrother died in labor camp. Her entire family from Vacz were, was deported to Auschwitz and died\nthere. My mother never had to work, basically, my father was always making enough money and\nshe enjoyed just being a housewife. Anything else?",
        "Q: Did you say how many brothers and sisters your father had?",
        "A: My father had thirteen brothers and sisters, yes, and he was the oldest one to survive, to grow up,\nbecause his older brother died, very early. So, the burden of supporting the family was always on\nhim. So he was the provider type and my mother had no basic responsibility. She was basically\nwhat you would call a petit-bourgeois lady and I always admired my father\u2019s values more than my\nmother\u2019s but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t love my mother. My mother also survived the war with me.",
        "Q: How did your father and your mother meet?\n1 Cornelia Oestreicher",
        "A: My father and mother met, so that, my father was working for a wholesale drug distribution firm.\nBy drug I, we mean a cosmetic supply firm, but in Hungary they were called druggists, making\ncologne water, things like that. It had nothing to do with what we call drugs today. It was not a\npharmaceutical company. And my, at that time, in Hungary and in Europe, it was the custom of\nmiddle-class families to send their daughters to secretarial school and then have them work for a\nfew years for some firm, hoping that they\u2019re going to catch a husband. And my mother caught my\nfather there, which was very much to the dislike of her family because my father, they felt, was\nmuch below their class and they made him feel that way in all his life. Of course, I cannot really\nsay what would have happened after World War II because my mother\u2019s entire family was wiped\nout, practically. Only a few people who lived in Budapest remained. So, but I resented them for a\nvery simple reason, that they looked down on my father who I thought was a, was a very, was a man\nof integrity and, and hard-working, a good human being.",
        "Q: Were they, how did they treat you as a child?",
        "A: I had a very strange relationship with my mother\u2019s family, especially my grandparents because they\nwere very religious and I was born irreligious and whenever I had to visit with them they forced me\nto wear a hat even in the middle of the summer and eat a certain kind of very strict kosher food, go\nto the synagogue every night and pray and, and in general, they considered me some kind of a, what\nthey call in Yiddish a shaygets, somebody who is kind of just an outsider because I never really\nwent along with their, with their religious rules. I also resented the fact that my grandmother was\nkind of a, of a, of a very angry person. I felt that, that the way she treated others and the way she\ntreated my grandfather, I resented that. I didn\u2019t like to go there and my mother, of course, always\nwanted me to go and visit and I have, I just finally decided to take my revenge so I would not have\nto visit anymore. And one day, this was, I must have been about eleven or so, I went to a butcher\nshop, got a huge ham hock and got out and when the people went to the synagogue Friday night, I\nwas eating it without a hat and pretty soon they were reporting it to her and they were coming and\nthat was my last visit. They immediately sent me back to Budapest and I never had to visit again.",
        "Q: Was your mother angry with you?",
        "A: Yes. My mother was very angry, but my father and I, we always had some kind of an\nunderstanding. Even when he scolded me for something that, that had something to do with religion\nto go along with my mother, I sensed in his voice that it was not serious, that he just did it for my\nmother\u2019s sake. And I also found out since, between 1948 and 1950, I went to Israel, I was in Israel\nwhich we will come back later, when I came back and I spoke Hebrew, I realize that my father\ndoesn\u2019t know how to pray, that he just mumbles the words. He has no idea, what really, how to\neven pronounce them and he did this all for, for the love of my, my, my mother and I appreciated\nthis, that he put up this pretense but it was an interesting discovery for me, that. So he never, he\nnever really scolded me and he was practically influential after the war to put down his foot and say,\nforget about kosher anymore, let\u2019s just eat what is available. And so we did not have a kosher\nhousehold anymore.",
        "Q: Now was your father\u2019s entire family not very religious, then?",
        "A: Yes, yes, they weren\u2019t. They were Jews, they never, they never doubt their Jewishness. They knew\nthey were Jews but they were secular Jews, you know? And interestingly, quite a few of them\nsurvived because of the place where they lived. Since they lived in a Proletarian tenement of\u2014city\ntenement\u2014that was given to people under a certain income who had too many children and not\nenough income, there, the Communist Party, the illegal Communist Party had a very strong hold on\nthis area and when, then, the World War II came and the Nuremburg laws and everything else,\nsome of these Communist leaders, Communist members, came and actually rescued members of the\nfamily. I have an uncle in Hungary and he, for example, was a very good friend of a past\nCommunist prime minister who just died recently because they practically lived side by side. So a\ngreat deal of the Hungarian leadership, Communist leadership, came from this tenement. So that\nhelped rescue them. The Communists were the only, the only group you could really turn to, during\nthose terrible years that, that would help you.",
        "Q: So, was religion mainly only recognized in your household on holidays, or...",
        "A: Yes. Yes. My, my father always talked to me and said go, you know, to the synagogue, your\nmother wants you to go and all this and that, but he never really did anything to force me to do\nwhatever with religion. He just asked me to respect my mother\u2019s wishes and so I had Bar Mitzvah\nand that was the last thing that I did. After my Bar Mitzvah I never probably went to synagogue\nagain unless it was a tourist attraction, I just, wanted to see what it is, inside. And, but I never\ndenied my Jewishness so when my grandchildren especially ask me about religion, I say Iam a Jew\nbut \u2019m not Jewish. And they ask me, \u201cHow can that be?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s easy.\u201d",
        "Q: Did you have any sort of, any sense of faith?",
        "A: No, not really. It\u2019s a strange thing that I have never been somebody who believes in the supreme\nbeing and so maybe, eventually, my lot, this is going to be difficult, but because they say people\nwho have faith, they die much easier than the ones who don\u2019t, but I always just associated with\npeople who practically felt the same way and it never caused any problems so far in my life, in my\nsixty-six years. But I can\u2019t remember when I really honestly believed in a supreme being. And then\nof course, the war probably wiped out, if I had any doubts.",
        "Q: Will you say something about your relationship with your father?",
        "A: My relationship with my father was always very good. I [indecipherable], I considered him always\nmy, my example, my hero, and I was very very upset when in 1942, he was taken away and sent to\na labor camp in Yugoslavia. And when he came back in 1945, he, of course, I was overwhelmed\nand in my memory too, even though I spent more time with my mother, a lot more than with my\nfather because he was also a traveling salesman for a long time and I only saw him on weekends,\nsomehow my memory is much more blurred when it comes to my mother than when it comes to my\nfather. My mother, one reason it might be that my mother died in 1970 and my father died in 1980,\nso he survived ten more years and since we lived in Europe from \u201974 on, at least for six years I had a\nlot more contact with him than I would have if I had stayed in the U.S. I always considered him an\nabsolute statue of integrity and, and honesty and he was always looking out for my interests and I,\neven though when I as an American, had a very nice living, I made a very nice living and I didn\u2019t\nneed any, any material, he was still saving and collecting things for us in Hungary and was always\ngiving us a lot of things when we went to visit him and we kept telling him that he should spend it\non himself. He, he was just one of the most unselfish people I have ever met in my life.",
        "Q: And you felt this way from the time that you were a small child...",
        "A: Yes, always, always. He was always that way. Just a very simple, very simple man. Very,\nextremely intelligent, uneducated but a true human being. And with my mother, I always had a\nlittle bit of my doubts that she\u2019s not as straightforward as my father. And there were little incidents\nthat kind of, as a child, it\u2019s amazing how it gets engraved in your mind and you cannot get rid of it.\nAnd the thing that I was very, very bitter about, that I could never forgive my mother for, was that\nwhile my father was in concentration camp in Yugoslavia, she took a little job and she worked for a\ndrugstore in the center of Budapest. And next to the drugstore was an antique store. Mr. Klein was\nthe name of the man who owned and he liked my mother. My mother was a cute little creature and\neverybody liked her and so he would wait for her when she closed this shop to escort her home\nbecause he lived the same way and I didn\u2019t see anything wrong with this, but they noticed how\njealous I am of my mother and it\u2019s not that I wanted to possess my mother, I just, I was protecting\nmy mother for my father and so he put his arm around my mother and they were looking at me and\nlaughing at how annoyed I became and this picture is constantly in my mind. And I could never\nforgive my mother for this, that, that she did not realize how hurt I was by playing this silly game.\nAnd she was, still she was a good person, she did everything possible to give me a good education\nand, but, she had a very petit-bourgeois thinking and another thing that somehow stood between the\ntwo of us was piano. She decided that I\u2019m going to be a great piano player and I decided that I have\nno interest in playing the piano and she would sometimes get so annoyed that I did not practice that\nshe would take a rug-beater and run after me and try to beat me but I was much faster than she was\nSO We were running around the table and then eventually she just broke down and cried that she\ncouldn\u2019t catch me but she had this obsession with, with, with piano playing and so again, ever since\nin World War I, our piano was destroyed. We gave it to somebody for safekeeping and they\nclaimed that the, the bomb got it, whatever, I was glad. She wanted to buy another piano and I said\nno. When I, when we came up from the cellar after liberation, I said, that\u2019s it. I am now a man. I\nbasically rescued my mother more than once during World War II and I said no more piano and I\nnever sat down to play the piano. Never. I never had the urge.",
        "Q: You talked a little bit about your relationship with your mother\u2019s family and I was interested in\nhearing your relationship with your father\u2019s family.",
        "A: My father\u2019s family was my favorite side of the family. I had a grandmother, a typical Proletarian\nwoman with thirteen children and not much of a husband. And I remember going out and loving\nevery moment of spending time with them because here I came, I was the, the, the second\ngrandchild in the family. There was one older one who, unfortunately, during the war, was killed.\nSo I was kind of the sweetheart of everybody and they were pampering me and taking me to places\nand my grandmother, I remember, had a tremendous knowledge of how to make beans in at least\nfifteen different ways. There were beans every time I went out, they had beans, beans, but she was\njust a marvelous woman, a very warm-hearted, a typical country woman. She came from southern\nHungary from a very small village and after raising thirteen children during the day, she left them in\nthe care of my father and then went from door to door selling silk stockings just to add a little bit to\nthe, to the income. The, my father\u2019s brothers and sisters were, of course, some of them are only just\na few years older than I am, so they were almost like brothers and sisters to me at that time and\nsince there was no money at all in the family, they resorted to somehow, illegal things. I remember I\nloved ice skating and they said, oh no problem and they took a huge scissor\u2014pair of scissors\u2014and\ncut a big hole and pushed me through the hole into the ice skating rink, nearby, so we always went\nice skating. A lot of things were solved not by very legal ways, but as a child, this was life to me.\nThere were a lot of children in the tenement constantly horsing around and nobody, nobody was\nconstantly bothering me and, and, and disciplining me and getting ahead or going to the synagogue,\nnothing. It was a great freedom and I just enjoyed it very very much.",
        "Q: Did you have a particularly close relationship with any of your father\u2019s siblings?",
        "A: Any of my father\u2019s brothers or sisters?",
        "Q: Mmm-hmm.",
        "A: Let\u2019s see, did I? No, I really had a very, very good relationship with all of them, with practically all\nof them. And I cannot really say that one or the other, I liked one particularly and interestingly, I\nspent the least time with him. He was a, just kind of a very outstanding figure, a tall, very mascular\n[sic] man who went to Czechoslovakia during the War, World War II and somehow worked for a\nshoe factory, which was a very famous shoe factory all over the world, Bata, got married there and\ncame once to visit us and I still remember his visit. I was so impressed with him, with his, there\nwas just an air about this man that impressed me a great deal and, unfortunately, when there was the\nbig uprising, there was a big Slovakian uprising against the Germans in 1944, and he was an officer\nin the, in this uprising, in the Partisan Army, and they caught him and he was hanged. So, we knew\nthis for sure because his wife survived the war, he was a Gentile and he has two children living in\nSwitzerland today. One, I\u2019m sorry, one, the other one is a stepbrother. He has one and I met him\nand so I knew the story. But, this, this was the man who, to me, was an outstanding representative\nof my father\u2019s side of family. But, today, there are only two men and one women [sic.] left of the\nthirteen. I mean, they\u2019re in their late seventies, so, but on my mother\u2019s side, no brothers, no brother,\nno sister, practically. I only have one cousin left on my mother\u2019s side in Budapest today. He\u2019s\nyounger than I am, so, that\u2019s.",
        "Q: What were your, did you have particular interests as a child or special things that you liked to do?",
        "A: I was an avid cyclist. I loved to, I loved to bicycle. I would come home from school and\nimmediately take off and go, there was a big park, we lived near the, the, we lived on the Pest side\nand there was a so-called rose garden in the center of Pest and that\u2019s where I met with my friends\nevery afternoon. And we were comparing our bicycles. Bicycles were the same as cars today for\nus. I mean, it was, it was a thing and we admired the one who had the custom-made one or had just\neven custom-made parts, and so we had big races on bicycle and then that was it, so I was\nheartbroken when in 1944, one of the first things we had to take in when the Germans occupied\nHungary was the bicycle and the radio. And I lost it. I also belonged to an underground Boy Scout\ngroup, I was an avid underground Boy Scout. The reason I say underground because we couldn\u2019t\nbe legal Boy Scouts. The Boy Scout movement, which was based on brotherhood and equality of\nall, declared that Jews are not equal and therefore all Jewish Boy Scout organizations were\ndisbanded and Jews were also thrown out of those Boy Scout groups that were not affiliated with\nsome Jewish school or something. I belonged to the so-called Three-Hundred Ten, number Three-\nHundred Ten Jokay Mor Boy Scout group. Jokay Mor was a famous Hungarian writer, a humanist.\nHe was not Jewish but he was a humanist. And we met illegally, sometimes in the basement of\nsynagogues and then we had to split up later into smaller groups and it was in, in homes, 1n one, the\nsmall groups consisted of about ten, between ten and fourteen people and so we just rotated and did\nall kinds of things, besides hiking, we were building model airplanes and did what, what Boy Scouts\nusually do, otherwise. I have always, always dreamt these days, I had always dreamt about one day\nhaving a uniform. The uniform was unbelievably important for me, like most kids of my age at that\ntime. And I was always dreaming about it and at school, I just looked at my classmates who were,\nof course, Christians and could wear the uniform and just, I dreamt about that one day, I\u2019m going to\nhave a uniform and the sad thing 1s that after the war, when we met for the first time, those who\nsurvived in our group, and we went to get the uniform and we put it on and all of a sudden, to most\nof us, it didn\u2019t mean anything anymore. We were, it\u2019s hard to say, either we were too old or too\ncynical by that time to really attach any importance to the uniform, so I never wore it again.",
        "Q: Did you attend a secular school?",
        "A: Yes, I have always attended a secular school, except my first fourth grades were in a, the Jewish\norphanage ran a school, it was basically a secular school, but the Jewish orphanage was in charge in\norder to have enough money to raise the orphans. So the orphans lived in a dorm while we who\nwere coming from the outside, we had to pay tuition. And it was nearby, I spent four years there\nand then, middle school. I went to a secular state school, middle school because it was exactly next\ndoor to my house. And then, of course, came the... 1944, and 1943-44, I couldn\u2019t go to high\nschool. There\u2019s one incident in my middle school that I felt had very, very important consequences\nfor the rest of my life. We were, as basically innocents abroad, to the point where I really didn\u2019t pay\nmuch attention to being Jewish or not Jewish until this incident happened. In fifth grade, 1t was an\nart class and my art teacher was drawing something on the blackboard and we had to copy it,\nexactly. And then color it exactly. And he came by and for some reason, I used a different kind of\ncolor or something and he always walked around with a huge cane, which was not unusual in those\ndays for teachers because teachers...\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\nTape 1, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape one, side B of an interview with Mr. Robert Holczer. And Mr. Holczer, I was just\nasking you about your education and you were going to tell me about an experience that you had\nthat you said was very significant.",
        "A: Yes, in fifth grade, the, the idea of art was for the art teacher to draw on the blackboard and then for\nthe rest of the class, class to copy it and color it. The, teacher came around and made sure that\neverybody\u2019s following his instructions and just to emphasize that he means business, he had a big\ncane in his hand and for some reason, I missed a couple of the colors and used something different.\nHe became absolutely just, angry, unreasonably so and started to beat me to the point where I began\nto bleed through my nose. And I also became frantic seeing the blood coming from, from my nose\nand all this so I ran home. I mentioned before that I lived next to the school. The other house was\nwhere we lived, apartment house. And I ran up to my mother\u2019s, into my mother\u2019s arms and asked\nher to clean me up and come and basically what I wanted is justice, I could not, even at the age of\neleven, I couldn\u2019t believe that this is going to be the way it is. And I wanted her to come in and do\nsomething about it. And after she cleaned me up she said, \u201cNow you must understand, a lot of\nthings that you cannot understand now, I cannot go in and do anything, yes, except apologize for\nyour behavior.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat, what behavior, what did I do, used the wrong color,\u201d and she\nsaid, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t understand just now.\u201d [Clocks chiming] And the reason, what I left out was\na very important thing. The teacher was yelling at me as I was running out of the class, \u201cI hope you\ngo to Palestine to sell oranges. That\u2019s where you belong.\u201d And so when I told my mother, this is\nwhen her reaction came. So she came back to school with me and instead of demanding some kind\nof a remedial action for this, apologized to the teacher. And I thought that was, that was a very\nstrange thing. I didn\u2019t understand at that time. I did understand it, years later, that this was the only\ncourse she could, she could take. Obviously, she was afraid that maybe they will kick me out of\nschool if she does something else. And every Jewish family, of course, wanted to have their son\nfinish middle school. And that incident somehow frustrated me to the point, it created a mental\nblock. I never drew or never painted in my life since. I am such idiot when it comes to, to do\nanything with my hands that involves drawing or painting that it is pathetic. When we play some\ngames, for example, with my friends, when I have to draw something, they can\u2019t believe that, they\nthink my perception 1s that of a mentally retarded person and it is, it 1s just a, just a block. However,\nI appreciate art very much. I never fail to go and see an exhibit of paintings and drawings. I just\ndon\u2019t want to do it and I cannot do it myself. Now it\u2019s possible that this can be unlocked in time but\nby that time I won\u2019t be alive. So, I rather just leave this.",
        "Q: Did you father care about this incident?",
        "A: No, my father was not around anymore. He heard it after the war and of course by that time, I\ncould, I understood the whole situation better.",
        "Q: Was that the first instance of anti-Semitism that...",
        "A: ...Hit me for the first time? Well, the first one, I remember was when I was six and I was playing\nmarbles with, with kids and I won. And one kid said, threw the marble down the gutter and said\n\u201cTd rather throw it down the gutter than to give it to a Jew.\u201d And I went home and asked my\nmother, \u201cWhat, what does it mean?\u201d So, that really was the first time that something like this hit me.\nAnd since I went to a Jewish school for the first four years, I was not really exposed to things like\nthis. But the minute I switched and in fifth grade, everything started. Luckily, there were some\nteachers of course, in our school who tried to make up for this. And I remember a couple of them.\nUnfortunately, they\u2019re not alive anymore but they did everything possible to, to make our life a bit\nmore civilized. And one of them was even fired because of that. But not everybody was like this.",
        "Q: He was fired because he was .. .",
        "A: He was very protective of, of Jewish children and he was also fired because we had a special subject\ncalled, how would I, how would I translate this, Defensive Studies, which meant, basically, kind of\na ROTC type, except it was sheer propaganda. We had to, the book contained sentences that were\nso revolting as far as Hungary\u2019s neighbors were concerned. For example, the Romanians were\ndescribed as monkeys on a, on a tree, their intellectual level and, I mean, for every nationality that\nsurrounded Hungary, they had a very derogatory term. And, actually, the book was preparing you\nthat one day we will get even. And what he was, among other things, he was teaching this subject,\nand he said, \u201cPut the book away and let me tell you what life 1s about.\u201d And it was a very, very\nhuman, humanistic lecture that he would give us every day. And, after the war, to our great\nsatisfaction, but not surprise, he was named as the first director of the Hungarian Academy of\nPhysical Sciences, so, he, they recognized him. And he was then, I talked to him later and he was in\nthe Illegal Social Democratic Party, so that also helped him. But, there were teachers and I had a\nteacher, I don\u2019t even know if he had any political conviction, but he was a human being and he\nalways tried to mitigate any law, anything, but, but as a child, for example, even, even in middle\nschool, I had to go once a week to three hours of, of labor, battalion practice. This was one of the\nmost humiliating experiences that anybody can have. They had the scum of earth in charge of us, it\nwas not teachers or any... we had to report either at school or somewhere on the outskirts of\nBudapest to a practice ground where these hired instructors that were a lot worse than any drill\ninstructor I have ever seen in any movie, any American movie, because it\u2019s not that, 1t was not just\nthe physical, the physical abuse can be tolerated, but it is the mental abuse, but that was so, so bad,\nthe way they called us everything, a Jewish this and a Jewish that, and these were people hired to do\nthis job and besides of marching and, and digging and building, constantly, we were abused and\nconstantly even physically so. Many times they beat us and all this. And we had to go there about\nthree hours on a certain day. The Christians then went to three hours of practice of what you would\ncall today ROTC. They had, they had marching drill practices and all this. But ours was\ncompletely different.",
        "Q: What year did that start?",
        "A: What year? Well, I was in fifth grade, right, so it was about 1940 when I entered the middle school.\nIt was about 1940.",
        "Q: By that time, had any of the anti-Jewish legislation, I know there were a few things that Hungary\nhad adopted, was that affecting your family at all?",
        "A: Well, yes, in a sense, that some people in the family, such as my aunt, who was very young, one of\nmy father\u2019s sisters, and, was married also to a young, twenty-one or twenty-two year old man. He\nwas called up to go to the eastern front and, and he go into labor battalions, in \u00b041, I\u2019m talking about\n\"41 because that\u2019s when Germany declared war, Germany attacked the Soviet Union. Immediately,\nthe very young, I think twenty-one old Jewish men were called up. They had to go to a certain\nplace in their own clothes. They didn\u2019t get any uniform, anything, and taken to the eastern front\nimmediately for mine, got to, to pick up mines, okay? And many of them without any previous\nexperience and, and, and any schooling as to how to do it, of course, blew up. Now, the reason I am\nmentioning this because my father\u2019s sister who was very young and married to a young man,\ninterestingly, when he was taken to the front, for some reason, somebody made a mistake and his\nunit was issued Hungarian army uniforms.",
        "Q: This is her husband?",
        "A: Her husband, yes, okay. And he then went to the photographer for something and just had a picture\ntaken, proudly posing in a Hungarian military uniform, he sent home. By the time, the picture\narrived at home, he was dead. He was blown up on a mine. And this picture initiated a whole\navalanche of events in our family because my aunt who was an extremely shrewd person, used this\npicture to start, to basic... declaring herself first as half-Jewish, which was an exceptional position\nthen. And as the Nuremburg laws were tightened more and more so, she took one more step and\none more step and one more step in pushing this whole idea that she\u2019s not really under this category\nof the Nuremburg laws. And it, the whole thing accelerated to the point where the last, when the\nonly way she could be declared an exceptional person, as they were called, which means that you\u2019re\nnot considered Jewish, was to take my grandmother down to the police station and that was a scene\nI remember: her taking my grandmother down and my grandmother had to, under oath, sign an\naffidavit that she is an, she was an illegitimate child because my grandmother was cleaning house\nfor a lawyer, a Christian lawyer who was dead by that time, a bachelor. And she signed this\naffidavit which made her a, a Christian. And with a husband who died in military uniform, so he\nwas obviously a Christian, with her mother signing this affidavit that she was illegitimate, and the\nfather was a Christian, she practically cleared herself and then set out to save the rest of the family.\nAnd, as I mentioned to you before, she did an excellent job up until 1944, October, that was the\npoint where nobody could do anything anymore because hell broke loose in Hungary and the scum\nof earth, the worst elements, the so-called Arrow Cross Party took over and ruled from October 15\"\nuntil January 18\" when Pest was liberated.",
        "Q: Back in the beginnings of the war, when there were, did your, did your family experience economic\nhardships when there were economic restrictions on Jewish...",
        "A: Yes. Obviously, everybody experienced this because the men were away and there were very, very\nfew employers who would feel obligated to compensate the family. And so a lot of people were\nactually either starving, or the mother had to go and look for a job, or if the children were old\nenough, they had to go and work and do something. We were in a very good position, my mother\nand I, for a while, because my father\u2019s employer felt obligated to send us part of his regular monthly\nsalary, so we did get money.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s come back to that and first, 1f you would, tell me how your father was taken away and when?",
        "A: Okay, my father was taken away several times. You know, Hungary was kind of a strange part of\nthat Nazi area because the Hungarians, the Hungarian government has always been in the hands of\nthe aristocracy, Hungarian aristocracy, and the Hungarian aristocracy had no taste for Jews but also\nhad no taste for killing or murdering Jews. They were above this, and so therefore when the dictator\nof Hungary, Admiral Horthy, had to appoint a government, most of the time that government would\nnot eventually do everything that the Germans wanted them to do. So it was almost like playing\nmusical chairs, I mean, Hungary\u2019s a very small country and you don\u2019t have that many politicians,\naristocrats to go around, but almost the same faces somehow appeared, if not as prime minister then\nmaybe minister of interior, or something. So we really, up until 1944, we had a great deal of anti-\nSemitism, we had a great deal of persecution of Jews but we were not in fear of our lives. Because\nsomehow that was below the dignity of that class. Not only that, some of those aristocrats were\nvery Anglophiles and had, during the war, connections with the British. And so in between, it\ndepended on which aristocrat was in charge of the country. Some of them were a little bit more\nGerman-oriented than others. And when, and more German-oriented came into the picture because\nthe Germans didn\u2019t like the one who was in office, then he ordered that so and so is going to go and\nserve in, these Jews will be taken to the labor battalion. My father was in the labor battalion before\nhe was taken to Yugoslavia but he was inside Hungary so we could visit him, we could take food\nfor him and eventually, when a new prime minister came, he declared that anybody over let\u2019s say,\nforty-five can go home. So there was no fear of being killed just because you are, you\u2019re a Jew. Up\nuntil 1944, March, when the Germans marched into Hungary.",
        "Q: So when your father was called to be taken away .. .",
        "A: To go, yeah, we knew where he was. I remember, he was not far from Budapest for awhile, for a\nfew month, and then almost every weekend we took food down, we talked to him, he was released,\nwe could walk around a little bit. And so it was not the same thing as taken away to a faraway\ncountry where we had no idea what would happen to him. Now, there, there, then in 1942, he was\ntaken away for, for good. For some reason, and I cannot really remember exactly what happened\nand why. We had, probably, a more radical prime minister who yielded to the Germans and let this\ncontingent of Jewish labor battalions go outside the country and he was then taken to Yugoslavia. I\nremember, even then, they, they were told which railroad station are they going to be going through\nin Budapest and they allowed them to be there I think half an hour or an hour where we had a visit\nwith him so we could talk over a few things. And that was the last I saw him, then, for a couple of\nyears until he came back after the war.",
        "Q: And he, where did he go exactly?",
        "A: He went to, he was in a copper mine in Bor, B, O, R which is I think the nearest is NiS which is\nSerbia today, the Serb Republic in Yugoslavia. And he was there, he was always telling me about\nwhat was, what was interesting, the various people who guarded them. They had Croats, they had\nGerman, they was all SS, Croat, Croatian SS, German SS, Hungarian, not SS, but Hungarian, and I\nthink that they had something, I\u2019ve forgot what, but anyway, various nationalities were guarding\nthem and probably Bosnians. And he mentioned when he came home, interestingly, he said, \u201cSon,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cwe never, we never really worried too much about anyone else guarding us except the\nCroatians.\u201d He said, \u201cWe had never seen such beasts as the Croatian SS was.\u201d They called them\nUstaSas, you know. He was there and I think, I, this is probably much better written than in my\nmemory, I think about one hundred fifty thousand were in this particular area where he was and\nwhat happened was when, when the Tito partisans were really pushing them back, The Germans\ndecided to march them back toward Germany and in, in what is northern, what was northern\nYugoslavia at that time and previously back before 1918, was southern Hungary, they set up these\nslaughterhouses, where those who survived the concentration camp were killed and\nmy father was in the last six thousand being marched and they were captured by Tito\u2019s partisans.\nAnd then he was given a choice whether he could fight with the partisans, he could work for the\npartisans, or they would allow him to go into an area that was already liberated and live there and\nthey would supply him with enough food to survive until the war is over, they said. And he was a\nvery strong man and very grateful that they saved his life and he volunteered to work. So he\nworked in a flour mill somewhere around and came home with all kinds of documents and, and\nlittle medals that testified to the fact that he was a good worker and did his share. And he was very\nproud of it, and when Stalin decided to eradicate any of the memories attached to Tito,\nunfortunately we had to burn everything and we had to throw away his medals because it was very\ndangerous to be in the possession of anything that connects you to Tito. People were hanged all the\ntime without not much reason, let alone if they find something on you. So, he was very bitter about\nthis, and this turned him against the Russians so in all his life he was very anti-Russian and very\npro-Yugoslavian. He would have been heartbroken to see what happened to Yugoslavia had he\nlived today.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s stop.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\nTape 2, Side A",
        "Q: I would like to ask, you were just describing your, your father\u2019s experience in Bor and I wonder if\nwhen he was taken away to Bor if that, you and your mother and your father were recognizing that\nthis was going to be the big one, as it were and if you can recall that separation and what happened.",
        "A: Well, of course we were always afraid that he would not survive and we had no doubt that\nphysically he could survive but we were afraid that, that he would get killed. But an interesting\nepisode was that, [cough] excuse me, I asked him after the war, what, why did he survive if so many\npeople died? And he had a little, just a short little anecdote, he said, \u201cSon, there were two kinds of\npeople in the concentration camp. We got a canteen of water every morning. The one group drank\nthe water immediately and the second group, such as myself, drank half of the water during the day\nand we used the other half to wash ourselves.\u201d And I said, \u201cHalf a canteen of water would make\nyou clean?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, but I felt like a human being, I was still caring about myself.\u201d And he\nsaid, \u201cAnd later on I understood a lot more about this whole attitude that I\u2019m not going to lie down\nhere and gulp down everything, I am, even though I am full of lice, I\u2019m still caring about myself.\u201d\nSo that, basically, that was the attitude that saved, I\u2019m sure, that was who survived. And of course\nluck, because even with this attitude somebody could have shot you if they didn\u2019t like your face or\nthe way they moved. Yes, we, my mother maintained of course like most wives that he\u2019s going to\nreturn, and she was right because even though we have not heard from him for a long time,\nespecially the last year when he was there, of course by that time, we couldn\u2019t have heard from him\nbecause he was already in the liberated area and we were in Hungary still, in the battlefield. It was,\nhowever, just that, that deep feeling that he will come home. And he came home in 1945, I\nremember late spring, it must have been April, May, probably, and he did not just stop by and said,\n\u2018Here I am.\u201d He was afraid that maybe we would faint or something like that. He sent a friend up.\nA man came up and inquired about my father and very slowly kind of asked, \u201cWhen did you hear\nfrom him?\u201d and all this, and \u201cDo you think he\u2019s alive?\u201d and all this, and slowly he said, \u201cWell, I\nhave a feeling that he 1s alive,\u201d and slowly he led us to this. I remember him coming up on the stairs\nwith a rucksack. The rucksack was full of sausage and potatoes. And he knew that we were\nstarving and so that was it. Now, just to describe the situation in Hungary at that time and how you\nneeded to be, to stay a human being, the, we did not live in our apartment, we were moved, because\nyou could not stay in your apartment. You had to move to first, to so-called Jewish houses that had\na big star on them and, eventually to the ghetto. And because of the history of this house, we did\nnot move into the ghetto but this house Zichy street One, was designated as a Jewish house first.\nSo, in the meantime, we moved out of, of our apartment in, that was 1944, summer when you had to\nleave your apartment. We, the neighbors came, some of them, and said \u201cWe will keep this for you,\nand keep this for you,\u201d and needless to say, that not one thing eventually survived again. Or\nresurfaced again. They all, either the Russians took it, or the bombing or everything. It\u2019s all\ndisappeared, and what could you do about it? You said okay. But people were in a way like\nvultures, they were just circling around and see, you know, what they can take. And then the\napartment was given, all these Jewish apartments were given to bomb those people whose...\nGentiles whose houses were bombed and they couldn\u2019t live in anymore. And I had no idea of\ncourse what happened to our apartment. We lived in a street called Rottenbiller Street, 667, and I,\nmy first thing, we were liberated on January 18 and the first thing I went back to see, what, what\nhappened to our apartment because we left, believe it or not, a few boxes of linen there, just when\nwe left. We just, we couldn\u2019t do anything with it, so. And when I came, when I went up there, I\nhad this tremendous chip on my shoulder that I\u2019m going to show these people whoever are there,\nthat within two hours, I said I\u2019m going to give them two hours to get out of here. And here I was a\nsixteen year old kid, barely sixteen, fifteen really, and telling them, here was a family and I was\ntelling them to get out of here. And the family consisted of a mother, father, a daughter and two\nsons. And they were tailors. And the old man was quite old, the father, was telling me, he said,\n\u201cBut, but, where can we go?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, we have,\nwe have no place. Our, our house was destroyed, and I mean we knew that this 1s, this was a Jewish\napartment, but still it was between this or living in the street, in the cold snowy January,\u201d so he said,\n\u201cCould, could you do something, could, could we somehow come to some kind of an agreement?\u201d\nAnd so my mother came up and she said, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just divide the place between us?\u201d And\nhere it was a two room apartment with their family, four people, five people in their families and\ntwo, my mother and I, and we decided that after looking at them and listening to them and all this,\nthere was just something that all of a sudden hit me. My chip was gone and so we decided that yes,\nwe were going to, we'll, well make it. And so we lived there under the same roof and we became\nvery good friends. And when my father came home in late spring, the new government, Democratic\ngovernment, devised this plan of each block had to elect a kind of a small council and the head of\nthat council was quite powerful in deciding if there was an empty apartment or, almost like a Justice\nof Peace. They had certain tasks that they can perform, temporarily, they were deputized. And my\nfather was appointed to do this because he was always very much respected by the people there and\nthe fact that he was now good, you know, with the new regime. And next to us, an apartment was\nfull of old, old women who died one after another. It was a, like a Salvation Army place. They,\nthey rented it and it became empty, so my father got the apartment for them and they moved over\nthere so we could get our apartment back, we lived there, but they could never really thank enough\nand we, we kept this relationship for a long time and I\u2019m sorry I lost contact with them. But then,\nwe had an apartment and then we faced something else because then the Russians were coming\naround and trying to find places for their soldiers and so they, they got, they got two old Russian\nsoldiers from Siberia who were quartered in, in our apartment because two rooms were too many\nfor three people. So, and I remember, they were very cute old men, we had no, I mean we had sign\nlanguage, we didn\u2019t speak Russian and the only incident I remember is that my mother, of all these\nsufferings, had one little symbol in her possession: a bottle of very expensive cologne water that she\nkept. And she said, \u201cI am going to start using this after the war, when we are all together and we\nltve in peace.\u201d And so, and she kept it and she had it with her all the time. And so now, when we\nmoved back, she, we got a temporarily, kind of an armoir and she put it way back between sheets.\nNow one day we came home and my mother said, \u201cThis, this place smells like cologne water, very\n* When Robert lived there, the street number was 39. It was later changed to 66.\ngood cologne water,\u201d and she rushed to her cologne water in the armoir but these two Siberians,\nRussians were very hard pressed to get alcohol, anything, they would drink. I mean, there were\nstories that I can\u2019t believe, that they went to the museum and drank alcohol out of these scientific\nlab experiments and\u2014including embryos\u2014but I never believed those stories, but this is true. They\ndrank my mother\u2019s cologne water. They were so, so hard pressed for alcohol. And that was about\nour only experience with Russians in our house. Otherwise, most people lost their watches. They\nwere very hard pressed for watches. It was a time when nobody in his right mind would walk\naround in Budapest with a watch on his wrist. They just, they were fascinated. They stop you and\nthey took your watch. That was their, their, their thing. Well, anyway, okay, ask.",
        "Q: So the Russians had moved into your apartment then. . .",
        "A: Yeah, two.",
        "Q: During the German occupation, this was before. . .",
        "A: No, no, no. This was during the Russian occupation.",
        "Q: Oh, after. [talkover]",
        "A: Oh yes. I\u2019m talking about after, this all happened after. Oh no, there were no Russians during the\nGerman occupation. I wish there were. No.",
        "Q: I wanted to go back just a little...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: ...bit, I had, I had wanted to ask you about when you were younger as a child and you were in\nschool, were your friends mostly Jewish...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Or did you share...",
        "A: Yes. Mostly Jewish. There were a few Gentile friends who never, ever mentioned religion, never\nreally made us feel inferior, just a few. And after the war, I made it clear how much I appreciated it.\nSo, I\u2019m glad that I could do that. Now, I also have to say that not many of my classmates survived\nbecause my Jewish classmates were in a labor battalion and they were working outside Budapest on\nthe day when the deportations came to that village. And the gendarmerie had an empty boxcart and\nthey decided not to let them go home but deport them. So very few Jewish classmates of mine\nsurvived. Gentiles, again, the war, the army eventually, everybody who was fifteen, fourteen,\nfifteen, sixteen at the end of the war, the last few months, the Arrow Cross people, they forced\nchildren out into the street with a gun. So quite a few of them did not survive. I really had very\nfew contact with, with, with the few that survived but there weren\u2019t too many.",
        "Q: And you had mentioned that your father\u2019s employer was helping you and your mother out.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Yes. And my father was very grateful to him and worked for him again after the war.",
        "Q: And so the help that he gave you then during the time that your father was away was enough for you\nand your mother to... [talkover]",
        "A: Yes. I also took a job. I was a messenger boy up until 19... until the yellow star came into\nexistence... \"44 March. I was a messenger boy for architectural firm. Because of the bicycle. I\ncould bicycle around then, so I was delivering messages and things. So, that supplemented also, my\nfather\u2019s salary which wasn\u2019t a full salary, just part of it.",
        "Q: And as the war progressed, was the next significant event then, would have been the German\noccupation?",
        "A: Yes. 1944, March, if I remember it, 19\", is when the Germans had serious doubts apparently, that\nHungary is not a trusted ally anymore, that Hungary probably entertains the idea of getting out of\nthe war because by that time I think Romania was ready to jump and the situation in Italy was very\nshaky so they decided to occupy Hungary officially and put in a very right-wing government which\nwas still a lot better than what came in 1944, October. That will be the other stage. But let\u2019s take a\nlook at what happened when the Germans marched in, the yellow star had to be worn within a few\nweeks, or... So, the labor battalions were more intensified. Now everybody who was eighteen had\nto go, that was now, they lowered the limit and the deportations started. So, unfortunately, that was\nthe worst thing, the deportations. They started in the countryside, eventually coming to Budapest.\nThey were supposed to come to Budapest, you know, by the fall.",
        "Q: You mentioned that your friends were deported one day.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did you manage to avoid being deported yourself?",
        "A: That was just an, a coincidence, that my aunt, the one who gained this special status, said to me,\n\u2018Please, I just have some very bad feelings, I don\u2019t want you to go today out and work. Stay home,\nstay with me.\u201d She took me to her apartment and that was the day when it happened. It was just a,\njust a miraculous instinct that she had. And that is what saved me.",
        "Q: Did life take a turn after that, after the German occupation did you feel, were you able to feed\nyourself and your mother adequately?",
        "A: Well, what I did was, I gathered, I was always quite street smart and so I somehow found that the\nbest way to do this whole thing is first to get some papers that would qualify us\u2014at least to those\nwho don\u2019t know us\u2014as Christians. So I took my mother\u2019s jewellries, sold it, and bought papers.\nAnd the papers were blank and you had to fill it out. And I did that. Also, I got some papers and I\nfill it out with the same name from a cousin of mine who was adopted but had birth certificate and\neverything else that pertained to the fact that he was a Gentile. And his parents gave me his papers\ntoo so I had kind of this double insurance, moving around, in case I needed it. For a while, I did not\nuse these papers. I waited until, you know, we got the point where it was necessary. Also, there\nwas a danger that until the Russian troops did not cross the Hungarian border, it was a matter of a\ntelephone call to find out if you had false birth certificates. All they had to do 1s call the\nprincipality, you know, and that, that municipality and check, okay? And so, actually, we waited\nuntil practically the first village fell and, after that, it was much easier to fill 1t out, to a town or a\nvillage that had, that was already occupied under occu... Soviet occupation because they couldn\u2019t\ncheck anymore.",
        "Q: And after that point, did you use those papers?",
        "A: Then, then, then we used the papers for awhile, but it was a, it was very confusing period when we\nwere moving a lot. First, my wife, my mother and I moved to the, the apartment of one of my\nfather\u2019s friends. They were Seventh-Day Adventists. And they offered their place but soon they\nlearned that Seventh-Day Adventists are just in the same danger as Jews so after consultation, we\nleft. Then we were, we went to a, I was always on the street, hearing, feeling, looking, what can\nhappen? Then I took my mother to a Jewish high school which was designated as a clothing supply\nbusiness for the Hungarian army and it was really a refuge for, for Jews. They were sewing\nuniforms for the army and it was established by old Hungarian Jewish army officers who wanted to\nsave their skin and their family and hired fake guards in uniform to come in and out of the place,\nputting on a show and inside they were actually really making, sewing uniforms and delivering it to\nthe army and, and, so I was always, it was just constantly you had to change your position and you\nhad to always look at what seems safe at the moment. And it is possible that something that was\nsafe one week became unsafe the next week because somebody recognized one person in that place\nwhen he was walking down the street, going into places, \u201cHere is a Jew, doesn\u2019t wear a yellow star,\nwhat is he doing?\u201d And so, your life depended on nuances, those days.",
        "Q: So you just took off the yellow star?",
        "A: My aunt is the one who just ripped off the yellow star and said, \u201cYou stay with me,\u201d and then my\nmother came there, too. And this is how we got to this house in Zichy Jeno Street, One, in the Fifth\nDistrict of Budapest.",
        "Q: Now, I think before you even moved into that house, there had been a lot of Allied bombings...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Had there not? Of Budapest?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So where were you during that time?",
        "A: Well, we, whenever there was a, up until we had to leave our own apartment, when there was a\nbombing we lived tn the cellar, you know, sometimes for hours. But usually, the bombings came at\nnight, so, I, one thing that war taught me how to be very organized because there was no light. You\ncouldn\u2019t turn on the light. No, that was a major offense. If they saw any light, when the sirens went\noff, they, they considered you collaborating with the, with the enemy, you know, giving signals. So,\nI had to lay out all my stuff and in the darkness I could pick every one of my clothes and still do, to\nrun down. We had seconds to run down in the bombing, started. Usually, there was no really\nintense bombing of Budapest. Most of the bombers, many times, Americans, were flying over to\nRomania, to Ploesti, to bomb the oil fields. There was really not much to bomb in Budapest, was\nnot very badly bombed. Budapest was, Budapest was mainly destroyed during that siege from\nDecember until January 18. That was the main reason for the destruction. But before that, there\nwas not that much.",
        "Q: So, when was it that you moved in with your aunt?",
        "A: It was late fall, in 1944, you know. Late fall that... when we felt that that place was the best place\nto be. And then it turned out to be a very fortunate choice because in that house, there was a famous\nHungarian psychiatrist. Psychiatry was, in Hungary, at the very, very early stage. This man became\nvery famous and since there weren\u2019t too many, a great deal of his clientele were famous politicians,\nactors, actresses, writers. So he was well-known all over the place and he had this idea that he is\ngoing to save his family and friends by number one, contacting a fascist officer and I\u2019ve no idea\nhow he did it, who wants to save his skin and is willing to play this game of declaring the house a\nclinic and, and do everything possible to save the people inside the house and then he found this\nman and his name was Jereczian Ara George. And this is in reverse order because Hungarian\nnames are in reverse order. The last name is what we consider first so in English you would say\nGeorge Ara Jereczian. The, I remember him, a very handsome man, a very, kind of a man of stature\nand a fascist uniform, hand grenades hanging from his belt. I mean, he was intimidating to anyone.\nTo, with us, he was very kind. The, I suppose, looking back that we about three hundred doctors\nand families in that apartment house jammed, absolutely jammed. While we could still live\nupstairs, probably there were at least five to ten people to a room. When we lived in the basement,\nno one 1s to tell, we were just side by side on mattresses because when the siege of Budapest started,\nyou couldn\u2019t live upstairs anymore. So this man moved in with a few of his men who apparently\nwere loyal to him and his girlfriend and they set up their headquarters there and they were\npractically like a, a, a support group. The clinic had its official emblem there and the whole\noperation looked like it was a legal operation to save anybody who is injured. \u2018Kay? Now, we\u2019re at\nthe end?",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t we pause here? I\u2019d like to ask you some more. . .",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\nTape 2, Side B",
        "Q: Okay. We\u2019re on tape two, side B of an interview with Mr. Robert Holczer. And if we can just go\nback a little bit and I'd like to know something about during the, you mentioned that you stopped\ngoing to school at a certain point and I wanted to hear about what you did with your days at that\ntime. When was that exactly?",
        "A: It was, it was in 1944, [coughs] excuse me. After I finished what would be eighth grade here, it was\nthe fourth grade of middle school and I was supposed to then go to what they call gymnasium,\nwhich is high school in Europe. I could not get into a high school and so it was not a long period\nbut between 1944, I have to figure this out. Let\u2019s see, 1925, 40, right. So there was a year, \u00b043\nbecause I was, I left the school, \u201943 so I had one year when actually I didn\u2019t do much except odd\njobs. My father was away, so, as I mentioned before I delivered, worked for an architectural firm\nand delivered blueprints, whatever I can find but I could not get into high school. The higher four\ngrades of high school, the gymnasium. And so my mother suggested that we hire a tutor so by the\ntime I would be available for high school, I wouldn\u2019t miss much. And this is why I had a private\ntutor. I was studying especially Latin because everybody suggested that that would probably create\na problem when all of a sudden I, war would be over\u2014we were always optimists\u2014and I could go\nto, instead of the first form to the second form and Latin would create the biggest problem. So for\nLatin and Algebra, I had a tutor, somebody in, in my mother\u2019s distant family, who lived in\nBudapest. And this is how the year went by. There was really not much else, a little work and a\nlittle study.",
        "Q: At that time, was, were you and your mother aware of the so-called Final Solution and what was\nhappening to Jews elsewhere in Europe?",
        "A: Yes. My mother somehow, well, first of all the BBC, of course, unfortunately told us what\nhappened to the Jews who were taken away to concentration camps and death camps but by the that\ntime it was well known in Hungary too, what the deportations, how the deportations end up. So my\nmother was extremely upset, for understandable reasons and I really had to kind of keep her spirit\nup and, constantly reminding her that there are certain things we can\u2019t change and she still has to\nlive for her own little immediate family. But yes, we were very much aware, very much aware.\nAnd even though it was very, very difficult to get BBC and up until 1944, March, or April when the\nradios had to be turned in, we could still get BBC. And I learned from my father, I was six years\nold when I learned from my father that there is more to news than just the Hungarian papers and the\nHungarian radio. He would close the shutters at certain times, he always changed the times, of\ncourse, he would lock the doors and he would listen to BBC. At a very early age and would tell me\nthat this is the truth. Eventually, it became very dangerous because the Germans would have a\ndevice that was on top of a car, similar probably to what radar is today, that would circle and try to\nfind people who listened to foreign broadcasts. And it was punishable also by going to\nconcentration camp.",
        "Q: And yet, despite your awareness of what was happening elsewhere in Europe, you and your mother\nremained, or at least your mother remained optimistic enough to find you a tutor and to...",
        "A: Yes. Yes. [talkover] Well, I think this is in the Jewish nature, if you consider the fact that people\nin boxcars going to Auschwitz were still running schools, right? It\u2019s just that, this part of the, of the\noptimism and the fact that you have to learn, learn and learn. That was with us. That kind of a\nfeeling never left us and we never really gave up.",
        "Q: Was your tutor Jewish?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. She was. And she was just a distant cousin of my, my mother and she, I eventually\nmet her when I was in Israel, again. She emigrated to Israel.",
        "Q: And, were, well let\u2019s just go forth to the, okay, let\u2019s go back to your, your home with your aunt that\nyou had moved into several months after the German occupation and you had begun to describe to\nme this house, and the man who had been a member of Arrow Cross who had established it as a\nclinic. And as, as it was established as a clinic, did the same people who had been living in it\nbefore, did some of them move out or have to leave or just more people came?",
        "A: No, those who were in the house, they were allowed to stay, which is obvious, I mean, anybody\nwho would have been tossed out would have had to go to the ghetto. And it was, to most people, it\nwas clear that eventually the ghetto is going to be annihilated. There was no other way, since\nBudapest was surrounded by then by the Soviet forces, what else can you do with it? They built a\nhuge wooden wall around the ghetto and, according to the rumors, they would just detonate the\nwhole thing or burn it down or, but they would not let the Jews survive if the siege had lasted\nanother week or so. The lucky thing is that they just ran out of time. I, of course I was never in the\nghetto, but no, those who were in the house, they could stay, and a lot of other families moved in,\npractically all of them connected to famous Hungarian doctors.",
        "Q: Before the house was established as a clinic...",
        "A: It was a Jewish house.",
        "Q: It was a Jewish house...",
        "A: Yes. It was a Jewish house. It had, 1t was a designated Jewish house.",
        "Q: And who was living in your aunt\u2019s apartment with you?",
        "A: Well, about at least ten other members of our family. Some other aunts and brothers of my father,\nmy mother, of course, and I. I say, and it was a, about one and a half room apartment and there\nwere plenty of people in it. But that was the, the least of our problems, really, you know. We\ncould, we could sleep very well. There were a lot worse arrangements in Budapest at that time.\nThere were, there were people in Swedish-protected houses in, near the Danube, where, I\nunderstand, people couldn\u2019t even sleep. They just were, you know, practically back to back in a\nroom, there were so many people jammed in. This is the one that Wallen... what was his name, the\nSwedish diplomat, Wallenberg, the one, that was his little area, Raoul Wallenberg. But I never, I\nwent a couple of times by, but I never went up but I noticed that there just, there were just lots of\nlots of people.",
        "Q: And then this house, before it was established as a clinic, were there non-Jews living as well?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. And interestingly, I can remember that a couple of non-Jewish families stayed there.\nThey just stayed there. By that time, perhaps what went through their mind is, that, since the war\ninevitably is coming to an end, it\u2019s not a bad idea to be here when the Soviet troops come. So that\nmust have been their reasoning. And it was not, not impractical, actually. At the same time, even in\nthe last week, we were in danger of being taken to the Danube, that was the, the most common way\nof getting rid of Jews who were discovered outside the ghetto, marched down and shot into the\nriver. It was a cold, bitter, snowy winter and the Danube was red and full of corpses. But I\nremember that even the last week, somebody from the neighborhood reported us to the fascist\nauthorities and they came and tried to disarm Jereczian Ara George\u2019s own people in the house, the\nbodyguards. And he seemed, he almost seemed helpless. We were already lined up and then he\nagain arrived there, amazingly, he did this more than once, with some paper from a very special\nhigher authority that said, \u201cClear out of here. This is a protected territory and we do our job for the\ngovernment and leave us alone.\u201d We confronted the man after the war. I know that. He was\ncaught, the one who reported us because he was stupid enough to show up the last week before\nBudapest was, Pest was occupied, and pointed fingers. I also remember another man who was a\nfascist officer that lived a couple of houses across from us who was also quite antagonistic toward\nus and we were worried about him. And also the last week, they brought him in with a head injury.\nHe was shot in the head in the street fighting. There was tremendous street fighting and he was just\nleft there to die. And I don\u2019t know, I was just fascinated by, by this man that, that everybody was\nalways afraid of and here he was, basically a nothing anymore, you know. And in spite of my good\njudgement, I watched him, kept going back to him, as a young man all night, watch him how he was\ndying. And I can\u2019t, I still cannot explain this fascination, because ever since I couldn\u2019t look at\nanother human being, even an animal that is dying. But somehow, there was a mixed feeling in me\nof revenge and satisfaction that this scum 1s, is not going to be here any longer and I wanted to see\nhow he was going. And my mother, I remember scolded me for this and constantly was taking me\nback to our place, where we, our sleeping arrangement was. But, there, there were incidents like\nthis and it was a very, very strange period for a fifteen-year-old boy. My job was basically to take\nlegs and arms up that were cut off, operated on in the so-called operating room which was a, a dark\npart of the basement and kind of arrange them on the, in the courtyard. And when in, when in\nJanuary 18\", we went up, upstairs, everybody was horrified. There were huge piles of limbs just\npiled up on the courtyard. And most of it, I had to pile up because I was the one who was always\nsent up with these. The doctors operated without any anesthesis [sic], anything. There were, there\nwere, there was nothing and it, of course, the survival ratio probably was minimal, you know. But\nthat, whenever I look into that house, that always comes to my mind, how these houses survive. We\ndie but they keep their secrets.",
        "Q: Had any of the other people who were living in your aunt\u2019s apartment, did they have papers, false\npapers?",
        "A: I have a feeling that most of them did because my father\u2019s brothers wore the uniform of a military\npolice and again, because of their, their origin from this working, workers\u2019 neighborhood, they got\npapers and they got uniforms. They were supplied with everything, both of them. So.",
        "Q: Were you using your papers at the time?",
        "A: I was, only when, when on the street, they stopped me and asked for papers. That was the only time\nI used mine. And, by the last, I would say the last few weeks it didn\u2019t mean anything if they\nstopped a man because they didn\u2019t even ask for papers. They asked for you to drop your pants.\nAnd since in Europe, only Jews are circumcised, it was very easy to detect who was a Jew. And I\nhave to thank, I mean my life was really saved by a man who, amazingly appeared at the time when\nI thought that this was my last moment on earth. I was sent out to get something, I think, if I\nremember correctly, I was sent out because a horse fell on the street from shrapnels and we needed\nsome meat. And the only kind of meat, whenever we had meat, the only meat that we could get was\nhorsemeat. And of fallen horses, horses that were shot on the street, usually by airplanes. Airplanes\nflew very low and they were just machine-gunning anything that moved. And I always ran out and\nI also crawled out to get water. There were certain areas where a faucet was still intact and you\ncould get some water. And a patrol came and caught me and they said, \u201cOkay, here, come, come\ninto the doorway of this house,\u201d and they were shouting, yelling, \u201cThis looks like a Jew and took off\nyour pants, take off your pants,\u201d and they give me the order and I was kind of snow-white probably\nand shaking and all of a sudden another man with a much higher rank came and said to the guys,\n\u201cLook, I see four, five Jews on that corner. Go immediately, see, catch those, I take care of this\nidiot here. And so we went under the doorway and I was unbuttoning my pants and kind of shaking\nand he said, \u201cListen,\u201d he said, \u201care you crazy?\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where you come from, do\nyou have a place where you were staying?\u201d I said yes. He said, he said, \u201cGo back and I don\u2019t ever\nwant to see you again on the street.\u201d And we came out and he was hitting me and beating me and\njust and he said to these people, \u201cThis idiot, he\u2019s not a Jew,\u201d he said, \u201che\u2019s an idiot, a young idiotic\nkid who wants to be a hero apparently. Go back to your mother and don\u2019t ever leave the house.\u201d\nAnd I told my mother this story and of course, she never let me, the last week she never let me leave\nthe place, under no circumstances. And interestingly, about four, five weeks after we were\nliberated, I went to the UNRRA, the UNRRA was the U, N, R, R, A, that was the, the joint\ncommittee of the Jewish Relief and you could go there and you could get some emergency supplies,\nfood supplies, they were bringing them in. And who was at the door letting people in? I recognized\nthis man. And I walked up to him, he had a huge, a big flag emblem on his lapel, the flag of what\ntoday is Israel, at that time it was a Zionist emblem. And I said to him, I said, \u201cHey, you know, you\nsaved my life?\u2019 And he looked at me, he said, \u201cYou too?\u201d He said, \u201cThere were many more.\u201d And\nturned\u2014he didn\u2019t really want me to elaborate or nothing. And there were many people like this.\nNow who they were, I was very curious and I went to find out and most of the people who were\ndoing this were Polish Jews because a lot of them had very fair complexions. They were blond and\nblue-eyed and so, and they came to Hungary early, 1939 or so, and in four, five years, they learned\nenough Hungarian, and good Hungarian so they had very little accent and they could pass as, there\nwere other people in the Arrow Cross movement who had accents, so quite a few of them were in\nthe Arrow Cross movement. And in the Zionist Underground so, that was a lucky, a lucky accident\nfor me.",
        "Q: How did you get food during that time?",
        "A: During the siege? Well, during the siege. . .",
        "Q: Well, I\u2019m sorry, not only during the siege but during the time of the establishment of the clinic.",
        "A: Oh, well they, they did it, the, the man I told you who saved us, he had good source of supply. So,\nthere was always a center of supply. The only thing that we could not get was of course, what did\nwe get, flour and beans. These were the two and soya. People made, there was incredible things\nout of soyabeans. I have great respect for soyabeans. They made sausage, they made, you name it,\nand it all tasted like real sausage or soyabread was marvelous. And they made bread of rice and just\ninvented all kinds of things that they had never eaten before. But the, the big thing was meat.\nEverybody wanted to have meat so we always watched out, looked out for horses, horses. And you\nshould have seen, when a horse fell on the street, ah, everybody was running with huge knives and\ncarving it out and running back into the basement because .. .",
        "Q: People wearing the stars at that time? [talkover]",
        "A: No, nobody in, nobody, nobody in this house wore stars. Okay? Nobody, that was a taboo. No.\nAnd that was his order. \u2018Kay? We were exempt, because a lot of things that he told us, 1t was not\ntrue, it was just to boost our confidence but by that time there was such confusion everywhere, in\nhigher government places that who, who knows what was really the truth and what was not? Only\nhe can.",
        "Q: So he would distribute the food and then everybody would take it back to their apartments...",
        "A: No, no. We did, we had pretty good organization. No, he was the one who secured the food by,\nyou know, sending a contingent of people to, to get it and then we brought it back and then we, we\ndivided it. He had his little place there and he was just, these are all intelligent people and very\ndisciplined people. He did not have to go down personally and do anything, really. All we needed\nhim for is to, to, to help us survive, to, to protect us from the outside world. But inside, we\norganized everything ourselves.",
        "Q: Was everybody who lived in the building in some way involved [talkover]",
        "A: Some way, yes. Yes. They had to. They had to, they did something. Okay, at least, if nothing else\non paper. My mother was a nurse, for example.",
        "Q: And your only job was to take these limbs?",
        "A: Well, I was, what they called, I was a messenger, you know, I was an errand boy. I was fifteen, and\nso, that was, I had a little uniform and a gray overall with a, kind of a military cap. But I was in\ncharge of taking the, the severed things up.",
        "Q: Did you have any friends in the building?",
        "A: I, did I have, yes, I had a friend. And it was the first time in my life that I really felt a sexual\nattraction toward a woman. And I was kind of a cute little kid and she was a lot older than I. And I\nthink under different circumstances, probably, we would have been much cozier but it was, there\nwere too many people around. I liked her. She was a, believe it or not, there was a, among other\nthings, there was a famous Hungarian Jewish comedian who also ended up in our, in our place.\nAlphonso. And this was the other half of his act, a young woman. And we became good friends\nand I had all kinds of fantasies about her and maybe she, too, about me. But my mother was around\nand too many people and so our attraction never really came to anything else, but just that. But we\nspent a lot of time together and, and, and it was just a nice puppy love, I think, that I\u2019ve had for the\nfirst time in my life with an older, somebody was at that time older, not too old. I think she was in\nher early twenties or so, but I was just fifteen. And the, I also had a strange relationship with an\nItalian girl. The Italian government of Badoglio (ph), that was his name, his Air Force chief I think,\nor Air Force minister had a Hungarian Jewish wife and when things got very hot in Italy, he brought\nher back to Hungary because he felt that in Hungary she has a better chance of survival, being the\nwife of the famous Italian Air Force general. In Italy, everybody knew that she was Jewish and they\nwere afraid of deportation. So, and he had a daughter, and somehow I had a lot of friends in the\nItalian school in Budapest, the Italian embassy maintained a school. And I fell in love with this girl.\nAnd the stupid thing, the reason this ties in with this story, the stupid I did was, during the terrible,\nduring those terrible days of siege, whenever I had some food like horsemeat or something, I would\nwalk, they lived about a half an hour from our house and I would walk on the street, of course walk,\ntry to run from one block to another, very close to the walls to deliver food to this girl and to her\nmother. And, and I felt that this was my obligation and it was a stupid thing to do.\nEnd of tape 2, Side B\nTape 3, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape three, side A of an interview with Mr. Robert Holczer. Am I pronouncing your name\ncorrectly?",
        "A: Holczer.",
        "Q: Holczer. Holczer. I\u2019m interested in hearing, you were just describing some of your friendships to\nme and I\u2019m interested in hearing what you did for entertainment, how you, if you managed to find\nany games to play or ways to have fun?",
        "A: Well, if I remember correctly, we did not play any games because the day went by with constantly\nwatching out to survive. We watched the streets, we listened to the radio. I remember that I was\nterribly concerned with the expression of adults around me, I watched their faces. I always\nsuspected that they know more than what they would tell me and somehow, in the last few weeks, I\njust became obsessed with, with this business of survival. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else and my\nuncle, who is, the one who is still alive, reminded me that my constant question to him was,\npractically hourly, \u201cHow long will this last? How long will this last?\u201d This was my constant\nquestion. I was just counting the hours. We knew that the, that the streetfighting between the\nGermans and the Russians cannot be more than a couple of city blocks away. We saw German\nsoldiers, injured, moving down the street and we heard, practically, the gunfire as if 1t were next to\nus. Some people came in injured who reported that just a couple of blocks from us there were\nalready Russian soldiers so it was that, that, that tension that kept me from doing anything else\nexcept just waiting for that final onslaught when I can see that our area 1s liberated. There was just\nno mood for playing. We were not children. None of us were children. We were, all our\nconversations, I remember, with the, with the kids of my age down there, all, everything was always\nrevolving around survival.",
        "Q: So even before the, the actual siege you didn\u2019t have?",
        "A: No, before the actual siege, yes, I, 1 still contacted sometimes my old Boy Scout comrades, they\nwere the ones that I kept up with. But once of course, the siege started then, there was no chance to,\nto go out and do anything like that.",
        "Q: So some of your, your Boy Scout comrades had escaped the deportation?",
        "A: Oh yes, well, remember these were not school, these were not school people, I told you that. No,\nthese are all from various, the Boy Scout group, the membership consisted of people from anywhere\nin Budapest and for various areas and quite a few of them survived. So, even after the war, of\ncourse, we met for awhile and then we decided there is nothing in it for us anymore and that\u2019s when\nI joined the Zionist Movement. That gave me a lot more important goals than the Boy Scouts.",
        "Q: The, the Boy Scouts, your friends from the Boy Scouts weren\u2019t in the ghetto then.",
        "A: No. Some of them did go in, you know, some of them did go in. But others weren\u2019t. And so we\ncommunicated and visited with a couple of, who were outside.",
        "Q: You would go to each other\u2019s home?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Strictly, you know, strictly so. We didn\u2019t want any conversation, any, any public place\nthat can be overheard. Because our main concern was the kind of topic that others shouldn\u2019t hear.",
        "Q: Such as what?",
        "A: Well, where are the Russian forces? What did you hear? All this. What did the radio say? We\ndidn\u2019t have any radios, the Jews, right? But those who were hiding, and were perhaps with a\nChristian family, they could still listen to BBC so that was the, the entire existence was the war and\nthe topics were just that.",
        "Q: Now the, the clinic, what, who were the people that the clinic would treat? Was it just anyone who\nwould happen to be injured?",
        "A: Well, theoretically, we were supposed to treat fascist officials according to all the papers and the,\nthe permit that our leader, you know, had. But there was such chaos in the last few weeks, you\nknow, when the siege of Budapest started, that we treated everybody who came in from the street\nwho was injured. And it was pathetic, sometimes, that people would come in with some very minor\nproblems and leave the clinic, and within minutes they were brought back with, with practically\ntheir guts out. In other words, in order to reach us, they went through such danger that they lost\ntheir lives, eventually. We had, we had no medicine left, we had practically nothing. So we\ncouldn\u2019t do much. Anybody, anybody was treated. And doctors are doctors. I was always\ninterested in, especially when there was a fascist official, what did they do to him? Would they take\nadvantage of the fact that here we are, you know, lost all family members and all this, but I talked\nto, this interested me and I talked to some of the doctors and they said there\u2019s no such thing, a\ndoctor cannot do that.",
        "Q: Did the clinic work with any of the other rescue organizations in any way?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t. By that time, there was no contact, nothing. Everybody\u2019s out for, for itself. There\nwas, there was just, everything collapsed. The streets were ruled by twelve year old children with\nsubmachine guns and disenfrised [sic], uneducated laborers who never amounted to anything, and\nthis was their way to get their revenge. They were shooting first, truly and asking questions after. It\nwas, it was the, a total reign of terror.",
        "Q: What about before the siege, siege?",
        "A: Before the siege, it was already leading up to this because they, as soon as the Arrow Cross\nmovement took over on October 15, the, they started. It was just as bad. And the minute the\nadmiral who was the head of Hungary, Admiral Horthy finished his speech in which he announced\nthat as far as he was concerned the war was lost, at that moment, you know, hell broke loose. He\nwas atrested, his bodyguards were arrested.",
        "Q: And you, as soon as that, that date, October 15, you just didn\u2019t go outside anymore?",
        "A: No, well, we, that was the date when the house, the story I told you began to get, take shape, okay?\nThis was when we kind of put our heads together and we learned that this psychiatrist is taking steps\nto bring this man in and all this. We had to act very quickly because events were really coming to\nan end. The Russians were approaching Budapest rapidly and we knew that again, that gives the,\nthese guys very little time to kill all of us. And they were getting more and more vicious,\namazingly. Instead of saving their skin, they became even more violent.",
        "Q: Okay, so, before the siege, and you were sometimes going out...",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: You would deliver messages?",
        "A: Right, right. I had, you know, the uniform and the ID and all this. I was sent to get our rations, you\nknow, I was sent to pick up some papers or pick up medicine. Yeah, I was Justa...",
        "Q: But you had no contact with the Red Cross or with the different legations.",
        "A: Well, the, the Red, if I remember correctly, we had some, some very vague contact with the Red\nCross, I probably picked up medicine from them or something for the, for the organization. But\npersonally, I had no as a, as an individual, I had no contact other than with the, just with the Swiss\nEmbassy. I told you I had a Switz, Swiss schutzpass, that by the time the Arrow Cross movement\nstarted, meant very little.",
        "Q: How did you, how did you get that schutzpdsse?",
        "A: Well, you could go to the Swedish Embassy or the Swiss Embassy and they would, put you on the\nlist and eventually would give it to you. And it was really just a, kind of a, a smokescreen. There\nwas not much, if you were lucky, they respected it and they let you go. If you were unlucky, they\njust tore 1t apart and said, \u201cStep into the wagon,\u201d you know, and you were gone. You could never,\nnever know. It, those embassies issued this in good faith but the people who looked at it, you were\nat the mercy of those. And I just happened to go to the Swiss one, but the Swedish did it and then\nprobably you heard the story, the Japanese, 1t was a Japanese in, in, not in Hungary, I think it was in\nLithuania or somewhere, did the same thing.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So, in Hungary, it was mainly the Swedish and the, and the Swiss and I think the Vatican too.\nThere was some, even though that the Primate of Hungary was almost like a collaborator. He did\nnot really act very courageously under the Nazi era.",
        "Q: Do you remember when the siege began?",
        "A: Yes. It was in December, if I know, December 20\" or something, very close to Christmas. That\u2019s\nwhen it... really, it just, all of a sudden we were shot at from every direction. We knew that\nBudapest was totally surrounded. The airplanes were just coming day and night. They were called\nratas, R, A, T, A, these small Soviet airplanes machine-gunning anything on the street that moved.\nIt was very dangerous to get out on the street. And of course, then, when it came to night, anybody\nwas moving could have been also shot by the fascists, by the Arrow Cross people, \u2018cause they were\nalso moving. And it, it was a lot of noise, a lot of injuries, a smell of, of the stench of, of gunpowder\nand, and corpses came closer, you know? War has a certain smell, a very very unpleasant smell that\nyou can really honestly feel. And as a child, I learned that. That\u2019s, that\u2019s all I can tell you, but...",
        "Q: Now, so the entire building then moved down into the basement?",
        "A: Yes, the entire Budapest lived in basements. Some of the newer houses\u2019 basements were clean,\nperhaps dry, you know. And you could make it with a little effort to become temporary living\nquarters. But those built in the 19\" century, they were damp, dark, they were just awful. Cold.\nAnd luckily, that this house, this Zichy Jeno Street was a fairly, fairly new house. And the basement\nwas livable. Now where I lived, where I lived before, in most of my life, back, that basement was\nsuch that I, oh, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to spend any time right there because it was a damp, old\ntypical, what you see almost in Dickensian, you know, movies or read about Dickensian novels.\nAlso, there were rats, loved this kind of a moist dark environment. But here, I remember our\nbasement as quite civilized in, in this house. So it was, the hardship was not really bad and so many\npeople, the heat, I think, of the bodies made up for the cold outside.",
        "Q: How many people were there?",
        "A: Oh, I would say we were a few hundred people in that basement, yeah?",
        "Q: How big was the basement?",
        "A: Oh, it, it would be like a floor, an entire floor of the house, because it was, usually the basements\nwere what you can consider a low floor. So, it\u2019s, I cannot really describe it in, in square footage\nbecause at that time I didn\u2019t even, I didn\u2019t even know about that, but it, it was a good size apartment\nhouse floor, okay, just picture it. And there were mattresses down, and everybody brought the\nmattresses down, and there were people very closely situated and, was in a way, it was kind of a\nwarm place.",
        "Q: Were there separate rooms?",
        "A: There were a few, but mainly the separate rooms were, were given to the doctors for operation,\noperating rooms and, and supply rooms and things like that. Most of the people lived in, in these\nbig open areas.",
        "Q: So the treatments continued, then?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Up until the, practically the last minute. And then the liberation, January 18, 1s when\nwe heard the emergency wall of our basement. We heard a knock and by law, there was a, an\nemergency entrance to every one of these basements between two houses that consisted only of one\nlayer of bricks. So, and there had to be a pick next to it. So we heard that a pick was working,\nbreaking through. And then, must have been about four o\u2019clock, five o\u2019clock in the morning and all\nof a sudden the furred hat half of a young Russian soldier, Soviet soldier, came through first and\nthen the whole body. And this was first time, I think, that he got a hug from people because, and he\ncouldn\u2019t understand why, he was absolutely bewildered because, of course, the Soviet soldiers were\nnot welcomed with great enthusiasm anywhere since most Hungarians were hoping for a German\nvictory and we, we were just hugging and kissing him.",
        "Q: Before we go forward, you, so the treatments continued but so, somebody was actually was going\nout onto the streets during that time and...",
        "A: We were, yeah, bringing in people from just the vicinity, okay, very close vicinity. And people\nwould come in on their own too, you know, with a, with a shrapnel or something in their leg or a\nsmall injury.",
        "Q: And was somebody going out to get food?",
        "A: Well, we had beans. We, we, I remember that we practically had beans every day. Beans, beans\nand beans. As long as you have beans, you can really survive. And water, yeah, water was dripping\nbut still, we could get at enough water to, for drinking. Nobody took a shower, that\u2019s for sure.\nThere was no way.",
        "Q: Was there a place to cook in the, in the basement?",
        "A: Yep. People had these little, you know, stoves. A lot of people had little stoves and they shared\nthose, whole families. There was, amazingly, it was a very peaceful environment because we all,\nwe only had one important thing 1n our mind, to get out of there, alive. And people shared.",
        "Q: So everybody managed to get along [talkover]?",
        "A: Yes, nobody, there was no such thing as leaving somebody starving or leaving somebody without\nfuel, or, I remember that everybody was doing their best. And of course, there are small little\nskirmishes mainly a couple of old people who just didn\u2019t understand the situation completely, and\nhad unreasonable demands or something and we had to step on their toes, and... But no basic, no,\nno big problems.",
        "Q: How many doctors would you say there were out of that...",
        "A: It\u2019s hard for me to look back but I would say we had at least thirty doctors there, at least. And we\nare talking about the cream of, of the Hungarian Jewish doctors, you know? Really, they went out\nand famous professors from universities so this man, this Doctor V\u00e9lgyessi? who was the\npsychiatrist living in the house originally, he had a very large circle of friends, and so he managed to\ngather the ones that he could and brought them in. And there were many other people, I don\u2019t know\nhow they got there. I just read a few years ago that the chief architect of Budapest, the main\narchitect of Budapest today, was with me in the basement in this house. I... somebody sent me, I\nthink, a newspaper article or while in visiting in Budapest I saw it, he gave an interview about it.\nBecause it was the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation of Budapest this year.",
        "Q: Was Jereczian still in, still with you at that point, at the point of the siege?",
        "A: Jereczian?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh he stayed, he stayed all the time, he stayed, he never left the place. Yeah. So, no, he was there\nall the time. And if he had to leave for some reason, he made sure that he left enough people there\nto, to protect us.",
        "Q: So he had made just a complete break from the Arrow Cross?",
        "A: Yes, apparently, apparently and why he even joined them and what was his job there, I don\u2019t know.\nI don\u2019t know. Since I left in 1948, you know, and I think that probably it took a few years to write\nabout these things and clear up this thing and I was not there in these, from \u201948 to 50. And after I\ncame back, you just didn\u2019t want to, those were the worst years of Stalinism and you didn\u2019t want to\nget involved with anything because you didn\u2019t know what he was doing at that time and so, no\nquestions asked was the best policy. But, later on in the sixties and seventies, I heard that he was a\nconcert impressario and that he took certain shows back to Budapest. And I even saw his name and\nI am, I really regret that I didn\u2019t go to see him. I should have looked for him somehow and talked to\nhim. So I feel so strongly about this whole thing that if I knew today that he is still alive, living, I\nwould probably go to Vienna. That\u2019s where he lived and, and, and just thank him again. But I\nknow that he received a great deal of recognition from people. But I know, I don\u2019t know exactly\nwhat, if he\u2019s alive today. He was, I would say, about ten, at least ten, fifteen years older than I, so\nit\u2019s hard to say.",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s go back to the, to the liberation. So there\u2019s a Russian soldier who broke through and you\nall embraced him and then, and then what did you do?\n> First name: Ferencz",
        "A: What did I do after that? Well, I did what probably is a natural thing to do. I went with the Russian\nsoldiers and whenever they broke into a store and they broke into every store that still had anything,\nI went with them. And after they were through and took what they wanted to take, I took what I\nwanted to take. In other words, I did what we called zabralny which means to confiscate things. I\nwas full of hate, I was full of frustration and I thought this, this was the way to get even, probably.\nAnd, I had a little store at home, a kind of a little supply of all these stolen goods that I got from\nshops that were just there, most people wouldn\u2019t dare to go in with the Russians, but I put back my\nyellow star and I went with them and unless I bumped into some Ukrainians, who were famous anti-\nSemites and beat the hell out of you, the, the others, they, they were welcoming you. They said go\nahead. Also, we had a, a little Jewish domestic from Romania with us, who joined us and helped\nmy, my mother and she also spent the last few months with us in this, in this basement. And she\nwas from Romania and with the Russians we had Romanian troops coming in. And she was a\nbeautiful young girl, nineteen, and the Romanian officers were just, just absolutely crazy about her.\nSo she took me by the hand and she said, \u201c\u201cCome with me.\u201d\u2019 And she went with these Romanians to\nall the jewelry stores and she amassed a fortune within days in jewelry. And then said goodbye to\nus and disappeared. We never found out what happened to her. She had a fiancee in Romania,\nwhether she found him or not, we suspected she eventually ended up in Israel like most young\npeople of that time. But I went with her and Romanian officers, I went with Russians. I was kind\nof a street urchin for awhile. I enjoyed the fact that nobody, nobody can really give me any orders.\nAnd my mother could not control me either, you know? I was now a man and I was just intoxicated\nby this, and so I had a little store there, that, with all the stolen goods, and my father saw this when\nhe came home and found out, asked me what happened and I told him. And he was absolutely just\nhorrified that I would do something like this and made me take everything back to the stores where I\ngot it from. It was interesting, he got a little cart for me, we put everything on it and he came with\nme and he stayed outside and I had to deliver it back. And I tell you, some of those people could\nnot believe that this happened. And today, of course, I feel very good about this but not, not at that\ntime. So, in, 1t took me only a year or two to realize that I, my real emotions that I\u2019m not a\nHungarian, I never had a Hungarian passport, you know? I never had any, any identity, Hungarian\nidentity. They, I was always being denied of being a Hungarian even though my parents were born\nin Hungary and practically everybody back generations born in Hungary and so I joined the Zionist\nMovement. And in 1948, the, the, the Communists completely took over the government. They\ncalled it the Year of Turn. And all other organizations except for Communist youth organizations\nwere banned. So again now I was in the underground Zionist organization.\nEnd of Tape 3, Side A\nTape 3, Side B",
        "Q: Okay, so this is tape three, side B of an interview with Mr. Robert Holczer. And will you describe\nto me your father\u2019s homecoming, what that event was like for you and your mother? And your\nfather?",
        "A: Well, I told you, before, that, it, we knew because of an emissary that he had sent ahead of him who\nthen by small dosage made us aware of the fact that he was alive, that he was coming, but of course,\nit was a tremendous emotional experience for him to appear there and, the fact that he immediately\nunderstood why there are two families living in the apartment and, and, and accepted our decision, it\nwas just a very nice homecoming. Because number one, we saw him, number two he brought food,\nwhich helped us to have a little feast then, and number three is that he, we knew that that\u2019s what he\nwould have done, he would have split the living quarters and would not throw a family of four,\nfamily of five who were out of their own, well, problems, housed in our place. We... naturally, we\nwere totally just overwhelmed by emotions for awhile and then, set out to see the rest of the family.\nHe wanted to see his brothers and sisters and, and, that\u2019s, this is what happened.",
        "Q: So you had left, when did you, let\u2019s go back a little bit again.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You had left the, the house on Zichy Jeno Street.",
        "A: Yes. Zichy utca. Yeah, I left 1t practically the day after we were liberated and went back to see\nwhat happened to our apartment. And that\u2019s where I found that family living in it. \u2018Kay? And, then\nshortly we moved back with my mother and so after a few months, I think it must have been April\nor May when my father finally appeared.",
        "Q: And you, during that few months, food was very scarce?",
        "A: It was, very scarce. But again, this aunt of ours, of mine, who played such an important role in\nsaving all of us, again, she and I, we teamed up and went, which was very customary then for city\npeople to do, took jewelry and possessions of the family that we thought farmers might like to have\nand we could put on our body, and walked about, I would say, thirty, forty kilometer, about twenty\nmiles from Budapest, and exchange it for food. We also hired a person with a horse to drag it back\nto Budapest. It was mainly flour, lard, necessities, but of course, a horse was immediately a red flag\nin, in the eyes of the Russians because they confiscated every horse, everything that could be used\nfor transporting their goods. And we were caught midway between this place and Budapest,\ncoming back, in a small Danubian village. On the other side of the Danube, there was a battle going\non. And we knew that it doesn\u2019t affect anything, because the Danube is a very wide river and the\nGermans didn\u2019t have any means to get over and why would they come over, but there was a battle\nover there because Trans-Danubia was not liberated yet. And so the Russians were very edgy and\nthey confiscated the cart, they confiscated the food, they confiscated the horse and then, they also\nincarcerated my aunt and myself. And I have no idea what happened, but the next... my aunt was\nwith me in the room and the, the Russian captain came in and took her out and she came back a few\nhours later and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everything is going to be fine.\u201d And the next morning, we\nwere given back the cart, the horse, the man who was the owner of the horse and cart and the food\nand everything else and let go. And I can only guess what was the price. The only thing I regret is\nthat we heard that after delivering the stuff to our home and sharing it with the family, when the, the\nfarmer whose, who had the horse and the cart went back, eventually, was caught and lost both. So\nyes, if you had still some belongings that farmers would appreciate, you could have food. Because\nthe farmers always have food.",
        "Q: How long did that cartful of food last you?",
        "A: Ah, probably, a few weeks and then, the, the UNRRA, the American Jewish organizations were also\nsending packages and, and would supply us regularly. So that helped too. We were not really, you\nknow, in danger of, of starving to death.",
        "Q: And did you go back to school?",
        "A: Yes, I went back to school, to high school, and eventually finished practically, my high school at the\nage of eighteen. And just a few weeks before, practically, of finishing, my Zionist Organization\ngive me signals that 1t was time to go to Israel because they couldn\u2019t guarantee that we would have\nmore time. The Communist Police was and the border guards were really closing everything very\ntightly. So, I, my instructions were to say goodbye to my family and get either an instrument or an\ninstrument case, that was instruction number one. Then I was called by my Zionist leaders and, and\nasked if it is true that my mother comes from this northern Hungarian town, I said yes. They said,\n\u201cDo us a favor. Go to that town, introduce yourself as, so they can recognize that you are, your\nmother is related,\u201d and all this and that, \u201cand ask them if they would like to have a high school\norchestra to play a concert in town. And if they say yes,\u2019 \u2014which probably they would, they said,\nbecause which little town doesn\u2019t like a free concert\u2014 \u201cgo to a printer, here 1s money and have nice\nposters printed.\u201d And they give me the date. I went, I talked to the mayor, he was overwhelmed, I\nwent to the printer, I had all the prints made and I didn\u2019t realize at that time that this was the alibi\njust in case we would be caught because this town is on the way to the border, my mother\u2019s\nbirthplace. On a given day, we boarded the bus, the bus was a state-owned bus by that time from a\nstate-owned company. We were all either holding an instrument or having an instrument case so\npeople thought this was a high school orchestra and while singing Communist songs, we took off\nfor the border. On the border, when we got close to this town, we kept on going and the bus driver\nsaid that he was hungry, we were hungry too so we stopped in a, in a certain pub or so and this was\nin 1948, February. We were eating there and getting something to drink and a woman began to flirt\nwith the bus driver. And we were horrified because that would, everything would cause a problem,\nwe, we knew that we had a definite plan. And soon the bus driver said that he would like to take\nabout a half an hour rest and my, our leader argued with him but he said, \u201cAll right, go.\u201d And as\nsoon as he disappeared, he gathered us and he said, \u201cGo across this field and there is a barn there\nand don\u2019t ask any questions, just get into the barn.\u201d That\u2019s what we did. They closed the barn and\naround midnight, or so, or later, we were marched down to the Ipoly River which is the river\nbetween Czechoslovakia and Hungary and to our great amazement, who was leading us?\u2014the\npeasant woman who was in the pub. She shed her twelve skirts or so because those women still\nwore many, many skirts, this was the, the thing. Now she had a leather jacket and blue jeans and\nshe spoke Hebrew with our leader. She was a, an Israeli army officer, born to Hungarian parents\nwho spoke perfect Hungarian and this was her job, to distract. And she led us down to the river,\neverything was supposed to happen so that on the other side of the river, this was Czechoslovakia\nand the reason we had to go to Czechoslovakia and not to Austria because the border between\nAustria and Hungary was already closed and tightly controlled but the Czechs were still kind of in\nbetween this Year of Turn and the Democratic regime that was there before. The, the end, at the\nend we crossed the river but instead of getting into the trucks, the border guards stayed and started\nto talk right there which was odd and very painful because there was snow on the ground. It was\nvery cold in February, we were wet and we had to lie on the ground for about a half an hour when\nthey finally left. Then we couldn\u2019t find a truck, the truck left, too, who was supposed to wait for us.\nSo it took us about a half a day to find it and, finally, we were taken to Bratislava, where the\ngendarmerie was paid off. We were nominally arrested by the gendarmerie and he put into a warm\nplace in the synagogue, there was straw on the floor, I remember, and the next morning, we were\ntaken to the railroad station, put in boxcarts [sic] and within about a half an hour they opened. We\nwere in Vienna, in the American section of, of, of Vienna. At that time, Vienna was divided. So\nthis was my, my great escape to Israel. And from there on, of course, we were taken down and\neventually ended up in Israel.",
        "Q: You mentioned how you had joined this Zionist organization that you realized that you, you were\nnot really a Hungarian citizen.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Was it the desire to have a place that led you to join the Zionist Organization?",
        "A: Yes. I mean, they, they, they, I felt that I was among brothers and sisters and I felt\u2014at that time\nremember it was the last few weeks of the war\u2014that I was, if I fought, I was going to fight for, for\nthe Jewish homeland. And I already associated myself more with that than with Hungary. That\nwas, every young person needs a fatherland and that was mine, even though I\u2019d never seen it before.\nSo, it was an emotional thing and I stayed in Israel for two day, two years.",
        "Q: How did your parents relate to your decision, to...",
        "A: Of course, they were very, very upset and very sad. But I said, \u201cYou can come and, and join me,\u201d\nyou know. And we agreed that they would but of course, they couldn\u2019t, because after we left, 1t was\nimpossible to, to leave Hungary for awhile. So, I corresponded and this was, this was one of the\nreasons why I returned eventually, in 1950 to Hungary, \u201ccause I realized that I needed to make up\nfor the years that my father was away. So I returned to Hungary and it was the worst of the Stalinist\nera. It was like 1984, it was terrible.",
        "Q: Did he, did your father identify himself as a, did he feel a Hungarian nationalism in any way?",
        "A: No, my father never really made an issue out of this. He never made an issue out of this, you know?\nOne way or another. Just, he, he, he loved his environment, Budapest. He loved to go to the coffee\nhouse and play cards with his friends and drink coffee and, and, probably gossip or whatever,\npolitics. He loved that. And he told us a cute little joke. They always asked him why doesn\u2019t he\nfollow me, when he was already alone, after my mother died and he, he said, \u201cI tell you a joke.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cMr. Kohn sits in this famous Hungarian coffee house\u2019\u201d\u2014it was called Hungaria, it\u2019s a very\nfamous, or New York, it had two names. New York before and after the German occupation, called\nHungaria because you couldn\u2019t give a place New York. Anyway, Mr. Kohn sits there and people\nsay, \u201cMr. Kohn, it is now the 1940s, we are after the war, all your friends are gone. They\u2019re all in\nNew York, what are you doing here alone in the coffee house?\u201d And Mr. Kohn said, \u201cLook son,\nwhat would I have done had I also left for New York? I would have arrived there one day and the\nnext day I would have looked for my old friends and I would have found them and the third day we\nwould have sat down to talk, about what? The good old days in the coffee house.\u201d He said, \u201cLook\nson, I am already in the coffee house.\u201d And my father always said, \u201cThis is my coffee house.\u201d In\nother words, this was his life, this was his environment. You know, he was always on his feet, he\nwas always going around in Budapest and he was also working almost up to the last year just before\nhe died. He was, he just couldn\u2019t be without work. He was a workaholic and he knew that in this\ncountry, you need language. And he had very poor language facilities, he would have never learned\nEnglish. So, it was a realization but we, we saw him as much as we could.",
        "Q: What did you do when you arrived in Israel?",
        "A: Basically, I spent most of my time in kibbutz, living in a kibbutz. I learned to work with the tractors\nat that time, and then we, with a hundred other Hungarian, young Hungarian youth, most of them\nfrom my old organization from Hungary, we received land near the Jordanian border by a town\ncalled Afula and started our own settlement. So, I was really working the, as a farmer, kibbutz.",
        "Q: Did you play any role in the War of Independence?",
        "A: Very little, almost none. I got there very late, remember, so I do not claim any, any real major role\nat all. No.",
        "Q: And then you decided to come back in 1950?",
        "A: In 1950, then, it was part of a homesickness for my parents and part of stupidity on my part, that I\nbelieved that things are the way Communist papers describe it in Hungary. I decided to return,\nperhaps temporarily, perhaps not. And when I arrived in Hungary, I realized that it was a fatal\nmistake.",
        "Q: Had you found any of that sense of home that you were looking for when...",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: when you went to Israel?",
        "A: No, no. I found my parents, but other than that, it was, 1t was a terrible period for any human being,\nespecially people who came from the West. It was the worst for those, because you were\nconsidered unreliable and especially coming from Israel, even more so. The reason was, that by that\ntime, Stalin was very paranoid and Zionism was one of his main targets. So, it, it, this 1s, this is\nsomething that is not much to do with the Holocaust anymore. It was just very hard for anybody to\nlive under Communist rule at that time, but especially for Jews. Well, I don\u2019t know if you know\nthat in 1953 when he was dying, he looked up and he saw some Jewish doctors around his deathbed\nand he said, \u201cThey are poisoning me, they\u2019re against me.\u201d And he said, \u201cArrest them.\u201d And\npractically hours before he died, they arrested Jewish doctors and I was just at the University in\nHungary, studying and that was my state, the time of my state examination. And Hungary had to\nfollow everything that the Soviet Union did so they were looking for anybody who had anything to\ndo with Zionism. And they found me at the university and I was let go, weeks before my state\nexam. So, it, 1t was difficult but of course that has nothing to do with the Holocaust anymore.",
        "Q: When you had been in Israel, had you, do you feel, did you feel that you had found some of what\nyou were looking for there? Was your intention to go?",
        "A: Yes and no. Yes and no. I had some very deep feelings about the country as such and then again, I\nwas still a young man, eighteen, and I was also influenced by a great deal of these revolutionary\nMarxist ideas. And there were many things that were not to my liking, that I would have loved to\nsee differently. And so when I left Israel, I did not just leave it with nostalgia. I left it because I\nthought that finally, somehow, in Hungary, I\u2019m going to find, find that utopistic state, that, that is, is\njustice and equality for everyone. And, I was just a little bit too stupid, to, to think that way, but I\ndid. So it a was a, a double reason to return. A, a totally unfounded idealism and homesickness.",
        "Q: What did you do for work when you returned home?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t work for awhile because I was unreliable, anybody who came from the West, especially\nfrom Israel. Finally, with some great connections, I was hired to sweep and clean a garage, a state-\nowned garage. And that would have been my future for a long time, had it not been for a, just a, a\nvery fortunate incident when the Party secretary of my, my company was sick and a substitute Party\nsecretary was there. And I appeared at her office because there were big posters, they wanted\nworkers youth to go to college because they figure that some of the middle class and the former\nupper class that sends its sons to college and I asked if she can recommend me and she said, \u201cWell,\nI don\u2019t know you but why don\u2019t you dictate a recommendation to my secretary?\u201d And so that was\nthe big first hurdle that I went through because the regular Party secretary would have never written\nthat letter. So, with this, I went to a university forum, but the trouble is you had to write your\nautobiography, and the minute they got to a point of Israel, which you could not in those days just\nstay silent about two years of your life, when they found out they said \u2018Thanks but no thanks,\u2019 and\nagain a strange thing happened. One of the faculty members who was on the committee, cause the\ncommittee that interviewed people consisted of faculty member, Communist Youth Organization,\nthe Communist Party, the union, various organizations. He came after me and he said, \u201cHolczer,\nHolczer,\u201d he said, \u201cwas your father from the suburb of Budapest?\u201d I said yes. He said, \u201cWas there a\nsoccer team in which he and four or five of his brothers played at the same time?\u201d I said yes. He\nsaid, \u201cI played with your dad.\u201d He said, \u201c(Come back in September,\u201d he says \u201cYou were a minor\nwhen you left Hungary. Let\u2019s see if the minister of education can exempt you,\u201d you know\u2019?\nAmnesty you, pardon you, whatever. Well, anyway, I went back in September and nobody knew\nwho I was, nobody, they had no idea, go away. So I looked for him and he went in to the Party\nsecretary and he came out and he said, and he said, \u201cI am happy to inform you that the minister of\neducation give you a dispensation. You can enter the university.\u201d And he said, \u201cThis is the last\ntime you and I ever talk to each other.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t even greet me.\u201d He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know\nme.\u201d And that was it. This is how I got in. Yeah. So it was two coincidences, very lucky ones.\nEnd of Tape 3, Side B\nTape 4, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape four, side A of an interview with Robert Holczer. So you entered university, what year\nwas this?",
        "A: 1950.",
        "Q: And you stayed, you studied what?",
        "A: I studied, my major was geography and my minor was history.",
        "Q: What were you interested in doing after you gained your degree?",
        "A: I wanted to be a geographer. I wanted to work for the Geographic Institute of Hungary or teach\ngeography. I love geography. And, in Hungary, it was a very important subject at that time. But in\nAmerica, it was no subject at all. I, when I arrived here, people were just looking at me and they\nsaid, \u201cNo, this is, unfortunately, we are not teaching geography here.\u201d It was incorporated into what\nthey called social studies in the high school.",
        "Q: So, after you...",
        "A: So, I switched and I made, I went back to school here in 1959, and switched and had a history\nmajor, \u2018kay. And I left geography just out there, I didn\u2019t touch it anymore, so I got a master\u2019s\ndegree in history and my secondary credentials, teaching credentials.",
        "Q: After you graduated from, from college while you were in Hungary, what did you do?",
        "A: Then I taught in a junior high school in the suburbs of Budapest, working-class suburb in Budapest\nuntil 1956, when the Revolution broke out and I left.",
        "Q: Did you play any sort of role in the Revolution?",
        "A: Just a very minor one. In the 19\" district of Budapest, I was asked to form the New Democratic\nTeachers\u2019 Union. And I had very ambivalent feelings about the revolution because I was afraid that\nthe same elements, the same kind of elements who came up in 1944, October 15, eventually will\ndominate it. I just did not trust the revolution so I stayed away from it. I understood the anger of\nthe people and I sympathized with the, with the desire to have a free country, but I didn\u2019t trust some\nof the groups that participated in it. And what, what really precipitated my departure is that a few\ndays before I left, I saw some groups with Arrow Cross armbands, and that did it. I realized that I\nwould never be able to live here anymore. There will be absolutely no, no peace for somebody who\nis either a human being or, or has a Jewish background or favors a peaceful living, lifestyle.",
        "Q: Had you experienced directly any anti-Semitism?",
        "A: All the time. Hungarians are with the Austrians and Poles, probably the three most anti-Semitic\ncountries in Europe. I felt much less anti-Semitism frankly in Germany in my nineteen years that I\nrecently spent there than in Hungary or in Austria.",
        "Q: So you decided to leave Hungary.",
        "A: Yes, I decided to leave Hungary and in 1956, November, I started to walk toward the border with a\ncousin of mine who just graduated from high school and was always in political trouble with the\npolice for his outspoken attitude, so, he followed, he came with me, and we then crossed the border\nafter, I think about six, seven days or so. And arrived in Austria.",
        "Q: Was it difficult to leave, did you need any exit visa or any...",
        "A: No, it was totally illegal. We were walking usually from dawn to dusk and whatever the conditions\nwere, you know, favorable, we didn\u2019t really like to walk in broad daylight but of course we couldn\u2019t\nwalk in the darkness either because we didn\u2019t know the terrain. We slept in, in haylofts, the farmers\nwere quite kind. They felt probably a little bit guilty for not participating in the revolution and\nslowly approached the border this way. And then before the border, 1t was then a little bit difficult,\nand we had to have, we had connections because a third person joined us whose relatives lived in a\nborder town and they helped us to get over.",
        "Q: And then your parents were still living...?",
        "A: Yes. My parents were still there and I told them definitely that this time I want them to follow me,\neventually, when they can come legally. Because I didn\u2019t want them to, they were by that time, the\nage when you don\u2019t just chase somebody across snowfields. So, we arrived in Graz, that was the\nfirst Austrian town, and you had all the opportunity to go then anywhere in the world. Every\ncountry opened its arms. [dog barking] Lie down, Gelsey.",
        "Q: So you arrived in, in Graz.",
        "A: And the world was then open to us and I intended to go to Sweden. I wanted to stay in Europe, and\nI just thought that Sweden would be a good place for me to, to be. But my cousin got away from\nme while we were staying in Salzburg, in, in a hotel which was one of the gathering points for the\nHungarian refugees, and left a note for me to come and follow him. And I promised his mother that\nI would take care of him so I followed him and this is how I ended up 1n the U.S.",
        "Q: You followed him all the way to the U.S.?",
        "A: Yes. Well, of course, it was very easy. All I had to do is go and tell the authorities there, the, the\nones who were in charge of the Hungarian refugees that instead of Sweden, I changed my mind and\nI want to go to the U.S. Not only that, they already, they already had some messages from the Red\nCross saying that if I show up, and the reason I was away, because previously he had asked me to\ngo to Vienna and arrange for him to stay with his relatives in Vienna who were not my relatives, but\nhe wanted to go to school there. He was totally intoxicated by the, by the light, western lifestyle\nbecause he had never been to the West. And by the time I came back to Salzburg, he was gone. So,\nbut he left messages. So the Red Cross sent me to St. Louis, Missouri to be reunited with him.",
        "Q: Did you have any idea why he would have done such a thing, of just leaving?",
        "A: No, he, he was just, he was a very unpredictable fellow, you know? You could not really, he was,\nhe was a just a restless person and I think he figured, well, why not, I want to see the U.S. and, and\nhis message to me was, \u201cYou can always go to Sweden from the U.S. You will have the money and\nopportunity, but maybe you won\u2019t have the opportunity to go and see the U.S. if you live in\nSweden.\u201d Little, little did he know about economic conditions in the eighties and nineties that, I\nthink, more Swedes can travel much easier and come here than we in Sweden.",
        "Q: Why did you prefer to go to Sweden?",
        "A: You know, I am a romantic. And I just felt that I would not want to leave Europe. Europe, to me,\nwas always my home. I loved the old towns, and I always loved clarity and that, the Scandinavian\npurity, maybe, that I have seen too many, I had seen too many Scandinavian movies, Swedish\nmovies. But they just appealed to me, the lifestyle. And I liked the fact that the social security, that\npeople have in Scandinavian countries, especially in Sweden. And just a lot of things appealed to\nme about Sweden, and I knew that I would be treated fairly, so, that was it.",
        "Q: And you had, yet you had enough money to just travel to the U.S. instead and...",
        "A: No, I had no money. We didn\u2019t need any money. [talkover] No. Nobody had any money. All you\ndid was as a refugee, you appeared at, when, when we finally were picked up and taken to Graz by\nthe Austrian police, they were very well organized there, there, you found every religious\ndenomination having a booth, who welcomed you. You could go and say that I am a Baptist, I am a\nCatholic, made no difference and then name the country where you wanted to go to. And, and it\nwas very simple, you didn\u2019t need any money. Then, next step was each had a place in Austria\nwhere they temporarily would house you, even give you a little pocket money and there you waited\nfor your transportation to go to that country. And that so, I did not really want to be attached to any\nreligious organization so I went to a very independent one called the Tolstoy Foundation. It was\nfounded by Tolstoy\u2019s daughter and, using I think the, the royalties of Tolstoy\u2019s books, and so they\nare the ones who brought me to the U.S. It was all gratis. I came over, the American military and\nthe Air Force is the one who flew all Hungarian refugees over. MATS, Military Air Transportation,\nthe, the stewardesses and almost everybody involved with us were of, of Hungarian origin, most of\nthem from Cleveland. Cleveland is the second largest Hungarian city in the world after Budapest.\nAnd, and so here, they then, then I was handed over to a Jewish organization because my cousin\ncame through a Jewish organization. So in St. Louis they were waiting for me. If you were a\nHungarian refugee those days, you had no problem because the world, the whole world felt very\nguilty about not helping the Revolution and so they did everything possible. I mean I was so\nembarrassed. I never, I was never in my life treated this way, I thought, you know, I was some\ndignitary or something. They were waiting for me at the airport and I was just... But first I had to\nspend, like most Hungarians, some time at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey which was a screening\ncamp for people. They screened out the sick, the U.S. did not take, I think, people with TB and\nsome other illnesses, they went to Scandinavia, the Swedes did, and also Communist Party members\nand such. I don\u2019t know what the criteria was, but they looked into your background a little bit. And\nso this is how I ended up in St. Louis. My cousin stayed with me for about no more than two\nmonths, not even that much. He found some relatives in Chicago who would help him to go to\nChampagne, the University of Illinois, and he just left. And we were housed, we were taken by an\nAmerican family who had very good intentions but the man was a manic depressive so you could\nnever figure out for one second to another how he would react to you. And, apparently, his wife felt\nthat maybe taking Hungarian refugees in would, would somehow remedy the problem but it didn\u2019t.\nAnd they had a mentally retarded child, so it was not a very ideal situation for a newcomer although\nshe was very nice to me and I stayed there for a few months and then eventually, I met a professor\nof Hungarian ancestry and origin at the University of, Washington University in St. Louis who had\nin Aspen, Colorado, a house, and he and his family spent every summer there because he was a\nmember of the music festival. And when they heard... I hated St. Louis, I just couldn\u2019t find\nanything redeeming about that, that city, and when they heard that I was very unhappy and all this,\nthey took me to Aspen, Colorado and they said, \u201cYou can always work here for a dollar an hour,\ntoo.\u201d And I loved it. I stayed there for almost three years. And most of my friends and connections\nand everything in my American life practically comes from that period. From my Aspen period,\npeople who helped me to get ahead in, in more ways than one. So, I am, I was very lucky again to\nend up there. Of course, those days Aspen was not what it is today, you know.",
        "Q: Were you teaching there?",
        "A: I was, no, from Aspen was a place where I collected my money and, and, you know, saved enough.\nI wanted to go up to Alaska for one summer. I went up to Alaska and worked for the Forest Service\nand then came to Fresno, California, which offered me a loan. I couldn\u2019t get a scholarship because\nthey didn\u2019t know much about me. My papers did not arrive from Hungary. So it was, but at least\nthey offered me a National Defense Loan so that helped me to start school. And I stayed in Fresno\nfor two years when I got my teaching credentials and my master\u2019s degree in history. And I, those\nwere, scholastically speaking, they were good years. I had very good instructors and, and good\nfriends and sponsors and, I did not regret it. And then I ended up in the Bay Area where I wanted to\nbe. And met my wife there. And I was teaching in Marin County.",
        "Q: Were you in touch with your parents throughout this . . .",
        "A: Yes. All the time. And I, almost every summer I went home to visit, okay?",
        "Q: Were there plans for them to come?",
        "A: Yes. They, once I got married in \u201967, they came to visit and they enjoyed it very much and then in\n1974, when, see I married my wife with three children. They were tiny, their, their father\nabandoned them, he was alcoholic. And so, my wife and I raised them. And by the time, 1974, I\nget an offer from a friend of mine in Switzerland to come and help him, he was a director of a\nschool in a children\u2019s village in Switzerland, Pestalozzy, very famous children\u2019s village, Pestalozzy\nChildren\u2019s Village. Do you speak German?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. Okay. And so, and I loved the mountains, I loved the Alps and I wanted to get back to Europe.\nAnd since we had only one child at home by that time, and he was willing to come so we went over.\nWe, we resigned our jobs and we went back and the job fell through. Because in the meantime, the\nSwiss had the law, not a law, a plebiscite about not hiring foreigners unless they can find a local\nperson for the job. And after years of advertisement for this particular position, they couldn\u2019t find\nanybody, a couple came just as we were being interviewed. So it fell through and in 1964, no I\nmean 1965, before I got married, I came over to Europe to teach for the Army, just for a year. I just\nneeded, I was a very confirmed bachelor, and I needed a year to think about whether I want to marry\nsomebody with three small children and here a confirmed bachelor. So I stayed for a year when I\ndecided yes, but during the year, I got to know a lot of people in the system, in the Department of\nDefense School System. So now that the job fell through and we basically gave up our jobs here in\nthe States, I had only one, you know, opportunity here, to go over and see if any of our, our, any of\nmy former colleagues can be found and if I can get any help to get a job for my wife and myself.\nAnd not only that I found some but they were now in very, very high positions and they said, no\nproblem. And both of us, within a year, started to teach. My wife got a job even before me,\nbecause it was more difficult for high school teachers than elementary. So she started out and we\nlived in the Frankfurt area and we stayed for nineteen years.",
        "Q: How did you meet your wife?",
        "A: We, when I left school with my credentials, I wanted to, I had a girlfriend in the Bay Area, also\nfrom Aspen. She was a schoolteacher and she wanted me to get a job there so we can be close and\nwe were there. Now all of a sudden, she said, oh, at that time it was very, by that time it was very\ndifficult to get a job for a teacher, in the early sixties, and the only job available, finally, was\nteaching special ed classes. And I said, children are children, I don\u2019t care. I had to sign a paper that\nI would go to school and get a credential. And the man who hired me was also a Holocaust survivor\nso it, 1t really helped. I told him very honestly why I want the job and I said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter why\nI want the job, I will, I will do a good job, you can, you can bet on that.\u201d And I hope I did. So, he\nhired me and this is where I met my wife. She was also teaching special ed classes, and but she\nstayed only for a few years and then when I came back in 1965, then I went into special ed for the\ncounty, for Marin County, and I stayed for almost ten years, nine years. So that\u2019s how we met. And\nthen I switched. With the Army, I switched back to teaching political science and, and history.",
        "Q: What was it like living in Germany all those years?",
        "A: Well, 1t was much more pleasant than I had envisioned, frankly. I found that there is a very large\nsegment of a new German generation that is, 1s absolutely appalled, okay, of the past. And I met a\nlot of intellectuals who had a very good vision of the past, and not only that, they spread the\nknowledge around. Naturally, there is an element in, in Germany, that is, you know, that is the\nscum of earth, but frankly, they are very much the minority. And I, I could live in Germany much\neasier, probably, than I could ever live in Austria, where it doesn\u2019t take more than a few minutes to\nhear somebody making an anti-Semitic or fascist remark, especially if they have a couple of beer.\nYou know. So, there is, there is anew Germany. Now, with East Germany joining, it is a problem.\nBut West Germany itself, was, I would say, a pretty civilized state. Okay, now the East Germans,\nthat\u2019s a different, that\u2019s a, that\u2019s a tragedy right now, that they had not been instructed by the proper\nhistory teachers, and, there are big problems in East Germany because the East Germans said, \u201c\u201cThe\nNazis, oh no, they live in West Germany. We, we are good Communists here, we don\u2019t have to\nworry about the past.\u201d And this attitude then led to what is happening nowadays in Germany with\nthe skinheads.",
        "Q: Was it difficult at first for you to accept that Germany was so, that you could really get along with\nsome of these Germans?",
        "A: Well, again, you know, I followed my father. He came to see us in Germany once and while he was\nthere, our landlady\u2019s son was killed in a motorcycle accident, a young seventeen year old, a young\nman. And we had to go to the funeral. And my wife said to my father as she look around,\n\u201cGrandpa, look, all these men of your age. Do you sometimes think of all the ghosts that are around\nhere behind these men?\u201d And my father said, \u201cYou can\u2019t live with hate.\u201d He says, \u201cThere are\nghosts everywhere. There are Indian ghosts in America, too. You have your own ghosts.\u201d And\nthat\u2019s just the way that, you can\u2019t constantly think of that. And we befriended Germans who were a\nlot more even liberal than, than we are. And so, I mean, you can find all kinds of people. That, but\nthere, Germany, I don\u2019t really worry too much about Germany as much as I worry about Russia\nand, and Poland and Austria and there you can find a lot of fascist elements and Hungary too,\nprobably.",
        "Q: We\u2019ve got a few more minutes. So, is there anything, what made you decide to return to the States?",
        "A: Oh, when, the, the military was in a, is, is a drawdown situation where they were pulling out quite a\nfew troops from Germany and we reached, my wife reached the point where she just said she\nwanted to be close to the children. We have four grandchildren. She, this house which didn\u2019t look\nlike this at that time was a small little place, this was one end of the house and that was the other end\nof the house. A partner of my brother-in-law lived here, a veterinarian, but 1t was a very small\nplace. It was available. They bought it and he called us and my wife said, \u201cLook, I stayed in\nEurope for nineteen years with you, now I would like you to stay where I would like to be and it is\nso nice to be so close to family.\u201d Our son is only four hours away, in Nashville, with a little baby.\nAnd oh, and she gets along with her sister very well and we all get along, we never had an\nargument. So, that was an ideal situation so that\u2019s how we got here.\nEnd of Tape 4, Side A\n[NOTE: SIDE TWO OF TAPE 4 IS BLANK]\nTape 5, Side A",
        "Q: I'm Arwen Donahue and I'm here with Robert Holczer in Paris, Kentucky on April 29, 1996. This\nis a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview. And first to... ask you a couple of\nquestions about the issues that came up in the last interview. I just wanted to get your aunt's name,\nfor one thing, the aunt whose apartment you stayed in on Zichy Jeno Street, what was her name?",
        "A: Her name was Aranka, that is Goldie in English, you know, Aranka, and Teply, T-E-P-L-Y. She's\nstill living in Hungary at this date and probably it would be very difficult to communicate with her\nbecause she is number one, old, and number two, I think that she has some mental problems that she\ndeveloped since the war and, but she certainly is the heroine of the whole story and my survival, so I\ntry to keep up with her but it's very, very difficult and I'm very, very sorry about that. But she has a\nson who lives in Switzerland so at this point she's still alive.",
        "Q: I didn't quite understand how just go back a little bit, when you lived in the house on Zichy Jeno\nStreet, before it became a clinic, it was a Jewish house.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And yet there were some people who lived in the house who were non-Jews.",
        "A: Non-Jews, yes.",
        "Q: And I suppose your aunt was considered one of them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But before the house was designated a clinic, if anyone in the house were to be liquida... were to be\nput into the ghetto, would they have gone apartment by apartment, or would they have taken the\nentire house?",
        "A: They would have gone apartment by apartment and, of course, if you could prove that you are a\ngentile, and that was very easy because every concierge had a list, years ago this was a law in\nHungary, that every concierge had a list and that had nothing to do with Jews or non-Jews way\nback, because when you change your residence in Europe, you have to go to the police and report it.\nIn other words, every European country, they know who is at that point where. And so this list\nexisted, all they had to do, come and talk to the concierge and all the concierges were basically\nserving the government, they were in my estimate, what I call the common man, and their attitude\nchanged regarding of what the government was doing and they were lackeys and so there was no\nbig problem, they always could tell who were the gentiles and who were not by just showing the\nlist. But there were gentiles still living in the Jewish houses who had a nice place and they just\ndidn't want to move, you know? And so when, for example, at one time we were lined up because\nthe house was discovered and this George Ara Jereczian was not there with his guards. I think they\nwent to buy, get some rations for the house, and so we were really without any defense, and we\nwere lined up, then the gentiles who are not down there be also lined up because they, apparently\nthey had known what was going on and could identify themselves.",
        "Q: But you were lined up although you lived with your aunt?",
        "A: We were, yes, we were lined up, we were lined up. And then in the last moment, a lot of things\nhappened. This aunt of mine, for example, she was also out, most people who could go on the street\nwere always out looking for something to eat and bring home and when she saw her mother, for\nexample, in the lineup, she just went up to her and started to kick her and said, \u201cThis stupid slut.\nJust, she is so stupid. Every time people say line up, she lines up, she's not Jewish.\u201d And all this,\nand in front of those Arrow Cross people, she just dragged her mother out of the line up and she had\na personality that nobody argued with her. So they assume that she is a gentile, therefore her mother\nis a gentile, too. And then we were saved because George Ara Jereczian came home and\nimmediately, his men immediately went to these punks and said, you know, \u201cClear out of here in\nshort order, papers and everything else. And if you want, you know, we'll call the Ministry of\nDefense.\u201d And so, they knew their job and threatened these people who then left.",
        "Q: You mentioned that there were about ten people living in that apartment with your aunt?",
        "A: About ten, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And some of them were her brothers and sisters?",
        "A: Yes, they were, they were, I start out with my mother, then my father's three sisters, okay? Among\nthem this Aranka, Goldie, and eventually my father's two brothers, too, joined us. They were also\nunder some kind of a disguise as policemen or this and that in whatever uniform they could get, but\nwhen things were really tough the last, I think, ten days or two weeks, they joined us, so they were\nthere, too. Then there were some husbands, my, one of my aunts had a husband and a boyfriend. It\nwas a triangle that the family just tolerated because the boyfriend was a much nicer person than the\nhusband, everybody, so there was even humor then. And some children. So we might, it's possible\nwe were even more than ten and that was very fortunate, a lot of apartments have a lot more than\njust ten people because this was, it sound like, it seemed like a safe haven and of course, all the\nrelatives were coming and you wouldn't want to throw out your relatives and so... a lot of very\nfamous doctors were there who then went on and came to this country and elsewhere and the whole\nfamily was there, so.",
        "Q: What about her other brothers and sisters, other than those who were in the apartment? Where did\nthey... were they at the time?",
        "A: Oh, my aunt's other, well, we were all together in the same apartment, it was her apartment and\nbecause ordinarily a gentile would not have had anything to do with Jews, but this was an\nextraordinary place because we, she knew that if they really stormed the house, the Arrow Cross\npeople, and if they really eliminate George Ara Jereczian and his guards, then everything 1s lost, it\ndoesn't make any difference, so... and inside the house, of course, there was absolutely no other rule\nexcept you made up your own so nobody cared. Yes?",
        "Q: But she had, there were thirteen all together, siblings, nght?",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: SO...",
        "A: No, no, no, no, thirteen, my father had thirteen brothers and sisters and some of them were already\ndead and others were elsewhere. One was in what was Slovakia at that time and participated in the\nSlovak uprising against the Germans and was hanged, was captured and hanged. My father was in\nYugoslavia, so there were, another was in a labor camp, we didn't even know where he was, so they\nwere dispersed. The women were together, the women we could get together and, but the men, only\ntwo of them. So there were altogether five, five of the thirteen, right there.",
        "Q: Also, what was the name of the psychiatrist, the famous psychiatrist who...",
        "A: Volgyessi, Volgyessi. He was the most famous Hungarian psychiatrist of his, of that time.",
        "Q: Would you spell his name, please?",
        "A: V-O, and there is a double, what the Germans call, what 1s it, well, anyway, two dots.",
        "Q: Umlaut.",
        "A: Umlaut, yes, two dots on the O, then L-G-Y-E-S-S-I, Volgyessi. And he, he was a very influential\nman and I, if I remember correctly, I heard, at that time as a child, that he was the main reason that\nthis whole setup was the way it was. That he had the connection, he knew George Ara Jereczian\nand he is the one who brought him in and suggested that let's do this.",
        "Q: Do you know what became of him after the war?",
        "A: He was in his, I would say, late 50's in 1945, but he had a son and two daughters and a relatively\nyounger wife, so I assume that they are somewhere and I also assume that they are not in Hungary,\nthat they are probably in the U.S., so if ever there is a reunion, I will see them. As a matter of fact, I\nwould like to see them because I was deeply in love with one of the, the little Volgyessi girls. I was\na young kid then, it was just a puppy love.",
        "Q: Who else of the group that was with you in the apartment on Zichy Jeno Street survived? You and\nyour aunts and your mother?",
        "A: Well, in 1945, we all survived, okay? But, oh you mean since? Who's still alive?",
        "Q: So everyone went through okay, went through the war?",
        "A: Oh, we went through the same experience and nobody... in that house, the only people who were\ntaken away were a man between eighteen and, I think it was eighteen and forty-five or eighteen and\nfifty-five, before, before October 15th when the labor, when they truly were just going to a labor\ncamp, labor organizations, that is when all the men, so there were no men until October 15th,\nbetween eighteen and fifty-five in that house, they were all taken away. So, some of the families\nwho lived there, for example, their father was not with them by that time. And, I don't know of\nanybody who survived. In other words, unfortunately, most of these people were then in a forced\nmarch toward Germany at the end of the war and somewhere in, probably western Hungary, they\nwere just either killed or died of typhus.",
        "Q: Did you keep in touch with anyone else from the clinic after the war, other than your family?",
        "A: No, no, no. You know, I was fifteen when the war ended, and I regret this very much, but outside\nmy family, my family is the only one, and there are only two members living in my family and they\nare the only ones. I tried to ask them if they can make some contact, I am now really very much\ninterested in keeping up with some other people, but they, they just, they never really bothered and\nthey are not very good letter writers so, and if I go to Hungary, maybe I will look for it, I would like\nto and I'm going to ask, perhaps, if I can get to the, to any, perhaps to the synagogue in Hungary, if\nthey have some knowledge of, is there a group that still comes together, because there were kids of\nmy age and I'd like to know what happened to them.",
        "Q: When you returned to your apartment, you described, in our last interview, about returning to your\napartment after the war and finding that there were other people who were living there.",
        "A: Mmm-hmm.",
        "Q: Were your things, were you furniture, any of your belongings still in the apartment?",
        "A: Yeah, interestingly, well, there was very little left in our apartment, what was left, a couple of boxes,\nand I don't know why they were left there, this family never touched. And that, to me, was\nimmediately, I give them some good points for that. But when I opened it, our apartment got a\ndirect hit when the siege of Budapest took place and so a lot of the... and most of these boxes\ncontained tablecloth or sheets or something like that, and so they all had big holes in them. And,\nhowever, a very beautiful embroidered tablecloth and the napkins we had for a long time until they\ndisintegrated. My wife mended them and we used them. And now, what happened to the furniture?\nA lot we give to neighbors to say, \u201cIf we come back, okay, hopefully, you will give it back to us and\nif we are not, then it 1s yours,\u201d so, and they took it and now not one of them had a piece left that they\ncan give back to us. They all said the same thing: the Russians took it. Now, this was the most\nillogical, stupid thing to say, because the Russian soldiers had two hands, what are they going to do\nwith a piano? What are they going to do with a table, what do they need it? The Russians only\nwent for one thing. Watches. They had watches up to their ears, it's as if they had never seen\nwatches before, that was the only thing. They stop you on the street and that was the only question,\n\u201cDavay chasi!\u201d That means, \u201cGive me your watch.\u201d Nothing else, I mean what can a, a foot soldier\nwho is going on and on and on across Europe, what is he going to do with anything that takes up\nspace and has weight? And so it was ridiculous, but nothing, absolutely nothing was returned from\nthe neighbors.",
        "Q: Did any of your friends from before the war return afterwards?",
        "A: Any of my friends? Well, as I mentioned before, my class, junior high class, was practically totally\ntaken and deported under those very unusual circumstances, so I had to look for the kids who were\nnot my schoolmates, but, or either lower or higher classes, and also the ones that I used to play with\nwhen I went to the city park which was not far away from us. And I would say that about half of\nthem I found, but the other half perished, you know, either because of the fires, you know there was\nbombs, or because they were killed during the Arrow Cross era, after October 15th.",
        "Q: You, 1n our last interview, had talked a little bit about meeting up with some of your friends around\nBudapest and that you would talk about the war and that was exclusively what you would talk\nabout. When you met up with them again after the war, what did you talk about then?",
        "A: Well, when I met my friends after the war, number one, we were so full of hatred, we were looking\nfor some kind of an outlet, some organization that we can join, and we found it. And part of 1t was\nthey give away shirts, we found a Communist Party. Imagine, we were fifteen year olds and we\nsaw that people were walking around in red, flaming red shirts. And we found out that the flaming\nred shirts come from parachutes and these parachutes were supply parachutes that were dropped by\nthe Soviet forces and the Hungarians got the material and the Communist Party made a kind of a\ncampaign and made it into shirts and would give them to anybody who signed up. And I think this\ndrew us a lot more than anything else, the four very close friends of mine, whom I knew from the\nillegal boy scout organization and, luckily, we all survived, we all went and signed up with the\nCommunist Party and I think this is the first, or almost the last time, I ever went to the Party\nbecause, now we went to a couple of meetings and we were just bored to death, this happened to\nAmerican communists, too. Signed up or something, I mean it was the most boring thing, so we\nnever really considered ourself truly Communist Party members because we were, I think, members\nfor a month and then we never paid any fees or we didn't do anything after that, but this was, our\nfirst step was to go down to the Communist Party headquarters and sign up with the Communist\nParty, which was understandable because we felt that the Communist Party was going to be the one\nthat revenges all these atrocities and whatever happened, and then we saw that almost everybody\nwho was in the Arrow Cross movement is also in the Communist Party because people easily\nturned, that's obvious, you know, a lot of books and essays were written about how anybody who is\nan extremist 1n one way can become the extremist in\u2014on the other side. So we found that and that\nwas disgusting, absolutely. And the Communist Party knew about it and they defended it and we\ndidn't like that, their terminology, and so we quit. So then we went back to, and kind of regrouped\nas old boy scouts. But our heart was not in 1t because now, I mean for so many years we could not\ndo anything as boy scouts except go out and hike in nature, we couldn't even wear a kerchief. And\nso now we could wear a uniform and some of us really bought a uniform, and then we just, we just\nlost completely our lust for boy scout life and that didn't work. Then, you know, this was, another\nyear went by and I, of the four, I broke away from the other four and I joined the Zionists. They\njust, there were a lot of things that appealed to me, the fact that, finally, I am going to have a\nhomeland, finally, I am going to have a passport, there was adventure. Immediately, they send me\nup in the mountains and I had to go through a certain instruction, more than one, on more than one\noccasion. And they, I advanced, I was pretty eager and good at learning things, and I became a\nyouth leader in the movement and I loved to be with young people. And so that, to me, was a, was a\nvery happy period of my life. My only conflict was with my parents. Since I was an only child, of\ncourse, they wanted me around as much as possible, and I reached that rebellious teenage period, I\nwas not too rebellious, but rebellious enough to move out of the house at sixteen and go to a Zionist\nchildren's home where first I was just a, a resident and I liked being with my peer group. There\nwere many, there were many in Hungary, a lot of the survivors, young people of my age, just chose\nthis as a lifestyle. And what we were doing there, we received a lot of instructions in agriculture, in\nthe language, Hebrew language, in Jewish history, to prepare us when we go to Israel. And my\nparents, of course, didn't like for me being away at sixteen and I felt really sorry for them and once\nthe rebellious period ended, in about a half a year or so, I moved back home and one of the reasons\nwas that life was too free on these, it was the perfect kind of thesis, anti-thesis, that we were so\nrestricted, now everything was free, I mean, and I was a little bit of a, I was a strange kid because I\ndidn't grow up very quickly to become a man, and I did not like the fact that here were girls of my\nage who wanted to sleep with me and all this and that, I just, I always pictured myself more of a, an\nindividual, a man who has things to do and I don't, I'm not going to spend a lot of time with, with\nsex and all this and my mind was not only on just women, let's put it this way, even though I already\nhad sexual experiences and the whole, and because of this, they considered me a little bit of an\neccentric so that happy, I moved back home to satisfy my parents, but I didn't stay there long\nenough because I got an offer at the age of seventeen to go and be a resident advisor in a home for\nJewish orphans. That was on, it was called Tarogato Street in the Buda section of Budapest where I\nfound a man who became a very good friend of mine, the man who led the institution, a marvelous\nman, also a Zionist, by the name of Spitzer* and his family, and they were very good to me and I felt\nvery much at home, plus I got a nice salary and all my needs were taken care of there. Even I had a\n* First name: Imre\ngirlfriend who was also a resident counselor there, so happy, really, they were very happy days.\nAnd in the meantime, I also participated very actively in, I changed organizations and left, I was in\na, I would say, kind of a petit bourgeois Zionist group and I went over to the Marxists because that\nsuited my philosophy a lot more and I stayed with them and eventually they were the ones that\nhelped me to then immigrate to Israel, that was after, but we'll get to this. Now I want to talk just a\nlittle bit about school because all these times I went to school, too. Right after the, 1945, as soon as\nthe school started, my mother was determined that I should go to the School of Commerce, the high\nschools were specialized, and there was one that was called, the Special High School for\nCommerce. Can you stop it for a second because I want to close the window. So as I said, my\nmother was determined that I should go there, of course, I had no desire but I was still a good boy\nand I started at that school and the fact that it was the middle of the year, basically, and I missed the\nfirst half of a year wasn't a big problem because anybody who was a, a Holocaust survivor at that\ntime can just about do anything. So this was no big problem, the big problem came when I noticed\nhow many of my teachers are outright anti-American, anti-Russian, anti-Semitic, they haven't\nchanged their attitude and there were some other Jewish kids in that school and I got together with\nthem and I asked them if, if we should tolerate this, if they think this 1s correct and everybody was\nkind of lying low, the usual way, and I said, \u201cNo, I am not going to do that.\u201d There was specifically\none teacher who had, I forgot, had a German name, a very small man who not only was anti-Semitic\nand anti-Russian and anti-everything and very pro-German, but agitating. He was not just making\nstatements, he was really agitating and in a very emotional way and I was, I just, I reached a point\nwhere I just couldn't take it anymore, not after what happened, just, you know, in the last few years\nand my boy scout commander, and at that time I was still kind of hanging on with the boy scout\nmovement, my boy scout commander was now a member of the new Hungarian Secret Police and\nhe was an officer and he escaped from the labor camp and went over to the Russians and all this and\ncame back with the Russian troops already and was one of the organizers. And I went to see him\nand I said, \u201cThis man should be removed from the school.\u201d And they did take him in and somehow\nthey went down the list at school and found out that I was the one who reported him because it was\nobvious since I was constantly arguing with him, arguing with him in class and so... .\nEnd of Tape 5, Side A\nTape 5, Side B",
        "Q: Okay, this is tape one, side B of an interview with Robert Holczer.",
        "A: I just had to quit. And then I continued my studies, I did not want to have the same experience\nagain and I went to the Jewish, the Jewish rabbi school, really, what it was, it was a school to\neducate future teachers, but it was a high school still. Just like my previous high school was\nspecialized for commercial jobs, this one was, basically, a teaching gymnasium, a teaching high\nschool, which meant by the laws of Hungary at that time that once you finished\u2014and it was instead\nof four, five classes, so you were nineteen when you finished the school\u2014you were then an\nelementary school teacher at the age of nineteen without any college education. I was there at this\nschool and, of course, as far as any kind of a bad experience, I didn't have any. Now I was among\nmy own people, there were some very, very good friends, I liked the school, it was nothing special,\nit was not challenging me, the only aspect most of us didn't like is the religious aspect, which we\ndidn't take very seriously. So actually, I was still in that school in my eighteenth year when\neventually, and we will go back to this, I emigrated, emigrated to Israel, and so I never really\nfinished my high school. But out of deference to what happened and all this, I got a diploma. So I\nhad a high school diploma which, of course, my parents got later because I needed one and... so\nthese are the two schools. Once I reached this level of the, this, the Jewish teaching high school for,\nhigh school for future teachers, whatever, it's very difficult to translate into English, perhaps\nLyceum is a good name for it, once I reached that, then as far as my experiences after the Holocaust,\nthere was no problem, you know, it's obvious. Now, going back, of course in the meantime, in the\nZionist movement, a lot of changes took place because we had to go practically underground. As\nthe communist regime established itself 1n Hungary and in 1948 the famous turn, Year of the Turn\ncame about, which happened in every Eastern European country, and the Year of the Turn is an\nexpression when the communists took control, complete power, because until 1948, we had\ndemocracy in Eastern Europe, those countries that knew what democracy was. And Hungary had\nsome very able politicians and was really on its road to become a democracy, so was\nCzechoslovakia, and probably Poland, too, of course, Romania was very different. But, in 1948,\neverything has changed, we became, again, just like with the illegal boy scout group before 1945, I\nfound myself belonging to an illegal organization, Zionism was outlawed because all of a sudden\nStalin and company found Zionism, of course, a tool of the imperialists as they called it. So we\nwere doing, basically, the same things that we were doing before, but now very cautiously, illegally,\nand meetings were held usually either in some far away synagogues, basements or in some Jewish\norphanages where it was not very obvious if, let's say, twenty, thirty people came in and out because\nthere were hundreds of people living there anyway. The, many times we paraded as young\ncommunists, if we wanted to have a larger meeting somewhere, singing communist songs when\nsomebody came by, but otherwise doing our own business. By 1949, early 1949, the situation\nalmost was intolerable and, basically, they wanted to have the whole Zionist movement leave, not\nthe communists, but the Zionist movement wanted to get as many people out as possible, fearing\nthat if Czechoslovakia is going to turn also completely communist, that there will be no way from\nHungary to go anywhere. By that time we could only go illegally across the border. And I think it\nwas in February, 1949, that I got an order from my Zionist leadership to go to a little northern town,\nVacz, V-A-C-Z, my mother comes from that town and they knew it. My job was to go to the mayor\nof the town and ask him if he would like to have a high school orchestra give a, an evening concert\non some given date. I went there, I mentioned to the mayor that I had been to Vacz many, many\ntimes because my grandparents, cousins, aunts, I had a lot of relatives and my mother was born\nhere, and of course, he was overwhelmed that a high school orchestra 1s coming to play. I then went\nto a printer, this was one of my instructions, and had all kinds of posters printed advertising the date\nand the concert. Went back, reported it and the next command was that on a certain day, I would\nhave to go with an instrument or with an instrument case to a corner of Budapest and there would be\na bus there, a state bus, by that time every bus company was nationalized, and I have to board the\nbus with a lot of other people and I have to pretend that I am a member of a high school band,\nwhatever instrument I am playing, and do, not to talk about anything, Zionism or Israel, anything\nlike that. And just wait for further instructions there. And of course, I was notified that this is it,\nthat we would be going to Israel and I bid farewell to my family and got an instrument case,\nboarded the bus on a certain date and time and I saw all my fellow Zionist members, the ones who\nwere in my group, and we started toward the Czechoslovakian border.",
        "Q: Can I ask a few questions before we go on?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I wanted to, I'm interested in hearing how you felt about Marxism, why it was that Marxism\nappealed to you as far as the type of Zionist organization that you were involved in and hearing a\nlittle bit more about how you felt about the politics of the time and the communist takeover.",
        "A: I had very ambivalent feelings like a lot of those Jews who did not come from the upper middle\nclass or upper class. I came from definitely no better than the middle of the middle class or rather,\nperhaps, the lower middle class. My father came from a very low class proletarian family which\nwas very unusual among the Jews of Hungary. My mother came from a little petit bourgeois family\nfrom the northern Hungarian town. They thought they were middle class, but 1t depends on how\nyou classify this, as far as I'm concerned they were kind of a pseudo-petit bourgeois people, the kind\nwho, it's very difficult to define them, but there was not much work and a lot of complaining. Now,\nbecause I never had a very, let's say satisfactory and wealthy life, naturally I had some sympathies\nwith, with the Marxist movement, it's obvious. Second, I had a very definite sympathy with them\nbecause they were the most adamant about taking the war criminals and punish them. They were\nthe most anti-fascist and all these things appealed to me. I was, you can consider even though I was\nnot a member, really after my one month experience, I was not a member, at least I didn't consider\nmyself a member of the Communist Party, but I certainly was sympathizing with a lot of their goals,\neven though I was in a completely different game by that time, knowing I would go to Israel. But,\nthis is probably why I changed my affiliation and went from a bourgeoisie Zionist organization to a\nMarxist Zionist organization where I felt very much at home. And there were, of course, ugly\nthings happening, the communist takeover in Eastern Europe was not a very pleasant occasion. And\none only had to think a little bit clearly and rise above all this emotion to see that the communists\nused very nasty methods to eliminate anyone who disagreed with them. And the more power they\ngrabbed, the more vicious they became. And of course, eventually I, the Zionists suffered more\nwhat anybody who was considered a Zionist or anybody, like my father, who could have been\nexecuted if they discovered that he was with Tito, so if you were an enemy for one reason or\nanother, there was no law. The communists created their own laws, the secret police had free hand\nand, of course, I began to become very disappointed in that. My father, he was always a Social\nDemocrat, and he never, never approved what the Communist Party was doing in Hungary. And he\nwas very courageous because when the Communist Party gobbled up the Social Democratic Party,\nhe sent in a postcard and said, \u201cExcuse me, but I don't want to join you.\u201d Which was very\ncourageous because from there on, you could have been watched. The fact that he comes from a\nworking class and was a very little fish, I think saved his life. But if he had been a name, probably\nhe would have been killed then. And so, politics, yes, I kept my eye on politics all the time and this\nhelped me in 1949 to just go, because I figured there will never be peace here, there will never be\npeace here. And, do you have any other questions?",
        "Q: Mmm-hmm.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: As far as, you had mentioned that there were some serious anti-Semitic incidents at your school and\nI am wondering if you had any expectations after the war was over that some of that would be\nameliorated and that anti-Semitism was not going to be as much of a problem any more?",
        "A: Yes, I was very naive, really, at the age of fifteen, for some reason, I thought that a better world is\ncoming. And I was deeply disappointed when I heard that there were even pogroms in the\ncountryside where a few Jews dared to come back to a village or a town in Hungary, in Poland, in\nSlovakia, I think the Czechs were the only ones who acted in a very civilized way, but then they\nwere always civilized and the most civilized in Eastern Europe. That disappointed me, people were\nkilled, survived Auschwitz, came home and killed in a pogrom in Hungary and in some other\nEastern European countries, two years after the war. And that made me very bitter and my idealism\nand my naivete really evaporated.",
        "Q: Did you experience anything directly, any anti-Semitic incidents?",
        "A: I have not been directly in an anti-Semitic incidence because I avoided, I avoided them, I avoided\nany kind of such thing. I associated mainly with my own kind because I saw that there is no hope.\nNow, this interestingly must have changed to a certain extent because almost every one of my\ncousins is married to a gentile in Hungary, I think with the exception of maybe two, but every one\nof them, and the marriages are very solid. So I, and it's not, they are still not what you would call a\ntruly middle class family, that most of them still stayed in, you know, auto mechanics and this and\nthat, that part. Now, the ones who are up there, went to college and became dentists and those, they\nare all married to other Jews. It's a very interesting phenomenon. But I have not experienced\nanything except when, right after the war at school. Okay? I heard people constantly yelling anti-\nSemitic slogans, especially at soccer games, but I knew that I can't expect anything else any more.",
        "Q: And you, when you joined the Zionist organization, did you have, did you really have dreams of\nbeing in Israel, or that this, that this was something that you felt very strongly about?",
        "A: Yes, I had dreams and that was probably a, a, just a marvelous high of my youth. The whole, the\nZionists did a, a fantastic job in catching the spirit of young people and really giving us what we\nwanted to have. We had a relatively free life, we had, we had a picture of a heroic future for us,\nwhether we are going to be still serving in the army in Israel or just working in a kibbutz as farmers,\nalmost everything about it had a kind of a super human touch that I'm going to be better than all\nthese people around here who are running around like ants on the cities of Budapest, I'm going to\nlead a very healthy life, and finally I'm going to have a country, I have a home, I will have a\nfatherland and it was, 1t was a marvelous feeling. And also, the whole, the whole setup, the whole\norganization, you know, until then, until 1946 or so, most of the picture that we saw of Jewish\npeople is, is like sheep going into Auschwitz. And all of a sudden these people come from Israel,\nthey are beautiful looking people. And not only that, they had courage, the way they carried\nthemselves and they were teaching us a lot of things, you know, Israel sent a lot of, they called them\nSchliahs, people that, those who are sent, I think, literally. And they were in charge of all these\ncamps where we had to go to where we were taught self-defense and, you know, we lived on a tree\nin one camp, I think what, for forty-eight hours, we were given a piece of rope and a knife and we\nhad to stay up, and sleep up there and make our bed and all this. I mean, which young person\ndoesn't like this? The whole image of the Jew has changed in our mind and we said, \u201cGod, it's\nbeautiful.\u201d And when we were in danger, they were the ones who led us out of danger. I remember\nonce I was up in the BorzsOny mountains in Hungary in a self-defense camp for a week and\nsomebody betrayed us to the police and the police surrounded us and there was a creek, not deeper,\nI don't think it was deeper than maybe twenty inches, and guess who is the one who escaped from\nthe creek in order to do something, not to save his own skin, but he was immediately telephoning\nand all this and that and eventually we were released. The Israeli whatever, diplomat, I can't call\nthem, the diplomat is not the right word because you picture somebody, you know, with a tie and\nsuit and all this, but they were just, I, messengers or whatever, leaders. And he escaped, he escaped\nin that creek, crawling in twenty inch of water, you know, getting on something that blend in with\nthe, with the rocks, I mean they were unbelievable, unbelievable people. And women, you know,\nit's, it's, okay, after them the women came and, I mean this is a completely different Jew. I mean,\nand when I took my wife to Israel, she understood that, that there was just something about those\nkids. And so this, this, of course, was, they were idols and it was very easy to follow them. And\nthey were, they were not really demagogues, I remember quite a few of them who got quite\nintroverted, they were not giving you big speeches or something, but by personal example, they\nwere leaders because we followed them. So the, the bus going back to my escape from Hungary,\nthe bus eventually reached Vacz and, needless to say, it didn't stop there. Beyond Vacz, it became\nquite dark and our leader suggested to the bus driver that we stop somewhere and eat and there was\na roadside pub where they also served food. We went in and we were given money and we could\norder something, and in that pub, there was a very beautiful peasant woman, with I don't know how\nmany skirts on her, this was the reason you recognize a peasant woman, in those days they still wore\na lot of skirts, you know, that's an Eastern European costume that a dozen skirts is no big deal. And\nshe started to flirt with the bus driver. And soon the bus driver came, went over to her table, and\nthey had a good time and, of course, we were getting more and more anxious that this is going to\ncreate a big problem here, right? We knew that we were on a timetable. All of a sudden, the bus\ndriver said to our leader, \u201cHow long do you think we will be here?\u201d And our leader said, \u201cWell, all\nthese kids eat, oh, a half an hour, forty-five minutes.\u201d He said, \u201cGood, I'll be back.\u201d and left with\nthe woman. We ate, and our leader said, \u201cOkay, line up outside.\u201d And instead of going back to the\nbus, he led us down on a field into a big barn, I would say about one mile down in a muddy field, it\nwas February and snow and mud everywhere. We all got into the barn, about thirty of us, they\nclosed the doors, barn doors, and he said, \u201cOkay, don't worry. Everything will be okay.\u201d After\nmidnight, 1:00 or so, the barn door opened and we were, they said we have to get on line and\nmarched down, there was the river Ipoly, I-P-O-L-Y, and that was the border between Hungary and\nCzechoslovakia. The Austrian border was already sealed, but the Czechs still let Zionist groups\ncome over, it was kind of an arrangement, the Joint did it for a lot of money, however, they didn't\nknow which border, Czech border guard was a communist or not, so we have to be very careful.\nAnd once we went beyond the border guards, everything was organized there, I will go back to this.\nSo as we were marching down, I saw a woman in a leather jacket with a revolver hanging on her hip\nin blue jeans. I looked at this woman's face, said, \u201cHey, I have seen her before.\u201d And I looked and\nsaid, \u201cThis is the woman in the pub.\u201d This is to show you how organized they were. I mean, the\nGermans couldn't have done better, really, with their devilish organization. I mean, everything, if\nyou understood the whole, they called it aliyah, the going of, to Israel. If you understood that, how\nthey did it, you can understand how they could survive. All right? Surrounded by, of course, a sea\nof enemies. Once we got down to the river, we had to take our shoes off, and we kept everything on\nour head, the river was not high enough, we couldn't swim, so we had to walk, but I was very small,\nand it got to my throat at one time. Now this is February, imagine. We got over to the other side\nand it was supposed to be that the border guards change, everything was according to the clock, and\nsomething happened and the border guards did not change the way they were supposed to, they\nwere still talking to each other. There was snow on the ground and the dogs, their dogs were\nbarking, so we had to lie down on the snow for about a half an hour, wet. And many of us got sick,\nright there. I myself, I lost, I got frostbitten and even today I suffer for that. Now, then the border\nguards finally were gone and we went up, there was a house where they used to press grapes, it was\na grape growing region, but had no roof and the wind was blowing and I remember, I don't think I\nhave ever been colder in my life since then. And so we huddled together because now we missed\nthe truck that was supposed to pick us up right down on a highway beyond that hill, so the Israelis,\nthe two Israelis, a man and a woman who were leading us, they went down and eventually, in about\nfour or five hours, they located the truck, the truck came back, the truck was looking for us and then\nleft and then, anyway the truck came back, we got up on the truck, the canvas, the top was taken\ndown, and from there on, all we heard was the engine of the truck was occasionally, when they were\nhalted and the word dollar, the word dollar came back all the time, I remember that.\nEnd of Tape 5, Side B\nTape 6, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Robert Holczer. So you'll say something about the\ngroup of people that you were with.",
        "A: I, my best friend in that group was a young man by the name of Zev Rotics. He lives in Israel at this\ntime still, in Haifa, at Rehov Shunamit 14, and we correspond monthly, we have been ever since,\never since that time, and eventually when I left Israel, we corresponded, we kept up and I consider\nhim my best friend. He's about the only person I keep up with. Oh no, there was one, another, a\nman by the name of Nissan Meschel, and I have no, he is in touch with my friend, Zev Rotics, but I\nlost touch with him, so I have no idea what happened, I just know that he's living there. But the\nothers, the, I remember one young lady who was with us and she, unfortunately, had eventually\npneumonia when we got to Vienna, which I will go back to when I continue the story of the\njourney, and died in Vienna of pneumonia, and she's buried there somewhere in the cemetery and I\nalways planned to go and visit her, but I always run out of time and I don't know where she is\nburied, probably there is no more than one Jewish cemetery, so when I go back to Israel I'm going\nto find out because my wife... Zev Rotics, sometimes he goes to the meetings of our old friends and\nso he would know. Now, after the truck finally stopped in Bratislava. In Bratislava they took us to\nthe gendarmerie where, as a formality, we were arrested, and interned in the synagogue, they took\nus to the synagogue that had already warm rooms, straw on the floor, blankets, good food,\neverything, and we were told that next morning we are going on. And it was very strange because\nnext morning, again, the gendarmerie surrounded the synagogue, it was a big show, of course, all\njust 1n case some Soviet authority is watching. And they took us to the railroad station where we\nwere taken in boxcars, how interesting, locked up, quite a few people in boxcars, and the train\nstarted and I think within an hour or so, they opened up and we were in the American sector of\nVienna. Because Bratislava is very close to Vienna. We stayed in Vienna for, I think, two, one or\ntwo weeks, and in an American hospital, that's where the Joint somehow got an American hospital\nfor the Zionist members and we were all there and we were given good food and warm rooms and it\nwas very pleasant, the only thing we were always warned about, not to ever wander into the Soviet\nsection. We were free to wander around, the city was still divided into four sections, American,\nBritish, French and Soviet. And sometimes we had to go very close to the Soviet section in going\nto, I remember going to a swimming pool, it was on the edge, and so everybody was nervous. But,\nbasically, it was a good time. Vienna was full of refugees, full of life. After one week or so, then\nwe were taken across, again by trucks, across the Alps into, no I have to correct myself, to, not to\nAustria, to a, a, a UNRRA camp, UNRRA was the United Nations Refugee Association or\nsomething, so the joint gave us temporarily over to UNRRA and we were housed 1n a beautiful area\nof the Alps in a town called Zaalfelden. It is a, on a lake, just the other side from Germany, and\nthere were some very picturesque villages nearby, and I remember even though here the food was\nvery meager and we still were hiking almost every day and going up in the mountains, and I\nremember that just above our camp, our refugee camp, there was a place, a mountain hut where\nHitler and Mussolini met and we had to see it and sometimes a cabbage soup a day just didn't give\nus enough energy, but we were still pushing for it, we wanted to see it. We stayed here, again, one\nor two weeks and then on, again, now over the border to Italy. In Italy, they took us again to the\ntrain station, somewhere in northern Italy, and the train then was closed up and sealed, but regular\ntrain, we just could not leave the train, Italian detectives were on the train to make sure that nobody\nescapes because it was ridiculous because who wants to escape to Italy, at least at that time? And\nwe were taken down to Bari. Now, the only thing that stands out in my mind was that a lot of times\nwhen the train stopped, we, of course, rolled the windows down and the good looking girls among\nus ended up with dozens of pictures from Italian men, written on it, I love you, I'm going to marry\nyou and all this, by the time we got to Bari, I think the girls were exchanging pictures and who\nwanted this one and this one? I mean it was a funny thing to see that those men were really just\ninstantly falling in love with these girls. In Bari, a ship was waiting for us, if you could call it a\nship. It was called the Galil, Galilea or Galilee, I forgot exactly, and so we boarded the ship and in\ntwo days or three days, it must have been three I think, we were going to reach Haifa. Everybody\ngot sea sick, the boat was an old, old fishing boat that the Israeli government brought from, bought\nfrom Greece and it was a primitive thing, very primitive. And I know I have a very strong will and I\ndon't want to, you know, go back to that, to the story, but I never throw up, somehow I just psych\nmyself up ever since I was a little kid as a result of an incident that I would not throw up. And I\nremember I was the only one on the ship who could eat. Everybody else was just constantly\nthrowing up and so we arrived, by the time we arrived in Haifa, everybody was just yellow and\ngreen and wouldn\u2019t want to look at food. Now, the funny thing about this ship is that a few years\nago I was travelling in France with my wife and we stopped in the Loire valley in a small little\ntown, Blois, and as we were walking in the town there was a kind of a summer suit that I wanted to\nbuy, it was very inexpensive and I needed a summer suit for wearing on some occasion that I have\nto wear a suit and I went into the shop and I was trying on the suit when the owner of the shop all of\na sudden yelled and said, \u201cShalom haver.\u201d And it appears he was talking to my wife and somehow\nit came that he was a Moroccan Jew and he was telling, I think, my wife that he was a Moroccan\nJew and all this, because he had a definite Arabic name. And so my wife, I think, told him that I\nwas Jewish, too you know, and this, so he invited us after the deal\u2014which was a good one\u2014he\ninvited us to a bar down on the street, an outdoor caf\u00e9, to drink something with him. And during the\nconversation he asked me a little bit about my life and he said to, and I asked him and he said, \u201cOh,\nI was in Israel, I was a sailor.\u201d I said, \u201cWhere did you sail?\u201d He said, In the Mediterranean, of\ncourse,\u201d and I said, \u201c\u201cWhat ship?\u201d He said, \u201cThe Galilea.\u201d \u201cWhat time?\u201d He said, \u201cFrom 1948 to\n1950 something.\u201d Well, he was on that ship, you know, and I mean it was a small ship and he was\none of the sailors. Well, when we arrived in Haifa, of course, that was a very emotional scene and\nthen eventually, the war, basically, was finished and there was no temporary animosity so then we,\nour movement went to a kibbutz there where we then blended in and one year after we were taught\na trade in the kibbutz and we got our own land then. I don't know what else you want to know\nabout the Israeli thing.",
        "Q: Everyone from your group then who was travelling together went to the same kibbutz?",
        "A: Yes, everyone went to the same kibbutz except the ones who did not want to go to the kibbutz, had\nrelatives who were waiting for them and this was a little bit of a disappointment to us because\ntheoretically, everybody was supposed to stay together, but this was not the case. There were, not\neverybody wants to live in a kibbutz because it is a very difficult living for those who dream of\nmoney and wealth and their own car and all this because it's a, at that time it was a very perfect\ncommunity, but it was a community, you didn't have a great deal that you owned at all, you know,\nyou were lucky if you had a radio that you can call your own. So we lost, I would say, about one-\nthird of our group who had planned, but not shared their plan with us, to go immediately and stay on\nthe outside.",
        "Q: How was it decided that your group would go to a kibbutz, was it decided communally among the\ngroup or did someone else decide it for you?",
        "A: All Zionist youth organizations basically, with very little exception, very few exceptions, were\ngeared toward the kibbutz. This was an understanding back in Eastern Europe where we were\nrecruited that Israel, and they always brought the example of the pyramid, that the, we Jews, we\nalways like a pyramid on the top, we had all the, the farmers, and down at the bottom where the\npyramid is the largest, we had all the intellectuals, and Israel needed a pyramid upside down, where\nthe largest group 1s going to be the farmers and the agricultural group, and the smallest one is going\nto be the intellectuals, the tip of the pyramid. So almost every Zionist organization, that was the\nvery strong influence and educational goal to teach you to go and be a farmer in a collective, you\nknow? So that was the reason why most of us did go to a kibbutz. And who decided it? It was\ndecided above, that had nothing to do with us, where we would go, we were assigned to an old\nkibbutz, very old, experienced, large kibbutz, called Givat Chajim, in Israel which is in, about\nmidway between Haifa and Tel Aviv and this is where we learned our trade for one year, we stayed\nthere for one year.",
        "Q: Did you speak any Hebrew at all?",
        "A: We did not speak any Hebrew when we arrived there, most of us didn't speak any Hebrew, except\nthe ones who came from very religious families. They knew quite a bit and for them it was much\neasier to learn, we spoke no Yiddish because Hungarians do not speak, Hungarian Jews, very few\nHungarian Jews speak Yiddish, and so at first we felt a little bit kind of ostracized by the\ncommunity, especially the young Israeli kids. There were so many Hungarians coming in at that\ntime that the Hungarians even had a nickname in Israel, they were called Igen-Migen, Igen means\nyes in Hungarian and so kids would go after us on the street and call us Igen-Migen, Igen-Migen,\nbecause they heard us speak. And so we were in a big hurry to learn Hebrew. And then when we\nlearned Hebrew, we had another thing, the Hungarian language is such that your accent stays with\nyou no matter what language you learn, and so we had a very thick accent, even when we were\nspeaking Hebrew, so we had our difficulties with the language, but most of us learned it eventually.\nI was there in Israel for two years and by the time I came home, I was really speaking fluently.",
        "Q: What trade did you learn on this kibbutz?",
        "A: Okay, I was a tractor driver in the kibbutz and worked out plowing everything connected with the\ntractor, it was called a Falha, that particular branch, and from sacking, you know, flours and up to\nplowing and then seeding and cultivating, we had, we did everything. Then we got our own land,\nown piece of land, which was a reclaimed area on the train line between Tel Aviv and Haifa, it was\nthe, the, the Israel and Jordan swapped land and so Jordan give back a piece of land so the train\nservice can go from Tel Aviv to Haifa because part of the train line was in Jordan. This was the\nland that we received, and it was a very dangerous place, so when we, the first day we went out\nthere, I remember, was really hair raising because the tractor drivers had to go down and plow and\nthe, the weed in Israel is much higher than a human being and also we didn't know where the mines,\nif there were any mines. And even though the army supported us and they did give us, you know,\ngenerous support there, we the tractor drivers had to go down and practically open up the area. And\nSO We were very respected in the kibbutz for that reason. Above us was an Arab town, Tul Karem,\nwhich today is under Israeli occupation and still a very hot spot for riots. And I remember that Arab\ntown practically you could see the people on the street, and here we were on the other side living,\nyou know, two enemies and of course, I had a lot of adventures because of living on the border, but\nthen again, that has not much to do with the Holocaust and I am sure that the Holocaust Museum\nhas a lot of testtmonies from Israelis so they don't need. I don't know, but that's up to you, but I\nhave a lot of stories that came to us as a result of living so close at that time, back in 1948, 1949, on\nthe border, you know.",
        "Q: I'd be interested in hearing how, what kinds of relations or encounters you had with Arabs in that\narea.",
        "A: Well, when we first showed up, when we first showed up, the first day, there were Arab shepherds\ndown on the other side of the barbed wire, the border was just marked with a bunch of barbed wire.\nAnd when they saw us, they emitted a sound like woo-woo-woo, and they were running away, they\nwere just scared to death. These were shepherds, very poor people, and we didn't know exactly who\nthey were, but we learned eventually, that they were, they were working for the local, you know,\nsheik or whomever owns the land for very little. And eventually, we also saw that here on this side\nof the border we are plowing with up-to-date 20\"-century machinery and we saw not far from us, a\nman on a horseback whipping people just because they did something apparently that did not please\nthem. The owner of the land had practically complete jurisdiction over these poor fellows, and that\nwas just a few hundred yards from where we were working. As they got used to us, they came\ncloser and closer and when they saw that we don't mean any harm, they came down to the barbed\nwire many times, watching to make sure that nobody sees them and tried to make friends with us\nand we did make friends with them for, the main reason is that chocolate was very expensive in\nIsrael those days, cocoa, and we already had quite a few children in our group, babies. Cigarettes\nwere very expensive for some reason in Jordan and they were very cheap in Israel, American\ncigarettes. So they asked, oh, these people offered us a deal, but they did not want to do it during\nthe day because they were afraid that the... Jordan had the best military force, the Arab Legion,\ntrained by the British and they were afraid that they were patrolling there and all this and it was a\nserious crime to deal with, with Israelis. So at night in the darkness, and I remember it was my turn,\ntoo, 1t was always a few people and always the tractor drivers because we had the contact with the\nborder people, we went down because they would recognize us and it was a very risky thing, they\ncould have just shot me dead right there, it could have been a trap. We went down and we were\ndoing all the business, they jumped over or we went over, but mainly they came over because they\nwere much better fence jumpers than we were. So this was one contact that we had. The other one\nwas not so pleasant, these wadis, dry river beds, that run across, they don't recognize borders, they\nrun, you know, back and forth, Israel, Jordan, and in, when they are dry which is most of the time,\nthis is where the Arab thieves come over, they use these river beds because you can't see them, they\nare, you know, they are like little canyons. And they would come over in these river beds and go\ninto other areas and steal, mainly animals. And they were unbelievably good thieves. They would\nsteal, they can, they would steal a cattle, they would steal a donkey, they would steal a horse\nsurrounded by walls. Nobody could ever figure out how they did it. So the army hired us to be kind\nof a paramilitary force and go out and lie, so we had to lie down in the wadis and a few of us, we\ndidn't have very good guns, we had old Czech guns, and wait for these thieves to come. And I only\nhad one occasion when three of us were in a patrol and there were about fifteen or twenty of these\ncoming by and we didn't feel like getting murdered by them because what chances do we have?\nAnd so we let them go by and then reported to the border police that they went by, but we didn't\nwant to engage in any fire fight there. Now, my good experience was with the Jordanian Legion,\nwhich then eventually had also a sad ending. All of a sudden one day we were, I was plowing I\nremember, and I had to have always a guard on my tractor with a submachine gun who was\nconstantly casing and watching because I was so close to the border and this was a friend of mine\none day who was a guard in an Arab POW camp, an Israeli POW camp, guarding Arabs during the\nWar of Independence, so he learned some Arabic from them. And you will see why this 1s\nimportant, and all of a sudden we saw some, an Arab Legion patrol right by the barbed wire and\nthey were motioning to us to come down and we said no, you know. And so they went away. Next\nday they came and again they were motioning, they said, \u201cPeace, peace.\u201d So finally they went back\nabout fifty yards and they put their guns into a pile and then came back, showing that they had no\nweapons and they told us, \u201cSit down on that side of the border. What can we do?\u201d They were\nabout twelve, if they really wanted to kill us, we said, \u201cOkay, let's go down. What do they want?\u201d\nThey just wanted to talk to us and from there on, every day they would come down at a certain time\nand eventually they, the Arabs have watermelon all over, so it was like a party, they would yell at\none of these poor fellows who was working there and I, this is all I learned in Arabic, what it is,\n\u201cHey, bring me a watermelon.\u201d Yalla Jibbu Battiyah. And they brought a watermelon and they\nwould slice it and we were eating, almost every day we had a little lunch there together, we brought\nsome stuff. And this went on for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks. And eventually we really\nfooled our countries because sometimes they came over and ate and laughed that they ate in Israel\nand sometimes we jumped over and we said, \u201cOh, we ate in Jordan.\u201d\u201d And one day it was our turn,\nwe stopped the tractor, they haven't come down yet so we were waiting for them, but we were\nalready sitting on the other side, we had a little blanket, we put it down, all the food from our\nkitchen and all of a sudden a patrol is there, but it 1s a totally different patrol. What happened,\napparently somebody saw them and reported them, I don't know what ever happened, I never saw\nthem again and these guys were, they drew their guns and they are going to shoot us. And you\nknow that border was no joke, every night somebody was killed there, either an Israeli or an Arab.\nVery innocent people, you know, sometimes a, one night I felt so badly, a young couple, lovers,\nwere walking around and apparently they were in the wrong place and an Israeli guard, and most of\nthe Israeli border guards were from Arab countries, Arab Jews, well, not Arab, that sounds kind of\nstrange, but Jews from Arab countries, and they were vicious. I mean, you could not get better\nborder guards and they were, they hated the Arabs more than we hated the Nazis. And so they\nwere, they were, they saw one at night, they were shooting sometimes for no reason. So that was a\nvery poisonous atmosphere there, and I mean it took a long time and the fact that my friend spoke\nsome Arabic and all this and mitigated the situation, but then the man said, \u201cHow come you speak\nsome Arabic? Where did you learn it?\u201d And then he had to kind of, so finally the sergeant who was\nleading all them, always a master sergeant leading the patrol, he said, \u201cYou have one luck that I\nhave a son of your age.\u201d He said, \u201cIf I ever see you even down touching the barbed wire,\u201d he said,\n\u201cT am going to just make dust out of you.\u201d And of course, we never went back again. That was,\nthese are some experiences living on the border.",
        "Q: Do you remember what you would talk about with these, with the guards before they were taken\naway?",
        "A: Well, it was a very simple conversation because we had a language problem, it was mainly sign\nlanguage quite a bit, and we were talking about, basically, these people were talking about their\nchildren, they showed pictures of their families and the word peace, Salaam or Shalom in Hebrew,\nwas constantly mentioned. And I have a feeling that all of us involved, probably, if they are,\nhopefully they are alive, will always remember this and that kind of softened us up, so we know that\nhuman beings can relax under certain circumstances and we don't have to be enemies. It was the\nfirst time that I realized that an Arab can, doesn't necessarily have to be my opponent, you know?",
        "Q: How many people were members of this kibbutz?",
        "A: About a hundred, about a hundred, and all from Hungary. But other kibbutzim had sometimes\nmixed.\nEnd of Tape 6, Side A\nTape 6, Side B",
        "Q: Okay, this is tape two, side B of an interview with Robert Holczer. Did you find that your dream of\nIsrael was fulfilled, the utopian ideal that you had and some of your, your thirst for a place where\nyou felt you belonged, was fulfilled there?",
        "A: At first I was very, very idealistic. Then somehow, I felt a little bit disappointed where in our\nkibbutz, all kinds of political groups tried to kind of tear us apart. And there were more and more\narguments and somehow this and the fact that as the country settled down into so-called peace, if we\ncan call it, the usual symptoms that every nation in the world experiences, surfaced, such as crime\nand... but the fact that there were Jewish criminals, that shocked me. You know, I was so naive that\nI thought that anybody goes to Israel, certainly doesn't want to do anything to hurt another human\nbeing. There were even, even murderers, and I just one day after another, these things, they added\nto my little disappointment, but I was still enjoying myself because I love to be outdoors and we, we\ndid the physical work and it was all that a young person wants for self-image, good self-image, we\nhad a very good self-image of ourselves. There were two things that contributed to my, to my\ncoming, going back to Hungary eventually in '51. One was, all of a sudden I realized that I, in all\nmy life I loved my father very, very much, and this is a, I mean it's a fact, there is nothing you can\ndo about it, I loved my father more than I loved my mother. Somehow I always considered my\nmother a little bit of a, of a kind of petit bourgeois that I never really completely understood. And I\nthought that she was a little bit, she was just in another, in other words, she wanted me to be also,\nyou know, like she was, and play the piano and all these things and I was not the type. So I was not\nthat close to her even though I was with her all the time and practically, I was also instrumental in\nsaving her life in the war when I dragged her with me everywhere and all this, but my father, and I\nrealized I spent very little time with my father as a young man because he was always away in, in\nthe concentration camp. And now he was home and now they couldn't come any more, Hungary\nwas sealed. And then I also, at the age of nineteen, became somehow involved with a group of\ncynical people. And I met them here and there and some of them I knew from Hungary and they\nwere married to this and this, I just somehow was under the influence of these who saw nothing nice\nany more in Israel except the bad things. This, the homesickness plus the fact that then I began to\nget all kinds of propaganda material from Hungary and somehow, this was the third thing, I was\nmisled by all this, what I read, and I thought that the situation changed and Hungary is such a\nmarvelous country today. And my parents tried to communicate to me, even though they never\nwanted me to really go away, but now they didn't want me to really come home, they were afraid\nwhat would happen to me. And that, they just apparently didn't come across quite well because I,\neventually I just decided I want to go back to Hungary, and probably homesickness had a great deal\nto do, I, at that time as a young man, I didn't realize that you can't go home again, you know? I\nenvisioned that everything is going to be back and all this. Well, I then applied to the Hungarian\nEmbassy, got a permit and the Israelis, of course, didn\u2019t keep me there, and in 1951, I returned to\nHungary. And those were the worst years, aside from October 15th, those years were the worst\nyears of my life, the next two or three years.",
        "Q: Before we go into more details about that, you mentioned that you found the Israelis very well\norganized as you were escaping from Hungary. When you arrived in the kibbutz, did you, did you\nshare the feeling that the way that the kibbutz was organized was, was very good and smooth and,\ndid you have any observations about that?",
        "A: The kibbutz was also very well organized, this was an old kibbutz and it was like a clock work.\nAlso, there was a hierarchy which naturally some people didn't understand, but I had no argument\nwith that because I realized a person who came here fifty years ago when there was nothing here\nexcept rocks and Arabs shooting at them, has, is more equal, right, than somebody who arrives here\ntoday. It was well run, it was a wealthy kibbutz, there was very good food, there was culture, they\nmade sure that orchestras are coming, good ones, entertainment, no, I had absolutely no feeling of\nlet down in this respect. No, I admired the way they carried on. Just a little, just a little thing that\nshows that how they thought of everything: shoveling manure, for example, of course, not\nsomething that somebody wants to do for the rest of his or her life, so or washing dishes in the\nkitchen, so there were, there were certain things in the kibbutz that 1t was not a, an area where you\nwere assigned permanently, they were temporary. And so everybody knew that once in a month I\nhave to shovel manure and once a month or twice a month, I have to wash the dishes, so, there were\nsome other, but even this was taken care of, you know, I think in a very human manner.",
        "Q: Did you have dreams or ideas of what exactly you would be doing when you went back to Hungary,\nwas that... was your sense of where you wanted to go in your life very developed?",
        "A: I was naively thinking about going to the university and continuing with my education to become a\nteacher, a high school teacher, and so I went back through the Bosporus, Turkey, Black Sea,\nRomania and then Hungary. Travelling through Romania by train, in 1949, excuse me, 1951, was\nquite an experience, the people just looked at me, looked at me and since there are quite a few\nHungarians in Romania, I then... eventually they found out that I speak Hungarian, so there was\nalways a Hungarian there and asked me and I very naively give all the details of my life and all this\nand that, and I didn't understand why they looked at me, just looked at me, just looked at me, and\nalso Romania was tremendously gray and I could only think of 7984, going across Romania. And\nthat was only the beginning, 1951, you know?",
        "Q: You're referring to the book, 1984?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: You're referring to the book?",
        "A: Yes, I refer to the book 1984, or the movie rather, okay? It's the same thing, but the movie is the\none that I always keep in my mind when I think of Romania. So I arrived on the Hungarian border\nand here was an officer on the border looked at my papers and all this and he, I'll never forget what\nhe told me, he said to me, \u201cI don't know where you come from, but it must have been very bad, very\nbad there, that you come from.\u201d And he looked at me and said, \u201cWelcome to Hungary.\u201d And this\nwas a border guard officer. And I thought this is a strange thing, what does it mean? Well, I\nlearned very quickly. When I boarded the train again on the other side of the border, it was just as\ngray as coming through Romania and then finally when I arrived home, I looked around, I realized\nthat I was totally, totally misled. Never have I been misled before or after the way I was. I arrived\nthere and it was the grayest, most colorless, most suspicious, paranoid society you can imagine.\nAnd my bad period started with, of course, not being able to get a job, any job, there was no one,\ngoing to the university, of course, was ridiculous to think about because I was an unreliable element,\nI came home, number one, from the West, I was an imperialist agent, as far as they were concerned,\nnot only that, I was a Zionist imperialist agent. And it took me almost six month to get a job to\nsweep a floor, to sweep floors and clean oil off the concrete in a garage, in a state-owned garage.",
        "Q: How did you get the job?",
        "A: With great connections, the fact that my father was from the working class and many of his brothers\nand their friends were involved, but mainly their friends of where they come from, this suburb of\nHungary, a very poor one, suburb of Budapest, where now the communist officials with great\nconnections, but nobody wanted any names, nobody wanted to stick out their neck, they just\nsomehow pushed some paperwork somewhere and I was an, kind of an auxiliary labor help, a no\nname person whom they hired because they needed somebody to clean something. And that was\nthe only job I could get. What hurt me even more was the fact that my good friends on the street,\nsome of them who stayed in Hungary, not too many because most of them escaped, but they would\nnot want anything to do with me because most people didn't want to touch me, didn't want to talk to\nme, they don't know me, they rather would go to the other side of the street than to meet me. Some\nprobably out of disgust that how stupid a human being can be to come back to this, and others for\nfear.",
        "Q: Because you had been in Israel?",
        "A: Yes, yes, because I had been out, it doesn't have to be, it didn't have to be Israel, anyone, it was a\ntotally paranoid society, everything that happened in the Soviet Union was copied the next day, you\nknow. So the, I worked in this garage for about six month and I always noticed with great nostalgia,\nhow they have these posters about urging workers to go to college and I wanted to go to college,\nand I went to the Party secretary of the firm which had about twelve garages, had to sign a paper\nthat recommends you to go to the next step and every time I went to see him, he laughed at me, he\nsaid, \u201cYou know that you are here by the grace of a few people and not, you have no merits to go\nthere.\u201d So the, my break came when the secretary became very ill, the Party secretary of the firm,\nand they sent out a temporary Party secretary, and she was a woman, she was very busy when I\nentered, you know, dirty and overalls and all this, and when I told her what I wanted, I got an, this\nopportunity and try, now, when I told her what I wanted, she said, \u201cWell, I don't have time to write\nyou a recommendation. I'm glad that a worker wants to go to college, we need working youth, why\ndon't you dictate what you need to my secretary and I will just sign it.\u201d So I passed the first hurdle,\nwith this I went to the university where I had to submit this. This was a committee, they\ninterviewed you and they read your, you had to write your, your biography, autobiography for\neverything, everything. So here was a committee, admitting committee, the Young Communist\nLeague, the Communist Party, one from the faculty, et cetera, about, I would say, seven, eight\npeople. And when they got to certain points, they said, \u201cCome on, you must be joking that you\nreally think that, you know, you can come here.\u201d Well, I left and as I was going out a man whose\nname was Mr. Bartos, he was on the faculty, this was the Hungarian Teachers Academy, this was\nthe university where I wanted to go, it was called the Teachers Academy, but it was part of the\nuniversity. He came out and he said, \u201cHolczer, Holczer, didn't your father play on a certain soccer\nteam?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d He said, \u201cDidn't your father have four or five brothers playing on the same\nsoccer team?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes.\u201d And he said, \u201cOkay, come back in September and see, maybe\nsince you were a minor when you left the country, I will try and write to the Ministry of Education,\nmaybe something can be done.\u201d Well, I was holding my breath for three months, I went back in\nSeptember and I went into the Party secretary's office, they had no idea who I was, they couldn't\nfind any paper, anything, so I was looking for him. And I found him and he said, \u201cJust a second.\u201d\nHe went into the Party secretary, he came out a few minutes later and he said, \u201cI am very happy to\ninform you that the Minister of Education, on the basis that you were a minor when you left\nHungary, give you special permission to enter the university.\u201d And he said, \u201cNow, this was the last\ntime you ever talk to me, you ever looked at me, you ever even thought that we have anything to do\nwith each other. Never again.\u201d He said, \u201cThat is the price. You understand?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d Said,\n\u201cand say hello to your dad.\u201d That was it. I went home, my father remembered him, they played on\nthe same team. And he was the head of the physical education branch of the faculty, you know?\nAnd this is how I got in. And I had a very, very good time because I found out ninety-nine percent\nof the kids thought the same way as I did and there were very few communists, very few. And yet,\nwhen it came to 1953, I almost was, I was thrown out for about one week. Stalin was dying and\nwhen he, in his last breath, he looked up, he saw doctors around him and he was paranoia, he said,\n\u201cWho are these?\u201d They said, \u201cDoctors.\u201d And Stalin was very anti-Semitic and he said, \u201cAre they\nJewish doctors?\u201d And I think, out of twelve or so, seven or eight were Jewish, they said, \u201cYes.\u201d\nThey said, \u201cArrest them.\u201d And they were, all the doctors around Stalin were arrested a few days\nbefore he died. And then, when this happened, in Hungary, too, they were looking for Jewish\ndoctors or anybody who was, had anything to do with Zionists because they called them the Zionist\nconspiracy against Stalin and they found me at the college. They had to, since this was a chain\nreaction, that went down. So they found me and they told me to go home and that I am a Zionist\nthis and Zionist that. And Stalin died three days later and I mean, I was just heartbroken because it\nwas before exams and all this and it was in March and I was ready to take my exams soon and then\nwhen everything died, died down, and the so-called Thaw, this is what they called it politically, the\nThaw started, then they called me back and they said forget about the whole thing and continue.",
        "Q: You mentioned in the last tape that your father had, after he returned from Bor, he was appointed on\na committee for housing?",
        "A: Mmm-hmm.",
        "Q: What, what happened with his work, with his career, did he remain on that committee after the\ncommunist takeover, or did he continue, you also mentioned that he went back to work for his\nformer employer, did he continue to work for this former employer? What became of his career?",
        "A: My father's former employers, either died or escaped in 1947 or 1948, to the West, so this, what I\nmentioned, was a volunteer work. Everybody, basically, had to volunteer to do something. This\nwas volunteer work, he volunteered to be appointed to this position and this was not a paid job.\nAnd it did not require a great deal of his time. He immediately looked for some opportunity and\nstarted to work for a co-op, a lot of co-ops started and what co-ops were are a group of people who\nbanded together and formed a what you would call a, maybe a small enterprise, as long as they\nworked under the ruse of a cooperation and everything was divided, the profit if there was any, and\nthey paid their taxes to the state, this was what the communists considered kind of a happy in-\nbetween of state farms or state enterprise and private enterprise. Because private enterprise was\nphased out gradually, except in cases such as a shoe maker that, you know, repairs shoes, but even\nfor that, eventually, they had co-ops, shoemaker co-ops or tailor co-ops or this, but a few, a few of\nthose branches, that you could not really work any other way except in a co-op, but he was working\nfor a co-op where he rose eventually, he was a very smart man, and he rose to be kind of a midlevel\nmanager, but also working and this co-op was working with a lot of women who would then get the\nmerchandise and do it at home. They were making shopping nets and shopping bags and things like\nthat that anybody can do on a sewing machine at home. And then they would bring it in and so\nactually they had a very, a very small area, a very small base and just a warehouse and he enjoyed\nthis, he enjoyed it and he was very much liked. The only problem he had occasionally is that they\nasked him, because he was such a good worker, and he received all kinds of awards that he didn't\nreally want particularly because he was not very, you know, infatuated with the communist system,\nthey always wanted him to join the Party because he was a perfect, what they called cadre, cadre, he\ncomes from the working class, he was a hard-working man, he was an honest man, he rose from\nnothing to a midlevel manager, so he was an ideal person. But he never joined, he always said,\n\u2018No, absolutely no.\u201d So that, he was such a good worker, they left him alone.",
        "Q: Did your mother have to start working?",
        "A: No, my mother was totally just a mother and a housewife, she never had any, any, and I can't\nremember my mother having, you know, political opinion or anything like that, she had other\ninterests. She read a lot and went to the movies and she loved visiting around during the day, she\nwas kind of a social butterfly.",
        "Q: You mentioned that in school you were studying geography and history?",
        "A: Yes, that was my, in college, geography and history.",
        "Q: And that the other students who were in school with you were, were also didn't have a lot of\nsympathy for communism. Did you all get together with your classmates and did you, did you talk\nabout politics often, what was the mood like among your, your, your fellow students?",
        "A: Interestingly, with most people, you could talk politics. You know, eventually, throughout these\nyears, we isolated the ones who were suspicious to us and... because they were always eager beaver\nParty workers and give big speeches and some of them did big speeches and we knew that we can\nstill talk to them, they\u2019re just careerists and they just want to go ahead. But I would say the great\nmajority, even in the worst days, we could still discuss things. Obviously, we didn't do it on the\nstreet, we didn't do it elsewhere except in our own home or in a restaurant where there was a lot of\nnoise and they couldn't discern, you know, who says what. So in this respect, we did not really have\na kind of a prison atmosphere in college. And our professors, I would say eighty percent of them\nwere very much against the regime and occasionally they let that go in very, you know, ambiguous\nstatements. We recognized it immediately and all this, but just to give you one example, most of us,\nwe had to go to Russian instruction every day, most of us either didn't show up or if we did, we\ndidn't listen, we didn't learn anything, and after going through college, at the end you had to take a\nstate exam. And I, the exam in Hungary at that time was you had to draw a written note on which\nyou had a topic. And you were given fifteen minutes to take notes on that topic from your memory,\nyou were given a pencil and some paper, and when you were called upon, this was your turn and\nyou could talk about, introduce your topic and there was a committee. And I went to my Russian\nexam, and this happened to other people too, and I drew my topic and I couldn't even read the title,\nlet alone, couldn't read the title, I yust, in these years I just never bothered to read, to learn enough to\nread. Today of course, I'm not very proud of this, because now I know that the more languages you\nspeak, you know, the more lives you have, but those days, this was a political statement, they\ncouldn't believe it, they just couldn't believe it because I was straight A in my subjects and so there\nwas tremendous animosity toward me from the police, from the Party secretary and all the others.\nCan we stop?\nEnd of Tape 6, Side B\nTape 7, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape three, side A of an interview with Robert Holczer. Do you want to continue with what\nyou were saying about your. . .",
        "A: Oh, the Russian exam. And then I found out later that some of my classmates had the same\nproblem and, eventually, they decided not to, not to have us back, so they just gave us a D and they\nwere very angry about it. But in a way it was their fault, too, because how could we get up to that\npoint, going through all classes, didn\u2019t they realize that something is wrong? Well, this, I remember\nthis very distinctly, that that was one way to show our reaction to what was going on. And\notherwise, even the ones who were very active in the Communist Party, most of them always gave\nus a signal that this is all a show, there is nothing to worry about. There were very few people. So\nwhen I left the college, at that time, you, I became a teacher and we were supposed to go to the\ncountryside, they could not, you could not teach in Budapest the first year and I was then assigned\nto a little, small village, not far from Vacz, from my mother's birthplace, only a few miles and taught\nthere for a year. And this was a small village of a minority, Hungary has very few minorities, but\nthey have some Slovak minorities in the North, these were Slovaks and they speak, they spoke very\nlittle Hungarian, but they would not admit it because they were afraid that there would be\nrepercussion, so they asked for a Hungarian teacher, they could have asked for a Slovak-speaking\nteacher, too. And it was quite an experience, but it has nothing to do with being Jewish or with the\nHolocaust, none of that came up, it was just a totally different one. And then after this year that I\nspent in... I made contact again, I wanted to get back with a youth organization and I found\ninterestingly that the Communist Youth Organization, the Pioneer organization probably could use\nme because, I mean I went through the boy scouts, I went through the Zionists, I had some very\ndefinite ideas and I answered an ad and became a director of a summer camp. They looked for a\nyoung teacher who, I had about twelve other young teachers with me and it was in Budapest, it was\njust a day camp, and it turned out to be such a good experience that the local Communist Party\nsecretary asked me if I would like to come and teach in the district. And I said, \u201cNaturally, this is\nit!\u2019 And so I was transferred to, just to a suburb of Budapest and I taught there until the Revolution\ncame and I escaped again.",
        "Q: When did you graduate from college?",
        "A: '53.",
        "Q: And so it was in '54?",
        "A: Yeah, the Revolution came in '56, okay, so. . .",
        "Q: So you taught for two years in a suburb of. . .",
        "A: Yeah, right. One year in the countryside and two years in this suburb. Junior high.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you were involved with the Democratic Teacher's Union at one point?",
        "A: During the Revolution, they asked me to organize a Democratic Teacher's Union. I was not a Party\nmember, they knew that I was not also an anti-Party member either because, and this I wanted to\nbring out and emphasize, that as a Jew in Hungary, you could never be truly an anti-communist\nbecause you knew one thing, as long as the Communist Party was in power, there would be no\npogroms and your life is safe. And this is what happened after communism, and communist fall,\nmost of my relatives and friends who were in Hungary, this was their greatest fear, that what will\nhappen to them now. And anti-Semitism is now rampant in Eastern Europe, in Hungary, too. So\nthis is just an interlude, I just wanted to say something about that. So I was just teaching in this\nsuburb and until the Revolution and as a, and during the Revolution, they sent for me and they\nwanted me to get the Democratic Teachers Union together, various democratic organizations, and\nall this. And I came out to a couple of briefings with people, with the local council, the town\ncouncil, the district council and one day there was some fighting out there and I saw a bunch of\npeople with armbands, the Arrow Cross armbands. And I looked out the window and all my desire\nto ever do anything or to stay there, just went away. Right in that moment. I realized that this is\nnow when I have to leave. Even though I had a very good life, the last three years, after I was\ntransferred to Budapest, I had a very, very good life, relatively speaking, you know? A good salary,\nI started to write for the newspaper, the... stories about young people. I ran camps and financially,\nand I got all the recognition and awards and all this, I couldn't complain. But when I saw, when I\nsaw that, the symbol, I went home and I said, \u201cThis is it. I will never return except to visit.\u201d And I\ntold my parents, \u201cIn two weeks, I'm leaving.\u201d",
        "Q: Where did you, you mentioned that you had a, you had a real enthusiasm for working with young\npeople and that seems to be something that you did for most of your adult life and at the time, what,\nwhere did your, where did that enthusiasm come from and what, what were you teaching, were you\nteaching them simply geography or were you trying to teach them a broader range of things?",
        "A: Well, when I was transferred to Budapest, immediately I started to teach geography, they had these\nso-called pioneer houses, these were buildings where the kids can come back in the afternoon and\ndepending on their interests, join groups, study groups. And I was running the geography group\nwhich was a lot of introduction and simulations of how a river is meandering and then old river 1s\nmeandering, a lot of tests, hands-on type of activities. I took them to hike and I taught them how,\norientation in nature and all, everything that was romantic in the boy scouts. And from this, I kind\nof organized a group of very enthusiastic kids who eventually would follow me anywhere, you\nknow, and it appealed to me as a young, and I can still do that, and so then people saw this and they\nhired me to run big camps. But I always neglected the political thing, that was not, I never really\ncared for the politics, but I emphasized the romantic thing. I even wrote a book for the Pioneer\nmovement and suggested a completely new uniform and emblems and all this, what kids love at that\nage, because the Pioneer uniform is the most, was the most impractical thing a child can have. A\nwhite shirt, can you imagine, with dark blue pants and a red kerchief, I mean, and nothing on it, they\nwere not, they couldn't have any emblem anything, so I said, \u201cNo, a child wants to see his or her\nachievements, right there, he or she wants to show it to the world.\u201d And so they were, they were\ngiving me some free hand to do it and I did a lot of this, submitted it, it was accepted, so this 1s what\nI loved, that I could have some influence and push them away, mainly from politics, into romantic\nactivities, you know, and that is the one, that is, I think that pleased me a_ great deal. And\neventually, it was a, I did it until the very last day, until I left Hungary, and I still corresponded with\nmany of my kids who were in my group as adults. And when I went back later on, ten years or\nfifteen years later, some of these kids were running the same kind of camps and organizations and\nthey always came and they said, \u201cYou know, if you had told us that in the middle of the night we\nhave to leave our homes so that nobody will wake up and assemble in a place, we would have been\nup there. And we would have been following you all the way out to the border.\u201d I didn't tell them\nthat I was leaving because I didn't want them to even have this silly idea, but after I left some of\nthem learned about it and three of them came after me and ended up in Switzerland, but eventually\nwent back to Hungary. So occasionally, when I am in Hungary, I do bump into them and I go out\nand look up some, and those who were very nice to me, I always see. I even see the Communist\nParty secretary, the woman who was influential to get me, I took my wife, too, to see her during the\nlate \u201870s and early \u201880s, she and her husband, I just, they were good people. They came from the\nold communist underground, you know? And though we never talked about it, I'm sure they were\njust as disappointed in what happened to Marx ideas as most other people. But they would never\ndiscuss it because they were too loyal to the Party.",
        "Q: When 1956 came and some of the demonstrations started, were you intrigued in any way or did you\nmainly feel concerned about the fascist elements that you were seeing? Did you go to the big\ndemonstration on October 23rd?",
        "A: Yeah. I was on the street all the time because I believed that I have this, anybody, most Holocaust\nsurvivors have an intuition, have a, somehow, a sixth sense and we always wanted to read the\ncrowd. The mood of the crowd. And so I was in the street all the time, watching what's happening,\nkind of sensing the undercurrent. I was like an animal and I knew that I knew exactly what was\ngoing on. And I knew that these people eventually could be up to no good or quite a few of them\ncould be up to no good because, you know, the leopard doesn't lose its spots and even though it all\nstarted with great democratic slogans, eventually after two weeks, it did disintegrate and there were\na lot of fascist groups and I did not want to live under Russian tanks, but I was glad, myself, that the\nRussian tanks came back. I just didn't want to live under that system either, but at least 1t saved the\nlives of a lot of people because there were ugly incidents. The Revolution started for two weeks, the\nfirst one week was kind of democratic and looked like democratic and the second week, just\neverything disintegrated and the crowd went berserk and I didn't trust any of that any more.",
        "Q: You also mentioned that there was an extreme amount of anti-Semitism during that time. Would\nyou just tell me some examples of what was going on?",
        "A: Well, unfortunately, after looking at all the countries where anti-Semitism 1s so rampant, has been\nand still is, I must conclude that all Catholic countries are that way in Eastern Europe, only the\nCatholic countries. Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia, these are the countries where, and some\nof them have very little Jews, in Poland there are only a few thousand Jews left. I have experienced\nanti-Semitism all the time, [coughs] excuse me, and even when I go home nowadays to visit, well I\nhaven't been to Hungary for the last three years, but the letters I receive from my relatives constantly\nrefer to that and my family was never very much interested in bringing this out because they are,\nrather, they consider themselves Hungarians, the ones who are living in Hungary today and I'm\nalways surprised that this is a main concern to them, so apparently this situation has never changed.\nIn 1919, Hungary became the first fascist country of Europe, even before Hitler, and stayed that\nway, at least, even today under the current, the undercurrent is very anti-Semitic, the Jews are\nresponsible for everything just like in the Middle Ages.",
        "Q: How long did you have to prepare to leave, you made the decision to leave and then, how long did it\ntake before you actually left and how did you make preparations?",
        "A: Well, the Revolution was defeated in the first week of November and it took me about ten to\nfourteen days to get going. I just wanted to say goodbye to my good friends and my family and also\nI had a cousin who wanted to come with me and I had to do a little preparation there, too, because\nhe was just a high school graduate and a very green fellow at that. And eventually he brought his\nfriend, so the three of us started out and in about ten, ten to fourteen days, I can't remember exactly,\nbut no more than two weeks. I just wanted to see exactly what works, what doesn't work, how can I\napproach the border, the most practical way, a lot of people were practically there and then captured\nand brought back to Budapest. And the repercussion was nothing but still, you didn't want to go\nthrough all this and then in the last second, just before you would go over to Austria, captured, you\nknow, be captured, so I kind of did a little homework, that's all, and tried to think of the practical\naspects of how to do that.\nEnd of Tape 7, Side B\nTape 8, Side A",

        "Q: It does?",
        "A: Yes. I... obviously I\u2019m not that devoted to Hungary. I\u2019m not a person who really believes much\nin national identity, you know, I just... I feel that cause more problems, that and religion, than\nanything else, so I\u2019ve never been a patriot of basically any country, and there... I still am not. So,\ndoes it sound all right?

So, do you... but then\nagain, you don\u2019t have a lot of strong feelings for Hungary. Do you dislike going back, when you\nhave visited? Or, how do you feel about visiting there, even?",
        "A: Well...",
        "Q: Pll hold it.",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t mind visiting Hungary, but... and the reason I don\u2019t mind visiting, because I still\nhave friends and some relatives I care to see and I care to be with. But, on the whole, when I am\nthere, I feel like a total stranger, which is not... which is not just because of what happened to\nme, it\u2019s also a tremendous generation gap. Most of the people of my age, are... [dog barks]\nprobably you have to stop that.",
        "Q: Yeah, I\u2019m wondering what... Hungary...",
        "A: Yes, that I... as I mentioned, I like to be with people, but the feeling of totally estranged, I realize\nis not just what happened... because of what happened to me, but also because I am now a... I...\nreaching the age when most people are just not around any more. And I... it\u2019s a strange thing to\nwalk through streets where you used to play, and you know that nobody is there any more from\nyour previous life. However, when I hear some anti-Semitic remarks, which you can hear often\nin Hungary, even today, or I see some very rude behavior, then I realize that I am very lucky not\nto be here, yeah. So... and I have never been a patriot of Hungary. I\u2019ve never had a Hungarian\npassport in my life. I\u2019ve always been really, stamped. Every document I ever had in Hungary,\nhad a big... a ZS on it, which meant I was a Jew. So, since I was never a first class citizen, not\neven a second class, no citizen at all, I just don\u2019t have any attachment to the country, as such. I\ndo have attachment to certain places where I grew up.",
        "Q: Are you an American citizen?",
        "A: Oh yes, I became an American citizen in 1961, and so I always kid people who ask me, when\nthey hear my accent, what happened to me, how come a foreigner is teaching American\ngovernment? Some of my students question me and I said, \u201cWell, I have been an American much\nlonger than you, and your parents.\u201d And so...",
        "Q: Do you feel more of an attachment to being... to America than Hungary in any sense? I mean, by\nbeing a citizen, by having lived here for so long?",
        "A: Oh, definitely. I must be honest and say that I do not have nationalistic feelings, as most people\nwould have. The flag or a national anthem doesn\u2019t really mean much to me. I don\u2019t consider that\npatriotism. But I like a lot of things here, especially the constitution, and I appreciate the fact that\nI can live a free life and for them I am very grateful and my patriotism manifests itself this way,\nand not by waving the flag.",
        "Q: Did you know anything about the Constitution before you came, or how did you learn about...\nabout the Constitution?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t, because I couldn\u2019t... I couldn\u2019t read it, I didn\u2019t speak English, and in Hungary, they\nwere not very eager to translate the American Constitution as I was growing up. But when I\ncame here, and I began to learn English and eventually when I went back to school, and was a\nhistory major, I had to... so, base... my first encounter with the Constitution was in college, in\nFresno.",
        "Q: And what... what impressed you about it, or what was your response to it when you first\n?",
        "A: Oh I thought that it was a tremendous document, naturally, and I still admire the people who\nwrote it. I consider them geniuses, creating something from nothing, truly, and I wish that we\nhad some of that caliber walking around today in Washington.",
        "Q: Was becoming a citizen of the United States an important event for you? Did it mean anything?",
        "A: Yes, because I never in my life held any kind of citizenship or any kind of passport. And the fact\nthat now I have something that will... unfortunately, that in the 20\" century, the fact that you are\na human being, with two eyes and a nose and everything else on you, 1s not sufficient proof for\nyou to travel around the world and be protected by international law. Considering all this, I felt\nmuch safer now that I have a country behind me and I am protected in case I am in trouble\nsomewhere. Yes, it meant a great deal, because those days, I liked to travel a lot, and it was a\nsense of security that I had from it.",
        "Q: Well, going back to then, when you first arrived in the United States, in 1956?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember your conceptions, your ideas about what the United States was then and what\nyou actually found and what your first impressions were?",
        "A: Well, since I came from a Communist country, and before that a Fascist country, initially the\nU.S. was never painted as a paradise. Never even painted as any country that is desirable to live\nin. All I heard about it was negative. However, I was raised in a family, my father was a very\nenlightened man, and he raised me on the truth, so I knew that this is the country of the free. And\nI had no qualms about this. The thing that bothered me a great deal about coming here, and also\nI, as I mentioned before, I did not come here... this was not my first choice, you know, I had to\nfollow my cousin. What bothered me, I have... I was never that much in favor of modern times\nand fast times, and a landscape with skyscrapers, that was not my vision of my future life. I was\na typical European, who felt a lot more comfortable in... on a narrow street with half-timbered\nhouses, and a lot of people on the street, and sidewalk caf\u00e9s, and little restaurants. Then to go to\na country where none of this would exist. So I had my reservations this way, emotionally. I had\nno qualms about the United States politically, but I was worried about how can I adjust to a place\nthat doesn\u2019t have much traditions.",
        "Q: Did you find that to be true, that your impression was that there was no tradition here, or did\nyou...",
        "A: Yes, yes, very much so. I still am very nostalgic when it comes to, for example Christmas. I\nconsider our life here quite plastic and I understand why. I am not faulting anyone for it. I know\nthat a country that 1s so young as the United State, just never had the opportunity to develop\nthose traditions that European countries have, that existed now for thousands of years. And so...\nBut it is just sad. I feel that a great deal of problems come from the fact that we are so young, and\nwe grew too quickly, almost like a teenager who just became totally uncoordinated.",
        "Q: But you mentioned that your father taught you about America, that it was... that it was the Land\nof the Free. What did that mean to you? What did that mean to him?",
        "A: Well, in the war, we listened, as long as he was around, and we had an opportunity, we listened\nto London, to the BBC, it was... and occasionally, I think, but I am not so sure, even the Voice of\nAmerica could be heard. And, of course there, we heard a great deal about the western... so-\ncalled western world. And realized that while we are living there as practical slaves, in the\nwestern world, people have a very good life. And that appealed to me a great deal.",
        "Q: How long were you in Camp Kilmer, when you first arrived in the U.S., in New Jersey?",
        "A: I think it was no more than two weeks. It was just a screening process to just give a very\nsuperficial screening, so certain elements, undesirable elements would not sneak into the\ncountry. They were looking for members of the Communist Party and unfortunately, people who\nwere sick, because with certain illnesses, you could not gain entrance to the United States. For\nexample, if you had TB. And then, from there... and also, they were in charge of sending you\nsomewhere. So, they were kind of dispatchers.",
        "Q: So it was then that you got sent to...",
        "A: Saint Louis.",
        "Q: Saint Louis.",
        "A: Yeah, Saint Louis, Missouri.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, what did you do there?",
        "A: In Saint Louis... Saint Louis, Missouri, I was welcomed by the family, by that time, adopted, of\ncourse, just symbolically, my cousin, and we were united. They were a... you might say upper-\nmiddle class American family with some problems and they thought that getting two Hungarian\nrefugees would probably mitigate their circumstances. And I was, within weeks, working for a\nwholesale jewelry company. I was just a stockboy. And, very simple work, and that was my job.\nAnd on weekends, as long as my cousin was with me, of course, we were walking around and\ngoing to a movie, even though we couldn\u2019t understand much of it. But just planning, eventually,\nto be integrated into this society. And on weekdays we worked, we went home, we watched\ntelevision. And the family was... it was a very interesting situation, because the man was manic\ndepressive and we could never figure out what his moves would be next. The... his wife was a\nvery darling woman, and she was the one who tried to figure this out, that with two Hungarian\nrefugees, the situation might change. They had a mentally retarded son in an institution, who\ncame home on weekends and they had another son at home, a very brilliant young man, who was\nalways creating something electrical, or mechanical, even. So, we had good relationship with\nhim, and I kept up with my host mother for a long time, and only when we left for Europe, that\nwas the time when I lost contact and I don\u2019t know where she is. I understand they got a divorce\nafter. It was in... unbearable to live with somebody who was so unpredictable.",
        "Q: You mean when you left for Europe to move there with Jan and...",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, yes.",
        "Q: ... much later. Uh-huh. Did you have the idea at that time, that you would be staying in the\nUnited States? I know you had the idea originally that you didn\u2019t want to stay, and you wanted to\ngo back to Europe. Were you thinking, after you had arrived, that you would actually stay?\nWhat... What were your thoughts about the future?",
        "A: Well, I realize that I was in a trap, because there was no way for me to go back to Europe, even if\nI wanted to, and be accepted by a... any country and get some legal status anywhere. The reason\nwas, once you were placed in a country, you couldn\u2019t really do much about it any more. So I\nknew I had to make the best of my stay here, but I certainly didn\u2019t want to stay in Saint Louis,\nbecause I was totally astonished at the prejudice in Saint Louis. Not just against Blacks, but also\nagainst just about anyone. I worked mainly, this 1s my fate, with German, it was a German\ncompany basically, a German family, German workers and I heard enough of... you cannot name\na group or a race around the world about whom they were not talking during the day, always in\nvery derogatory terms. And then I found out that Saint Louis was a very Germanic city at that\ntime. You were either of German descent, or you were Black. And luckily, when I became very,\nvery upset about this, my Black fellow workers, first by sign language, probably, and later on, as\nI learned my English, pidgin English back then, they invited me on weekends to be... to go\naround with them, because they said one cannot just sit at home. And they introduced me to the\nSaint Louis that most people who were born there, probably, wouldn\u2019t know. I went to just about\nevery nightclub, I heard just about every jazz band that there existed those days, that came to\nSaint Louis. And many times, in a huge dance hall, I was the only white face. And of course,\nsometimes, I ran into almost trouble too, because of that.",
        "Q: Were you not... did it seem strange to you that it would be the group of Black co-workers, rather\nthan Germanic co-workers who would befriend you, or did you think that that had anything to do\nwith you being Jewish, or did you reject friendships with the German descent co-workers? What\nwas the story with that?",
        "A: No, because most of those Germans were Jews, and... but that didn\u2019t prevent them from being\nprejudiced against me too, and they knew that they were... that I was Jewish. It was just a general\nthing in Saint Louis, to look down on anyone who is not an established person. And I felt this,\neverywhere. I just... and the situation at home, where I was staying with these people, was also\nnot very happy. And that, I think, contributed to my thoughts that, how nice it would be to go to\nsome other place.",
        "Q: So you came with some ideas about this being the Land of the Free, and did it surprise you to see\nhow... what a division there was between Blacks and Whites in this country and the way that the\nWhite people treated Blacks, and the problems with equality?",
        "A: Yes, yes, that surprised me very, very much. In one of these weekend excursions, I was\nintroduced to a very charming college student, she was Black, and we started to date. And\neventually, she explained to me that we cannot see each other any more, because her life was in\ndanger, and my life was in danger. And she said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand this now, but twenty\nyears from now you will understand. And as much as it hurts me, we have to stop seeing each\nother.\u201d And that was my first great introduction to prejudice, really, on a personal, you know,\nbasis.",
        "Q: So, up until then, you really hadn\u2019t realized what a strong division there was, or what a taboo\nthere was against interracial relationships?",
        "A: No, I mean, you know, I came from a society that was tremendously prejudiced and I thought I\nam coming to a society that is much more different and much more positive about these things.\nAnd it really surprised me that there was so much dislike and hatred, that I knew could not be\nerased very soon.",
        "Q: Were there any civil rights activities going on in Saint Louis during the time that you were there?\nWas there... were there any at... you know, discussions, just in the wake of the Brown versus\nBoard of Education decision that interracial education would be happening? I mean, were you\naware, or... that the schools would stop being segregated? Were there any things like that\nhappening in Saint Louis that you were aware of?",
        "A: This was in 1957, and by 1957, June, I was gone. So I only lived there for five months or so. And\nI... my English was not good enough to read newspapers or even discuss anything political with\npeople. I did watch television, because I felt that 1t was a good way to learn, and I got certain\nideas, but I am not aware that I was... anyway I ever met, you know, this kind of a problem in\nSaint Louis, no.",
        "Q: How did you learn English?",
        "A: Well, when you are... this is my great argument against bilingual education, that when you have\nto, you learn everything. You can learn Chinese probably, just as well as you learn English. No,\nfor Europeans, English is an easy language to learn. Not so easy to write, but to learn, because\nit\u2019s... the grammar is much simpler than some European languages. I just put my mind to it, and I\ndecided, if I am here, I might as well do it. I could have gone to Cleveland, for example, and live\nmy life as a Hungarian, but I wanted to be integrated into the society, and I love the English\nlanguage, that\u2019s the truth. I think of all the languages, even though I admit that French is a very\nbeautiful language to listen to, but I love the English language, I love... and this is why I love to\nread and I learned just by listening and my willpower, I think, helped me to get through. And\namong all the people eventually I associated with, who arrived at the same time, I made the most\nprogress, because I just decided I don\u2019t want to belong to any Hungarian club and I don\u2019t want\nanything to do with this. I really want to learn English.",
        "Q: It was a... you mentioned in the last interview that it was a friendship with... was it a professor at\nWashington University? Was that how you got out of Saint Louis and to Aspen? How did your\nacquaintance with this man come about?",
        "A: He saw a newspaper article about us, 1n the... I think 1t was the Saint Louis Post Dispatch. He...\nBecause we were the first ones, my cousin and I think the first Hungarian refugees. And he cut it\nout and misplaced it somewhere, and only a few month after, somehow th-the article came up\nand he called us and he invited both of us to dinner, to his house. And by that time my cousin\nwas gone, so I went and I met him and his family. He just wanted to socialize and talk about the\ndays in Hungary. He came to... he had come to this country before I, right after World War II.\nAnd his wife was a former German psychiatrist, and they had one son. And...",
        "Q: But they were not Jewish, were they, or...",
        "A: Yes, yes...",
        "Q: ... were... they were Jewish?",
        "A: ... they were. And... but of course, this doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. Interestingly, I last... I\nlost contact with them in... sometimes in the sixties, and reestablished it last year when I went to\nAspen. And Mrs. Chabay was there. The professor, Mr. Chabay, was already dead, but she was\nthere, visiting from Florida, where she lives in a retirement home. And so I had a good chat with\nher about the good old days.",
        "Q: When you met them, did they ask you about your experiences during the war? Did you talk at all\nabout that?",
        "A: Yes, they ask me a great deal about that, naturally. But they were also very much interested in\nmy... at... in my present experiences then, which were also not very good. Something happened\nto me after I moved out of my original family, and established my independence. For a couple of\nmonth, I lived with a Hungarian couple who rented a room, because they needed some money,\nand they had a room with a separate entrance, so I rented that, and there I had a pretty bad\nexperience, and so I was just ready to leave, anywhere, in the United States. And this is when\nthey showed me a film of Aspen, Colorado, where they had the summer home, and where he was\na member of the music festival staff, and said, \u201cYou are coming with us.\u201d",
        "Q: Do you want to say anything about the experience that you had, that was bad?",
        "A: Well, it was... I don\u2019t even know if anyone in the future would completely understand it, but it\nwas just a strange coincidence that my father\u2019s company\u2019s... every company in Hungary had a\nParty secretary, they were in charge of practically life and death, what was going on. And my\nfather\u2019s Party secretary, a lady, was the mother of the person who rented the room. So, he and his\nwife immediately, when this came to the surface, they immediately were afraid that I might\nreport on them back to Hungary, which I had no interest, I couldn\u2019t care less, except one day\nthey... I heard a big argument and I realized that they were arguing about abortion. The man\nwanted his wife to abort, she was pregnant. They were very... social climbers, real social\nclimbers, who were constantly adding up, every penny on a piece of paper, figuring out when\nand how they can move, they can buy more furniture, they can buy this, they... a child was the\nlast on their priority list. And so I heard her cry, and all this, and a few days later I came home,\nand she was in a pool of blood. She had done something to herself, and I found her, and it...\nEnd of Tape 8, Side A\nTape 8, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape one, side B, of an interview with Robert Holczer. Go ahead.",
        "A: And so the young man knew now that I... we have a secret, and he was afraid that I would report\nthis back to his mother. And of course, I had absolutely nothing to do with his mother. Then,\nnext, the mail from home stopped. I did not get any, any, any mail, which was very strange,\nbecause I had an agreement with my parents that every week we shall write to each other. They\nreceived letters from me, desperate letters, what happened to you? And nothing. This went on for\nweeks and weeks, until I went to a Party, and the woman confidentially asked me to step aside,\nand told me that she was with them somewhere, and they were a little bit tipsy, and they were\nsaying that they are stopping all my mail and stuff it under their mattress. I left the place very\nquickly, I went home, looked under their mattress, and I found all the letters, and confronted\nthem with this, and I knew that I would have to move out, and that\u2019s exactly when this happened,\nthat I was invited and they said, \u201cOh, you come with us.\u201d",
        "Q: So you went to Aspen?",
        "A: Yes. I went to Aspen, and that was like going from a cave to paradise. Not only that it was\nbeautiful and now, I had always been a mountain man, but the people, I just loved the people.\nThat was way before Aspen was discovered and made into the rich man\u2019s Mecca. It was now a...\nit was a great deal of Europeans... Americans from the 10th Mountain Division that exist... that\ntrained there during World War II, and many of its members came back and established Aspen. It\nwas just a marvelous group of people. Today, of course, they are all dead, but their names are on\nstreets, and the recreation centers and parks. And it just... it was a little bit weird for me to return\nand see all my friends names as street names and park names and all.",
        "Q: What was it... tell more about what it was about the place that was so appealing to you, and also\nhow that changed your perception of the United States, if it did.",
        "A: What appealed to me is, number one, up on eight thousand feet, you need each other. The\nwinters are pretty harsh, and the summers were filled with tourists coming to the music festival.\nYou needed other people\u2019s help and you had to help others, too. There was just a camaraderie\nthere, a very open attitude that appealed to me a great deal. I was still young, and the fact that I\ncould get a job where I... my hours were not so regimented, even then... there, I felt so free. The\npay was good in comparison to other, you know, kinds of other areas of the United States. There\nwas so much color in the place. All kinds of people coming and going. It was just a... for a\nnewcomer, it was a marvelous, marvelous introduction to American life. There were people there\nwho were truly the most middle class, rigid family. There were people who were a very relaxed\nfamily. All kinds, and they were all... they all got along so well, that was a great surprise to me. I\nalso loved the fact that a great deal of the town, the eastern part, was still in such primitive state\nback then, that some miner shacks still had cooking utensils on the stove, just as they left them\nback at the turn of the century when the panic came and many of those miners went back to Italy\nand you... what is today Yugoslavia. So, there was a little bit of the old. Not everything was\nconcrete and glass, and well, even today the town has preserved a few buildings. I was very glad\nto see that not everything is rebuilt.",
        "Q: When you formed friendships with people and made contact with people there, did they... were\nthey interested in your past, and where you\u2019d come from and what had happened to you during\nthe war? Did anyone ask you about that, and did you feel compelled to talk about it?",
        "A: Yes, yes, they were very much interested. These were the type of people, the locals and well,\nmost people worked in businesses that catered to tourists. And it was an asset if you had an\naccent, and if you look like somebody who had an interesting past, because they... sometimes\nthey hired me for a certain job just because I had a story. And yes, people were constantly\nquestioning you about this, and I couldn\u2019t care less, it... as a matter of fact, I enjoyed this kind of\nfifteen minutes in the sun. And so, I mean, in this respect, I had no problem.",
        "Q: Did you find that people had an understanding of what had happened during the war, and the\nhistory of what had happened to the Jews in Europe?",
        "A: Mm, mm, well no, not much. The only people with whom I could really communicate about the\nwar, and what happened in Europe, were the ones who were in the European theater, and as I, as\nI mentioned before, many of the so-called 10 Mountain Division\u2019s members settled there, and I\nloved to talk to them, because they were very much involved in the liberation of some of the\nEuropean countries, so they knew where I came from. I just have to add one more thing to this,\nthat interestingly, the reason I am so fond of Aspen, even today, because I believe that my life in\nAmerica was shaped by that two and a half years I spent in Aspen. Almost every major\nfriendship, almost every major contact I had, after I left Aspen, was based on something that\nhappened to me in Aspen. Almost every one of them. I still am very close, and my closest friends\ntoday, I say, in the U.S. are those who were with me in Aspen, and those who still are alive.",
        "Q: What was the work that you did while you were in Aspen?",
        "A: When I arrived there, immediately, the next day, I started to wash dishes in a little caf\u00e9 house\ncalled the Epicure. And I was there, I think, for no more than five days or so, when a very nice\nlooking Austrian gentleman stopped by and, who looked, I remember, who looked exactly like\nthe famous French actor, back then Fernandel, and said to me... he watched me washing dishes\nand he said, \u201cOh, I am so and so, Iam a friend of Mr. Chabay.\u201d And that was the gentleman who\nbrought me to Aspen. He said, \u201cAnd I would like you to come over and see my shop.\u201d And he\nbrought me over to his shop, he had a nice jewelry and gift shop, and it was... he was a\nwatchmaker and that was his main profession, but he also had a very, very nice place. And he\nasked me... we conversed in German, since he was Austrian and I spoke much better German\nthan English and he said, \u201cHow do you like my shop?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat a nice, nice, cute\nplace.\u201d He said, \u201cWould you like to work for me? I can give you this much,\u201d which was a lot\nmore than washing dishes. I said, \u201cBut how can you hire me? I don\u2019t speak English.\u201d He said, \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t ask you whether you speak English or not, I asked you whether you like my shop.\u201d And he\nsaid... And I said, \u201cYes,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re hired.\u201d And that was the kind of attitude that\nprevailed in Aspen. Easy going, fun loving, a lot of kidding. So I worked for Kurt Breznits, and I\nstarted to work for him, this was in 1957, about, I would say, July. And our friendship survived\nfor forty-two years, because he\u2019s the one, he and his wife, in their eighties, I visited them last\nyear. Now, I work there until late fall... early fall, excuse me. A young man came in around\nSeptember, and by that time there weren\u2019t too many people in Aspen, because it\u2019s a seasonal\nplace. At least back then, the off season, you could hardly see anybody in the street. At the end\nof September, people were leaving, the music festival was over, and the ski season came around\nin December. So everybody left, vacation, travel. A young man came in and started to talk to me.\nHe said, \u201cI got a problem, my mother has a birthday and I have to get something for her.\u201d I said,\n\u201cLook, that\u2019s not... shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d In my broken English I said that, and he looked at\nme and he immediately said, \u201cWell, where are you from?\u201d And of course, the whole story came\nabout and I said, \u201cWell, why is it a problem to buy something for your mother?\u201d He said,\n\u201cBecause she has everything.\u201d And this is how I met a then young man by the name of Sheldon\nRich, who was the son of a Chicago banking family. And on his twenty-first birthday he received\na nightclub from his parents, called, The Limelite. He just kept coming back and talking to me,\nand we just became really... friends. We\u2019d occasionally go out at night and he would bring his\ndate and I would bring a date, and had a very nice relationship. And then he came back later on,\nand he said, \u201cI have to leave my place, and there are three apartments in the nightclub. I just hate\nto leave the place unattended. Would you mind moving into one of the apartments? You can just\nstay there, and when I come back we can just share apartments, and no problem.\u201d Well, who'd...\nwho would refuse a free apartment? I moved into the Limelite apartment, and when he came\nback in December to open it that year, he said to me, \u201cLook, I desperately need somebody that I\ncan trust, to be the cashier. How would you like to work for me?\u201d He said, \u201cI double your\nsalary.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I would do that, but I am very loyal to my boss, whom I love dearly\nand I just... I just can\u2019t leave.\u201d He said, \u201cOh, this is America. We don\u2019t have to worry about that.\nI'll take care of that, P\u2019Il talk to him.\u201d He said, \u201cYou know, Robert, here, we don\u2019t even show up\nwhen we leave, we just call and say, send my check somewhere.\u201d He says, \u201cThere\u2019s no loyalty\nhere.\u201d I said, \u201cNo? You want me to be loyal to you.\u201d The conversation went on and on and on\nand I said, \u201cWell, I just cannot go to my friend, Kurt Breznits and say, \u2018I am leaving,\u2019 because\nyou double my salary.\u201d But the truth is, I needed money very badly to go back to school. That\nwas my aim, that once I mastered the language, I would go back to school. So, by the... I went to\nwork next day, and my boss and friend, Kurt Breznits was laughing and said, \u201cRobert, you don\u2019t\nhave to have these problems in this country. This is not Europe, and not only that, I would be\ndelighted if you can make twice as much money as you made here. I can\u2019t afford that salary.\u201d\nBut I said, \u201cBut we were such good friends.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, from now on, as long as you\u2019re in\nAspen, every Friday night, we will have dinner in my family home.\u201d So... and we did that, just\nevery Friday, I usually work late Fridays, so they had an early dinner, just so I can come. And we\nhad dinner together and talked a great deal. And we saw each other other nights too, but that\nproblem was solved, but I could never understand this distance that is between employees and\nemployers. I\u2019m still, even in my old days, as a high school teacher and all this, I would have been\nvery hesitant to go and report to somebody that I found a better place and I want to leave. I know\nit\u2019s silly, but 1t was just pounded into me that you are loyal. And so I worked for the Limelite,\nwhich became a very well-known nightclub those days, with a lot of folk singers, as that was the\ntime when the Kingston Trio and all the others became famous and it was the... you know, the\ngreat time of folk singing. Pete Seeger and all the rest, the... most of them came to this nightclub.\nAnd eventually, from cashier, I was promoted and eventually I ended up managing the place.\nAnd then my friend and boss, Sheldon Rich, became lucky, because his hated nightclub was\nsold. He could sell it to a group of folksingers who were singing there, three, four people, and\nthey formed a group called \u201cThe Limeliters,\u201d named after the club, became famous, and now\nthey could buy the club from him. So, he sold the club, and I became the employee of the group,\nand... up until 1959, when I left. But I maintained relations with one of the group, and his family.\nThese are people who still very much around today, you know, the four. And one of them, Glenn\nYarbrough, who was my friend, 1s still producing CD\u2019s.",
        "Q: And you decided... so your motivation to leave was really that you wanted to get in... to continue\nyour education? Was that...",
        "A: Yes, I knew that living in a tourist place, I knew that I would never have, probably, the money to\ngo out on my own, because every year, buying a place, and setting up some kind of a business,\nwas more and more expensive. As Aspen became more and more fashionable, everything\nbecame more expensive. Besides, I had no interest in opening a business. I always thought of\nmyself as an educator. I wanted to go back to school, and luckily, I got together with some\nadventuresome kids, and they told me about Alaska. They said that in Alaska you can make a lot\nof money and it\u2019s fascinating, and it\u2019s beautiful. And I loved to travel, so it was just a spur of a\nmoment when I decided that at the end of the season, around April, I would go and follow them\nto Alaska, and would try to make money, and then, eventually, that fall, I was going back to\nschool in Fresno.",
        "Q: Why Fresno? Why Fresno?",
        "A: Why Fresno? Yeah, people always ask me this question, because I\u2019m the most unlikely person to\nend up in a central California town of practically no distinction. Hundred, hundred ten degrees\nheat. Why Fresno? Because they were the only ones, back those days, who answered my letters...\nnot giving me a scholarship, because I had trouble getting my records together from Hungary. It\nwas against the law, at that time, to send anything out, and I had to wait for my parents to find an\nopportunity to send it out with somebody. And so, I just... a college had to accept me on my\nword, and apparently they were afraid to do that. But Fresno said okay, you can come, spend a\nsemester, we\u2019ll find out how you function here, and then we will determine your status, based on\nthat. And we cannot give you a scholarship, but we can assure you about the National Defense\nScholarship, which was given to people who eventually end up in education. And so I applied for\nthat, and I got a National Defense loan, excuse me, not scholarship. That\u2019s what it was called\nback then. And I received that loan, and so eventually, after Alaska, I ended... I ended up in\nFresno. And of course, that was another eye opener, another piece of America that was very\nunknown to me. And it was a little bit of a crazy town, with... Fresno is the center of the\nArmenian population in America. And they were... I hit it off with them extremely well, no\nproblem, until they found out that I am writing my master thesis on Turko-American relations in\n1918-1920, and that was the time when the Armenians were persecuted terribly. And of course,\nno nation 1s all bad, no nation 1s all good. And of course, when they were reading a little bit of\nmy thesis, they found out that I was very sympathetic to Kemal Ataturk. Of course, I condemned\nthe method of getting rid of Armenians, but I was... I found some goodness. So we had some\nlittle differences, but all in all, I liked the people in Fresno. I liked them. I had a lot of foreign,\nforeign students, colleagues in the college and it was probably easier for me to navigate there,\nthan if I had gone to a big institution, where I would have been just a strange fish. Here I had a\nchance to talk to professors. It was just a very relaxed atmosphere.",
        "Q: Were you feeling surprised that you\u2019d been to several very different places in the country, with\nvery different atmospheres. Were you surprised at how much variation there was in this country,\nthat you had kind of come to expecting a certain, maybe...",
        "A: Uniformity.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I reported back, I remember to my relatives, and parents, I said, \u201cThis is not a country, this\nis a continent.\u201d I said, \u201cDon\u2019t think in terms of a country, this is a continent.\u201d It\u2019s... 1t will be that\nway for a long, long time, and I think it still is. When I travel, in spite of the uniformity that\nmodern age brings, you can still see that it is... it\u2019Il take a long time, and perhaps it shouldn\u2019t,\nperhaps this is the way it should be, that we still have areas that... like you can open your eyes\nand realize that you are not in Chicago, or not in New York. And hope that they will keep it this\nway.",
        "Q: Well, you talked a little bit, in your first interview about what happened then, and how you...\nhow you had gone from... it was after you got your Master\u2019s degree, you went from Fresno to\nteaching, in a special ed school, in Marin county, and you mentioned you had a... you had\nwanted to go there because you had girlfriend in the area. And do you want to say anything more\nabout that time, or do you want to go on to saying something about... I\u2019d be interested in hearing\nhow you met Jan and what... kind of how your relationship grew, and was built, and whether...\nand what she knew about your past and what you talked... I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Why\ndon\u2019t...",
        "A: No, that\u2019s okay.",
        "Q: ... you answer my first question first.",
        "A: Yeah, well, the... when I arrived at the Bay Area, for me that was just incredible. I practically\npinched myself every morning when I woke up and I saw the sun and looked around, and the\nscenery. I just couldn\u2019t believe that I was that lucky. I just couldn\u2019t find words to describe it to\nmy parents, the beauty of the area and the very uniqueness that the San Francisco Bay Area had\nfor me. And still, it holds just a fascination. It\u2019s almost like Europe in the United States, when I\nwalked the streets of San Francisco. I lived in Tiburon... Belvedere... no, Tiburon, I\u2019m sorry. I\nlived in Tiburon, Belvedere is just next door, which at that time was affordable for a bachelor\nschoolteacher like myself. Today, of course, it would be impossible. And I had a nice little\napartment in a duplex, overlooking what they call Raccoon Straight. And these are small, little\nislands in the bay. The sailboats were going back and forth all day. Tourists, you know, boats,\nand it was just a very, very picturesque environment. The type of people I associated with,\nmainly through school, through my job, were very pleasant. Most of them were very young, and\nwe did a lot of things together. I also had plenty of opportunity, of course, to go on my own. And\nthose days, I just was a restless spirit. I had a tendency to walk down, for example, at night, and\nsee the streets... the lights of San Francisco, and just feel that there is something going on in the\ncity that I\u2019m not part of, and I just have to hop into my car and go there. And I did that, and it\nwas then fifteen minutes, twenty minutes, I was in the city, going around. And so then, I was\nwalking around and I was happy, and I did a couple of things. And then I looked back and I saw\nthe lights of Belvedere or Tiburon or Sausalito, and I felt that there... something must be going\non and I\u2019m not part of it, so I hopped in my car and went back. So I was just restlessly looking\nfor that unknown beauty which really was just around me, all over. And I loved to hike up on\nMount Tamalpais. Mill Valley, all those communities were very unique to me, and I thought I\nwould live my life here, probably forever.",
        "Q: What year was it? What year was it when you arrived?",
        "A: 1961. And, as I mentioned previously, the only job I could get here was... teaching mentally\nretarded students, but I didn\u2019t mind, because I thought of the old Hungarian proverb that said for\nany... for something that you like, you would even let people chop wood on your back, and I\nstrongly believe in this. And so, I just... I didn\u2019t really consider teaching these children a great\ndeal different than teaching regular children. As a matter of fact, in certain aspects, in certain\nsense, it was even easier because they were so loyal and devoted to you. Naturally, there were\nsome problems with emotionally disturbed kids, who were in this group, too. But basically, it\nwas easy, because of their love and devotion. And I stayed in it for ten years, and after ten years,\nI honestly said to myself, I\u2019m burned out, I have nothing more to give, and this is when I\nreturned to regulating... teaching so-called normal children, if there is such thing. And my wife,\nyeah, I met my wife at a teacher\u2019s meeting, and our superiors, our administrators, were a rather\nstrange bunch of people, who had sometimes very unreasonable requests, and it had nothing to\ndo with education, such as we should have two pairs of shoes in our drawers, so we would never\nhave dusty shoes. And saying this to people who had to go out in the playground almost every\nhour, I mean it was strange. And they criticized the way we dressed or what we said, or we\nlooked, and they didn\u2019t much do it to me, but to... because I was a man, and I was the only man\non the faculty of the county, but mainly to women. And... so I met my wife and at that time she\nwas married with three children. And she struck me as a kind of a person who doesn\u2019t really\nwant others to know much about her. And I found out later there was a reason for that. Then...\nand we just discussed things, and I in my mind said, \u201cOh, this lady\u2019s quite cold.\u201d That was my\nfirst impression. And never bothered really much. But, our path crossed at these meetings, and\neventually, she was writing some kind of a publication for mentally retarded teachers, and she\ncalled me up, and...",
        "Q: Mentally retarded teachers, or students?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry. No, teachers of retarded students. And she called me up and she wanted my advice in\nsomething, which I still maintain, even up today, it was just a device to strike of...\nEnd of Tape 8, Side B\nTape 9, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Robert Holczer.",
        "A: Yeah, and as I was saying, first, I was not really very impressed, because she was not very warm.\nAnd then the relationship changed after her phone call, when she asked for some help, because I\nthought if a woman is really cold and reserved, she wouldn\u2019t call me and ask for help. And so I\ncalled her back and we started to chat, and from there on, occasionally, we called each other. But\nwe never talked about personal things, and so, the whole thing kind of petered out. And then,\nlater, a year or two years later, I was invited to a party, and to one of our colleagues, and he said,\n\u201cOh, by the way, Jan got a divorce. She is divorced, and she looks good.\u201d And according to...\nexcuse me... according to Jan, I said, \u201cWow,\u201d which I deny. I never said such thing. But anyway,\nthis, or whatever I did, or said, they considered it some kind of a sign for me that I would like to\nsee her. So they invited her and kind of matched us together one evening, and we hit it off just\nright. And from there on, I began to see her more often, and eventually, we just decided that this\nwas a pretty serious relationship. But I was thirty-seven, thirty-six and a bachelor, and I just was\nnot going to get married without giving it some thought. So, I did what my previous girlfriend\ndid, and signed up for one year to go and teach for the Army in Germany. And I arrived there,\nand I spent a year in Germany, and that year convinced me that yes, that she would be the right\nperson for me, so I came home. And we got married on Mount Tamalpais, on the top of Mount\nTamalpais, the mountain I loved to hike around, and the mountain we both saw every day,\ncoming and going to school.",
        "Q: How old were her children at that point?",
        "A: Five, six and eight.",
        "Q: Did they ask you about your experiences during the war at some point, or did you tell... did they\nknow anything about your history?",
        "A: Interestingly, they were more interested then, than they are now. As little children, they kept\nasking me a lot, and these days, as adults, if we meet, maybe they fear they knew... they heard\neverything. But I am surprised that my sons, who are writing all the time, just as a pastime, never\nreally ask any questions. And they are around movies concerning the Holocaust and... back those\ndays. But no. But back then yes, yes, and I told them quite a bit, and it was not really that much\nabout the Holocaust. They were too little, and I didn\u2019t want to, of course, cause nightmares, but it\nwas mainly just life, what was life when I grew up and what I... the things I did, and they were\nfascinated by my accent, and they begged us to have another child, so he or she could have an\naccent. They thought that a baby is going to be born with an accent. And they laughed at my\nmistakes that I made, because sometimes they were really funny. And inadvertently, I did say\ncertain things that just sounded very strange, and still are a saying in the family.",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "A: Pardon me? Such as, I... for a long time, I thought that fungus is really fangus, and so everybody\ncalled fungus a fangus. Once I told them something about a lawyer, and I... instead of lawyer, I\nkept saying liar. And they couldn\u2019t understand, and in the end they said, the difference is of no...\nwhen I learn, I said, \u201cGod, there is no difference, lawyers, liars, what\u2019s the difference?\u201d And so\nthere were many cute episodes. Drift and draft, I remember I had trouble distinguishing that.\n\u201cClose the... close the door, because there is a drift.\u201d And so ever since, everybody called it drift\nand not draft.",
        "Q: What about Jan? Did you talk with Jan about your much... in the early times of your getting to\nknow each other, about your experiences during the Holocaust, and about just the Holocaust in\ngeneral?",
        "A: Yes. There is no problem there. She really wanted to know everything and I told her everything.\nAnd she read a great deal. And, as a matter of fact, she is my police woman, because she doesn\u2019t\nallow me to watch anything concerning the Holocaust on television, because she says I have such\nnightmares that she doesn\u2019t want to wake me up and it just... too much trouble. But I was amazed\nthat after we got married, how much time she... and effort she spent, and energy in reading books\non Jewish history, and then, of course, going into her favorite theme, cookbooks. She has Jewish\ncookbooks and she knows more about Jewish cooking and holidays, and... so today when\nsomebody ask me about some Jewish custom or holiday or something, I always refer them to her,\nbecause she knows a lot more about it than I do. I just, because of my indifference to religion, I\njust never really give it too much thought, of learning much about holidays and the background,\nbut she did. And of course, there was never any question about conversion, anything like this,\nbecause I myself, I was not practicing.",
        "Q: How... was her family accepting of you?",
        "A: Yes, and the reason was, by the time we got married, the person who probably wouldn\u2019t have\nliked me, because he was a rabid anti-Semite, her father, was gone. Her mother was a very\ntolerant person, but she was dead, too, by the time we got married. So, the only relatives around\nthat she had, was her brother and her sister, who are 20\"-Century human beings, and they are\nvery, very tolerant, and very progressive people.",
        "Q: Okay, so you stayed in the Bay Area until 1974, is that right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. What did you think of... were you aware of what was going on with the... with the\nSummer of Love, and the Free Speech Movement and all that stuff that was happening in\nBerkeley, and San Francisco in the late sixties?",
        "A: Oh yes. By the time I arrived in the Bay Area, and even before that, as soon as I could\nunderstand and speak some English, I became involved in the social and political scene very\nmuch. For example, I remember when I... even before I settled in the Bay Area, I would come up\nfor the weekend and would go down, just by myself, to North Beach, in San Francisco, to the\nbeatnik coffeehouses, and just listen, or converse sometimes with people. I really enjoyed the\nbeatnik era. I liked those people, they were very introspective and intelligent. There was kind of\na subdued, refined attitude about them that I appreciated. Occasionally, when somebody played\nthe piano, they were sipping the coffee and philosophizing, just a great time, I think, for\nliterature, poetry reading. They were all part of the scene. That truly was an interesting chapter in\nmy life, going to North Beach. Then, later on, of course, after we were married, after I came back\nfrom Europe, from my one-year stint with the Army, which was in 1966, that is when everything\nstarted, especially the Vietnam War flared up. And our family was very much involved in that.\nWe were going over to the city, and I remember making big signs. My wife joined the Another\nMother for Peace movement. We were demonstrating, and there was a very cute episode that\nhappened to us. She usually sewed a lot for herself and for the children, and bought a very nice,\nflowery material to make a dress. And we went to a big demonstration over in Berkeley, and had\nto make our own signs. And we were getting the signs ready and all of a sudden, we look down\non our youngest son, Kevin\u2019s sign, and what did we see? A beautiful flower, of some textile, and\nif we looked at it, then we realized it was her dress material that she had bought. He was so\nfascinated by the pattern, and he needed flowers, because that was the theme of the\ndemonstration, you had to have flowers on your signs, that he didn\u2019t think twice, and he was\ncutting out the flowers from... what... we didn\u2019t know what to do about it, and then we decided\njust to talk to him, that this was not really the proper thing to do, but he didn\u2019t get punished. So\nthat was Vietnam. My sister-in-law wrote to, for example, to Lyndon Johnson and told him that\nshe fears that he should not run again. And interestingly, about three days later, he came out and\nhe announced that he would not run. So that... we felt that the family can take some credit for\nthat decision. But, we, we tried to have our children go and learn a lot about the times where we\nlived in, because we realized that they were very exciting times, very unique times. And perhaps,\nI always thought later on in their lives, life will be much duller than it was back then. We also\nlived, by that time, in Inverness, 1n an area that was in the center of all these cults, and rock\nbands and so the kids were exposed to all these people and spent sometimes days, just listening\nto their music, up in the hills. It had advantages, it had disadvantages. The disadvantage in this\nrespect was that, no matter what parents would say to their children, they always had a place to\ngo and because these rock groups had open house, you could help yourself at the fridge, or\nwhatever, eating, or no matter how young you were, you were also welcome to dip into the pot\nand smoke it. And so it was in a... in the sense, difficult. And many of our children in the area,\nwere runaways. They would occasionally run away because that was just the style.",
        "Q: During that time, did you... were you aware of how Americans in general thought about the\nHolocaust and Holocaust survivors, and some of the stereotypes that were attached to them? And\ndid you think of yourself as a Holocaust survivor, and how were you... how were you relating to\nthe culture at large, in terms of that kind of identity?",
        "A: Mm-hm. Now that is a very surprising question, because I never really thought about it, but as\nyou were asking me, I realize I didn\u2019t really think much about myself any more, as a Holocaust\nsurvivor. I just thought much as a member of the scene, so to speak. I was more involved in what\nis happening in America, and thought more about it day by day, than to think too much, to give\ntoo much thought about the past. So, in this respect, it was good, because one should not\nconstantly be visited by ghosts. So I think it, it was a good thing for me, in this respect. And you\nknow, I was part of the whole story then, and, rather, an American fighting to end the war, and\nbring justice to people who were oppressed.",
        "Q: But you did have nightmares about the past, you mentioned that.",
        "A: Only... only it usually... it was provoked by watching some television story, or reading\nsomething in the newspaper. Otherwise, they were going away, they were becoming distant.",
        "Q: What about when you lived in Germany and you\u2019re... you\u2019re there in this nation that had\nperpetrated these crimes, and people presumably were much more aware of the history there,\nthan your acquaintances had been when you lived in the States. Was it a bigger issue that The\nHolocaust? Was it more of a... did 1t have more of a place in your life and did you talk about it\nwith people?",
        "A: The... now, this is a very complex story. When we lived in Germany, which was from 1974 to\n1993, I would say most of the time, when there was a West Germany and East Germany, the\nHolocaust was not a big problem, mainly because the West Germans were bringing it into the\nopen. It was not something hushed up under the rug. There were discussions about it in schools. I\nspoke about it to high school students, mainly. The whole... the whole problem with the\nHolocaust and the way Germans would look at it, really started after the Unification. Now, I\nmust also say that there weren\u2019t too many people who were alive in World War II, by this time.\nBecause I was fifteen when the war ended, and I am seventy now, almost. And so, most people\nare dead, who were in World War II. Now of course, it doesn\u2019t mean that Fascism as such, is\ndead, or was even... was dead. Yes, I heard anti-Semitic remarks, and sometimes, when I felt that\nit was the proper thing to do, I responded, and sometimes when I looked at the person, and I\nrealize it was a primitive old idiot, there was no reason to say anything. It would have been\ntotally superfluous to provoke anything, because it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference. I rather\nconcentrated on talking to people of the middle and the younger generation. And I found that\nintellectually, at least, they understood what was the Holocaust. They were very ashamed and\nsorry about it, and I felt no urge to drill in, with young people especially. I felt that they were\nprogressive enough. The younger German generation amazed me, because I think they are very\nprogressive, and I think they see history in the right light. How... all this changed after the\nunification, because you had now Eastern Germany joining. A country that was never taught\nproper history, where the Holocaust, oh well, only West Germans were responsible for the\nHolocaust, because all the Nazis, according to East Germany, were in West Germany. So, those\npeople had no background, and they had... they were not prepared for this historical fact and they\ndenied it. And this is why the skinhead movement and all the neo-Fascist organizations,\nbasically, come from, East Germany, even today. Add to this the usual reasons for Fascism and\nanti-Semitism, a very high unemployment and very bad economic conditions and the fact that\nunification didn\u2019t bring immediate remedies to all their problems. So they had to again go back\nand blame the old scapegoat, the Jews, in spite of the fact that there aren\u2019t too many. So, since\nthey couldn\u2019t attack many who are living among them, they went back to the past.",
        "Q: You were living in Frankfurt at the time that the Wall... that the Berlin Wall came down?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Do you... Did you foresee any of this? Did you, at the time... what were your emotions at the\ntime, and your thoughts at the time that the Wall came down and you were seeing the... that there\nwas this... unification was going to be happening?",
        "A: Oh, I think that everybody basically felt the same, that we lived truly in a moment of history that\nis... has just very, very few companions. That it was something extraordinary. And now, just a\ncouple of years before, nobody would have thought that in our lifetime, something like this will\nhappen. But of course, after the Soviet regime collapsed, then, then, it was inevitable. It still, it\nwas a surprise, and it was naturally something that will always be in my mind, because just a few\nweeks before, my granddaughter, who was about fifteen at that time, came to Europe and we\nwent to the Wall in Berlin, and we had pictures of her just standing by, and I was telling her that\nyou can bring back your children here, probably, and maybe even your grandchildren one day,\nand the Wall will still be here. And so, no, nobody anticipated such a rapid disintegration.",
        "Q: Did your... have you talked to your grandchildren about... have they been interested in a... in\nyour experiences during the Holocaust, or ask you questions about...",
        "A: Yes, the... my granddaughter who 1s twenty-four... I\u2019m sorry, twenty-four? No, no, twenty-two, I\ntalk to her, she knows quite a bit about the Holocaust. And we usually go together to movies, not\nnecessarily related to the Holocaust but sometimes do, like, we saw, \u201cLife is Beautiful\u201d together,\nand I make a point to take her to movies that deal with history... modern history, or the\nHolocaust, so we can talk about it. I want her to know everything. The, the... I have two\ngrandsons and I took them too, to the Holocaust Museum. And they are at the... they were at the\nage, they went through too fast for my taste, but I hope one day they will go back and they will\nslow down. And the other... grandchildren, or potential grandchildren, are still too young to say\nanything.",
        "Q: So, when you were in Germany, you were teaching... were you teaching American students?",
        "A: Yes, I was teaching a regular American high school, where The American Army and the\nAmerican diplomat\u2019s kids would go. Just like any other high school. We had a... that was a\nschool district, just like an American school district. It was funded by the same way, and\noperated the same way and everything was the same, only the scene was Frankfurt, Germany.",
        "Q: Did you know... did you have other Jewish friends in Germany at the time who had been through\nthe Holocaust?",
        "A: No, no, I did not have any. I had some German friends and we talked about the Holocaust, and\nthey knew about me, but it... we never really made it into a big deal, and I never really wanted to\nmake it a big deal, I didn\u2019t want them to think that I solely exist and maintain the friendship to\nkind of pound in the subject. They knew about me, they knew about my life, and we discussed it\nin... on very civil terms, and I knew that they were genuinely interested and sorry for what\nhappened. But, other than that, no, no, I did not have any other... occasionally, my high school\nteacher friend, the German couple, they invited me to their schools, to talk. And Germans\namazed me because, in our house, for example, there was a lady who was a farmer\u2019s daughter,\nand she was in a... kind of a mid-level managerial job with a pharmaceutical company and she\nhad constantly friends from Israel, and she was not Jewish. I had another... I have another very\nold friend in Germany, I met back in the early 1960\u2019s, and we have been friends ever since, and\nshe has friends constantly visiting her from Israel. She\u2019s also not Jewish. So, there\u2019s a lot of\ncontact between Israel and Germany, and well, I don\u2019t know whether this 1s a result of a... of a\nbad conscience or something, but certainly you cannot hold somebody who was not even alive at\nthat time responsible for anything that happened. No, that would be unreasonable. But it\u2019s not...\ntoday, it\u2019s not a big issue. It is a sad fact of history, especially in the western part of Germany.",
        "Q: Did you have thoughts at that time, of where you wanted to stay, whether you wanted to stay in\nGermany and settle there, and make your home there, or did you picture coming back to the\nUnited States at some point?",
        "A: Oh, I could have stayed in Germany, by the sheer coincidence of my name, which is a German\nname and the fact that I was, for a few month, a German citizen, in World War II. And that was\njust for a few months, so I didn\u2019t include in any citizenship, just by a mistake and because of the\nstrange happenings of the times. They classified me as German in Hungary, and temporarily we\nwere considered Germans, and of course the whole thing was... oh, they only lasted for a few\nmonth when they found out who we were. But that little episode and my name, and the fact that\nthe reason the Hungarians tossed us out, besides being Jewish, they discovered that one of my\ngreat-grandparents was born in what is called Sudetenland, which was a part of German speaking\nCzechoslovakia, which was at that time, the Austro-Hungarian empire, and all back, it all\nconnects together, and it all added up to some very tragic events, because we were not\nconsidered Hungarians, and my grandfather was deported to Auschwitz, not because he was\nJewish, but because of they said he was a foreigner. He could not prove that his grandfather was\na Hungarian, which was not true. But because of this, and other reasons, I could have gotten\nGerman citizenship. I could have gotten, probably, a great deal of money that way, because of\nwhat happened to my family in World War II, and all this, but I never had, for a second, a\nthought. I mean, how can I think about settling in Germany, and taking German citizenship?\nThere are so many reasons why I shouldn\u2019t have done this, right? Number one is an emotional\nthing, a rational thing to... that would be a little bit too much for me to bear. Second is that I have\nan American family, and my wife was ready to return to the United States. There no way would\nshe have stayed in Europe with me. So, I knew that this was temporary, and I enjoyed while it\nlasted.\nEnd of Tape 9, Side A\nTape 9, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape two, side B of an interview with Robert Holczer. Do you want to say anything else\nabout Germany before we go on?",
        "A: I just want to say that I know that, for the purpose of the interview, you\u2019re interested in anti-\nSemitism and where did I run into the most, and I must say that the country where I ran into the\nmost anti-Semitic and Fascist remarks, and... is Austria. And I was amazed that the... so many\nyears after the war, I don\u2019t see a lot of changes. That here is a country that, unlike Germany, was\nconsidered a victim of Fascism, which of course, it was not, and played this role very\nsuccessfully. And today, it is just terrible. It\u2019s, the right wing elements are all over it. And you\ncan go to any pub and just wait until they have a few drinks, and there will be some talk about\nthe good old days. So, no, I thought Germany dealt with the problem much, much better than\nAustria.",
        "Q: So you came to the U.S. in 1993, you returned. Did you come straight to Kentucky?",
        "A: Yes, yes, we came here straight from Frankfurt, Germany, we landed in Lexington. And by that\ntime, we had a little home, because my brother and sister-in-law, who own Briarbrook Farm, had\ncalled us two years before, and asked us if we would like to buy a home here for a very, very\nlittle money, and that sounded just like a good investment. My wife, of course, immediately\nknew it was going to be our home. I just considered maybe just an investment. We bought it, and\nthen slowly, she worked on me to retire here. Because I had no intention to come here. I wanted\nto be near a big city and I loved California. And she insisted that she did not want to go back to\nCalifornia, even though she lived all her American life there, and so she won. Well, she followed\nme to Europe for twenty years, and I thought it is proper to honor her wishes and whatever they\nwere, but basically, she wanted to be close to her sister and vice-versa, so we came here, and at\nleast we could be in driving distance, within a day, to our daughter in Virginia and to our son and\nher... and his family in Nashville. So, that was an... also another consideration.",
        "Q: Did you have any preconceived notions about Kentucky in general? Did you consider it to be\nkind of a backwards place, or did you have... had you heard any stereotypes about it?",
        "A: Well, we used to visit here, almost every summer when... while we were in Europe, every second\nsummer or so, we would come back and stop here, too, for a few days. And so I could... I was\nalways very defiant when it came to this place, I just... I never really opened my eyes as to what\nis here, rather would sulk so... not in a very obvious way, but call it an inside sulker. That\u2019s what\nI was, sitting on the couch during the day, and occasionally complaining that there is really not\nmuch to do here. And this was going on, I was... I never really came here with great enthusiasm.\nAs I put it to my wife, an area that doesn\u2019t even have sidewalks in town, to walk around, what\nam I going to do there? And also the fences bothered me, that you can\u2019t go anywhere, everything\nis fenced in. And how can you take your mountain bike and, and bike somewhere? You run into\na fence within minutes. And I was just not very much for settling here. And then, I knew that she\nwas very insistent, and the last time we were visiting here, I think it was in \u201991, that was shortly\nafter we bought that little house... people were still living 1n it, the partners of the farm, and I was\nwalking around, and all of a sudden, the... my past caught up with me, because I spent a great\ndeal, as a young kid, out in nature, and I loved the smells and the... I loved the sight of a tree, the\nsmell of the grass. And all of a sudden, I began to smell and look at the very things that were so\ndear to me when I was little and I was constantly hiking with my friends. And I realized that this\nis not a bad place, and besides, it was so peaceful. At night there was no noise. And so I came\nback and the whole family was around because they were... we were celebrating our wedding\nanniversary. And I said, \u201cI want to say something to you.\u201d I said, \u201cI just made up my mind, I can\nlive here very well.\u201d And that was the end. All my sulking went away, all my reservations went\naway. I knew I was not going to come to the middle of New York City. I knew that there is not\ngoing to be any half-timbered houses when I walk into Paris. But I thought that I can make the\nbest of it, and that I can live here.",
        "Q: Did you have concerns culturally, what it would be like?",
        "A: Yes, that was my main concern. I knew that this is a beautiful state and if I drive an hour from\nhere, I can start hiking and it is really an... an open range, but culturally, I had reservations and I\nstill have reservations. I feel a little... I would have really felt much worse, perhaps twenty, thirty\nyears ago, but at the time when television brings you, especially the educational channel and the\nhistory channel and Discovery and there are so many channels now that you can get, that\nbrings... they bring a lot of good knowledgeable stuff, and this is one thing. Second, of course,\nthe internet connects you with the world. So, one is not so isolated any more. Still, I am still\nyearning to go to a town where the streets are crowded. I don\u2019t want to live on a crowded street\nall the time, but sometimes, and I want to go to a sidewalk caf\u00e9, and I want to eat some different\nfood that doesn\u2019t taste the same, and just converse with people. I feel that there is, right now in\nthis country, there 1s great suspicion. You just can\u2019t walk up to people and start talking. And\nKentucky is even better off in this respect than any other state, probably, or most other states. It\njust... there is always that suspicion in a person\u2019s mind, based on all the stories that we hear day\nby day by day by day, of violence. Violence really kind of poisoned the atmosphere in this\ncountry a great deal, and I\u2019m very sensitive to that. So, I would love to just go to a park and sit\non a bench sometimes, and just talk to strangers, as I used to when I was younger. But that\u2019s\nimpossible. We don\u2019t go to the park to begin with, because there are no... not many parks, and\nthere aren\u2019t... not too many people, if you find a park. And when it gets dark, of course, you clear\nout, and you just don\u2019t have that kind of a life, that vibrant life that you find still in European\ncities.",
        "Q: Do you... Have you formed relationships with people just in the community in Paris? Neighbors,\ndo you spend time 1n, in that town?",
        "A: Well, with neighbors, I just don\u2019t have that much with... in common. One neighbor next to our\nfarm is a hog farmer, and I don\u2019t know anything about hogs and he doesn\u2019t seem to be interested\nin many other things. And the others are way down. I go to Paris to take care of some business\nthat is necessary, post office or shopping, and this and that. And my hobbies... one of my hobbies\nis antiques, so I know the people who are in the antique business in Paris, and I can go in and\nspend some time and talk to them. But I do not have a close friend. Now my... however, my\nassociation with the so-called master gardeners association in Lexington brought me together\nwith people. I do volunteer work for the arboretum 1n season, every week, and so... one day, and\nthese are the people, usually, that I am the closest to, because we have a common interest,\ngardening. We spend time together, we have meetings. And after the season is over, we continue\nseeing each other. So, yes, but since I came back... and that has also something to do, of course,\nwith my age, too... I have not found here, anyone that I can call a friend.",
        "Q: Do you... do people ask you anything about yourself, or have they reached out to you 1n any\nway\u201d? Do they ask you about your accent, you know, people in town?",
        "A: Yeah, people are funny in this respect. They are interested my accent, and I cannot really say that\nthey are suspicious or they reject me. One man, a young man told me this last year. Said, \u201cYou\nknow, you are much better off than I.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou open your mouth, and everybody says,\n\u2018Oh, what a nice accent, where are you from?\u2019\u201d And he said, \u201cI open my mouth and they say,\n\u2018Hey, you are not from here, are you?\u2019 And you know what they mean,\u201d he says, \u201cthat I\u2019m a\ndamn Yankee.\u201d And I don\u2019t know about this, but all I can say is that nobody has ever reacted\nnegatively toward my accent. I see that sometimes people smile when I talk to them, and I know\nwhy they do it and I consider it a friendly gesture. And that\u2019s about it. The only people I\u2019m really\nmad at, the ones who listen to me for awhile and say, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u2019 Because I know that they\nare putting me on. That... if schoolchildren could understand me, they could, too. But... and\nanother thing that, of course irritates me, when... my hearing is not that good any more, and this\nhas nothing to do with accent and all this, it\u2019s just that some people are very intolerant, and if\nyou ask, you know, \u201cWill you please repeat it?\u201d They just say, \u201cForget it.\u201d And the word forget it\nreally irritates me. But that has nothing to do with accent and being foreign born. Otherwise, I\nfind that people are much friendlier, even with my reservations about being suspicious, much\nfriendlier than they were in some other states that I\u2019ve travelled.",
        "Q: Did you say awhile... maybe the first interview we did, at that time were you working with the\nHistorical Society in Paris, or with the museum? Do you still do that at all, or...",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t do it any more, and frankly, I can\u2019t even come up with a good reason why. Perhaps\nit\u2019s just that I get very busy at home, and the... somehow, the familiar faces that I knew, many of\nthem left and I... it\u2019s very difficult, I think, after a certain age, to make friends and to build kind\nof a circle around yourself. And also when I first joined, the Historical Society was a lot more\nvital than it is now. I think it just settled into a routine life, and it just... I was just not interested\nany more. The museum was established, it\u2019s running smoothly. I don\u2019t think they really need me\nthere any more. So I rather concentrate on the Master Gardener\u2019s Association, where I can do\nsomething, actually work. I am always much happier when I can do physical work, than when I\njust sit around and talk about what to do.",
        "Q: Have you taken a particular interest in Kentucky history since you\u2019ve been here, or in learning\nabout that?",
        "A: I... well, not strictly speaking Kentucky history, but I did take my first class, last year, in the\nhistory of Cincinnati. Cincinnati fascinated me from the very beginning, because when I saw it, I\nsaid, this is the closest thing, around here, to a real city. The others seem like villages, all of\nthem. I can\u2019t think of any place in Kentucky, that to me, looks like an urban environment. And\nthe... most of the places are, you know, just built very quickly and the original downtown...\nunfortunately, Lexington is destroyed, as we know it, and what is left of it is just struggling.\nNow, yeah, Cincinnati, yes. I was so interested in Cincinnati, and Cincinnati\u2019s history, that I took\na class, a whole week Elder Hostel class. I like to take classes with Elder Hostel, and it\u2019s usually\na hands-on class, but this time I made an exception, \u2018cause I wanted to know the history,\nbackground, and more about the area. And it was not just Cincinnati, 1t was northern Kentucky,\ntoo. It was very good. So I\u2019m hoping to do some more. And of course, here and there I read a\nbook about Kentucky. I take some authors who are local and look into their works, and David\nDick lives in the area, and his books... so, Iam. But I am not really an expert on Kentucky\nhistory, I leave this to people who are natives. I just have a kind of a... really a surface interest in\njust the basics.",
        "Q: Do you feel that you can stay here and live here and be at home here for the rest of your life? Is\nthat something you think about?",
        "A: Oh, I settled this already with myself. That\u2019s it. This is my last station. I am here for good, and\nnaturally, this is not a bad place to be, and even though I might... I could think of some other\nplaces where I would rather live, but I am here now, and I make the best of it. So...",
        "Q: It seems like you could, if you look back on... on your whole life and where you came from and\nwhat your experiences have been, that you could say to yourself that this was almost the last...\nlast place that you would have landed. You think?",
        "A: Yes. I wouldn\u2019t have chosen it, back thirty or forty years ago, no way. Because at that time I still\nwas more, somehow I felt that I... that there was still a great deal to discover. And I know that,\nnow that I reached the age, and considering the fact that I have heart problems, that I can\u2019t just\njump around any more. And even though I would love to visit some other corners of the world,\nand our country, I have to take it easy, and this 1s basically a very good point to be. I really like\nto explore more of the eastern part of the United States. That\u2019s a very good place to be, and the\nfact that we lead here, otherwise in kind of a Norman Rockwell type life, with my brother and\nsister-in-law, that here... we have been here for six years... almost six years now, and we never\nhad a conflict, not even a minor one. We eat our meals together quite a bit. We go, usually\ntogether to the theater or a party or something. We do a lot of things together. We are... they are\nour companions, and we are theirs. And so I... considering all this, I am very happy, and at peace.",
        "Q: Have you encountered any anti-Semitism since you\u2019ve been here to Kentucky?",
        "A: No, no. I have never heard anything like this. I think there are so many... so few Jews here. Of\ncourse, that doesn\u2019t mean anything, there are very few Jews left in Poland, and there\u2019s still anti-\nSemitism, but no.",
        "Q: And then you mentioned that you talk... have been talking with school groups.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Will you say something about what that experience is like?",
        "A: Oh that, that is... I do this with great pleasure, because I know that... in this area, there are very\nfew people, probably, who experienced the Holocaust, and even know what it is. And so, one\nschoolteacher started this program in the local schools, and she always invites me, about two,\nthree times a year. And last time, it was a closed circuit television that they put me on, with some\nother classes around Kentucky. And... but most of the time, I just talk to her classes... her\ncombined classes or some other teachers bring in classes, and these are usually kids, thirteen,\nfourteen years old, and I like to talk to them, because that\u2019s how old I was when the real disaster\nhit me. And so I can kind of get down to their level of understanding and explain certain things\nto them. And I find that they are very receptive, very receptive. So, I consider it a mission.",
        "Q: Are these students... is this Bourbon county schools?",
        "A: Yes, Bourbon county school system. I\u2019ve never been to the Paris school system, but it\u2019s Bourbon\ncounty, which is, just basically, geographically speaking, it\u2019s also in the city, they just split, I\ndon\u2019t know why. And so I talk to the Bourbon county schools. I spoke to the high school last\nyear, but mainly it\u2019s the middle school.",
        "Q: Do you find that the students are they all familiar with the terminology, the term Holocaust? Do\nthey know... do they have a basic grasp of what happened?",
        "A: The middle school students, because of the teacher\u2019s eagerness to clarify everything, are much\nbetter informed than the high school students. I was amazed. I went to the high school, I... once I\nwent to Berea and talked to the Berea class, and that was the worst. They were just uninterested,\nsleepy people with a professor who, himself, put me asleep. I just couldn\u2019t blame the students, by\nthat time, they were so turned off, that no matter what I did, I could have stripped nude, and it\nwouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference in that class. But the middle-school kids, the junior\nhigh, they are just great to talk to. One girl... just yesterday, I was speaking to a class, and one\nlittle girl stayed behind, and I usually spend about an hour and a half with them. I speak to them\nfor awhile and then let them ask questions. And one little girl was just stay... just stood behind\nand she was waiting for me, waiting for me, when after everybody left, she came up, and she\nhugged me, and she kissed me, and she said, \u201cThis is all... for all the missed loves and kisses that\nyou could not get from your parents during those years.\u201d I thought that was just charming. And\nshe just turned around and left. It was... there was no other, you know, second thought about it.\nAnd so, it was just very, very beautiful.",
        "Q: Have you not... I mean, well, you mentioned you hadn\u2019t experienced anti-Semitism, have you\nexperienced anybody kind of asking you why don\u2019t you go to church, or you know, kind of\nasking you what church do you go to, or just expecting you to be Christian?",
        "A: Yeah, I... that comes around a little bit more often, when the people just cannot comprehend that,\nhow can anybody who doesn\u2019t steal, doesn\u2019t cheat, doesn\u2019t embezzle, has been married for\nthirty-three years, why am I not a church goer? And that is what I have to explain many times to\npeople. Not only that, when I say I\u2019m a non-believer, of course, I think I\u2019m out of their favors.\nAnd... but I try to make a point there, too, that one does not have to go to church and belong to a\nreligion, to lead a decent life. And I say that. I look around and see how many people who go to\nchurch are in the news, beating their wives and embezzling money from the school\u2019s treasury, or\nfrom the county treasury or using highway funds for their own purposes. You don\u2019t have to go.\nYou can set your own rules. So, I do more argument about that than anything else.",
        "Q: Do you tell them that you\u2019re... that you\u2019re Jewish and that that\u2019s part of the reason why?",
        "A: Well, I tell them always. I\u2019m not making any . Iam... I always say, I\u2019m\nJewish, but I am not a Jew... Iam a Jew, but I\u2019m not Jewish. And of course, first, nobody\nunderstands what I\u2019m talking about. And I say, \u201cEthnically speaking, I am a Jew. I come from a\nethnic group called the Semites and one of the subgroups are Jews.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cNow these people\nhave been mixed... intermingling with other people for over a thousand years, and therefore there\nis no such thing as a pure Jew, but then there\u2019s no such thing as a pure anything any more, since\nhistory mixed us up quite successfully. But, when it comes to religion,\u201d I said, \u201ceven though I am\na Jew, my religion is not Jewish. I have no religion.\u201d I said, \u201cI am not... I do not belong to any\norganized religion.\u201d So eventually I think they understand what I mean.",
        "Q: Do you ever get any responses to that? People getting into a conversation, or is that just kind of\nheads nodding, and then...",
        "A: Well, of course there are always those who feel that they can perhaps sway me over. And I\nalways say, \u201cLook, I\u2019m seventy years old, and you have no idea how many people tried, and you\nare just wasting your time,\u201d I said. And so eventually, they see that they are. So they give up and\nmany of them still trust me and keeps talking to me, and there are those who kind of shy away,\nbecause I might, you know, be who knows, the devil, or... you never know what they think of\nyou if you say I\u2019m a non-believer.",

        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t know anybody. And several times, my cardiologist, who is Jewish, and is very\nactive in one of the synagogues in Lexington, mentioned that the rabbi is going to get in touch\nwith me, because he wants me to come and talk to some group within the congregation, but they\nnever contacted me. I really don\u2019t have any connection to any other group.",
        "Q: Do you feel any desire or any interest in having that kind of connection?",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t mind. I\u2019m completely neutral. I am not going out of my way to look for it, and...\nbecause I don\u2019t like to dwell that much upon past. And... but I wouldn\u2019t reject if they... if they\nwould want to establish any contact with me.",
        "Q: You live in a rural area of, you know, central Kentucky, and there are a lot of, I mean, as far as\nother... as far as minority groups, other than the main group, the... probably the main other group\nwould be migrant workers, and I\u2019m interested in just hearing your... your perceptions of how\npeople in the area deal with minority groups, and your observations about... about that, if you\nhave any.",
        "A: I consider this very similar to what was going on in Germany while we lived there. Germany had\nan economic boom in the 1950\u2019s, just like we have now, which meant that the... all the menial\nand dirty jobs were unfilled. Most Germans just wouldn\u2019t want to work in that, and also that they\nneeded more workers than the country actually could produce. So they invited in other\nnationalities as guest workers, that\u2019s what they were called, and they were mainly from Turkey.\nAnd this was back in the 50\u2019s. The German economic miracle produced a migration from\nTurkey, which was legal, completely legal. They had to have documents, they entered, they went\nto work in the factories. Now, today, in 1993... 1999, the economy... the German economy has\nslowed down considerably. These Turkish workers, the original Turkish workers, today are\ngrandparents. They brought their children back then, it was allowed, which was, I think, a very\nnice, humanitarian gesture, because Switzerland, who had the same problem, did not allow\nfamily members to follow. They could go home on vacation, send the money back, but nobody\nwas allowed to... allowed to come. So, the family members came, and you know, one family\nmember then brings another family member, and pretty soon... I think today there are close to\nthree million Turks living in Germany, a country of sixty-five million people. That\u2019s quite a bit,\nand of course, was tremendous resentment by some people to begin with. But the real problem\ncame not while the economic boom was on, the real problem came when it was over, because\nnow you had a lot of people who were already adults, and born in Germany, to Turkish parents,\nand all the rest. So now, here came the problem of what to do with them. Are they citizens, are\nthey not citizens? And welfare, are they qualified for welfare? So, I am afraid of the same thing\nhere. Right now, especially around here, in the Bluegrass, everybody who can think, knows that\nthese illegal... or legal Mexican workers are fulfilling an important job. They are working here in\na job that most other people wouldn\u2019t take. So, nobody has great reservations. When they see... I\nheard that when they see something in the paper, that a thief was arrested, or a murder happened,\nand it is a Spanish name, they do mumble about it, which is natural, I don\u2019t consider this\nextraordinary. But my biggest fear is, what is going to happen when this economic boom ends,\nand here we will be with these people. Now, they are not going to work. If they don\u2019t work, what\nwill happen to them? To their mind? What will happen to those who watch around, and will take\nthe opportunity to do the same as they do in Germany. The skinheads in Germany were burning\ndown the buildings where they lived. People died in fire, they were beaten up on the street, or\nthey were killed. Several, several times this happened. So, I hope that we'd... it doesn\u2019t come to\nthis. I think that the... we need more education, especially in the schools, to make these people\nwelcome. They are here for a reason, they are human beings, and just like anyone else in\nAmerica, they came in by the same rights. If there is illegal immigration, that is not for Kentucky\nto try to stop it, because we can\u2019t, it has to be stopped down on the border, that\u2019s not our\nproblem. But those who are here, they are here. So what are you going to do? But the churches,\nthe schools, any institution, I think should work together to make sure that people know that\nthese are human beings, these are not some alien group that is here only temporarily. They are\nnot here temporarily.",
        "Q: Do you draw... when you think about this issue, does you mind draw parallels to your own\nexperience, and experience of Jews in Europe? I mean, even though it\u2019s not... I mean, with the\nJews in Europe, they had been residents for hundreds and hundreds of years and they certainly\nbelonged there, but... but the idea of some kind of economic problems making one majority\ngroup turn against a minority group and persecuting them. Do you think that makes you\nparticularly...",
        "A: Yeah, yes...",
        "Q: ... Sensitive?",
        "A: ... yeah, oh, in this... in this respect, there is a comparison. I... definitely, that... they would be\nmade scapegoats, the minute the chips begin to fall. But I don\u2019t think that in America we ever\nhave a danger of the death camps or concentration camps any more. I know that we had them, of\ncourse, on a much, much smaller and different scale, for the Japanese Americans in the West\ncoast, but I don\u2019t think that would ever come to this. I\u2019m more afraid of individual treatment of\nthese people.",
        "Q: Incidents like skinheads getting...",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, and I would like to see that we deal in school, we deal with them realistically,\nthat we let their children come to school without any reservation, because children in the world\neverywhere, makes no difference where they come from, where they go, they should be in\nschool. And number two 1s that we do not go overboard with bilingual education. These kids\nknow how to speak Spanish, they should know how to speak English, and even the families, I\nthink, would appreciate the fact, that we would just throw them into an English speaking class,\nand I can guarantee that in three months, they would speak English, without even an accent.",
        "Q: The one thing that I... that I missed asking was about your parents. I... you mentioned, maybe in\nthe last interview, that they came to the States, to visit for your wedding.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Not for my wedding.",
        "Q: Not for your wedding?",
        "A: Mm-mm, no.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: They came in 1967 to visit. They were here, I think, six weeks or seven weeks. And my mother,\nof course, would have loved to stay here. My father, he was just used to his life in Budapest, and\nhe was very anxious, eventually, to get back. So there was no question that they would stay here.\nAnd my father, who has always been around little businesses in his life, he did the usual thing\nthat people at that time did, from Eastern Europe, traveling to the West, they were constantly\ncounting what... certain prices on merchandise, it would cost in Hungary, in Hungarian money. I\nmean, I was thinking about getting him a little calculator, but he was so fast in his head, he\nwould beat any calculator. So, his favorite place... and we lived in California when they were\nwith us, was Long\u2019s Drugstore, which is the equivalent of any big drugstore chain in our area.\nAnd he... he would just... if we did something, the rest of the family, with my mother, and he did\nnot want to be part of it, he just said, \u201cOh, just drop me at Long\u2019s Drugstore,\u201d and he would\nspend an entire day at Long\u2019s Drugstore, looking... going around, looking everything, figuring\nout prices and this. So, yeah.",
        "Q: They...",
        "A: ... the Long Drug... the employees began to get a bit suspicious, what is this man doing here, and\nhe was smiling always, because he couldn\u2019t speak a word of English. So, finally, I had to... I\nexplained, I talked to the people, and said, \u201cThis is my father, he doesn\u2019t speak any English, and\nhe loves your store.\u201d And this is all he did. We drop him off here, he\u2019s totally harmless. He never\nkilled a fly in his life. He just likes to... and so they laughed, and they just... and eventually they\nall kind of tried to communicate with him and he with them. And another thing that... just blew\nhis mind, that all you can eat little places in San Francisco. And we used to go to one that had\nvery nice stuff, steam table, of course. And he just could not understand that here, we were five,\nseven people go, and of course, the kids kept going back and taking more and this and that, and\nso finally he said, \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said, \u201cin Hungary, a restaurant like this would go broke in one\nday.\u201d So, my wife went to get the manager, and it... she was a very nice lady, and explain to her\nwhere my father comes from and what these questions are, so she sat down with us, and she\nsaid... \u2018cause my father said, \u201cHow do you make money, all you can eat?\u201d So, she then pointed\nout to my father, that look, \u201cHere is your granddaughter. Look what she has. She really didn\u2019t\ntake much. Look at your wife, she didn\u2019t eat that much. Look at you, you didn\u2019t eat that much.\nThe two boys,\u201d she said, \u201cthe two boys, okay, so they might take up... up to the price that they\npaid, but look, all of you, you\u2019re eat...\u201d and so, she was very patiently explaining. She said, \u201cOur\nproblem is not what people eat, it\u2019s what people try to put into their jacket.\u201d She says, \u201cYou\u2019d be\nsurprised how many people come in here with a bag, and all this.\u201d My father could not\nunderstand this, that even in America people... because he had, certainly, a very idealistic view\nof America. But I forgot to tell you that every time we picked him up from Long\u2019s Drugstore, he\nlearned this sentence to say. First he learn it in... he said it in Hungarian, then I taught him how\nto say in English, so the children can understand. He says, \u201cThis country 1s invincible.\u201d After\nlooking at the drugstore, he made up his mind, that based on this wealth that is in this... yust in\nthis store, and the way people just come in and can afford and buy, all this... he said, \u201cThis\ncountry, my son, 1s invincible.\u201d He had unlimited faith in this country. And I don\u2019t know whether\nin a previous interview I told you, when people ask him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here?\u201d He told\nthem a joke. I think I...",
        "Q: Yeah, you did, you did, yeah.",
        "A: ... [say it, so I\u2019m not going to repeat that, but he... he truly, he... with all the wealth, and\neverything else that just enchanted him, he... and the nice aesthetics of the stores, he was ready to\ngo home.",
        "Q: What year did he die, he and your mother?",
        "A: My mother died in 1971, and my father died 1n, let\u2019s see, 1980.",
        "Q: Had you seen them again, since... in between...",
        "A: Oh, well, I was there when my father was dying, yeah. I was in Germany, so they called me and I\ncome, and he had a stroke, and... but I was not with my mother when she was dying. My father\njust called me. So... but they have always been great supporters of the United States.",
        "Q: Do you have anything else that you\u2019d like to add? I\u2019m about out of questions.",
        "A: Well, if you give me a couple of minutes...",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: ... You can stop that, and see if there\u2019s anything else, okay?",
        "Q: Shall I pause it?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Are you involved with any other activities besides the Master Gardener\u2019s Association?",
        "A: Yes, we are enthusiastic members of the Elder Hostel program. We have... my wife, I think,\nparticipated in just about fifteen or so, and I am just about five behind. And what we usually do,\nwe are taking hands-on type classes. My idea is that I want to know everything before I go,\nabout... a little about a lot of things, such as I have always wondered about blacksmithing. What\ndoes a blacksmith do? How does he do it? So I took a class in blacksmithing. I took a class in\nkaleidoscope making, because that interested me... me, too. How does a kaleidoscope work?\nHow do you make one? And I took several classes in wood turning, which I enjoy very much as\na hobby. We also took a beautiful class, which was not hands-on, but still something similar, to...\nin Hawaii, an Elder Hostel class for two weeks. We were studying the volcanoes, the rainforest\nand then Polynesian culture. My wife is very active in basket weaving. She\u2019s a member of the\nbasket weavers... Kentucky Basket Weavers Association, or whatever... I don\u2019t know if this is\nthe official name, but she participates, she exhibits sometimes. Also, she\u2019s a quilter, so as a\nquilter, she comes in contact with a lot of truly Kentuckians. And she doesn\u2019t ever come home\ncomplaining that maybe they considered her an outsider. She feels very much at home with all\nthese people. We also go to West Virginia, to Cedar Lake, which is also a - an Appalachian\ncenter for crafts, and take a hands-on class. Our next class, hopefully, we are on the waiting list,\nwe have taken a class in Charleston and we want to go back, this is our next class. We studied\noutdoor cooking and we are going back now to study Charleston\u2019s gardens. We take trips.",
        "Q: Is this West Virginia, or South Carolina?",
        "A: No, South Carolina, South Carolina, Charles... Charleston, South Carolina. And while there, we\nvisited Virginia, Savannah, and we were fascinated by Savannah, it was just walking around in a\nEuropean city. And in Kentucky, too, occasionally we take trips. We love to go, as I mentioned,\nto Cincinnati. We go up to Louisville. My wife, as a quilter, goes sometimes to western\nKentucky, which is the quilter\u2019s place, you know, Paducah is the quilter\u2019s museum. In other\nwords, we are active here, and I took the class in History of Cincinnati, in northern Kentucky.\nAnd I plan to... oh, I belong to the Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, a lot of conservationist\norganizations. I volunteered to participate in the Kentucky water watch program, which I\nenjoyed very much. It just ended with the Licking River, and the branch here in Paris, Stoner\nCreek, was our responsibility. Four times a year we had to go down and take samples, and... so\nthat was, I felt I was part of Kentucky, doing this. We are... we try to stay active and my wife 1s\nmainly involved with these quieter things, and I am... I like to get involved with something that\ntakes me out in nature and puts me in a kayak, or out there, really fighting the elements. I still\nhave a little bit of that spark. So, if I can manage, and if my heart gets better after the operation\nthis fall, I\u2019d like to buy a canoe or a kayak, one of the two, and just go on these little rivers here.\nSo...",
        "Q: Well, thank you.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Is there anything else?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. That\u2019s about it. I mean, I can\u2019t... can\u2019t really...",

        "Q: Mmm-hmm.",
        "Q: As far as, you had mentioned that there were some serious anti-Semitic incidents at your school and\nI am wondering if you had any expectations after the war was over that some of that would be\nameliorated and that anti-Semitism was not going to be as much of a problem any more?",
        "Q: Did you experience anything directly, any anti-Semitic incidents?",
        "Q: And you, when you joined the Zionist organization, did you have, did you really have dreams of\nbeing in Israel, or that this, that this was something that you felt very strongly about?",

        "Q: Before we go into more details about that, you mentioned that you found the Israelis very well\norganized as you were escaping from Hungary. When you arrived in the kibbutz, did you, did you\nshare the feeling that the way that the kibbutz was organized was, was very good and smooth and,\ndid you have any observations about that?",
        "Q: Did you have dreams or ideas of what exactly you would be doing when you went back to Hungary,\nwas that... was your sense of where you wanted to go in your life very developed?",

And I\u2019m Arwen Donahue, here\nwe go. Well, I\u2019m curious, before we...",
        "Q: ...go into the chronology, to hear more about your theory of nations. Did... you were talking a\nlittle earlier, just about how you really have an ambition of going back to Hungary and finding\nthe people who are living in the same house that you were during war time. So, do you... but then\nagain, you don\u2019t have a lot of strong feelings for Hungary. Do you dislike going back, when you\nhave visited? Or, how do you feel about visiting there, even?",
        "Q: Pll hold it.",
        "Q: Yeah, I\u2019m wondering what... Hungary...",
        "Q: Are you an American citizen?",
        "Q: Do you feel more of an attachment to being... to America than Hungary in any sense? I mean, by\nbeing a citizen, by having lived here for so long?",
        "Q: Did you know anything about the Constitution before you came, or how did you learn about...\nabout the Constitution?",

        "Q: ... much later. Uh-huh. Did you have the idea at that time, that you would be staying in the\nUnited States? I know you had the idea originally that you didn\u2019t want to stay, and you wanted to\ngo back to Europe. Were you thinking, after you had arrived, that you would actually stay?\nWhat... What were your thoughts about the future?",
        "Q: Were you not... did it seem strange to you that it would be the group of Black co-workers, rather\nthan Germanic co-workers who would befriend you, or did you think that that had anything to do\nwith you being Jewish, or did you reject friendships with the German descent co-workers? What\nwas the story with that?",
        "Q: So you came with some ideas about this being the Land of the Free, and did it surprise you to see\nhow... what a division there was between Blacks and Whites in this country and the way that the\nWhite people treated Blacks, and the problems with equality?",
        "Q: So, up until then, you really hadn\u2019t realized what a strong division there was, or what a taboo\nthere was against interracial relationships?",
        "Q: Were there any civil rights activities going on in Saint Louis during the time that you were there?\nWas there... were there any at... you know, discussions, just in the wake of the Brown versus\nBoard of Education decision that interracial education would be happening?

        "Q: This is tape one, side B, of an interview with Robert Holczer. Go ahead.",
        "Q: So you went to Aspen?",
        "Q: What was it... tell more about what it was about the place that was so appealing to you, and also\nhow that changed your perception of the United States, if it did.",
        "Q: When you formed friendships with people and made contact with people there, did they... were\nthey interested in your past, and where you\u2019d come from and what had happened to you during\nthe war? Did anyone ask you about that, and did you feel compelled to talk about it?",
        "Q: Did you find that people had an understanding of what had happened during the war, and the\nhistory of what had happened to the Jews in Europe?",
        "Q: What was the work that you did while you were in Aspen?",
        "Q: And you decided... so your motivation to leave was really that you wanted to get in... to continue\nyour education? Was that...",

        "Q: Were you feeling surprised that you\u2019d been to several very different places in the country, with\nvery different atmospheres. Were you surprised at how much variation there was in this country,\nthat you had kind of come to expecting a certain, maybe...",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: During that time, did you... were you aware of how Americans in general thought about the\nHolocaust and Holocaust survivors, and some of the stereotypes that were attached to them? And\ndid you think of yourself as a Holocaust survivor, and how were you... how were you relating to\nthe culture at large, in terms of that kind of identity?",
        "Q: But you did have nightmares about the past, you mentioned that.",
        "Q: What about when you lived in Germany and you\u2019re... you\u2019re there in this nation that had\nperpetrated these crimes, and people presumably were much more aware of the history there,\nthan your acquaintances had been when you lived in the States. Was it a bigger issue that The\nHolocaust? Was it more of a... did 1t have more of a place in your life and did you talk about it\nwith people?",

        "Q: Do you draw... when you think about this issue, does you mind draw parallels to your own\nexperience, and experience of Jews in Europe? I mean, even though it\u2019s not... I mean, with the\nJews in Europe, they had been residents for hundreds and hundreds of years and they certainly\nbelonged there, but... but the idea of some kind of economic problems making one majority\ngroup turn against a minority group and persecuting them.

        "A: I, my name is Robert Holczer. I was born in Budapest in 1929, August 31.",
        "A: My father was, my father\u2019s name is Lajos Holczer. He comes from a very poor working class\nfamily, a Jewish family that was almost totally assimilated into the Proletarian environment. They\nlived on the outskirts of Budapest in a tenement without any water and electricity. My grandmother\nwas practically the sole supporter of the family until the children got a little bit older because my\ngrandfather was a, what you would call a /umpen proletary (ph) person who did not really care too\nmuch about father responsibilities. The, so my father was the oldest one who made it into adult life,\nthere was somebody else ahead of him but died of tuberculosis. And he has always been a great\nsupport to his brothers and sisters. He was a working man, he has always worked for other people.\nEventually, he became kind of a, an amateur druggist, worked for companies but he did not have a\nformal education and after the war, he joined a co-op. He rose to kind of a mid-level managerial\nposition but he basically was always just a working man. He never went beyond the second grade\nand he taught himself how to read and write and everything else. He had exceptional qualities in\nmath and law. My mother\u2019 comes from a small northern Hungarian town, Vacz. This is where the\nDanube turns suddenly south and she comes from a middle class family, Orthodox, very religious.\nShe had a brother and a sister, both of them who died in World War II. The sister was deported, the\nbrother died in labor camp. Her entire family from Vacz were, was deported to Auschwitz and died\nthere. My mother never had to work, basically, my father was always making enough money and\nshe enjoyed just being a housewife. Anything else?",
        "A: My father had thirteen brothers and sisters, yes, and he was the oldest one to survive, to grow up,\nbecause his older brother died, very early. So, the burden of supporting the family was always on\nhim. So he was the provider type and my mother had no basic responsibility. She was basically\nwhat you would call a petit-bourgeois lady and I always admired my father\u2019s values more than my\nmother\u2019s but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t love my mother. My mother also survived the war with me.\n1 Cornelia Oestreicher",
        "A: My father and mother met, so that, my father was working for a wholesale drug distribution firm.\nBy drug I, we mean a cosmetic supply firm, but in Hungary they were called druggists, making\ncologne water, things like that. It had nothing to do with what we call drugs today. It was not a\npharmaceutical company. And my, at that time, in Hungary and in Europe, it was the custom of\nmiddle-class families to send their daughters to secretarial school and then have them work for a\nfew years for some firm, hoping that they\u2019re going to catch a husband. And my mother caught my\nfather there, which was very much to the dislike of her family because my father, they felt, was\nmuch below their class and they made him feel that way in all his life. Of course, I cannot really\nsay what would have happened after World War II because my mother\u2019s entire family was wiped\nout, practically. Only a few people who lived in Budapest remained. So, but I resented them for a\nvery simple reason, that they looked down on my father who I thought was a, was a very, was a man\nof integrity and, and hard-working, a good human being.",
        "A: I had a very strange relationship with my mother\u2019s family, especially my grandparents because they\nwere very religious and I was born irreligious and whenever I had to visit with them they forced me\nto wear a hat even in the middle of the summer and eat a certain kind of very strict kosher food, go\nto the synagogue every night and pray and, and in general, they considered me some kind of a, what\nthey call in Yiddish a shaygets, somebody who is kind of just an outsider because I never really\nwent along with their, with their religious rules. I also resented the fact that my grandmother was\nkind of a, of a, of a very angry person. I felt that, that the way she treated others and the way she\ntreated my grandfather, I resented that. I didn\u2019t like to go there and my mother, of course, always\nwanted me to go and visit and I have, I just finally decided to take my revenge so I would not have\nto visit anymore. And one day, this was, I must have been about eleven or so, I went to a butcher\nshop, got a huge ham hock and got out and when the people went to the synagogue Friday night, I\nwas eating it without a hat and pretty soon they were reporting it to her and they were coming and\nthat was my last visit. They immediately sent me back to Budapest and I never had to visit again.",
        "A: Yes. My mother was very angry, but my father and I, we always had some kind of an\nunderstanding. Even when he scolded me for something that, that had something to do with religion\nto go along with my mother, I sensed in his voice that it was not serious, that he just did it for my\nmother\u2019s sake. And I also found out since, between 1948 and 1950, I went to Israel, I was in Israel\nwhich we will come back later, when I came back and I spoke Hebrew, I realize that my father\ndoesn\u2019t know how to pray, that he just mumbles the words. He has no idea, what really, how to\neven pronounce them and he did this all for, for the love of my, my, my mother and I appreciated\nthis, that he put up this pretense but it was an interesting discovery for me, that. So he never, he\nnever really scolded me and he was practically influential after the war to put down his foot and say,\nforget about kosher anymore, let\u2019s just eat what is available. And so we did not have a kosher\nhousehold anymore.",
        "A: Yes, yes, they weren\u2019t. They were Jews, they never, they never doubt their Jewishness. They knew\nthey were Jews but they were secular Jews, you know? And interestingly, quite a few of them\nsurvived because of the place where they lived. Since they lived in a Proletarian tenement of\u2014city\ntenement\u2014that was given to people under a certain income who had too many children and not\nenough income, there, the Communist Party, the illegal Communist Party had a very strong hold on\nthis area and when, then, the World War II came and the Nuremburg laws and everything else,\nsome of these Communist leaders, Communist members, came and actually rescued members of the\nfamily. I have an uncle in Hungary and he, for example, was a very good friend of a past\nCommunist prime minister who just died recently because they practically lived side by side. So a\ngreat deal of the Hungarian leadership, Communist leadership, came from this tenement. So that\nhelped rescue them. The Communists were the only, the only group you could really turn to, during\nthose terrible years that, that would help you.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. My, my father always talked to me and said go, you know, to the synagogue, your\nmother wants you to go and all this and that, but he never really did anything to force me to do\nwhatever with religion. He just asked me to respect my mother\u2019s wishes and so I had Bar Mitzvah\nand that was the last thing that I did. After my Bar Mitzvah I never probably went to synagogue\nagain unless it was a tourist attraction, I just, wanted to see what it is, inside. And, but I never\ndenied my Jewishness so when my grandchildren especially ask me about religion, I say Iam a Jew\nbut \u2019m not Jewish. And they ask me, \u201cHow can that be?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s easy.\u201d",
        "A: No, not really. It\u2019s a strange thing that I have never been somebody who believes in the supreme\nbeing and so maybe, eventually, my lot, this is going to be difficult, but because they say people\nwho have faith, they die much easier than the ones who don\u2019t, but I always just associated with\npeople who practically felt the same way and it never caused any problems so far in my life, in my\nsixty-six years. But I can\u2019t remember when I really honestly believed in a supreme being. And then\nof course, the war probably wiped out, if I had any doubts.",
        "A: My relationship with my father was always very good. I [indecipherable], I considered him always\nmy, my example, my hero, and I was very very upset when in 1942, he was taken away and sent to\na labor camp in Yugoslavia. And when he came back in 1945, he, of course, I was overwhelmed\nand in my memory too, even though I spent more time with my mother, a lot more than with my\nfather because he was also a traveling salesman for a long time and I only saw him on weekends,\nsomehow my memory is much more blurred when it comes to my mother than when it comes to my\nfather. My mother, one reason it might be that my mother died in 1970 and my father died in 1980,\nso he survived ten more years and since we lived in Europe from \u201974 on, at least for six years I had a\nlot more contact with him than I would have if I had stayed in the U.S. I always considered him an\nabsolute statue of integrity and, and honesty and he was always looking out for my interests and I,\neven though when I as an American, had a very nice living, I made a very nice living and I didn\u2019t\nneed any, any material, he was still saving and collecting things for us in Hungary and was always\ngiving us a lot of things when we went to visit him and we kept telling him that he should spend it\non himself. He, he was just one of the most unselfish people I have ever met in my life.",
        "A: Yes, always, always. He was always that way. Just a very simple, very simple man. Very,\nextremely intelligent, uneducated but a true human being. And with my mother, I always had a\nlittle bit of my doubts that she\u2019s not as straightforward as my father. And there were little incidents\nthat kind of, as a child, it\u2019s amazing how it gets engraved in your mind and you cannot get rid of it.\nAnd the thing that I was very, very bitter about, that I could never forgive my mother for, was that\nwhile my father was in concentration camp in Yugoslavia, she took a little job and she worked for a\ndrugstore in the center of Budapest. And next to the drugstore was an antique store. Mr. Klein was\nthe name of the man who owned and he liked my mother. My mother was a cute little creature and\neverybody liked her and so he would wait for her when she closed this shop to escort her home\nbecause he lived the same way and I didn\u2019t see anything wrong with this, but they noticed how\njealous I am of my mother and it\u2019s not that I wanted to possess my mother, I just, I was protecting\nmy mother for my father and so he put his arm around my mother and they were looking at me and\nlaughing at how annoyed I became and this picture is constantly in my mind. And I could never\nforgive my mother for this, that, that she did not realize how hurt I was by playing this silly game.\nAnd she was, still she was a good person, she did everything possible to give me a good education\nand, but, she had a very petit-bourgeois thinking and another thing that somehow stood between the\ntwo of us was piano. She decided that I\u2019m going to be a great piano player and I decided that I have\nno interest in playing the piano and she would sometimes get so annoyed that I did not practice that\nshe would take a rug-beater and run after me and try to beat me but I was much faster than she was\nSO We were running around the table and then eventually she just broke down and cried that she\ncouldn\u2019t catch me but she had this obsession with, with, with piano playing and so again, ever since\nin World War I, our piano was destroyed. We gave it to somebody for safekeeping and they\nclaimed that the, the bomb got it, whatever, I was glad. She wanted to buy another piano and I said\nno. When I, when we came up from the cellar after liberation, I said, that\u2019s it. I am now a man. I\nbasically rescued my mother more than once during World War II and I said no more piano and I\nnever sat down to play the piano. Never. I never had the urge.",
        "A: My father\u2019s family was my favorite side of the family. I had a grandmother, a typical Proletarian\nwoman with thirteen children and not much of a husband. And I remember going out and loving\nevery moment of spending time with them because here I came, I was the, the, the second\ngrandchild in the family. There was one older one who, unfortunately, during the war, was killed.\nSo I was kind of the sweetheart of everybody and they were pampering me and taking me to places\nand my grandmother, I remember, had a tremendous knowledge of how to make beans in at least\nfifteen different ways. There were beans every time I went out, they had beans, beans, but she was\njust a marvelous woman, a very warm-hearted, a typical country woman. She came from southern\nHungary from a very small village and after raising thirteen children during the day, she left them in\nthe care of my father and then went from door to door selling silk stockings just to add a little bit to\nthe, to the income. The, my father\u2019s brothers and sisters were, of course, some of them are only just\na few years older than I am, so they were almost like brothers and sisters to me at that time and\nsince there was no money at all in the family, they resorted to somehow, illegal things. I remember I\nloved ice skating and they said, oh no problem and they took a huge scissor\u2014pair of scissors\u2014and\ncut a big hole and pushed me through the hole into the ice skating rink, nearby, so we always went\nice skating. A lot of things were solved not by very legal ways, but as a child, this was life to me.\nThere were a lot of children in the tenement constantly horsing around and nobody, nobody was\nconstantly bothering me and, and, and disciplining me and getting ahead or going to the synagogue,\nnothing. It was a great freedom and I just enjoyed it very very much.",
        "A: Any of my father\u2019s brothers or sisters?",
        "A: Let\u2019s see, did I? No, I really had a very, very good relationship with all of them, with practically all\nof them. And I cannot really say that one or the other, I liked one particularly and interestingly, I\nspent the least time with him. He was a, just kind of a very outstanding figure, a tall, very mascular\n[sic] man who went to Czechoslovakia during the War, World War II and somehow worked for a\nshoe factory, which was a very famous shoe factory all over the world, Bata, got married there and\ncame once to visit us and I still remember his visit. I was so impressed with him, with his, there\nwas just an air about this man that impressed me a great deal and, unfortunately, when there was the\nbig uprising, there was a big Slovakian uprising against the Germans in 1944, and he was an officer\nin the, in this uprising, in the Partisan Army, and they caught him and he was hanged. So, we knew\nthis for sure because his wife survived the war, he was a Gentile and he has two children living in\nSwitzerland today. One, I\u2019m sorry, one, the other one is a stepbrother. He has one and I met him\nand so I knew the story. But, this, this was the man who, to me, was an outstanding representative\nof my father\u2019s side of family. But, today, there are only two men and one women [sic.] left of the\nthirteen. I mean, they\u2019re in their late seventies, so, but on my mother\u2019s side, no brothers, no brother,\nno sister, practically. I only have one cousin left on my mother\u2019s side in Budapest today. He\u2019s\nyounger than I am, so, that\u2019s.",
        "A: I was an avid cyclist. I loved to, I loved to bicycle. I would come home from school and\nimmediately take off and go, there was a big park, we lived near the, the, we lived on the Pest side\nand there was a so-called rose garden in the center of Pest and that\u2019s where I met with my friends\nevery afternoon. And we were comparing our bicycles. Bicycles were the same as cars today for\nus. I mean, it was, it was a thing and we admired the one who had the custom-made one or had just\neven custom-made parts, and so we had big races on bicycle and then that was it, so I was\nheartbroken when in 1944, one of the first things we had to take in when the Germans occupied\nHungary was the bicycle and the radio. And I lost it. I also belonged to an underground Boy Scout\ngroup, I was an avid underground Boy Scout. The reason I say underground because we couldn\u2019t\nbe legal Boy Scouts. The Boy Scout movement, which was based on brotherhood and equality of\nall, declared that Jews are not equal and therefore all Jewish Boy Scout organizations were\ndisbanded and Jews were also thrown out of those Boy Scout groups that were not affiliated with\nsome Jewish school or something. I belonged to the so-called Three-Hundred Ten, number Three-\nHundred Ten Jokay Mor Boy Scout group. Jokay Mor was a famous Hungarian writer, a humanist.\nHe was not Jewish but he was a humanist. And we met illegally, sometimes in the basement of\nsynagogues and then we had to split up later into smaller groups and it was in, in homes, 1n one, the\nsmall groups consisted of about ten, between ten and fourteen people and so we just rotated and did\nall kinds of things, besides hiking, we were building model airplanes and did what, what Boy Scouts\nusually do, otherwise. I have always, always dreamt these days, I had always dreamt about one day\nhaving a uniform. The uniform was unbelievably important for me, like most kids of my age at that\ntime. And I was always dreaming about it and at school, I just looked at my classmates who were,\nof course, Christians and could wear the uniform and just, I dreamt about that one day, I\u2019m going to\nhave a uniform and the sad thing 1s that after the war, when we met for the first time, those who\nsurvived in our group, and we went to get the uniform and we put it on and all of a sudden, to most\nof us, it didn\u2019t mean anything anymore. We were, it\u2019s hard to say, either we were too old or too\ncynical by that time to really attach any importance to the uniform, so I never wore it again.",
        "A: Yes, I have always attended a secular school, except my first fourth grades were in a, the Jewish\norphanage ran a school, it was basically a secular school, but the Jewish orphanage was in charge in\norder to have enough money to raise the orphans. So the orphans lived in a dorm while we who\nwere coming from the outside, we had to pay tuition. And it was nearby, I spent four years there\nand then, middle school. I went to a secular state school, middle school because it was exactly next\ndoor to my house. And then, of course, came the... 1944, and 1943-44, I couldn\u2019t go to high\nschool. There\u2019s one incident in my middle school that I felt had very, very important consequences\nfor the rest of my life. We were, as basically innocents abroad, to the point where I really didn\u2019t pay\nmuch attention to being Jewish or not Jewish until this incident happened. In fifth grade, 1t was an\nart class and my art teacher was drawing something on the blackboard and we had to copy it,\nexactly. And then color it exactly. And he came by and for some reason, I used a different kind of\ncolor or something and he always walked around with a huge cane, which was not unusual in those\ndays for teachers because teachers...\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\nTape 1, Side B",
        "A: Yes, in fifth grade, the, the idea of art was for the art teacher to draw on the blackboard and then for\nthe rest of the class, class to copy it and color it. The, teacher came around and made sure that\neverybody\u2019s following his instructions and just to emphasize that he means business, he had a big\ncane in his hand and for some reason, I missed a couple of the colors and used something different.\nHe became absolutely just, angry, unreasonably so and started to beat me to the point where I began\nto bleed through my nose. And I also became frantic seeing the blood coming from, from my nose\nand all this so I ran home. I mentioned before that I lived next to the school. The other house was\nwhere we lived, apartment house. And I ran up to my mother\u2019s, into my mother\u2019s arms and asked\nher to clean me up and come and basically what I wanted is justice, I could not, even at the age of\neleven, I couldn\u2019t believe that this is going to be the way it is. And I wanted her to come in and do\nsomething about it. And after she cleaned me up she said, \u201cNow you must understand, a lot of\nthings that you cannot understand now, I cannot go in and do anything, yes, except apologize for\nyour behavior.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat, what behavior, what did I do, used the wrong color,\u201d and she\nsaid, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t understand just now.\u201d [Clocks chiming] And the reason, what I left out was\na very important thing. The teacher was yelling at me as I was running out of the class, \u201cI hope you\ngo to Palestine to sell oranges. That\u2019s where you belong.\u201d And so when I told my mother, this is\nwhen her reaction came. So she came back to school with me and instead of demanding some kind\nof a remedial action for this, apologized to the teacher. And I thought that was, that was a very\nstrange thing. I didn\u2019t understand at that time. I did understand it, years later, that this was the only\ncourse she could, she could take. Obviously, she was afraid that maybe they will kick me out of\nschool if she does something else. And every Jewish family, of course, wanted to have their son\nfinish middle school. And that incident somehow frustrated me to the point, it created a mental\nblock. I never drew or never painted in my life since. I am such idiot when it comes to, to do\nanything with my hands that involves drawing or painting that it is pathetic. When we play some\ngames, for example, with my friends, when I have to draw something, they can\u2019t believe that, they\nthink my perception 1s that of a mentally retarded person and it is, it 1s just a, just a block. However,\nI appreciate art very much. I never fail to go and see an exhibit of paintings and drawings. I just\ndon\u2019t want to do it and I cannot do it myself. Now it\u2019s possible that this can be unlocked in time but\nby that time I won\u2019t be alive. So, I rather just leave this.",
        "A: No, my father was not around anymore. He heard it after the war and of course by that time, I\ncould, I understood the whole situation better.",
        "A: ...Hit me for the first time? Well, the first one, I remember was when I was six and I was playing\nmarbles with, with kids and I won. And one kid said, threw the marble down the gutter and said\n\u201cTd rather throw it down the gutter than to give it to a Jew.\u201d And I went home and asked my\nmother, \u201cWhat, what does it mean?\u201d So, that really was the first time that something like this hit me.\nAnd since I went to a Jewish school for the first four years, I was not really exposed to things like\nthis. But the minute I switched and in fifth grade, everything started. Luckily, there were some\nteachers of course, in our school who tried to make up for this. And I remember a couple of them.\nUnfortunately, they\u2019re not alive anymore but they did everything possible to, to make our life a bit\nmore civilized. And one of them was even fired because of that. But not everybody was like this.",
        "A: He was very protective of, of Jewish children and he was also fired because we had a special subject\ncalled, how would I, how would I translate this, Defensive Studies, which meant, basically, kind of\na ROTC type, except it was sheer propaganda. We had to, the book contained sentences that were\nso revolting as far as Hungary\u2019s neighbors were concerned. For example, the Romanians were\ndescribed as monkeys on a, on a tree, their intellectual level and, I mean, for every nationality that\nsurrounded Hungary, they had a very derogatory term. And, actually, the book was preparing you\nthat one day we will get even. And what he was, among other things, he was teaching this subject,\nand he said, \u201cPut the book away and let me tell you what life 1s about.\u201d And it was a very, very\nhuman, humanistic lecture that he would give us every day. And, after the war, to our great\nsatisfaction, but not surprise, he was named as the first director of the Hungarian Academy of\nPhysical Sciences, so, he, they recognized him. And he was then, I talked to him later and he was in\nthe Illegal Social Democratic Party, so that also helped him. But, there were teachers and I had a\nteacher, I don\u2019t even know if he had any political conviction, but he was a human being and he\nalways tried to mitigate any law, anything, but, but as a child, for example, even, even in middle\nschool, I had to go once a week to three hours of, of labor, battalion practice. This was one of the\nmost humiliating experiences that anybody can have. They had the scum of earth in charge of us, it\nwas not teachers or any... we had to report either at school or somewhere on the outskirts of\nBudapest to a practice ground where these hired instructors that were a lot worse than any drill\ninstructor I have ever seen in any movie, any American movie, because it\u2019s not that, 1t was not just\nthe physical, the physical abuse can be tolerated, but it is the mental abuse, but that was so, so bad,\nthe way they called us everything, a Jewish this and a Jewish that, and these were people hired to do\nthis job and besides of marching and, and digging and building, constantly, we were abused and\nconstantly even physically so. Many times they beat us and all this. And we had to go there about\nthree hours on a certain day. The Christians then went to three hours of practice of what you would\ncall today ROTC. They had, they had marching drill practices and all this. But ours was\ncompletely different.",
        "A: What year? Well, I was in fifth grade, right, so it was about 1940 when I entered the middle school.\nIt was about 1940.",
        "A: Well, yes, in a sense, that some people in the family, such as my aunt, who was very young, one of\nmy father\u2019s sisters, and, was married also to a young, twenty-one or twenty-two year old man. He\nwas called up to go to the eastern front and, and he go into labor battalions, in \u00b041, I\u2019m talking about\n\"41 because that\u2019s when Germany declared war, Germany attacked the Soviet Union. Immediately,\nthe very young, I think twenty-one old Jewish men were called up. They had to go to a certain\nplace in their own clothes. They didn\u2019t get any uniform, anything, and taken to the eastern front\nimmediately for mine, got to, to pick up mines, okay? And many of them without any previous\nexperience and, and, and any schooling as to how to do it, of course, blew up. Now, the reason I am\nmentioning this because my father\u2019s sister who was very young and married to a young man,\ninterestingly, when he was taken to the front, for some reason, somebody made a mistake and his\nunit was issued Hungarian army uniforms.",
        "A: Her husband, yes, okay. And he then went to the photographer for something and just had a picture\ntaken, proudly posing in a Hungarian military uniform, he sent home. By the time, the picture\narrived at home, he was dead. He was blown up on a mine. And this picture initiated a whole\navalanche of events in our family because my aunt who was an extremely shrewd person, used this\npicture to start, to basic... declaring herself first as half-Jewish, which was an exceptional position\nthen. And as the Nuremburg laws were tightened more and more so, she took one more step and\none more step and one more step in pushing this whole idea that she\u2019s not really under this category\nof the Nuremburg laws. And it, the whole thing accelerated to the point where the last, when the\nonly way she could be declared an exceptional person, as they were called, which means that you\u2019re\nnot considered Jewish, was to take my grandmother down to the police station and that was a scene\nI remember: her taking my grandmother down and my grandmother had to, under oath, sign an\naffidavit that she is an, she was an illegitimate child because my grandmother was cleaning house\nfor a lawyer, a Christian lawyer who was dead by that time, a bachelor. And she signed this\naffidavit which made her a, a Christian. And with a husband who died in military uniform, so he\nwas obviously a Christian, with her mother signing this affidavit that she was illegitimate, and the\nfather was a Christian, she practically cleared herself and then set out to save the rest of the family.\nAnd, as I mentioned to you before, she did an excellent job up until 1944, October, that was the\npoint where nobody could do anything anymore because hell broke loose in Hungary and the scum\nof earth, the worst elements, the so-called Arrow Cross Party took over and ruled from October 15\"\nuntil January 18\" when Pest was liberated.",
        "A: Yes. Obviously, everybody experienced this because the men were away and there were very, very\nfew employers who would feel obligated to compensate the family. And so a lot of people were\nactually either starving, or the mother had to go and look for a job, or if the children were old\nenough, they had to go and work and do something. We were in a very good position, my mother\nand I, for a while, because my father\u2019s employer felt obligated to send us part of his regular monthly\nsalary, so we did get money.",
        "A: Okay, my father was taken away several times. You know, Hungary was kind of a strange part of\nthat Nazi area because the Hungarians, the Hungarian government has always been in the hands of\nthe aristocracy, Hungarian aristocracy, and the Hungarian aristocracy had no taste for Jews but also\nhad no taste for killing or murdering Jews. They were above this, and so therefore when the dictator\nof Hungary, Admiral Horthy, had to appoint a government, most of the time that government would\nnot eventually do everything that the Germans wanted them to do. So it was almost like playing\nmusical chairs, I mean, Hungary\u2019s a very small country and you don\u2019t have that many politicians,\naristocrats to go around, but almost the same faces somehow appeared, if not as prime minister then\nmaybe minister of interior, or something. So we really, up until 1944, we had a great deal of anti-\nSemitism, we had a great deal of persecution of Jews but we were not in fear of our lives. Because\nsomehow that was below the dignity of that class. Not only that, some of those aristocrats were\nvery Anglophiles and had, during the war, connections with the British. And so in between, it\ndepended on which aristocrat was in charge of the country. Some of them were a little bit more\nGerman-oriented than others. And when, and more German-oriented came into the picture because\nthe Germans didn\u2019t like the one who was in office, then he ordered that so and so is going to go and\nserve in, these Jews will be taken to the labor battalion. My father was in the labor battalion before\nhe was taken to Yugoslavia but he was inside Hungary so we could visit him, we could take food\nfor him and eventually, when a new prime minister came, he declared that anybody over let\u2019s say,\nforty-five can go home. So there was no fear of being killed just because you are, you\u2019re a Jew. Up\nuntil 1944, March, when the Germans marched into Hungary.",
        "A: To go, yeah, we knew where he was. I remember, he was not far from Budapest for awhile, for a\nfew month, and then almost every weekend we took food down, we talked to him, he was released,\nwe could walk around a little bit. And so it was not the same thing as taken away to a faraway\ncountry where we had no idea what would happen to him. Now, there, there, then in 1942, he was\ntaken away for, for good. For some reason, and I cannot really remember exactly what happened\nand why. We had, probably, a more radical prime minister who yielded to the Germans and let this\ncontingent of Jewish labor battalions go outside the country and he was then taken to Yugoslavia. I\nremember, even then, they, they were told which railroad station are they going to be going through\nin Budapest and they allowed them to be there I think half an hour or an hour where we had a visit\nwith him so we could talk over a few things. And that was the last I saw him, then, for a couple of\nyears until he came back after the war.",
        "A: He went to, he was in a copper mine in Bor, B, O, R which is I think the nearest is NiS which is\nSerbia today, the Serb Republic in Yugoslavia. And he was there, he was always telling me about\nwhat was, what was interesting, the various people who guarded them. They had Croats, they had\nGerman, they was all SS, Croat, Croatian SS, German SS, Hungarian, not SS, but Hungarian, and I\nthink that they had something, I\u2019ve forgot what, but anyway, various nationalities were guarding\nthem and probably Bosnians. And he mentioned when he came home, interestingly, he said, \u201cSon,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cwe never, we never really worried too much about anyone else guarding us except the\nCroatians.\u201d He said, \u201cWe had never seen such beasts as the Croatian SS was.\u201d They called them\nUstaSas, you know. He was there and I think, I, this is probably much better written than in my\nmemory, I think about one hundred fifty thousand were in this particular area where he was and\nwhat happened was when, when the Tito partisans were really pushing them back, The Germans\ndecided to march them back toward Germany and in, in what is northern, what was northern\nYugoslavia at that time and previously back before 1918, was southern Hungary, they set up these\nslaughterhouses, where those who survived the concentration camp were killed and\nmy father was in the last six thousand being marched and they were captured by Tito\u2019s partisans.\nAnd then he was given a choice whether he could fight with the partisans, he could work for the\npartisans, or they would allow him to go into an area that was already liberated and live there and\nthey would supply him with enough food to survive until the war is over, they said. And he was a\nvery strong man and very grateful that they saved his life and he volunteered to work. So he\nworked in a flour mill somewhere around and came home with all kinds of documents and, and\nlittle medals that testified to the fact that he was a good worker and did his share. And he was very\nproud of it, and when Stalin decided to eradicate any of the memories attached to Tito,\nunfortunately we had to burn everything and we had to throw away his medals because it was very\ndangerous to be in the possession of anything that connects you to Tito. People were hanged all the\ntime without not much reason, let alone if they find something on you. So, he was very bitter about\nthis, and this turned him against the Russians so in all his life he was very anti-Russian and very\npro-Yugoslavian. He would have been heartbroken to see what happened to Yugoslavia had he\nlived today.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\nTape 2, Side A",
        "A: Well, of course we were always afraid that he would not survive and we had no doubt that\nphysically he could survive but we were afraid that, that he would get killed. But an interesting\nepisode was that, [cough] excuse me, I asked him after the war, what, why did he survive if so many\npeople died? And he had a little, just a short little anecdote, he said, \u201cSon, there were two kinds of\npeople in the concentration camp. We got a canteen of water every morning. The one group drank\nthe water immediately and the second group, such as myself, drank half of the water during the day\nand we used the other half to wash ourselves.\u201d And I said, \u201cHalf a canteen of water would make\nyou clean?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, but I felt like a human being, I was still caring about myself.\u201d And he\nsaid, \u201cAnd later on I understood a lot more about this whole attitude that I\u2019m not going to lie down\nhere and gulp down everything, I am, even though I am full of lice, I\u2019m still caring about myself.\u201d\nSo that, basically, that was the attitude that saved, I\u2019m sure, that was who survived. And of course\nluck, because even with this attitude somebody could have shot you if they didn\u2019t like your face or\nthe way they moved. Yes, we, my mother maintained of course like most wives that he\u2019s going to\nreturn, and she was right because even though we have not heard from him for a long time,\nespecially the last year when he was there, of course by that time, we couldn\u2019t have heard from him\nbecause he was already in the liberated area and we were in Hungary still, in the battlefield. It was,\nhowever, just that, that deep feeling that he will come home. And he came home in 1945, I\nremember late spring, it must have been April, May, probably, and he did not just stop by and said,\n\u2018Here I am.\u201d He was afraid that maybe we would faint or something like that. He sent a friend up.\nA man came up and inquired about my father and very slowly kind of asked, \u201cWhen did you hear\nfrom him?\u201d and all this, and \u201cDo you think he\u2019s alive?\u201d and all this, and slowly he said, \u201cWell, I\nhave a feeling that he 1s alive,\u201d and slowly he led us to this. I remember him coming up on the stairs\nwith a rucksack. The rucksack was full of sausage and potatoes. And he knew that we were\nstarving and so that was it. Now, just to describe the situation in Hungary at that time and how you\nneeded to be, to stay a human being, the, we did not live in our apartment, we were moved, because\nyou could not stay in your apartment. You had to move to first, to so-called Jewish houses that had\na big star on them and, eventually to the ghetto. And because of the history of this house, we did\nnot move into the ghetto but this house Zichy street One, was designated as a Jewish house first.\nSo, in the meantime, we moved out of, of our apartment in, that was 1944, summer when you had to\nleave your apartment. We, the neighbors came, some of them, and said \u201cWe will keep this for you,\nand keep this for you,\u201d and needless to say, that not one thing eventually survived again. Or\nresurfaced again. They all, either the Russians took it, or the bombing or everything. It\u2019s all\ndisappeared, and what could you do about it? You said okay. But people were in a way like\nvultures, they were just circling around and see, you know, what they can take. And then the\napartment was given, all these Jewish apartments were given to bomb those people whose...\nGentiles whose houses were bombed and they couldn\u2019t live in anymore. And I had no idea of\ncourse what happened to our apartment. We lived in a street called Rottenbiller Street, 667, and I,\nmy first thing, we were liberated on January 18 and the first thing I went back to see, what, what\nhappened to our apartment because we left, believe it or not, a few boxes of linen there, just when\nwe left. We just, we couldn\u2019t do anything with it, so. And when I came, when I went up there, I\nhad this tremendous chip on my shoulder that I\u2019m going to show these people whoever are there,\nthat within two hours, I said I\u2019m going to give them two hours to get out of here. And here I was a\nsixteen year old kid, barely sixteen, fifteen really, and telling them, here was a family and I was\ntelling them to get out of here. And the family consisted of a mother, father, a daughter and two\nsons. And they were tailors. And the old man was quite old, the father, was telling me, he said,\n\u201cBut, but, where can we go?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, we have,\nwe have no place. Our, our house was destroyed, and I mean we knew that this 1s, this was a Jewish\napartment, but still it was between this or living in the street, in the cold snowy January,\u201d so he said,\n\u201cCould, could you do something, could, could we somehow come to some kind of an agreement?\u201d\nAnd so my mother came up and she said, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just divide the place between us?\u201d And\nhere it was a two room apartment with their family, four people, five people in their families and\ntwo, my mother and I, and we decided that after looking at them and listening to them and all this,\nthere was just something that all of a sudden hit me. My chip was gone and so we decided that yes,\nwe were going to, we'll, well make it. And so we lived there under the same roof and we became\nvery good friends. And when my father came home in late spring, the new government, Democratic\ngovernment, devised this plan of each block had to elect a kind of a small council and the head of\nthat council was quite powerful in deciding if there was an empty apartment or, almost like a Justice\nof Peace. They had certain tasks that they can perform, temporarily, they were deputized. And my\nfather was appointed to do this because he was always very much respected by the people there and\nthe fact that he was now good, you know, with the new regime. And next to us, an apartment was\nfull of old, old women who died one after another. It was a, like a Salvation Army place. They,\nthey rented it and it became empty, so my father got the apartment for them and they moved over\nthere so we could get our apartment back, we lived there, but they could never really thank enough\nand we, we kept this relationship for a long time and I\u2019m sorry I lost contact with them. But then,\nwe had an apartment and then we faced something else because then the Russians were coming\naround and trying to find places for their soldiers and so they, they got, they got two old Russian\nsoldiers from Siberia who were quartered in, in our apartment because two rooms were too many\nfor three people. So, and I remember, they were very cute old men, we had no, I mean we had sign\nlanguage, we didn\u2019t speak Russian and the only incident I remember is that my mother, of all these\nsufferings, had one little symbol in her possession: a bottle of very expensive cologne water that she\nkept. And she said, \u201cI am going to start using this after the war, when we are all together and we\nltve in peace.\u201d And so, and she kept it and she had it with her all the time. And so now, when we\nmoved back, she, we got a temporarily, kind of an armoir and she put it way back between sheets.\nNow one day we came home and my mother said, \u201cThis, this place smells like cologne water, very\n* When Robert lived there, the street number was 39. It was later changed to 66.\ngood cologne water,\u201d and she rushed to her cologne water in the armoir but these two Siberians,\nRussians were very hard pressed to get alcohol, anything, they would drink. I mean, there were\nstories that I can\u2019t believe, that they went to the museum and drank alcohol out of these scientific\nlab experiments and\u2014including embryos\u2014but I never believed those stories, but this is true. They\ndrank my mother\u2019s cologne water. They were so, so hard pressed for alcohol. And that was about\nour only experience with Russians in our house. Otherwise, most people lost their watches. They\nwere very hard pressed for watches. It was a time when nobody in his right mind would walk\naround in Budapest with a watch on his wrist. They just, they were fascinated. They stop you and\nthey took your watch. That was their, their, their thing. Well, anyway, okay, ask.",
        "A: Yeah, two.",
        "A: No, no, no. This was during the Russian occupation.",
        "A: Oh yes. I\u2019m talking about after, this all happened after. Oh no, there were no Russians during the\nGerman occupation. I wish there were. No.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Mostly Jewish. There were a few Gentile friends who never, ever mentioned religion, never\nreally made us feel inferior, just a few. And after the war, I made it clear how much I appreciated it.\nSo, I\u2019m glad that I could do that. Now, I also have to say that not many of my classmates survived\nbecause my Jewish classmates were in a labor battalion and they were working outside Budapest on\nthe day when the deportations came to that village. And the gendarmerie had an empty boxcart and\nthey decided not to let them go home but deport them. So very few Jewish classmates of mine\nsurvived. Gentiles, again, the war, the army eventually, everybody who was fifteen, fourteen,\nfifteen, sixteen at the end of the war, the last few months, the Arrow Cross people, they forced\nchildren out into the street with a gun. So quite a few of them did not survive. I really had very\nfew contact with, with, with the few that survived but there weren\u2019t too many.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Yes. And my father was very grateful to him and worked for him again after the war.",
        "A: Yes. I also took a job. I was a messenger boy up until 19... until the yellow star came into\nexistence... \"44 March. I was a messenger boy for architectural firm. Because of the bicycle. I\ncould bicycle around then, so I was delivering messages and things. So, that supplemented also, my\nfather\u2019s salary which wasn\u2019t a full salary, just part of it.",
        "A: Yes. 1944, March, if I remember it, 19\", is when the Germans had serious doubts apparently, that\nHungary is not a trusted ally anymore, that Hungary probably entertains the idea of getting out of\nthe war because by that time I think Romania was ready to jump and the situation in Italy was very\nshaky so they decided to occupy Hungary officially and put in a very right-wing government which\nwas still a lot better than what came in 1944, October. That will be the other stage. But let\u2019s take a\nlook at what happened when the Germans marched in, the yellow star had to be worn within a few\nweeks, or... So, the labor battalions were more intensified. Now everybody who was eighteen had\nto go, that was now, they lowered the limit and the deportations started. So, unfortunately, that was\nthe worst thing, the deportations. They started in the countryside, eventually coming to Budapest.\nThey were supposed to come to Budapest, you know, by the fall.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That was just an, a coincidence, that my aunt, the one who gained this special status, said to me,\n\u2018Please, I just have some very bad feelings, I don\u2019t want you to go today out and work. Stay home,\nstay with me.\u201d She took me to her apartment and that was the day when it happened. It was just a,\njust a miraculous instinct that she had. And that is what saved me.",
        "A: Well, what I did was, I gathered, I was always quite street smart and so I somehow found that the\nbest way to do this whole thing is first to get some papers that would qualify us\u2014at least to those\nwho don\u2019t know us\u2014as Christians. So I took my mother\u2019s jewellries, sold it, and bought papers.\nAnd the papers were blank and you had to fill it out. And I did that. Also, I got some papers and I\nfill it out with the same name from a cousin of mine who was adopted but had birth certificate and\neverything else that pertained to the fact that he was a Gentile. And his parents gave me his papers\ntoo so I had kind of this double insurance, moving around, in case I needed it. For a while, I did not\nuse these papers. I waited until, you know, we got the point where it was necessary. Also, there\nwas a danger that until the Russian troops did not cross the Hungarian border, it was a matter of a\ntelephone call to find out if you had false birth certificates. All they had to do 1s call the\nprincipality, you know, and that, that municipality and check, okay? And so, actually, we waited\nuntil practically the first village fell and, after that, it was much easier to fill 1t out, to a town or a\nvillage that had, that was already occupied under occu... Soviet occupation because they couldn\u2019t\ncheck anymore.",
        "A: Then, then, then we used the papers for awhile, but it was a, it was very confusing period when we\nwere moving a lot. First, my wife, my mother and I moved to the, the apartment of one of my\nfather\u2019s friends. They were Seventh-Day Adventists. And they offered their place but soon they\nlearned that Seventh-Day Adventists are just in the same danger as Jews so after consultation, we\nleft. Then we were, we went to a, I was always on the street, hearing, feeling, looking, what can\nhappen? Then I took my mother to a Jewish high school which was designated as a clothing supply\nbusiness for the Hungarian army and it was really a refuge for, for Jews. They were sewing\nuniforms for the army and it was established by old Hungarian Jewish army officers who wanted to\nsave their skin and their family and hired fake guards in uniform to come in and out of the place,\nputting on a show and inside they were actually really making, sewing uniforms and delivering it to\nthe army and, and, so I was always, it was just constantly you had to change your position and you\nhad to always look at what seems safe at the moment. And it is possible that something that was\nsafe one week became unsafe the next week because somebody recognized one person in that place\nwhen he was walking down the street, going into places, \u201cHere is a Jew, doesn\u2019t wear a yellow star,\nwhat is he doing?\u201d And so, your life depended on nuances, those days.",
        "A: My aunt is the one who just ripped off the yellow star and said, \u201cYou stay with me,\u201d and then my\nmother came there, too. And this is how we got to this house in Zichy Jeno Street, One, in the Fifth\nDistrict of Budapest.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, we, whenever there was a, up until we had to leave our own apartment, when there was a\nbombing we lived tn the cellar, you know, sometimes for hours. But usually, the bombings came at\nnight, so, I, one thing that war taught me how to be very organized because there was no light. You\ncouldn\u2019t turn on the light. No, that was a major offense. If they saw any light, when the sirens went\noff, they, they considered you collaborating with the, with the enemy, you know, giving signals. So,\nI had to lay out all my stuff and in the darkness I could pick every one of my clothes and still do, to\nrun down. We had seconds to run down in the bombing, started. Usually, there was no really\nintense bombing of Budapest. Most of the bombers, many times, Americans, were flying over to\nRomania, to Ploesti, to bomb the oil fields. There was really not much to bomb in Budapest, was\nnot very badly bombed. Budapest was, Budapest was mainly destroyed during that siege from\nDecember until January 18. That was the main reason for the destruction. But before that, there\nwas not that much.",
        "A: It was late fall, in 1944, you know. Late fall that... when we felt that that place was the best place\nto be. And then it turned out to be a very fortunate choice because in that house, there was a famous\nHungarian psychiatrist. Psychiatry was, in Hungary, at the very, very early stage. This man became\nvery famous and since there weren\u2019t too many, a great deal of his clientele were famous politicians,\nactors, actresses, writers. So he was well-known all over the place and he had this idea that he is\ngoing to save his family and friends by number one, contacting a fascist officer and I\u2019ve no idea\nhow he did it, who wants to save his skin and is willing to play this game of declaring the house a\nclinic and, and do everything possible to save the people inside the house and then he found this\nman and his name was Jereczian Ara George. And this is in reverse order because Hungarian\nnames are in reverse order. The last name is what we consider first so in English you would say\nGeorge Ara Jereczian. The, I remember him, a very handsome man, a very, kind of a man of stature\nand a fascist uniform, hand grenades hanging from his belt. I mean, he was intimidating to anyone.\nTo, with us, he was very kind. The, I suppose, looking back that we about three hundred doctors\nand families in that apartment house jammed, absolutely jammed. While we could still live\nupstairs, probably there were at least five to ten people to a room. When we lived in the basement,\nno one 1s to tell, we were just side by side on mattresses because when the siege of Budapest started,\nyou couldn\u2019t live upstairs anymore. So this man moved in with a few of his men who apparently\nwere loyal to him and his girlfriend and they set up their headquarters there and they were\npractically like a, a, a support group. The clinic had its official emblem there and the whole\noperation looked like it was a legal operation to save anybody who is injured. \u2018Kay? Now, we\u2019re at\nthe end?",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\nTape 2, Side B",
        "A: It was, it was in 1944, [coughs] excuse me. After I finished what would be eighth grade here, it was\nthe fourth grade of middle school and I was supposed to then go to what they call gymnasium,\nwhich is high school in Europe. I could not get into a high school and so it was not a long period\nbut between 1944, I have to figure this out. Let\u2019s see, 1925, 40, right. So there was a year, \u00b043\nbecause I was, I left the school, \u201943 so I had one year when actually I didn\u2019t do much except odd\njobs. My father was away, so, as I mentioned before I delivered, worked for an architectural firm\nand delivered blueprints, whatever I can find but I could not get into high school. The higher four\ngrades of high school, the gymnasium. And so my mother suggested that we hire a tutor so by the\ntime I would be available for high school, I wouldn\u2019t miss much. And this is why I had a private\ntutor. I was studying especially Latin because everybody suggested that that would probably create\na problem when all of a sudden I, war would be over\u2014we were always optimists\u2014and I could go\nto, instead of the first form to the second form and Latin would create the biggest problem. So for\nLatin and Algebra, I had a tutor, somebody in, in my mother\u2019s distant family, who lived in\nBudapest. And this is how the year went by. There was really not much else, a little work and a\nlittle study.",
        "A: Yes. My mother somehow, well, first of all the BBC, of course, unfortunately told us what\nhappened to the Jews who were taken away to concentration camps and death camps but by the that\ntime it was well known in Hungary too, what the deportations, how the deportations end up. So my\nmother was extremely upset, for understandable reasons and I really had to kind of keep her spirit\nup and, constantly reminding her that there are certain things we can\u2019t change and she still has to\nlive for her own little immediate family. But yes, we were very much aware, very much aware.\nAnd even though it was very, very difficult to get BBC and up until 1944, March, or April when the\nradios had to be turned in, we could still get BBC. And I learned from my father, I was six years\nold when I learned from my father that there is more to news than just the Hungarian papers and the\nHungarian radio. He would close the shutters at certain times, he always changed the times, of\ncourse, he would lock the doors and he would listen to BBC. At a very early age and would tell me\nthat this is the truth. Eventually, it became very dangerous because the Germans would have a\ndevice that was on top of a car, similar probably to what radar is today, that would circle and try to\nfind people who listened to foreign broadcasts. And it was punishable also by going to\nconcentration camp.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. [talkover] Well, I think this is in the Jewish nature, if you consider the fact that people\nin boxcars going to Auschwitz were still running schools, right? It\u2019s just that, this part of the, of the\noptimism and the fact that you have to learn, learn and learn. That was with us. That kind of a\nfeeling never left us and we never really gave up.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. She was. And she was just a distant cousin of my, my mother and she, I eventually\nmet her when I was in Israel, again. She emigrated to Israel.",
        "A: No, those who were in the house, they were allowed to stay, which is obvious, I mean, anybody\nwho would have been tossed out would have had to go to the ghetto. And it was, to most people, it\nwas clear that eventually the ghetto is going to be annihilated. There was no other way, since\nBudapest was surrounded by then by the Soviet forces, what else can you do with it? They built a\nhuge wooden wall around the ghetto and, according to the rumors, they would just detonate the\nwhole thing or burn it down or, but they would not let the Jews survive if the siege had lasted\nanother week or so. The lucky thing is that they just ran out of time. I, of course I was never in the\nghetto, but no, those who were in the house, they could stay, and a lot of other families moved in,\npractically all of them connected to famous Hungarian doctors.",
        "A: It was a Jewish house.",
        "A: Yes. It was a Jewish house. It had, 1t was a designated Jewish house.",
        "A: Well, about at least ten other members of our family. Some other aunts and brothers of my father,\nmy mother, of course, and I. I say, and it was a, about one and a half room apartment and there\nwere plenty of people in it. But that was the, the least of our problems, really, you know. We\ncould, we could sleep very well. There were a lot worse arrangements in Budapest at that time.\nThere were, there were people in Swedish-protected houses in, near the Danube, where, I\nunderstand, people couldn\u2019t even sleep. They just were, you know, practically back to back in a\nroom, there were so many people jammed in. This is the one that Wallen... what was his name, the\nSwedish diplomat, Wallenberg, the one, that was his little area, Raoul Wallenberg. But I never, I\nwent a couple of times by, but I never went up but I noticed that there just, there were just lots of\nlots of people.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. And interestingly, I can remember that a couple of non-Jewish families stayed there.\nThey just stayed there. By that time, perhaps what went through their mind is, that, since the war\ninevitably is coming to an end, it\u2019s not a bad idea to be here when the Soviet troops come. So that\nmust have been their reasoning. And it was not, not impractical, actually. At the same time, even in\nthe last week, we were in danger of being taken to the Danube, that was the, the most common way\nof getting rid of Jews who were discovered outside the ghetto, marched down and shot into the\nriver. It was a cold, bitter, snowy winter and the Danube was red and full of corpses. But I\nremember that even the last week, somebody from the neighborhood reported us to the fascist\nauthorities and they came and tried to disarm Jereczian Ara George\u2019s own people in the house, the\nbodyguards. And he seemed, he almost seemed helpless. We were already lined up and then he\nagain arrived there, amazingly, he did this more than once, with some paper from a very special\nhigher authority that said, \u201cClear out of here. This is a protected territory and we do our job for the\ngovernment and leave us alone.\u201d We confronted the man after the war. I know that. He was\ncaught, the one who reported us because he was stupid enough to show up the last week before\nBudapest was, Pest was occupied, and pointed fingers. I also remember another man who was a\nfascist officer that lived a couple of houses across from us who was also quite antagonistic toward\nus and we were worried about him. And also the last week, they brought him in with a head injury.\nHe was shot in the head in the street fighting. There was tremendous street fighting and he was just\nleft there to die. And I don\u2019t know, I was just fascinated by, by this man that, that everybody was\nalways afraid of and here he was, basically a nothing anymore, you know. And in spite of my good\njudgement, I watched him, kept going back to him, as a young man all night, watch him how he was\ndying. And I can\u2019t, I still cannot explain this fascination, because ever since I couldn\u2019t look at\nanother human being, even an animal that is dying. But somehow, there was a mixed feeling in me\nof revenge and satisfaction that this scum 1s, is not going to be here any longer and I wanted to see\nhow he was going. And my mother, I remember scolded me for this and constantly was taking me\nback to our place, where we, our sleeping arrangement was. But, there, there were incidents like\nthis and it was a very, very strange period for a fifteen-year-old boy. My job was basically to take\nlegs and arms up that were cut off, operated on in the so-called operating room which was a, a dark\npart of the basement and kind of arrange them on the, in the courtyard. And when in, when in\nJanuary 18\", we went up, upstairs, everybody was horrified. There were huge piles of limbs just\npiled up on the courtyard. And most of it, I had to pile up because I was the one who was always\nsent up with these. The doctors operated without any anesthesis [sic], anything. There were, there\nwere, there was nothing and it, of course, the survival ratio probably was minimal, you know. But\nthat, whenever I look into that house, that always comes to my mind, how these houses survive. We\ndie but they keep their secrets.",
        "A: I have a feeling that most of them did because my father\u2019s brothers wore the uniform of a military\npolice and again, because of their, their origin from this working, workers\u2019 neighborhood, they got\npapers and they got uniforms. They were supplied with everything, both of them. So.",
        "A: I was, only when, when on the street, they stopped me and asked for papers. That was the only time\nI used mine. And, by the last, I would say the last few weeks it didn\u2019t mean anything if they\nstopped a man because they didn\u2019t even ask for papers. They asked for you to drop your pants.\nAnd since in Europe, only Jews are circumcised, it was very easy to detect who was a Jew. And I\nhave to thank, I mean my life was really saved by a man who, amazingly appeared at the time when\nI thought that this was my last moment on earth. I was sent out to get something, I think, if I\nremember correctly, I was sent out because a horse fell on the street from shrapnels and we needed\nsome meat. And the only kind of meat, whenever we had meat, the only meat that we could get was\nhorsemeat. And of fallen horses, horses that were shot on the street, usually by airplanes. Airplanes\nflew very low and they were just machine-gunning anything that moved. And I always ran out and\nI also crawled out to get water. There were certain areas where a faucet was still intact and you\ncould get some water. And a patrol came and caught me and they said, \u201cOkay, here, come, come\ninto the doorway of this house,\u201d and they were shouting, yelling, \u201cThis looks like a Jew and took off\nyour pants, take off your pants,\u201d and they give me the order and I was kind of snow-white probably\nand shaking and all of a sudden another man with a much higher rank came and said to the guys,\n\u201cLook, I see four, five Jews on that corner. Go immediately, see, catch those, I take care of this\nidiot here. And so we went under the doorway and I was unbuttoning my pants and kind of shaking\nand he said, \u201cListen,\u201d he said, \u201care you crazy?\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where you come from, do\nyou have a place where you were staying?\u201d I said yes. He said, he said, \u201cGo back and I don\u2019t ever\nwant to see you again on the street.\u201d And we came out and he was hitting me and beating me and\njust and he said to these people, \u201cThis idiot, he\u2019s not a Jew,\u201d he said, \u201che\u2019s an idiot, a young idiotic\nkid who wants to be a hero apparently. Go back to your mother and don\u2019t ever leave the house.\u201d\nAnd I told my mother this story and of course, she never let me, the last week she never let me leave\nthe place, under no circumstances. And interestingly, about four, five weeks after we were\nliberated, I went to the UNRRA, the UNRRA was the U, N, R, R, A, that was the, the joint\ncommittee of the Jewish Relief and you could go there and you could get some emergency supplies,\nfood supplies, they were bringing them in. And who was at the door letting people in? I recognized\nthis man. And I walked up to him, he had a huge, a big flag emblem on his lapel, the flag of what\ntoday is Israel, at that time it was a Zionist emblem. And I said to him, I said, \u201cHey, you know, you\nsaved my life?\u2019 And he looked at me, he said, \u201cYou too?\u201d He said, \u201cThere were many more.\u201d And\nturned\u2014he didn\u2019t really want me to elaborate or nothing. And there were many people like this.\nNow who they were, I was very curious and I went to find out and most of the people who were\ndoing this were Polish Jews because a lot of them had very fair complexions. They were blond and\nblue-eyed and so, and they came to Hungary early, 1939 or so, and in four, five years, they learned\nenough Hungarian, and good Hungarian so they had very little accent and they could pass as, there\nwere other people in the Arrow Cross movement who had accents, so quite a few of them were in\nthe Arrow Cross movement. And in the Zionist Underground so, that was a lucky, a lucky accident\nfor me.",
        "A: During the siege? Well, during the siege. . .",
        "A: Oh, well they, they did it, the, the man I told you who saved us, he had good source of supply. So,\nthere was always a center of supply. The only thing that we could not get was of course, what did\nwe get, flour and beans. These were the two and soya. People made, there was incredible things\nout of soyabeans. I have great respect for soyabeans. They made sausage, they made, you name it,\nand it all tasted like real sausage or soyabread was marvelous. And they made bread of rice and just\ninvented all kinds of things that they had never eaten before. But the, the big thing was meat.\nEverybody wanted to have meat so we always watched out, looked out for horses, horses. And you\nshould have seen, when a horse fell on the street, ah, everybody was running with huge knives and\ncarving it out and running back into the basement because .. .",
        "A: No, nobody in, nobody, nobody in this house wore stars. Okay? Nobody, that was a taboo. No.\nAnd that was his order. \u2018Kay? We were exempt, because a lot of things that he told us, 1t was not\ntrue, it was just to boost our confidence but by that time there was such confusion everywhere, in\nhigher government places that who, who knows what was really the truth and what was not? Only\nhe can.",
        "A: No, no. We did, we had pretty good organization. No, he was the one who secured the food by,\nyou know, sending a contingent of people to, to get it and then we brought it back and then we, we\ndivided it. He had his little place there and he was just, these are all intelligent people and very\ndisciplined people. He did not have to go down personally and do anything, really. All we needed\nhim for is to, to, to help us survive, to, to protect us from the outside world. But inside, we\norganized everything ourselves.",
        "A: Some way, yes. Yes. They had to. They had to, they did something. Okay, at least, if nothing else\non paper. My mother was a nurse, for example.",
        "A: Well, I was, what they called, I was a messenger, you know, I was an errand boy. I was fifteen, and\nso, that was, I had a little uniform and a gray overall with a, kind of a military cap. But I was in\ncharge of taking the, the severed things up.",
        "A: I, did I have, yes, I had a friend. And it was the first time in my life that I really felt a sexual\nattraction toward a woman. And I was kind of a cute little kid and she was a lot older than I. And I\nthink under different circumstances, probably, we would have been much cozier but it was, there\nwere too many people around. I liked her. She was a, believe it or not, there was a, among other\nthings, there was a famous Hungarian Jewish comedian who also ended up in our, in our place.\nAlphonso. And this was the other half of his act, a young woman. And we became good friends\nand I had all kinds of fantasies about her and maybe she, too, about me. But my mother was around\nand too many people and so our attraction never really came to anything else, but just that. But we\nspent a lot of time together and, and, and it was just a nice puppy love, I think, that I\u2019ve had for the\nfirst time in my life with an older, somebody was at that time older, not too old. I think she was in\nher early twenties or so, but I was just fifteen. And the, I also had a strange relationship with an\nItalian girl. The Italian government of Badoglio (ph), that was his name, his Air Force chief I think,\nor Air Force minister had a Hungarian Jewish wife and when things got very hot in Italy, he brought\nher back to Hungary because he felt that in Hungary she has a better chance of survival, being the\nwife of the famous Italian Air Force general. In Italy, everybody knew that she was Jewish and they\nwere afraid of deportation. So, and he had a daughter, and somehow I had a lot of friends in the\nItalian school in Budapest, the Italian embassy maintained a school. And I fell in love with this girl.\nAnd the stupid thing, the reason this ties in with this story, the stupid I did was, during the terrible,\nduring those terrible days of siege, whenever I had some food like horsemeat or something, I would\nwalk, they lived about a half an hour from our house and I would walk on the street, of course walk,\ntry to run from one block to another, very close to the walls to deliver food to this girl and to her\nmother. And, and I felt that this was my obligation and it was a stupid thing to do.\nEnd of tape 2, Side B\nTape 3, Side A",
        "A: Holczer.",
        "A: Well, if I remember correctly, we did not play any games because the day went by with constantly\nwatching out to survive. We watched the streets, we listened to the radio. I remember that I was\nterribly concerned with the expression of adults around me, I watched their faces. I always\nsuspected that they know more than what they would tell me and somehow, in the last few weeks, I\njust became obsessed with, with this business of survival. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else and my\nuncle, who is, the one who is still alive, reminded me that my constant question to him was,\npractically hourly, \u201cHow long will this last? How long will this last?\u201d This was my constant\nquestion. I was just counting the hours. We knew that the, that the streetfighting between the\nGermans and the Russians cannot be more than a couple of city blocks away. We saw German\nsoldiers, injured, moving down the street and we heard, practically, the gunfire as if 1t were next to\nus. Some people came in injured who reported that just a couple of blocks from us there were\nalready Russian soldiers so it was that, that, that tension that kept me from doing anything else\nexcept just waiting for that final onslaught when I can see that our area 1s liberated. There was just\nno mood for playing. We were not children. None of us were children. We were, all our\nconversations, I remember, with the, with the kids of my age down there, all, everything was always\nrevolving around survival.",
        "A: No, before the actual siege, yes, I, 1 still contacted sometimes my old Boy Scout comrades, they\nwere the ones that I kept up with. But once of course, the siege started then, there was no chance to,\nto go out and do anything like that.",
        "A: Oh yes, well, remember these were not school, these were not school people, I told you that. No,\nthese are all from various, the Boy Scout group, the membership consisted of people from anywhere\nin Budapest and for various areas and quite a few of them survived. So, even after the war, of\ncourse, we met for awhile and then we decided there is nothing in it for us anymore and that\u2019s when\nI joined the Zionist Movement. That gave me a lot more important goals than the Boy Scouts.",
        "A: No. Some of them did go in, you know, some of them did go in. But others weren\u2019t. And so we\ncommunicated and visited with a couple of, who were outside.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Strictly, you know, strictly so. We didn\u2019t want any conversation, any, any public place\nthat can be overheard. Because our main concern was the kind of topic that others shouldn\u2019t hear.",
        "A: Well, where are the Russian forces? What did you hear? All this. What did the radio say? We\ndidn\u2019t have any radios, the Jews, right? But those who were hiding, and were perhaps with a\nChristian family, they could still listen to BBC so that was the, the entire existence was the war and\nthe topics were just that.",
        "A: Well, theoretically, we were supposed to treat fascist officials according to all the papers and the,\nthe permit that our leader, you know, had. But there was such chaos in the last few weeks, you\nknow, when the siege of Budapest started, that we treated everybody who came in from the street\nwho was injured. And it was pathetic, sometimes, that people would come in with some very minor\nproblems and leave the clinic, and within minutes they were brought back with, with practically\ntheir guts out. In other words, in order to reach us, they went through such danger that they lost\ntheir lives, eventually. We had, we had no medicine left, we had practically nothing. So we\ncouldn\u2019t do much. Anybody, anybody was treated. And doctors are doctors. I was always\ninterested in, especially when there was a fascist official, what did they do to him? Would they take\nadvantage of the fact that here we are, you know, lost all family members and all this, but I talked\nto, this interested me and I talked to some of the doctors and they said there\u2019s no such thing, a\ndoctor cannot do that.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t. By that time, there was no contact, nothing. Everybody\u2019s out for, for itself. There\nwas, there was just, everything collapsed. The streets were ruled by twelve year old children with\nsubmachine guns and disenfrised [sic], uneducated laborers who never amounted to anything, and\nthis was their way to get their revenge. They were shooting first, truly and asking questions after. It\nwas, it was the, a total reign of terror.",
        "A: Before the siege, it was already leading up to this because they, as soon as the Arrow Cross\nmovement took over on October 15, the, they started. It was just as bad. And the minute the\nadmiral who was the head of Hungary, Admiral Horthy finished his speech in which he announced\nthat as far as he was concerned the war was lost, at that moment, you know, hell broke loose. He\nwas atrested, his bodyguards were arrested.",
        "A: No, well, we, that was the date when the house, the story I told you began to get, take shape, okay?\nThis was when we kind of put our heads together and we learned that this psychiatrist is taking steps\nto bring this man in and all this. We had to act very quickly because events were really coming to\nan end. The Russians were approaching Budapest rapidly and we knew that again, that gives the,\nthese guys very little time to kill all of us. And they were getting more and more vicious,\namazingly. Instead of saving their skin, they became even more violent.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Right, right. I had, you know, the uniform and the ID and all this. I was sent to get our rations, you\nknow, I was sent to pick up some papers or pick up medicine. Yeah, I was Justa...",
        "A: Well, the, the Red, if I remember correctly, we had some, some very vague contact with the Red\nCross, I probably picked up medicine from them or something for the, for the organization. But\npersonally, I had no as a, as an individual, I had no contact other than with the, just with the Swiss\nEmbassy. I told you I had a Switz, Swiss schutzpass, that by the time the Arrow Cross movement\nstarted, meant very little.",
        "A: Well, you could go to the Swedish Embassy or the Swiss Embassy and they would, put you on the\nlist and eventually would give it to you. And it was really just a, kind of a, a smokescreen. There\nwas not much, if you were lucky, they respected it and they let you go. If you were unlucky, they\njust tore 1t apart and said, \u201cStep into the wagon,\u201d you know, and you were gone. You could never,\nnever know. It, those embassies issued this in good faith but the people who looked at it, you were\nat the mercy of those. And I just happened to go to the Swiss one, but the Swedish did it and then\nprobably you heard the story, the Japanese, 1t was a Japanese in, in, not in Hungary, I think it was in\nLithuania or somewhere, did the same thing.",
        "A: So, in Hungary, it was mainly the Swedish and the, and the Swiss and I think the Vatican too.\nThere was some, even though that the Primate of Hungary was almost like a collaborator. He did\nnot really act very courageously under the Nazi era.",
        "A: Yes. It was in December, if I know, December 20\" or something, very close to Christmas. That\u2019s\nwhen it... really, it just, all of a sudden we were shot at from every direction. We knew that\nBudapest was totally surrounded. The airplanes were just coming day and night. They were called\nratas, R, A, T, A, these small Soviet airplanes machine-gunning anything on the street that moved.\nIt was very dangerous to get out on the street. And of course, then, when it came to night, anybody\nwas moving could have been also shot by the fascists, by the Arrow Cross people, \u2018cause they were\nalso moving. And it, it was a lot of noise, a lot of injuries, a smell of, of the stench of, of gunpowder\nand, and corpses came closer, you know? War has a certain smell, a very very unpleasant smell that\nyou can really honestly feel. And as a child, I learned that. That\u2019s, that\u2019s all I can tell you, but...",
        "A: Yes, the entire Budapest lived in basements. Some of the newer houses\u2019 basements were clean,\nperhaps dry, you know. And you could make it with a little effort to become temporary living\nquarters. But those built in the 19\" century, they were damp, dark, they were just awful. Cold.\nAnd luckily, that this house, this Zichy Jeno Street was a fairly, fairly new house. And the basement\nwas livable. Now where I lived, where I lived before, in most of my life, back, that basement was\nsuch that I, oh, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to spend any time right there because it was a damp, old\ntypical, what you see almost in Dickensian, you know, movies or read about Dickensian novels.\nAlso, there were rats, loved this kind of a moist dark environment. But here, I remember our\nbasement as quite civilized in, in this house. So it was, the hardship was not really bad and so many\npeople, the heat, I think, of the bodies made up for the cold outside.",
        "A: Oh, I would say we were a few hundred people in that basement, yeah?",
        "A: Oh, it, it would be like a floor, an entire floor of the house, because it was, usually the basements\nwere what you can consider a low floor. So, it\u2019s, I cannot really describe it in, in square footage\nbecause at that time I didn\u2019t even, I didn\u2019t even know about that, but it, it was a good size apartment\nhouse floor, okay, just picture it. And there were mattresses down, and everybody brought the\nmattresses down, and there were people very closely situated and, was in a way, it was kind of a\nwarm place.",
        "A: There were a few, but mainly the separate rooms were, were given to the doctors for operation,\noperating rooms and, and supply rooms and things like that. Most of the people lived in, in these\nbig open areas.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Up until the, practically the last minute. And then the liberation, January 18, 1s when\nwe heard the emergency wall of our basement. We heard a knock and by law, there was a, an\nemergency entrance to every one of these basements between two houses that consisted only of one\nlayer of bricks. So, and there had to be a pick next to it. So we heard that a pick was working,\nbreaking through. And then, must have been about four o\u2019clock, five o\u2019clock in the morning and all\nof a sudden the furred hat half of a young Russian soldier, Soviet soldier, came through first and\nthen the whole body. And this was first time, I think, that he got a hug from people because, and he\ncouldn\u2019t understand why, he was absolutely bewildered because, of course, the Soviet soldiers were\nnot welcomed with great enthusiasm anywhere since most Hungarians were hoping for a German\nvictory and we, we were just hugging and kissing him.",
        "A: We were, yeah, bringing in people from just the vicinity, okay, very close vicinity. And people\nwould come in on their own too, you know, with a, with a shrapnel or something in their leg or a\nsmall injury.",
        "A: Well, we had beans. We, we, I remember that we practically had beans every day. Beans, beans\nand beans. As long as you have beans, you can really survive. And water, yeah, water was dripping\nbut still, we could get at enough water to, for drinking. Nobody took a shower, that\u2019s for sure.\nThere was no way.",
        "A: Yep. People had these little, you know, stoves. A lot of people had little stoves and they shared\nthose, whole families. There was, amazingly, it was a very peaceful environment because we all,\nwe only had one important thing 1n our mind, to get out of there, alive. And people shared.",
        "A: Yes, nobody, there was no such thing as leaving somebody starving or leaving somebody without\nfuel, or, I remember that everybody was doing their best. And of course, there are small little\nskirmishes mainly a couple of old people who just didn\u2019t understand the situation completely, and\nhad unreasonable demands or something and we had to step on their toes, and... But no basic, no,\nno big problems.",
        "A: It\u2019s hard for me to look back but I would say we had at least thirty doctors there, at least. And we\nare talking about the cream of, of the Hungarian Jewish doctors, you know? Really, they went out\nand famous professors from universities so this man, this Doctor V\u00e9lgyessi? who was the\npsychiatrist living in the house originally, he had a very large circle of friends, and so he managed to\ngather the ones that he could and brought them in. And there were many other people, I don\u2019t know\nhow they got there. I just read a few years ago that the chief architect of Budapest, the main\narchitect of Budapest today, was with me in the basement in this house. I... somebody sent me, I\nthink, a newspaper article or while in visiting in Budapest I saw it, he gave an interview about it.\nBecause it was the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation of Budapest this year.",
        "A: Jereczian?",
        "A: Oh he stayed, he stayed all the time, he stayed, he never left the place. Yeah. So, no, he was there\nall the time. And if he had to leave for some reason, he made sure that he left enough people there\nto, to protect us.",
        "A: Yes, apparently, apparently and why he even joined them and what was his job there, I don\u2019t know.\nI don\u2019t know. Since I left in 1948, you know, and I think that probably it took a few years to write\nabout these things and clear up this thing and I was not there in these, from \u201948 to 50. And after I\ncame back, you just didn\u2019t want to, those were the worst years of Stalinism and you didn\u2019t want to\nget involved with anything because you didn\u2019t know what he was doing at that time and so, no\nquestions asked was the best policy. But, later on in the sixties and seventies, I heard that he was a\nconcert impressario and that he took certain shows back to Budapest. And I even saw his name and\nI am, I really regret that I didn\u2019t go to see him. I should have looked for him somehow and talked to\nhim. So I feel so strongly about this whole thing that if I knew today that he is still alive, living, I\nwould probably go to Vienna. That\u2019s where he lived and, and, and just thank him again. But I\nknow that he received a great deal of recognition from people. But I know, I don\u2019t know exactly\nwhat, if he\u2019s alive today. He was, I would say, about ten, at least ten, fifteen years older than I, so\nit\u2019s hard to say.",
        "A: What did I do after that? Well, I did what probably is a natural thing to do. I went with the Russian\nsoldiers and whenever they broke into a store and they broke into every store that still had anything,\nI went with them. And after they were through and took what they wanted to take, I took what I\nwanted to take. In other words, I did what we called zabralny which means to confiscate things. I\nwas full of hate, I was full of frustration and I thought this, this was the way to get even, probably.\nAnd, I had a little store at home, a kind of a little supply of all these stolen goods that I got from\nshops that were just there, most people wouldn\u2019t dare to go in with the Russians, but I put back my\nyellow star and I went with them and unless I bumped into some Ukrainians, who were famous anti-\nSemites and beat the hell out of you, the, the others, they, they were welcoming you. They said go\nahead. Also, we had a, a little Jewish domestic from Romania with us, who joined us and helped\nmy, my mother and she also spent the last few months with us in this, in this basement. And she\nwas from Romania and with the Russians we had Romanian troops coming in. And she was a\nbeautiful young girl, nineteen, and the Romanian officers were just, just absolutely crazy about her.\nSo she took me by the hand and she said, \u201c\u201cCome with me.\u201d\u2019 And she went with these Romanians to\nall the jewelry stores and she amassed a fortune within days in jewelry. And then said goodbye to\nus and disappeared. We never found out what happened to her. She had a fiancee in Romania,\nwhether she found him or not, we suspected she eventually ended up in Israel like most young\npeople of that time. But I went with her and Romanian officers, I went with Russians. I was kind\nof a street urchin for awhile. I enjoyed the fact that nobody, nobody can really give me any orders.\nAnd my mother could not control me either, you know? I was now a man and I was just intoxicated\nby this, and so I had a little store there, that, with all the stolen goods, and my father saw this when\nhe came home and found out, asked me what happened and I told him. And he was absolutely just\nhorrified that I would do something like this and made me take everything back to the stores where I\ngot it from. It was interesting, he got a little cart for me, we put everything on it and he came with\nme and he stayed outside and I had to deliver it back. And I tell you, some of those people could\nnot believe that this happened. And today, of course, I feel very good about this but not, not at that\ntime. So, in, 1t took me only a year or two to realize that I, my real emotions that I\u2019m not a\nHungarian, I never had a Hungarian passport, you know? I never had any, any identity, Hungarian\nidentity. They, I was always being denied of being a Hungarian even though my parents were born\nin Hungary and practically everybody back generations born in Hungary and so I joined the Zionist\nMovement. And in 1948, the, the, the Communists completely took over the government. They\ncalled it the Year of Turn. And all other organizations except for Communist youth organizations\nwere banned. So again now I was in the underground Zionist organization.\nEnd of Tape 3, Side A\nTape 3, Side B",
        "A: Well, I told you, before, that, it, we knew because of an emissary that he had sent ahead of him who\nthen by small dosage made us aware of the fact that he was alive, that he was coming, but of course,\nit was a tremendous emotional experience for him to appear there and, the fact that he immediately\nunderstood why there are two families living in the apartment and, and, and accepted our decision, it\nwas just a very nice homecoming. Because number one, we saw him, number two he brought food,\nwhich helped us to have a little feast then, and number three is that he, we knew that that\u2019s what he\nwould have done, he would have split the living quarters and would not throw a family of four,\nfamily of five who were out of their own, well, problems, housed in our place. We... naturally, we\nwere totally just overwhelmed by emotions for awhile and then, set out to see the rest of the family.\nHe wanted to see his brothers and sisters and, and, that\u2019s, this is what happened.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. Zichy utca. Yeah, I left 1t practically the day after we were liberated and went back to see\nwhat happened to our apartment. And that\u2019s where I found that family living in it. \u2018Kay? And, then\nshortly we moved back with my mother and so after a few months, I think it must have been April\nor May when my father finally appeared.",
        "A: It was, very scarce. But again, this aunt of ours, of mine, who played such an important role in\nsaving all of us, again, she and I, we teamed up and went, which was very customary then for city\npeople to do, took jewelry and possessions of the family that we thought farmers might like to have\nand we could put on our body, and walked about, I would say, thirty, forty kilometer, about twenty\nmiles from Budapest, and exchange it for food. We also hired a person with a horse to drag it back\nto Budapest. It was mainly flour, lard, necessities, but of course, a horse was immediately a red flag\nin, in the eyes of the Russians because they confiscated every horse, everything that could be used\nfor transporting their goods. And we were caught midway between this place and Budapest,\ncoming back, in a small Danubian village. On the other side of the Danube, there was a battle going\non. And we knew that it doesn\u2019t affect anything, because the Danube is a very wide river and the\nGermans didn\u2019t have any means to get over and why would they come over, but there was a battle\nover there because Trans-Danubia was not liberated yet. And so the Russians were very edgy and\nthey confiscated the cart, they confiscated the food, they confiscated the horse and then, they also\nincarcerated my aunt and myself. And I have no idea what happened, but the next... my aunt was\nwith me in the room and the, the Russian captain came in and took her out and she came back a few\nhours later and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everything is going to be fine.\u201d And the next morning, we\nwere given back the cart, the horse, the man who was the owner of the horse and cart and the food\nand everything else and let go. And I can only guess what was the price. The only thing I regret is\nthat we heard that after delivering the stuff to our home and sharing it with the family, when the, the\nfarmer whose, who had the horse and the cart went back, eventually, was caught and lost both. So\nyes, if you had still some belongings that farmers would appreciate, you could have food. Because\nthe farmers always have food.",
        "A: Ah, probably, a few weeks and then, the, the UNRRA, the American Jewish organizations were also\nsending packages and, and would supply us regularly. So that helped too. We were not really, you\nknow, in danger of, of starving to death.",
        "A: Yes, I went back to school, to high school, and eventually finished practically, my high school at the\nage of eighteen. And just a few weeks before, practically, of finishing, my Zionist Organization\ngive me signals that 1t was time to go to Israel because they couldn\u2019t guarantee that we would have\nmore time. The Communist Police was and the border guards were really closing everything very\ntightly. So, I, my instructions were to say goodbye to my family and get either an instrument or an\ninstrument case, that was instruction number one. Then I was called by my Zionist leaders and, and\nasked if it is true that my mother comes from this northern Hungarian town, I said yes. They said,\n\u201cDo us a favor. Go to that town, introduce yourself as, so they can recognize that you are, your\nmother is related,\u201d and all this and that, \u201cand ask them if they would like to have a high school\norchestra to play a concert in town. And if they say yes,\u2019 \u2014which probably they would, they said,\nbecause which little town doesn\u2019t like a free concert\u2014 \u201cgo to a printer, here 1s money and have nice\nposters printed.\u201d And they give me the date. I went, I talked to the mayor, he was overwhelmed, I\nwent to the printer, I had all the prints made and I didn\u2019t realize at that time that this was the alibi\njust in case we would be caught because this town is on the way to the border, my mother\u2019s\nbirthplace. On a given day, we boarded the bus, the bus was a state-owned bus by that time from a\nstate-owned company. We were all either holding an instrument or having an instrument case so\npeople thought this was a high school orchestra and while singing Communist songs, we took off\nfor the border. On the border, when we got close to this town, we kept on going and the bus driver\nsaid that he was hungry, we were hungry too so we stopped in a, in a certain pub or so and this was\nin 1948, February. We were eating there and getting something to drink and a woman began to flirt\nwith the bus driver. And we were horrified because that would, everything would cause a problem,\nwe, we knew that we had a definite plan. And soon the bus driver said that he would like to take\nabout a half an hour rest and my, our leader argued with him but he said, \u201cAll right, go.\u201d And as\nsoon as he disappeared, he gathered us and he said, \u201cGo across this field and there is a barn there\nand don\u2019t ask any questions, just get into the barn.\u201d That\u2019s what we did. They closed the barn and\naround midnight, or so, or later, we were marched down to the Ipoly River which is the river\nbetween Czechoslovakia and Hungary and to our great amazement, who was leading us?\u2014the\npeasant woman who was in the pub. She shed her twelve skirts or so because those women still\nwore many, many skirts, this was the, the thing. Now she had a leather jacket and blue jeans and\nshe spoke Hebrew with our leader. She was a, an Israeli army officer, born to Hungarian parents\nwho spoke perfect Hungarian and this was her job, to distract. And she led us down to the river,\neverything was supposed to happen so that on the other side of the river, this was Czechoslovakia\nand the reason we had to go to Czechoslovakia and not to Austria because the border between\nAustria and Hungary was already closed and tightly controlled but the Czechs were still kind of in\nbetween this Year of Turn and the Democratic regime that was there before. The, the end, at the\nend we crossed the river but instead of getting into the trucks, the border guards stayed and started\nto talk right there which was odd and very painful because there was snow on the ground. It was\nvery cold in February, we were wet and we had to lie on the ground for about a half an hour when\nthey finally left. Then we couldn\u2019t find a truck, the truck left, too, who was supposed to wait for us.\nSo it took us about a half a day to find it and, finally, we were taken to Bratislava, where the\ngendarmerie was paid off. We were nominally arrested by the gendarmerie and he put into a warm\nplace in the synagogue, there was straw on the floor, I remember, and the next morning, we were\ntaken to the railroad station, put in boxcarts [sic] and within about a half an hour they opened. We\nwere in Vienna, in the American section of, of, of Vienna. At that time, Vienna was divided. So\nthis was my, my great escape to Israel. And from there on, of course, we were taken down and\neventually ended up in Israel.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes. I mean, they, they, they, I felt that I was among brothers and sisters and I felt\u2014at that time\nremember it was the last few weeks of the war\u2014that I was, if I fought, I was going to fight for, for\nthe Jewish homeland. And I already associated myself more with that than with Hungary. That\nwas, every young person needs a fatherland and that was mine, even though I\u2019d never seen it before.\nSo, it was an emotional thing and I stayed in Israel for two day, two years.",
        "A: Of course, they were very, very upset and very sad. But I said, \u201cYou can come and, and join me,\u201d\nyou know. And we agreed that they would but of course, they couldn\u2019t, because after we left, 1t was\nimpossible to, to leave Hungary for awhile. So, I corresponded and this was, this was one of the\nreasons why I returned eventually, in 1950 to Hungary, \u201ccause I realized that I needed to make up\nfor the years that my father was away. So I returned to Hungary and it was the worst of the Stalinist\nera. It was like 1984, it was terrible.",
        "A: No, my father never really made an issue out of this. He never made an issue out of this, you know?\nOne way or another. Just, he, he, he loved his environment, Budapest. He loved to go to the coffee\nhouse and play cards with his friends and drink coffee and, and, probably gossip or whatever,\npolitics. He loved that. And he told us a cute little joke. They always asked him why doesn\u2019t he\nfollow me, when he was already alone, after my mother died and he, he said, \u201cI tell you a joke.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cMr. Kohn sits in this famous Hungarian coffee house\u2019\u201d\u2014it was called Hungaria, it\u2019s a very\nfamous, or New York, it had two names. New York before and after the German occupation, called\nHungaria because you couldn\u2019t give a place New York. Anyway, Mr. Kohn sits there and people\nsay, \u201cMr. Kohn, it is now the 1940s, we are after the war, all your friends are gone. They\u2019re all in\nNew York, what are you doing here alone in the coffee house?\u201d And Mr. Kohn said, \u201cLook son,\nwhat would I have done had I also left for New York? I would have arrived there one day and the\nnext day I would have looked for my old friends and I would have found them and the third day we\nwould have sat down to talk, about what? The good old days in the coffee house.\u201d He said, \u201cLook\nson, I am already in the coffee house.\u201d And my father always said, \u201cThis is my coffee house.\u201d In\nother words, this was his life, this was his environment. You know, he was always on his feet, he\nwas always going around in Budapest and he was also working almost up to the last year just before\nhe died. He was, he just couldn\u2019t be without work. He was a workaholic and he knew that in this\ncountry, you need language. And he had very poor language facilities, he would have never learned\nEnglish. So, it was a realization but we, we saw him as much as we could.",
        "A: Basically, I spent most of my time in kibbutz, living in a kibbutz. I learned to work with the tractors\nat that time, and then we, with a hundred other Hungarian, young Hungarian youth, most of them\nfrom my old organization from Hungary, we received land near the Jordanian border by a town\ncalled Afula and started our own settlement. So, I was really working the, as a farmer, kibbutz.",
        "A: Very little, almost none. I got there very late, remember, so I do not claim any, any real major role\nat all. No.",
        "A: In 1950, then, it was part of a homesickness for my parents and part of stupidity on my part, that I\nbelieved that things are the way Communist papers describe it in Hungary. I decided to return,\nperhaps temporarily, perhaps not. And when I arrived in Hungary, I realized that it was a fatal\nmistake.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no. I found my parents, but other than that, it was, 1t was a terrible period for any human being,\nespecially people who came from the West. It was the worst for those, because you were\nconsidered unreliable and especially coming from Israel, even more so. The reason was, that by that\ntime, Stalin was very paranoid and Zionism was one of his main targets. So, it, it, this 1s, this is\nsomething that is not much to do with the Holocaust anymore. It was just very hard for anybody to\nlive under Communist rule at that time, but especially for Jews. Well, I don\u2019t know if you know\nthat in 1953 when he was dying, he looked up and he saw some Jewish doctors around his deathbed\nand he said, \u201cThey are poisoning me, they\u2019re against me.\u201d And he said, \u201cArrest them.\u201d And\npractically hours before he died, they arrested Jewish doctors and I was just at the University in\nHungary, studying and that was my state, the time of my state examination. And Hungary had to\nfollow everything that the Soviet Union did so they were looking for anybody who had anything to\ndo with Zionism. And they found me at the university and I was let go, weeks before my state\nexam. So, it, 1t was difficult but of course that has nothing to do with the Holocaust anymore.",
        "A: Yes and no. Yes and no. I had some very deep feelings about the country as such and then again, I\nwas still a young man, eighteen, and I was also influenced by a great deal of these revolutionary\nMarxist ideas. And there were many things that were not to my liking, that I would have loved to\nsee differently. And so when I left Israel, I did not just leave it with nostalgia. I left it because I\nthought that finally, somehow, in Hungary, I\u2019m going to find, find that utopistic state, that, that is, is\njustice and equality for everyone. And, I was just a little bit too stupid, to, to think that way, but I\ndid. So it a was a, a double reason to return. A, a totally unfounded idealism and homesickness.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t work for awhile because I was unreliable, anybody who came from the West, especially\nfrom Israel. Finally, with some great connections, I was hired to sweep and clean a garage, a state-\nowned garage. And that would have been my future for a long time, had it not been for a, just a, a\nvery fortunate incident when the Party secretary of my, my company was sick and a substitute Party\nsecretary was there. And I appeared at her office because there were big posters, they wanted\nworkers youth to go to college because they figure that some of the middle class and the former\nupper class that sends its sons to college and I asked if she can recommend me and she said, \u201cWell,\nI don\u2019t know you but why don\u2019t you dictate a recommendation to my secretary?\u201d And so that was\nthe big first hurdle that I went through because the regular Party secretary would have never written\nthat letter. So, with this, I went to a university forum, but the trouble is you had to write your\nautobiography, and the minute they got to a point of Israel, which you could not in those days just\nstay silent about two years of your life, when they found out they said \u2018Thanks but no thanks,\u2019 and\nagain a strange thing happened. One of the faculty members who was on the committee, cause the\ncommittee that interviewed people consisted of faculty member, Communist Youth Organization,\nthe Communist Party, the union, various organizations. He came after me and he said, \u201cHolczer,\nHolczer,\u201d he said, \u201cwas your father from the suburb of Budapest?\u201d I said yes. He said, \u201cWas there a\nsoccer team in which he and four or five of his brothers played at the same time?\u201d I said yes. He\nsaid, \u201cI played with your dad.\u201d He said, \u201c(Come back in September,\u201d he says \u201cYou were a minor\nwhen you left Hungary. Let\u2019s see if the minister of education can exempt you,\u201d you know\u2019?\nAmnesty you, pardon you, whatever. Well, anyway, I went back in September and nobody knew\nwho I was, nobody, they had no idea, go away. So I looked for him and he went in to the Party\nsecretary and he came out and he said, and he said, \u201cI am happy to inform you that the minister of\neducation give you a dispensation. You can enter the university.\u201d And he said, \u201cThis is the last\ntime you and I ever talk to each other.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t even greet me.\u201d He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know\nme.\u201d And that was it. This is how I got in. Yeah. So it was two coincidences, very lucky ones.\nEnd of Tape 3, Side B\nTape 4, Side A",
        "A: 1950.",
        "A: I studied, my major was geography and my minor was history.",
        "A: I wanted to be a geographer. I wanted to work for the Geographic Institute of Hungary or teach\ngeography. I love geography. And, in Hungary, it was a very important subject at that time. But in\nAmerica, it was no subject at all. I, when I arrived here, people were just looking at me and they\nsaid, \u201cNo, this is, unfortunately, we are not teaching geography here.\u201d It was incorporated into what\nthey called social studies in the high school.",
        "A: So, I switched and I made, I went back to school here in 1959, and switched and had a history\nmajor, \u2018kay. And I left geography just out there, I didn\u2019t touch it anymore, so I got a master\u2019s\ndegree in history and my secondary credentials, teaching credentials.",
        "A: Then I taught in a junior high school in the suburbs of Budapest, working-class suburb in Budapest\nuntil 1956, when the Revolution broke out and I left.",
        "A: Just a very minor one. In the 19\" district of Budapest, I was asked to form the New Democratic\nTeachers\u2019 Union. And I had very ambivalent feelings about the revolution because I was afraid that\nthe same elements, the same kind of elements who came up in 1944, October 15, eventually will\ndominate it. I just did not trust the revolution so I stayed away from it. I understood the anger of\nthe people and I sympathized with the, with the desire to have a free country, but I didn\u2019t trust some\nof the groups that participated in it. And what, what really precipitated my departure is that a few\ndays before I left, I saw some groups with Arrow Cross armbands, and that did it. I realized that I\nwould never be able to live here anymore. There will be absolutely no, no peace for somebody who\nis either a human being or, or has a Jewish background or favors a peaceful living, lifestyle.",
        "A: All the time. Hungarians are with the Austrians and Poles, probably the three most anti-Semitic\ncountries in Europe. I felt much less anti-Semitism frankly in Germany in my nineteen years that I\nrecently spent there than in Hungary or in Austria.",
        "A: Yes, I decided to leave Hungary and in 1956, November, I started to walk toward the border with a\ncousin of mine who just graduated from high school and was always in political trouble with the\npolice for his outspoken attitude, so, he followed, he came with me, and we then crossed the border\nafter, I think about six, seven days or so. And arrived in Austria.",
        "A: No, it was totally illegal. We were walking usually from dawn to dusk and whatever the conditions\nwere, you know, favorable, we didn\u2019t really like to walk in broad daylight but of course we couldn\u2019t\nwalk in the darkness either because we didn\u2019t know the terrain. We slept in, in haylofts, the farmers\nwere quite kind. They felt probably a little bit guilty for not participating in the revolution and\nslowly approached the border this way. And then before the border, 1t was then a little bit difficult,\nand we had to have, we had connections because a third person joined us whose relatives lived in a\nborder town and they helped us to get over.",
        "A: Yes. My parents were still there and I told them definitely that this time I want them to follow me,\neventually, when they can come legally. Because I didn\u2019t want them to, they were by that time, the\nage when you don\u2019t just chase somebody across snowfields. So, we arrived in Graz, that was the\nfirst Austrian town, and you had all the opportunity to go then anywhere in the world. Every\ncountry opened its arms. [dog barking] Lie down, Gelsey.",
        "A: And the world was then open to us and I intended to go to Sweden. I wanted to stay in Europe, and\nI just thought that Sweden would be a good place for me to, to be. But my cousin got away from\nme while we were staying in Salzburg, in, in a hotel which was one of the gathering points for the\nHungarian refugees, and left a note for me to come and follow him. And I promised his mother that\nI would take care of him so I followed him and this is how I ended up 1n the U.S.",
        "A: Yes. Well, of course, it was very easy. All I had to do is go and tell the authorities there, the, the\nones who were in charge of the Hungarian refugees that instead of Sweden, I changed my mind and\nI want to go to the U.S. Not only that, they already, they already had some messages from the Red\nCross saying that if I show up, and the reason I was away, because previously he had asked me to\ngo to Vienna and arrange for him to stay with his relatives in Vienna who were not my relatives, but\nhe wanted to go to school there. He was totally intoxicated by the, by the light, western lifestyle\nbecause he had never been to the West. And by the time I came back to Salzburg, he was gone. So,\nbut he left messages. So the Red Cross sent me to St. Louis, Missouri to be reunited with him.",
        "A: No, he, he was just, he was a very unpredictable fellow, you know? You could not really, he was,\nhe was a just a restless person and I think he figured, well, why not, I want to see the U.S. and, and\nhis message to me was, \u201cYou can always go to Sweden from the U.S. You will have the money and\nopportunity, but maybe you won\u2019t have the opportunity to go and see the U.S. if you live in\nSweden.\u201d Little, little did he know about economic conditions in the eighties and nineties that, I\nthink, more Swedes can travel much easier and come here than we in Sweden.",
        "A: You know, I am a romantic. And I just felt that I would not want to leave Europe. Europe, to me,\nwas always my home. I loved the old towns, and I always loved clarity and that, the Scandinavian\npurity, maybe, that I have seen too many, I had seen too many Scandinavian movies, Swedish\nmovies. But they just appealed to me, the lifestyle. And I liked the fact that the social security, that\npeople have in Scandinavian countries, especially in Sweden. And just a lot of things appealed to\nme about Sweden, and I knew that I would be treated fairly, so, that was it.",
        "A: No, I had no money. We didn\u2019t need any money. [talkover] No. Nobody had any money. All you\ndid was as a refugee, you appeared at, when, when we finally were picked up and taken to Graz by\nthe Austrian police, they were very well organized there, there, you found every religious\ndenomination having a booth, who welcomed you. You could go and say that I am a Baptist, I am a\nCatholic, made no difference and then name the country where you wanted to go to. And, and it\nwas very simple, you didn\u2019t need any money. Then, next step was each had a place in Austria\nwhere they temporarily would house you, even give you a little pocket money and there you waited\nfor your transportation to go to that country. And that so, I did not really want to be attached to any\nreligious organization so I went to a very independent one called the Tolstoy Foundation. It was\nfounded by Tolstoy\u2019s daughter and, using I think the, the royalties of Tolstoy\u2019s books, and so they\nare the ones who brought me to the U.S. It was all gratis. I came over, the American military and\nthe Air Force is the one who flew all Hungarian refugees over. MATS, Military Air Transportation,\nthe, the stewardesses and almost everybody involved with us were of, of Hungarian origin, most of\nthem from Cleveland. Cleveland is the second largest Hungarian city in the world after Budapest.\nAnd, and so here, they then, then I was handed over to a Jewish organization because my cousin\ncame through a Jewish organization. So in St. Louis they were waiting for me. If you were a\nHungarian refugee those days, you had no problem because the world, the whole world felt very\nguilty about not helping the Revolution and so they did everything possible. I mean I was so\nembarrassed. I never, I was never in my life treated this way, I thought, you know, I was some\ndignitary or something. They were waiting for me at the airport and I was just... But first I had to\nspend, like most Hungarians, some time at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey which was a screening\ncamp for people. They screened out the sick, the U.S. did not take, I think, people with TB and\nsome other illnesses, they went to Scandinavia, the Swedes did, and also Communist Party members\nand such. I don\u2019t know what the criteria was, but they looked into your background a little bit. And\nso this is how I ended up in St. Louis. My cousin stayed with me for about no more than two\nmonths, not even that much. He found some relatives in Chicago who would help him to go to\nChampagne, the University of Illinois, and he just left. And we were housed, we were taken by an\nAmerican family who had very good intentions but the man was a manic depressive so you could\nnever figure out for one second to another how he would react to you. And, apparently, his wife felt\nthat maybe taking Hungarian refugees in would, would somehow remedy the problem but it didn\u2019t.\nAnd they had a mentally retarded child, so it was not a very ideal situation for a newcomer although\nshe was very nice to me and I stayed there for a few months and then eventually, I met a professor\nof Hungarian ancestry and origin at the University of, Washington University in St. Louis who had\nin Aspen, Colorado, a house, and he and his family spent every summer there because he was a\nmember of the music festival. And when they heard... I hated St. Louis, I just couldn\u2019t find\nanything redeeming about that, that city, and when they heard that I was very unhappy and all this,\nthey took me to Aspen, Colorado and they said, \u201cYou can always work here for a dollar an hour,\ntoo.\u201d And I loved it. I stayed there for almost three years. And most of my friends and connections\nand everything in my American life practically comes from that period. From my Aspen period,\npeople who helped me to get ahead in, in more ways than one. So, I am, I was very lucky again to\nend up there. Of course, those days Aspen was not what it is today, you know.",
        "A: I was, no, from Aspen was a place where I collected my money and, and, you know, saved enough.\nI wanted to go up to Alaska for one summer. I went up to Alaska and worked for the Forest Service\nand then came to Fresno, California, which offered me a loan. I couldn\u2019t get a scholarship because\nthey didn\u2019t know much about me. My papers did not arrive from Hungary. So it was, but at least\nthey offered me a National Defense Loan so that helped me to start school. And I stayed in Fresno\nfor two years when I got my teaching credentials and my master\u2019s degree in history. And I, those\nwere, scholastically speaking, they were good years. I had very good instructors and, and good\nfriends and sponsors and, I did not regret it. And then I ended up in the Bay Area where I wanted to\nbe. And met my wife there. And I was teaching in Marin County.",
        "A: Yes. All the time. And I, almost every summer I went home to visit, okay?",
        "A: Yes. They, once I got married in \u201967, they came to visit and they enjoyed it very much and then in\n1974, when, see I married my wife with three children. They were tiny, their, their father\nabandoned them, he was alcoholic. And so, my wife and I raised them. And by the time, 1974, I\nget an offer from a friend of mine in Switzerland to come and help him, he was a director of a\nschool in a children\u2019s village in Switzerland, Pestalozzy, very famous children\u2019s village, Pestalozzy\nChildren\u2019s Village. Do you speak German?",
        "A: No. Okay. And so, and I loved the mountains, I loved the Alps and I wanted to get back to Europe.\nAnd since we had only one child at home by that time, and he was willing to come so we went over.\nWe, we resigned our jobs and we went back and the job fell through. Because in the meantime, the\nSwiss had the law, not a law, a plebiscite about not hiring foreigners unless they can find a local\nperson for the job. And after years of advertisement for this particular position, they couldn\u2019t find\nanybody, a couple came just as we were being interviewed. So it fell through and in 1964, no I\nmean 1965, before I got married, I came over to Europe to teach for the Army, just for a year. I just\nneeded, I was a very confirmed bachelor, and I needed a year to think about whether I want to marry\nsomebody with three small children and here a confirmed bachelor. So I stayed for a year when I\ndecided yes, but during the year, I got to know a lot of people in the system, in the Department of\nDefense School System. So now that the job fell through and we basically gave up our jobs here in\nthe States, I had only one, you know, opportunity here, to go over and see if any of our, our, any of\nmy former colleagues can be found and if I can get any help to get a job for my wife and myself.\nAnd not only that I found some but they were now in very, very high positions and they said, no\nproblem. And both of us, within a year, started to teach. My wife got a job even before me,\nbecause it was more difficult for high school teachers than elementary. So she started out and we\nlived in the Frankfurt area and we stayed for nineteen years.",
        "A: We, when I left school with my credentials, I wanted to, I had a girlfriend in the Bay Area, also\nfrom Aspen. She was a schoolteacher and she wanted me to get a job there so we can be close and\nwe were there. Now all of a sudden, she said, oh, at that time it was very, by that time it was very\ndifficult to get a job for a teacher, in the early sixties, and the only job available, finally, was\nteaching special ed classes. And I said, children are children, I don\u2019t care. I had to sign a paper that\nI would go to school and get a credential. And the man who hired me was also a Holocaust survivor\nso it, 1t really helped. I told him very honestly why I want the job and I said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter why\nI want the job, I will, I will do a good job, you can, you can bet on that.\u201d And I hope I did. So, he\nhired me and this is where I met my wife. She was also teaching special ed classes, and but she\nstayed only for a few years and then when I came back in 1965, then I went into special ed for the\ncounty, for Marin County, and I stayed for almost ten years, nine years. So that\u2019s how we met. And\nthen I switched. With the Army, I switched back to teaching political science and, and history.",
        "A: Well, 1t was much more pleasant than I had envisioned, frankly. I found that there is a very large\nsegment of a new German generation that is, 1s absolutely appalled, okay, of the past. And I met a\nlot of intellectuals who had a very good vision of the past, and not only that, they spread the\nknowledge around. Naturally, there is an element in, in Germany, that is, you know, that is the\nscum of earth, but frankly, they are very much the minority. And I, I could live in Germany much\neasier, probably, than I could ever live in Austria, where it doesn\u2019t take more than a few minutes to\nhear somebody making an anti-Semitic or fascist remark, especially if they have a couple of beer.\nYou know. So, there is, there is anew Germany. Now, with East Germany joining, it is a problem.\nBut West Germany itself, was, I would say, a pretty civilized state. Okay, now the East Germans,\nthat\u2019s a different, that\u2019s a, that\u2019s a tragedy right now, that they had not been instructed by the proper\nhistory teachers, and, there are big problems in East Germany because the East Germans said, \u201c\u201cThe\nNazis, oh no, they live in West Germany. We, we are good Communists here, we don\u2019t have to\nworry about the past.\u201d And this attitude then led to what is happening nowadays in Germany with\nthe skinheads.",
        "A: Well, again, you know, I followed my father. He came to see us in Germany once and while he was\nthere, our landlady\u2019s son was killed in a motorcycle accident, a young seventeen year old, a young\nman. And we had to go to the funeral. And my wife said to my father as she look around,\n\u201cGrandpa, look, all these men of your age. Do you sometimes think of all the ghosts that are around\nhere behind these men?\u201d And my father said, \u201cYou can\u2019t live with hate.\u201d He says, \u201cThere are\nghosts everywhere. There are Indian ghosts in America, too. You have your own ghosts.\u201d And\nthat\u2019s just the way that, you can\u2019t constantly think of that. And we befriended Germans who were a\nlot more even liberal than, than we are. And so, I mean, you can find all kinds of people. That, but\nthere, Germany, I don\u2019t really worry too much about Germany as much as I worry about Russia\nand, and Poland and Austria and there you can find a lot of fascist elements and Hungary too,\nprobably.",
        "A: Oh, when, the, the military was in a, is, is a drawdown situation where they were pulling out quite a\nfew troops from Germany and we reached, my wife reached the point where she just said she\nwanted to be close to the children. We have four grandchildren. She, this house which didn\u2019t look\nlike this at that time was a small little place, this was one end of the house and that was the other end\nof the house. A partner of my brother-in-law lived here, a veterinarian, but 1t was a very small\nplace. It was available. They bought it and he called us and my wife said, \u201cLook, I stayed in\nEurope for nineteen years with you, now I would like you to stay where I would like to be and it is\nso nice to be so close to family.\u201d Our son is only four hours away, in Nashville, with a little baby.\nAnd oh, and she gets along with her sister very well and we all get along, we never had an\nargument. So, that was an ideal situation so that\u2019s how we got here.\nEnd of Tape 4, Side A\n[NOTE: SIDE TWO OF TAPE 4 IS BLANK]\nTape 5, Side A",
        "A: Her name was Aranka, that is Goldie in English, you know, Aranka, and Teply, T-E-P-L-Y. She's\nstill living in Hungary at this date and probably it would be very difficult to communicate with her\nbecause she is number one, old, and number two, I think that she has some mental problems that she\ndeveloped since the war and, but she certainly is the heroine of the whole story and my survival, so I\ntry to keep up with her but it's very, very difficult and I'm very, very sorry about that. But she has a\nson who lives in Switzerland so at this point she's still alive.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Non-Jews, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They would have gone apartment by apartment and, of course, if you could prove that you are a\ngentile, and that was very easy because every concierge had a list, years ago this was a law in\nHungary, that every concierge had a list and that had nothing to do with Jews or non-Jews way\nback, because when you change your residence in Europe, you have to go to the police and report it.\nIn other words, every European country, they know who is at that point where. And so this list\nexisted, all they had to do, come and talk to the concierge and all the concierges were basically\nserving the government, they were in my estimate, what I call the common man, and their attitude\nchanged regarding of what the government was doing and they were lackeys and so there was no\nbig problem, they always could tell who were the gentiles and who were not by just showing the\nlist. But there were gentiles still living in the Jewish houses who had a nice place and they just\ndidn't want to move, you know? And so when, for example, at one time we were lined up because\nthe house was discovered and this George Ara Jereczian was not there with his guards. I think they\nwent to buy, get some rations for the house, and so we were really without any defense, and we\nwere lined up, then the gentiles who are not down there be also lined up because they, apparently\nthey had known what was going on and could identify themselves.",
        "A: We were, yes, we were lined up, we were lined up. And then in the last moment, a lot of things\nhappened. This aunt of mine, for example, she was also out, most people who could go on the street\nwere always out looking for something to eat and bring home and when she saw her mother, for\nexample, in the lineup, she just went up to her and started to kick her and said, \u201cThis stupid slut.\nJust, she is so stupid. Every time people say line up, she lines up, she's not Jewish.\u201d And all this,\nand in front of those Arrow Cross people, she just dragged her mother out of the line up and she had\na personality that nobody argued with her. So they assume that she is a gentile, therefore her mother\nis a gentile, too. And then we were saved because George Ara Jereczian came home and\nimmediately, his men immediately went to these punks and said, you know, \u201cClear out of here in\nshort order, papers and everything else. And if you want, you know, we'll call the Ministry of\nDefense.\u201d And so, they knew their job and threatened these people who then left.",
        "A: About ten, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, they were, they were, I start out with my mother, then my father's three sisters, okay? Among\nthem this Aranka, Goldie, and eventually my father's two brothers, too, joined us. They were also\nunder some kind of a disguise as policemen or this and that in whatever uniform they could get, but\nwhen things were really tough the last, I think, ten days or two weeks, they joined us, so they were\nthere, too. Then there were some husbands, my, one of my aunts had a husband and a boyfriend. It\nwas a triangle that the family just tolerated because the boyfriend was a much nicer person than the\nhusband, everybody, so there was even humor then. And some children. So we might, it's possible\nwe were even more than ten and that was very fortunate, a lot of apartments have a lot more than\njust ten people because this was, it sound like, it seemed like a safe haven and of course, all the\nrelatives were coming and you wouldn't want to throw out your relatives and so... a lot of very\nfamous doctors were there who then went on and came to this country and elsewhere and the whole\nfamily was there, so.",
        "A: Oh, my aunt's other, well, we were all together in the same apartment, it was her apartment and\nbecause ordinarily a gentile would not have had anything to do with Jews, but this was an\nextraordinary place because we, she knew that if they really stormed the house, the Arrow Cross\npeople, and if they really eliminate George Ara Jereczian and his guards, then everything 1s lost, it\ndoesn't make any difference, so... and inside the house, of course, there was absolutely no other rule\nexcept you made up your own so nobody cared. Yes?",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, thirteen, my father had thirteen brothers and sisters and some of them were already\ndead and others were elsewhere. One was in what was Slovakia at that time and participated in the\nSlovak uprising against the Germans and was hanged, was captured and hanged. My father was in\nYugoslavia, so there were, another was in a labor camp, we didn't even know where he was, so they\nwere dispersed. The women were together, the women we could get together and, but the men, only\ntwo of them. So there were altogether five, five of the thirteen, right there.",
        "A: Volgyessi, Volgyessi. He was the most famous Hungarian psychiatrist of his, of that time.",
        "A: V-O, and there is a double, what the Germans call, what 1s it, well, anyway, two dots.",
        "A: Umlaut, yes, two dots on the O, then L-G-Y-E-S-S-I, Volgyessi. And he, he was a very influential\nman and I, if I remember correctly, I heard, at that time as a child, that he was the main reason that\nthis whole setup was the way it was. That he had the connection, he knew George Ara Jereczian\nand he is the one who brought him in and suggested that let's do this.",
        "A: He was in his, I would say, late 50's in 1945, but he had a son and two daughters and a relatively\nyounger wife, so I assume that they are somewhere and I also assume that they are not in Hungary,\nthat they are probably in the U.S., so if ever there is a reunion, I will see them. As a matter of fact, I\nwould like to see them because I was deeply in love with one of the, the little Volgyessi girls. I was\na young kid then, it was just a puppy love.",
        "A: Well, in 1945, we all survived, okay? But, oh you mean since? Who's still alive?",
        "A: Oh, we went through the same experience and nobody... in that house, the only people who were\ntaken away were a man between eighteen and, I think it was eighteen and forty-five or eighteen and\nfifty-five, before, before October 15th when the labor, when they truly were just going to a labor\ncamp, labor organizations, that is when all the men, so there were no men until October 15th,\nbetween eighteen and fifty-five in that house, they were all taken away. So, some of the families\nwho lived there, for example, their father was not with them by that time. And, I don't know of\nanybody who survived. In other words, unfortunately, most of these people were then in a forced\nmarch toward Germany at the end of the war and somewhere in, probably western Hungary, they\nwere just either killed or died of typhus.",
        "A: No, no, no. You know, I was fifteen when the war ended, and I regret this very much, but outside\nmy family, my family is the only one, and there are only two members living in my family and they\nare the only ones. I tried to ask them if they can make some contact, I am now really very much\ninterested in keeping up with some other people, but they, they just, they never really bothered and\nthey are not very good letter writers so, and if I go to Hungary, maybe I will look for it, I would like\nto and I'm going to ask, perhaps, if I can get to the, to any, perhaps to the synagogue in Hungary, if\nthey have some knowledge of, is there a group that still comes together, because there were kids of\nmy age and I'd like to know what happened to them.",
        "A: Mmm-hmm.",
        "A: Yeah, interestingly, well, there was very little left in our apartment, what was left, a couple of boxes,\nand I don't know why they were left there, this family never touched. And that, to me, was\nimmediately, I give them some good points for that. But when I opened it, our apartment got a\ndirect hit when the siege of Budapest took place and so a lot of the... and most of these boxes\ncontained tablecloth or sheets or something like that, and so they all had big holes in them. And,\nhowever, a very beautiful embroidered tablecloth and the napkins we had for a long time until they\ndisintegrated. My wife mended them and we used them. And now, what happened to the furniture?\nA lot we give to neighbors to say, \u201cIf we come back, okay, hopefully, you will give it back to us and\nif we are not, then it 1s yours,\u201d so, and they took it and now not one of them had a piece left that they\ncan give back to us. They all said the same thing: the Russians took it. Now, this was the most\nillogical, stupid thing to say, because the Russian soldiers had two hands, what are they going to do\nwith a piano? What are they going to do with a table, what do they need it? The Russians only\nwent for one thing. Watches. They had watches up to their ears, it's as if they had never seen\nwatches before, that was the only thing. They stop you on the street and that was the only question,\n\u201cDavay chasi!\u201d That means, \u201cGive me your watch.\u201d Nothing else, I mean what can a, a foot soldier\nwho is going on and on and on across Europe, what is he going to do with anything that takes up\nspace and has weight? And so it was ridiculous, but nothing, absolutely nothing was returned from\nthe neighbors.",
        "A: Any of my friends? Well, as I mentioned before, my class, junior high class, was practically totally\ntaken and deported under those very unusual circumstances, so I had to look for the kids who were\nnot my schoolmates, but, or either lower or higher classes, and also the ones that I used to play with\nwhen I went to the city park which was not far away from us. And I would say that about half of\nthem I found, but the other half perished, you know, either because of the fires, you know there was\nbombs, or because they were killed during the Arrow Cross era, after October 15th.",
        "A: Well, when I met my friends after the war, number one, we were so full of hatred, we were looking\nfor some kind of an outlet, some organization that we can join, and we found it. And part of 1t was\nthey give away shirts, we found a Communist Party. Imagine, we were fifteen year olds and we\nsaw that people were walking around in red, flaming red shirts. And we found out that the flaming\nred shirts come from parachutes and these parachutes were supply parachutes that were dropped by\nthe Soviet forces and the Hungarians got the material and the Communist Party made a kind of a\ncampaign and made it into shirts and would give them to anybody who signed up. And I think this\ndrew us a lot more than anything else, the four very close friends of mine, whom I knew from the\nillegal boy scout organization and, luckily, we all survived, we all went and signed up with the\nCommunist Party and I think this is the first, or almost the last time, I ever went to the Party\nbecause, now we went to a couple of meetings and we were just bored to death, this happened to\nAmerican communists, too. Signed up or something, I mean it was the most boring thing, so we\nnever really considered ourself truly Communist Party members because we were, I think, members\nfor a month and then we never paid any fees or we didn't do anything after that, but this was, our\nfirst step was to go down to the Communist Party headquarters and sign up with the Communist\nParty, which was understandable because we felt that the Communist Party was going to be the one\nthat revenges all these atrocities and whatever happened, and then we saw that almost everybody\nwho was in the Arrow Cross movement is also in the Communist Party because people easily\nturned, that's obvious, you know, a lot of books and essays were written about how anybody who is\nan extremist 1n one way can become the extremist in\u2014on the other side. So we found that and that\nwas disgusting, absolutely. And the Communist Party knew about it and they defended it and we\ndidn't like that, their terminology, and so we quit. So then we went back to, and kind of regrouped\nas old boy scouts. But our heart was not in 1t because now, I mean for so many years we could not\ndo anything as boy scouts except go out and hike in nature, we couldn't even wear a kerchief. And\nso now we could wear a uniform and some of us really bought a uniform, and then we just, we just\nlost completely our lust for boy scout life and that didn't work. Then, you know, this was, another\nyear went by and I, of the four, I broke away from the other four and I joined the Zionists. They\njust, there were a lot of things that appealed to me, the fact that, finally, I am going to have a\nhomeland, finally, I am going to have a passport, there was adventure. Immediately, they send me\nup in the mountains and I had to go through a certain instruction, more than one, on more than one\noccasion. And they, I advanced, I was pretty eager and good at learning things, and I became a\nyouth leader in the movement and I loved to be with young people. And so that, to me, was a, was a\nvery happy period of my life. My only conflict was with my parents. Since I was an only child, of\ncourse, they wanted me around as much as possible, and I reached that rebellious teenage period, I\nwas not too rebellious, but rebellious enough to move out of the house at sixteen and go to a Zionist\nchildren's home where first I was just a, a resident and I liked being with my peer group. There\nwere many, there were many in Hungary, a lot of the survivors, young people of my age, just chose\nthis as a lifestyle. And what we were doing there, we received a lot of instructions in agriculture, in\nthe language, Hebrew language, in Jewish history, to prepare us when we go to Israel. And my\nparents, of course, didn't like for me being away at sixteen and I felt really sorry for them and once\nthe rebellious period ended, in about a half a year or so, I moved back home and one of the reasons\nwas that life was too free on these, it was the perfect kind of thesis, anti-thesis, that we were so\nrestricted, now everything was free, I mean, and I was a little bit of a, I was a strange kid because I\ndidn't grow up very quickly to become a man, and I did not like the fact that here were girls of my\nage who wanted to sleep with me and all this and that, I just, I always pictured myself more of a, an\nindividual, a man who has things to do and I don't, I'm not going to spend a lot of time with, with\nsex and all this and my mind was not only on just women, let's put it this way, even though I already\nhad sexual experiences and the whole, and because of this, they considered me a little bit of an\neccentric so that happy, I moved back home to satisfy my parents, but I didn't stay there long\nenough because I got an offer at the age of seventeen to go and be a resident advisor in a home for\nJewish orphans. That was on, it was called Tarogato Street in the Buda section of Budapest where I\nfound a man who became a very good friend of mine, the man who led the institution, a marvelous\nman, also a Zionist, by the name of Spitzer* and his family, and they were very good to me and I felt\nvery much at home, plus I got a nice salary and all my needs were taken care of there. Even I had a\n* First name: Imre\ngirlfriend who was also a resident counselor there, so happy, really, they were very happy days.\nAnd in the meantime, I also participated very actively in, I changed organizations and left, I was in\na, I would say, kind of a petit bourgeois Zionist group and I went over to the Marxists because that\nsuited my philosophy a lot more and I stayed with them and eventually they were the ones that\nhelped me to then immigrate to Israel, that was after, but we'll get to this. Now I want to talk just a\nlittle bit about school because all these times I went to school, too. Right after the, 1945, as soon as\nthe school started, my mother was determined that I should go to the School of Commerce, the high\nschools were specialized, and there was one that was called, the Special High School for\nCommerce. Can you stop it for a second because I want to close the window. So as I said, my\nmother was determined that I should go there, of course, I had no desire but I was still a good boy\nand I started at that school and the fact that it was the middle of the year, basically, and I missed the\nfirst half of a year wasn't a big problem because anybody who was a, a Holocaust survivor at that\ntime can just about do anything. So this was no big problem, the big problem came when I noticed\nhow many of my teachers are outright anti-American, anti-Russian, anti-Semitic, they haven't\nchanged their attitude and there were some other Jewish kids in that school and I got together with\nthem and I asked them if, if we should tolerate this, if they think this 1s correct and everybody was\nkind of lying low, the usual way, and I said, \u201cNo, I am not going to do that.\u201d There was specifically\none teacher who had, I forgot, had a German name, a very small man who not only was anti-Semitic\nand anti-Russian and anti-everything and very pro-German, but agitating. He was not just making\nstatements, he was really agitating and in a very emotional way and I was, I just, I reached a point\nwhere I just couldn't take it anymore, not after what happened, just, you know, in the last few years\nand my boy scout commander, and at that time I was still kind of hanging on with the boy scout\nmovement, my boy scout commander was now a member of the new Hungarian Secret Police and\nhe was an officer and he escaped from the labor camp and went over to the Russians and all this and\ncame back with the Russian troops already and was one of the organizers. And I went to see him\nand I said, \u201cThis man should be removed from the school.\u201d And they did take him in and somehow\nthey went down the list at school and found out that I was the one who reported him because it was\nobvious since I was constantly arguing with him, arguing with him in class and so... .\nEnd of Tape 5, Side A\nTape 5, Side B",
        "A: I just had to quit. And then I continued my studies, I did not want to have the same experience\nagain and I went to the Jewish, the Jewish rabbi school, really, what it was, it was a school to\neducate future teachers, but it was a high school still. Just like my previous high school was\nspecialized for commercial jobs, this one was, basically, a teaching gymnasium, a teaching high\nschool, which meant by the laws of Hungary at that time that once you finished\u2014and it was instead\nof four, five classes, so you were nineteen when you finished the school\u2014you were then an\nelementary school teacher at the age of nineteen without any college education. I was there at this\nschool and, of course, as far as any kind of a bad experience, I didn't have any. Now I was among\nmy own people, there were some very, very good friends, I liked the school, it was nothing special,\nit was not challenging me, the only aspect most of us didn't like is the religious aspect, which we\ndidn't take very seriously. So actually, I was still in that school in my eighteenth year when\neventually, and we will go back to this, I emigrated, emigrated to Israel, and so I never really\nfinished my high school. But out of deference to what happened and all this, I got a diploma. So I\nhad a high school diploma which, of course, my parents got later because I needed one and... so\nthese are the two schools. Once I reached this level of the, this, the Jewish teaching high school for,\nhigh school for future teachers, whatever, it's very difficult to translate into English, perhaps\nLyceum is a good name for it, once I reached that, then as far as my experiences after the Holocaust,\nthere was no problem, you know, it's obvious. Now, going back, of course in the meantime, in the\nZionist movement, a lot of changes took place because we had to go practically underground. As\nthe communist regime established itself 1n Hungary and in 1948 the famous turn, Year of the Turn\ncame about, which happened in every Eastern European country, and the Year of the Turn is an\nexpression when the communists took control, complete power, because until 1948, we had\ndemocracy in Eastern Europe, those countries that knew what democracy was. And Hungary had\nsome very able politicians and was really on its road to become a democracy, so was\nCzechoslovakia, and probably Poland, too, of course, Romania was very different. But, in 1948,\neverything has changed, we became, again, just like with the illegal boy scout group before 1945, I\nfound myself belonging to an illegal organization, Zionism was outlawed because all of a sudden\nStalin and company found Zionism, of course, a tool of the imperialists as they called it. So we\nwere doing, basically, the same things that we were doing before, but now very cautiously, illegally,\nand meetings were held usually either in some far away synagogues, basements or in some Jewish\norphanages where it was not very obvious if, let's say, twenty, thirty people came in and out because\nthere were hundreds of people living there anyway. The, many times we paraded as young\ncommunists, if we wanted to have a larger meeting somewhere, singing communist songs when\nsomebody came by, but otherwise doing our own business. By 1949, early 1949, the situation\nalmost was intolerable and, basically, they wanted to have the whole Zionist movement leave, not\nthe communists, but the Zionist movement wanted to get as many people out as possible, fearing\nthat if Czechoslovakia is going to turn also completely communist, that there will be no way from\nHungary to go anywhere. By that time we could only go illegally across the border. And I think it\nwas in February, 1949, that I got an order from my Zionist leadership to go to a little northern town,\nVacz, V-A-C-Z, my mother comes from that town and they knew it. My job was to go to the mayor\nof the town and ask him if he would like to have a high school orchestra give a, an evening concert\non some given date. I went there, I mentioned to the mayor that I had been to Vacz many, many\ntimes because my grandparents, cousins, aunts, I had a lot of relatives and my mother was born\nhere, and of course, he was overwhelmed that a high school orchestra 1s coming to play. I then went\nto a printer, this was one of my instructions, and had all kinds of posters printed advertising the date\nand the concert. Went back, reported it and the next command was that on a certain day, I would\nhave to go with an instrument or with an instrument case to a corner of Budapest and there would be\na bus there, a state bus, by that time every bus company was nationalized, and I have to board the\nbus with a lot of other people and I have to pretend that I am a member of a high school band,\nwhatever instrument I am playing, and do, not to talk about anything, Zionism or Israel, anything\nlike that. And just wait for further instructions there. And of course, I was notified that this is it,\nthat we would be going to Israel and I bid farewell to my family and got an instrument case,\nboarded the bus on a certain date and time and I saw all my fellow Zionist members, the ones who\nwere in my group, and we started toward the Czechoslovakian border.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I had very ambivalent feelings like a lot of those Jews who did not come from the upper middle\nclass or upper class. I came from definitely no better than the middle of the middle class or rather,\nperhaps, the lower middle class. My father came from a very low class proletarian family which\nwas very unusual among the Jews of Hungary. My mother came from a little petit bourgeois family\nfrom the northern Hungarian town. They thought they were middle class, but 1t depends on how\nyou classify this, as far as I'm concerned they were kind of a pseudo-petit bourgeois people, the kind\nwho, it's very difficult to define them, but there was not much work and a lot of complaining. Now,\nbecause I never had a very, let's say satisfactory and wealthy life, naturally I had some sympathies\nwith, with the Marxist movement, it's obvious. Second, I had a very definite sympathy with them\nbecause they were the most adamant about taking the war criminals and punish them. They were\nthe most anti-fascist and all these things appealed to me. I was, you can consider even though I was\nnot a member, really after my one month experience, I was not a member, at least I didn't consider\nmyself a member of the Communist Party, but I certainly was sympathizing with a lot of their goals,\neven though I was in a completely different game by that time, knowing I would go to Israel. But,\nthis is probably why I changed my affiliation and went from a bourgeoisie Zionist organization to a\nMarxist Zionist organization where I felt very much at home. And there were, of course, ugly\nthings happening, the communist takeover in Eastern Europe was not a very pleasant occasion. And\none only had to think a little bit clearly and rise above all this emotion to see that the communists\nused very nasty methods to eliminate anyone who disagreed with them. And the more power they\ngrabbed, the more vicious they became. And of course, eventually I, the Zionists suffered more\nwhat anybody who was considered a Zionist or anybody, like my father, who could have been\nexecuted if they discovered that he was with Tito, so if you were an enemy for one reason or\nanother, there was no law. The communists created their own laws, the secret police had free hand\nand, of course, I began to become very disappointed in that. My father, he was always a Social\nDemocrat, and he never, never approved what the Communist Party was doing in Hungary. And he\nwas very courageous because when the Communist Party gobbled up the Social Democratic Party,\nhe sent in a postcard and said, \u201cExcuse me, but I don't want to join you.\u201d Which was very\ncourageous because from there on, you could have been watched. The fact that he comes from a\nworking class and was a very little fish, I think saved his life. But if he had been a name, probably\nhe would have been killed then. And so, politics, yes, I kept my eye on politics all the time and this\nhelped me in 1949 to just go, because I figured there will never be peace here, there will never be\npeace here. And, do you have any other questions?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Yes, I was very naive, really, at the age of fifteen, for some reason, I thought that a better world is\ncoming. And I was deeply disappointed when I heard that there were even pogroms in the\ncountryside where a few Jews dared to come back to a village or a town in Hungary, in Poland, in\nSlovakia, I think the Czechs were the only ones who acted in a very civilized way, but then they\nwere always civilized and the most civilized in Eastern Europe. That disappointed me, people were\nkilled, survived Auschwitz, came home and killed in a pogrom in Hungary and in some other\nEastern European countries, two years after the war. And that made me very bitter and my idealism\nand my naivete really evaporated.",
        "A: I have not been directly in an anti-Semitic incidence because I avoided, I avoided them, I avoided\nany kind of such thing. I associated mainly with my own kind because I saw that there is no hope.\nNow, this interestingly must have changed to a certain extent because almost every one of my\ncousins is married to a gentile in Hungary, I think with the exception of maybe two, but every one\nof them, and the marriages are very solid. So I, and it's not, they are still not what you would call a\ntruly middle class family, that most of them still stayed in, you know, auto mechanics and this and\nthat, that part. Now, the ones who are up there, went to college and became dentists and those, they\nare all married to other Jews. It's a very interesting phenomenon. But I have not experienced\nanything except when, right after the war at school. Okay? I heard people constantly yelling anti-\nSemitic slogans, especially at soccer games, but I knew that I can't expect anything else any more.",
        "A: Yes, I had dreams and that was probably a, a, just a marvelous high of my youth. The whole, the\nZionists did a, a fantastic job in catching the spirit of young people and really giving us what we\nwanted to have. We had a relatively free life, we had, we had a picture of a heroic future for us,\nwhether we are going to be still serving in the army in Israel or just working in a kibbutz as farmers,\nalmost everything about it had a kind of a super human touch that I'm going to be better than all\nthese people around here who are running around like ants on the cities of Budapest, I'm going to\nlead a very healthy life, and finally I'm going to have a country, I have a home, I will have a\nfatherland and it was, 1t was a marvelous feeling. And also, the whole, the whole setup, the whole\norganization, you know, until then, until 1946 or so, most of the picture that we saw of Jewish\npeople is, is like sheep going into Auschwitz. And all of a sudden these people come from Israel,\nthey are beautiful looking people. And not only that, they had courage, the way they carried\nthemselves and they were teaching us a lot of things, you know, Israel sent a lot of, they called them\nSchliahs, people that, those who are sent, I think, literally. And they were in charge of all these\ncamps where we had to go to where we were taught self-defense and, you know, we lived on a tree\nin one camp, I think what, for forty-eight hours, we were given a piece of rope and a knife and we\nhad to stay up, and sleep up there and make our bed and all this. I mean, which young person\ndoesn't like this? The whole image of the Jew has changed in our mind and we said, \u201cGod, it's\nbeautiful.\u201d And when we were in danger, they were the ones who led us out of danger. I remember\nonce I was up in the BorzsOny mountains in Hungary in a self-defense camp for a week and\nsomebody betrayed us to the police and the police surrounded us and there was a creek, not deeper,\nI don't think it was deeper than maybe twenty inches, and guess who is the one who escaped from\nthe creek in order to do something, not to save his own skin, but he was immediately telephoning\nand all this and that and eventually we were released. The Israeli whatever, diplomat, I can't call\nthem, the diplomat is not the right word because you picture somebody, you know, with a tie and\nsuit and all this, but they were just, I, messengers or whatever, leaders. And he escaped, he escaped\nin that creek, crawling in twenty inch of water, you know, getting on something that blend in with\nthe, with the rocks, I mean they were unbelievable, unbelievable people. And women, you know,\nit's, it's, okay, after them the women came and, I mean this is a completely different Jew. I mean,\nand when I took my wife to Israel, she understood that, that there was just something about those\nkids. And so this, this, of course, was, they were idols and it was very easy to follow them. And\nthey were, they were not really demagogues, I remember quite a few of them who got quite\nintroverted, they were not giving you big speeches or something, but by personal example, they\nwere leaders because we followed them. So the, the bus going back to my escape from Hungary,\nthe bus eventually reached Vacz and, needless to say, it didn't stop there. Beyond Vacz, it became\nquite dark and our leader suggested to the bus driver that we stop somewhere and eat and there was\na roadside pub where they also served food. We went in and we were given money and we could\norder something, and in that pub, there was a very beautiful peasant woman, with I don't know how\nmany skirts on her, this was the reason you recognize a peasant woman, in those days they still wore\na lot of skirts, you know, that's an Eastern European costume that a dozen skirts is no big deal. And\nshe started to flirt with the bus driver. And soon the bus driver came, went over to her table, and\nthey had a good time and, of course, we were getting more and more anxious that this is going to\ncreate a big problem here, right? We knew that we were on a timetable. All of a sudden, the bus\ndriver said to our leader, \u201cHow long do you think we will be here?\u201d And our leader said, \u201cWell, all\nthese kids eat, oh, a half an hour, forty-five minutes.\u201d He said, \u201cGood, I'll be back.\u201d and left with\nthe woman. We ate, and our leader said, \u201cOkay, line up outside.\u201d And instead of going back to the\nbus, he led us down on a field into a big barn, I would say about one mile down in a muddy field, it\nwas February and snow and mud everywhere. We all got into the barn, about thirty of us, they\nclosed the doors, barn doors, and he said, \u201cOkay, don't worry. Everything will be okay.\u201d After\nmidnight, 1:00 or so, the barn door opened and we were, they said we have to get on line and\nmarched down, there was the river Ipoly, I-P-O-L-Y, and that was the border between Hungary and\nCzechoslovakia. The Austrian border was already sealed, but the Czechs still let Zionist groups\ncome over, it was kind of an arrangement, the Joint did it for a lot of money, however, they didn't\nknow which border, Czech border guard was a communist or not, so we have to be very careful.\nAnd once we went beyond the border guards, everything was organized there, I will go back to this.\nSo as we were marching down, I saw a woman in a leather jacket with a revolver hanging on her hip\nin blue jeans. I looked at this woman's face, said, \u201cHey, I have seen her before.\u201d And I looked and\nsaid, \u201cThis is the woman in the pub.\u201d This is to show you how organized they were. I mean, the\nGermans couldn't have done better, really, with their devilish organization. I mean, everything, if\nyou understood the whole, they called it aliyah, the going of, to Israel. If you understood that, how\nthey did it, you can understand how they could survive. All right? Surrounded by, of course, a sea\nof enemies. Once we got down to the river, we had to take our shoes off, and we kept everything on\nour head, the river was not high enough, we couldn't swim, so we had to walk, but I was very small,\nand it got to my throat at one time. Now this is February, imagine. We got over to the other side\nand it was supposed to be that the border guards change, everything was according to the clock, and\nsomething happened and the border guards did not change the way they were supposed to, they\nwere still talking to each other. There was snow on the ground and the dogs, their dogs were\nbarking, so we had to lie down on the snow for about a half an hour, wet. And many of us got sick,\nright there. I myself, I lost, I got frostbitten and even today I suffer for that. Now, then the border\nguards finally were gone and we went up, there was a house where they used to press grapes, it was\na grape growing region, but had no roof and the wind was blowing and I remember, I don't think I\nhave ever been colder in my life since then. And so we huddled together because now we missed\nthe truck that was supposed to pick us up right down on a highway beyond that hill, so the Israelis,\nthe two Israelis, a man and a woman who were leading us, they went down and eventually, in about\nfour or five hours, they located the truck, the truck came back, the truck was looking for us and then\nleft and then, anyway the truck came back, we got up on the truck, the canvas, the top was taken\ndown, and from there on, all we heard was the engine of the truck was occasionally, when they were\nhalted and the word dollar, the word dollar came back all the time, I remember that.\nEnd of Tape 5, Side B\nTape 6, Side A",
        "A: I, my best friend in that group was a young man by the name of Zev Rotics. He lives in Israel at this\ntime still, in Haifa, at Rehov Shunamit 14, and we correspond monthly, we have been ever since,\never since that time, and eventually when I left Israel, we corresponded, we kept up and I consider\nhim my best friend. He's about the only person I keep up with. Oh no, there was one, another, a\nman by the name of Nissan Meschel, and I have no, he is in touch with my friend, Zev Rotics, but I\nlost touch with him, so I have no idea what happened, I just know that he's living there. But the\nothers, the, I remember one young lady who was with us and she, unfortunately, had eventually\npneumonia when we got to Vienna, which I will go back to when I continue the story of the\njourney, and died in Vienna of pneumonia, and she's buried there somewhere in the cemetery and I\nalways planned to go and visit her, but I always run out of time and I don't know where she is\nburied, probably there is no more than one Jewish cemetery, so when I go back to Israel I'm going\nto find out because my wife... Zev Rotics, sometimes he goes to the meetings of our old friends and\nso he would know. Now, after the truck finally stopped in Bratislava. In Bratislava they took us to\nthe gendarmerie where, as a formality, we were arrested, and interned in the synagogue, they took\nus to the synagogue that had already warm rooms, straw on the floor, blankets, good food,\neverything, and we were told that next morning we are going on. And it was very strange because\nnext morning, again, the gendarmerie surrounded the synagogue, it was a big show, of course, all\njust 1n case some Soviet authority is watching. And they took us to the railroad station where we\nwere taken in boxcars, how interesting, locked up, quite a few people in boxcars, and the train\nstarted and I think within an hour or so, they opened up and we were in the American sector of\nVienna. Because Bratislava is very close to Vienna. We stayed in Vienna for, I think, two, one or\ntwo weeks, and in an American hospital, that's where the Joint somehow got an American hospital\nfor the Zionist members and we were all there and we were given good food and warm rooms and it\nwas very pleasant, the only thing we were always warned about, not to ever wander into the Soviet\nsection. We were free to wander around, the city was still divided into four sections, American,\nBritish, French and Soviet. And sometimes we had to go very close to the Soviet section in going\nto, I remember going to a swimming pool, it was on the edge, and so everybody was nervous. But,\nbasically, it was a good time. Vienna was full of refugees, full of life. After one week or so, then\nwe were taken across, again by trucks, across the Alps into, no I have to correct myself, to, not to\nAustria, to a, a, a UNRRA camp, UNRRA was the United Nations Refugee Association or\nsomething, so the joint gave us temporarily over to UNRRA and we were housed 1n a beautiful area\nof the Alps in a town called Zaalfelden. It is a, on a lake, just the other side from Germany, and\nthere were some very picturesque villages nearby, and I remember even though here the food was\nvery meager and we still were hiking almost every day and going up in the mountains, and I\nremember that just above our camp, our refugee camp, there was a place, a mountain hut where\nHitler and Mussolini met and we had to see it and sometimes a cabbage soup a day just didn't give\nus enough energy, but we were still pushing for it, we wanted to see it. We stayed here, again, one\nor two weeks and then on, again, now over the border to Italy. In Italy, they took us again to the\ntrain station, somewhere in northern Italy, and the train then was closed up and sealed, but regular\ntrain, we just could not leave the train, Italian detectives were on the train to make sure that nobody\nescapes because it was ridiculous because who wants to escape to Italy, at least at that time? And\nwe were taken down to Bari. Now, the only thing that stands out in my mind was that a lot of times\nwhen the train stopped, we, of course, rolled the windows down and the good looking girls among\nus ended up with dozens of pictures from Italian men, written on it, I love you, I'm going to marry\nyou and all this, by the time we got to Bari, I think the girls were exchanging pictures and who\nwanted this one and this one? I mean it was a funny thing to see that those men were really just\ninstantly falling in love with these girls. In Bari, a ship was waiting for us, if you could call it a\nship. It was called the Galil, Galilea or Galilee, I forgot exactly, and so we boarded the ship and in\ntwo days or three days, it must have been three I think, we were going to reach Haifa. Everybody\ngot sea sick, the boat was an old, old fishing boat that the Israeli government brought from, bought\nfrom Greece and it was a primitive thing, very primitive. And I know I have a very strong will and I\ndon't want to, you know, go back to that, to the story, but I never throw up, somehow I just psych\nmyself up ever since I was a little kid as a result of an incident that I would not throw up. And I\nremember I was the only one on the ship who could eat. Everybody else was just constantly\nthrowing up and so we arrived, by the time we arrived in Haifa, everybody was just yellow and\ngreen and wouldn\u2019t want to look at food. Now, the funny thing about this ship is that a few years\nago I was travelling in France with my wife and we stopped in the Loire valley in a small little\ntown, Blois, and as we were walking in the town there was a kind of a summer suit that I wanted to\nbuy, it was very inexpensive and I needed a summer suit for wearing on some occasion that I have\nto wear a suit and I went into the shop and I was trying on the suit when the owner of the shop all of\na sudden yelled and said, \u201cShalom haver.\u201d And it appears he was talking to my wife and somehow\nit came that he was a Moroccan Jew and he was telling, I think, my wife that he was a Moroccan\nJew and all this, because he had a definite Arabic name. And so my wife, I think, told him that I\nwas Jewish, too you know, and this, so he invited us after the deal\u2014which was a good one\u2014he\ninvited us to a bar down on the street, an outdoor caf\u00e9, to drink something with him. And during the\nconversation he asked me a little bit about my life and he said to, and I asked him and he said, \u201cOh,\nI was in Israel, I was a sailor.\u201d I said, \u201cWhere did you sail?\u201d He said, In the Mediterranean, of\ncourse,\u201d and I said, \u201c\u201cWhat ship?\u201d He said, \u201cThe Galilea.\u201d \u201cWhat time?\u201d He said, \u201cFrom 1948 to\n1950 something.\u201d Well, he was on that ship, you know, and I mean it was a small ship and he was\none of the sailors. Well, when we arrived in Haifa, of course, that was a very emotional scene and\nthen eventually, the war, basically, was finished and there was no temporary animosity so then we,\nour movement went to a kibbutz there where we then blended in and one year after we were taught\na trade in the kibbutz and we got our own land then. I don't know what else you want to know\nabout the Israeli thing.",
        "A: Yes, everyone went to the same kibbutz except the ones who did not want to go to the kibbutz, had\nrelatives who were waiting for them and this was a little bit of a disappointment to us because\ntheoretically, everybody was supposed to stay together, but this was not the case. There were, not\neverybody wants to live in a kibbutz because it is a very difficult living for those who dream of\nmoney and wealth and their own car and all this because it's a, at that time it was a very perfect\ncommunity, but it was a community, you didn't have a great deal that you owned at all, you know,\nyou were lucky if you had a radio that you can call your own. So we lost, I would say, about one-\nthird of our group who had planned, but not shared their plan with us, to go immediately and stay on\nthe outside.",
        "A: All Zionist youth organizations basically, with very little exception, very few exceptions, were\ngeared toward the kibbutz. This was an understanding back in Eastern Europe where we were\nrecruited that Israel, and they always brought the example of the pyramid, that the, we Jews, we\nalways like a pyramid on the top, we had all the, the farmers, and down at the bottom where the\npyramid is the largest, we had all the intellectuals, and Israel needed a pyramid upside down, where\nthe largest group 1s going to be the farmers and the agricultural group, and the smallest one is going\nto be the intellectuals, the tip of the pyramid. So almost every Zionist organization, that was the\nvery strong influence and educational goal to teach you to go and be a farmer in a collective, you\nknow? So that was the reason why most of us did go to a kibbutz. And who decided it? It was\ndecided above, that had nothing to do with us, where we would go, we were assigned to an old\nkibbutz, very old, experienced, large kibbutz, called Givat Chajim, in Israel which is in, about\nmidway between Haifa and Tel Aviv and this is where we learned our trade for one year, we stayed\nthere for one year.",
        "A: We did not speak any Hebrew when we arrived there, most of us didn't speak any Hebrew, except\nthe ones who came from very religious families. They knew quite a bit and for them it was much\neasier to learn, we spoke no Yiddish because Hungarians do not speak, Hungarian Jews, very few\nHungarian Jews speak Yiddish, and so at first we felt a little bit kind of ostracized by the\ncommunity, especially the young Israeli kids. There were so many Hungarians coming in at that\ntime that the Hungarians even had a nickname in Israel, they were called Igen-Migen, Igen means\nyes in Hungarian and so kids would go after us on the street and call us Igen-Migen, Igen-Migen,\nbecause they heard us speak. And so we were in a big hurry to learn Hebrew. And then when we\nlearned Hebrew, we had another thing, the Hungarian language is such that your accent stays with\nyou no matter what language you learn, and so we had a very thick accent, even when we were\nspeaking Hebrew, so we had our difficulties with the language, but most of us learned it eventually.\nI was there in Israel for two years and by the time I came home, I was really speaking fluently.",
        "A: Okay, I was a tractor driver in the kibbutz and worked out plowing everything connected with the\ntractor, it was called a Falha, that particular branch, and from sacking, you know, flours and up to\nplowing and then seeding and cultivating, we had, we did everything. Then we got our own land,\nown piece of land, which was a reclaimed area on the train line between Tel Aviv and Haifa, it was\nthe, the, the Israel and Jordan swapped land and so Jordan give back a piece of land so the train\nservice can go from Tel Aviv to Haifa because part of the train line was in Jordan. This was the\nland that we received, and it was a very dangerous place, so when we, the first day we went out\nthere, I remember, was really hair raising because the tractor drivers had to go down and plow and\nthe, the weed in Israel is much higher than a human being and also we didn't know where the mines,\nif there were any mines. And even though the army supported us and they did give us, you know,\ngenerous support there, we the tractor drivers had to go down and practically open up the area. And\nSO We were very respected in the kibbutz for that reason. Above us was an Arab town, Tul Karem,\nwhich today is under Israeli occupation and still a very hot spot for riots. And I remember that Arab\ntown practically you could see the people on the street, and here we were on the other side living,\nyou know, two enemies and of course, I had a lot of adventures because of living on the border, but\nthen again, that has not much to do with the Holocaust and I am sure that the Holocaust Museum\nhas a lot of testtmonies from Israelis so they don't need. I don't know, but that's up to you, but I\nhave a lot of stories that came to us as a result of living so close at that time, back in 1948, 1949, on\nthe border, you know.",
        "A: Well, when we first showed up, when we first showed up, the first day, there were Arab shepherds\ndown on the other side of the barbed wire, the border was just marked with a bunch of barbed wire.\nAnd when they saw us, they emitted a sound like woo-woo-woo, and they were running away, they\nwere just scared to death. These were shepherds, very poor people, and we didn't know exactly who\nthey were, but we learned eventually, that they were, they were working for the local, you know,\nsheik or whomever owns the land for very little. And eventually, we also saw that here on this side\nof the border we are plowing with up-to-date 20\"-century machinery and we saw not far from us, a\nman on a horseback whipping people just because they did something apparently that did not please\nthem. The owner of the land had practically complete jurisdiction over these poor fellows, and that\nwas just a few hundred yards from where we were working. As they got used to us, they came\ncloser and closer and when they saw that we don't mean any harm, they came down to the barbed\nwire many times, watching to make sure that nobody sees them and tried to make friends with us\nand we did make friends with them for, the main reason is that chocolate was very expensive in\nIsrael those days, cocoa, and we already had quite a few children in our group, babies. Cigarettes\nwere very expensive for some reason in Jordan and they were very cheap in Israel, American\ncigarettes. So they asked, oh, these people offered us a deal, but they did not want to do it during\nthe day because they were afraid that the... Jordan had the best military force, the Arab Legion,\ntrained by the British and they were afraid that they were patrolling there and all this and it was a\nserious crime to deal with, with Israelis. So at night in the darkness, and I remember it was my turn,\ntoo, 1t was always a few people and always the tractor drivers because we had the contact with the\nborder people, we went down because they would recognize us and it was a very risky thing, they\ncould have just shot me dead right there, it could have been a trap. We went down and we were\ndoing all the business, they jumped over or we went over, but mainly they came over because they\nwere much better fence jumpers than we were. So this was one contact that we had. The other one\nwas not so pleasant, these wadis, dry river beds, that run across, they don't recognize borders, they\nrun, you know, back and forth, Israel, Jordan, and in, when they are dry which is most of the time,\nthis is where the Arab thieves come over, they use these river beds because you can't see them, they\nare, you know, they are like little canyons. And they would come over in these river beds and go\ninto other areas and steal, mainly animals. And they were unbelievably good thieves. They would\nsteal, they can, they would steal a cattle, they would steal a donkey, they would steal a horse\nsurrounded by walls. Nobody could ever figure out how they did it. So the army hired us to be kind\nof a paramilitary force and go out and lie, so we had to lie down in the wadis and a few of us, we\ndidn't have very good guns, we had old Czech guns, and wait for these thieves to come. And I only\nhad one occasion when three of us were in a patrol and there were about fifteen or twenty of these\ncoming by and we didn't feel like getting murdered by them because what chances do we have?\nAnd so we let them go by and then reported to the border police that they went by, but we didn't\nwant to engage in any fire fight there. Now, my good experience was with the Jordanian Legion,\nwhich then eventually had also a sad ending. All of a sudden one day we were, I was plowing I\nremember, and I had to have always a guard on my tractor with a submachine gun who was\nconstantly casing and watching because I was so close to the border and this was a friend of mine\none day who was a guard in an Arab POW camp, an Israeli POW camp, guarding Arabs during the\nWar of Independence, so he learned some Arabic from them. And you will see why this 1s\nimportant, and all of a sudden we saw some, an Arab Legion patrol right by the barbed wire and\nthey were motioning to us to come down and we said no, you know. And so they went away. Next\nday they came and again they were motioning, they said, \u201cPeace, peace.\u201d So finally they went back\nabout fifty yards and they put their guns into a pile and then came back, showing that they had no\nweapons and they told us, \u201cSit down on that side of the border. What can we do?\u201d They were\nabout twelve, if they really wanted to kill us, we said, \u201cOkay, let's go down. What do they want?\u201d\nThey just wanted to talk to us and from there on, every day they would come down at a certain time\nand eventually they, the Arabs have watermelon all over, so it was like a party, they would yell at\none of these poor fellows who was working there and I, this is all I learned in Arabic, what it is,\n\u201cHey, bring me a watermelon.\u201d Yalla Jibbu Battiyah. And they brought a watermelon and they\nwould slice it and we were eating, almost every day we had a little lunch there together, we brought\nsome stuff. And this went on for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks. And eventually we really\nfooled our countries because sometimes they came over and ate and laughed that they ate in Israel\nand sometimes we jumped over and we said, \u201cOh, we ate in Jordan.\u201d\u201d And one day it was our turn,\nwe stopped the tractor, they haven't come down yet so we were waiting for them, but we were\nalready sitting on the other side, we had a little blanket, we put it down, all the food from our\nkitchen and all of a sudden a patrol is there, but it 1s a totally different patrol. What happened,\napparently somebody saw them and reported them, I don't know what ever happened, I never saw\nthem again and these guys were, they drew their guns and they are going to shoot us. And you\nknow that border was no joke, every night somebody was killed there, either an Israeli or an Arab.\nVery innocent people, you know, sometimes a, one night I felt so badly, a young couple, lovers,\nwere walking around and apparently they were in the wrong place and an Israeli guard, and most of\nthe Israeli border guards were from Arab countries, Arab Jews, well, not Arab, that sounds kind of\nstrange, but Jews from Arab countries, and they were vicious. I mean, you could not get better\nborder guards and they were, they hated the Arabs more than we hated the Nazis. And so they\nwere, they were, they saw one at night, they were shooting sometimes for no reason. So that was a\nvery poisonous atmosphere there, and I mean it took a long time and the fact that my friend spoke\nsome Arabic and all this and mitigated the situation, but then the man said, \u201cHow come you speak\nsome Arabic? Where did you learn it?\u201d And then he had to kind of, so finally the sergeant who was\nleading all them, always a master sergeant leading the patrol, he said, \u201cYou have one luck that I\nhave a son of your age.\u201d He said, \u201cIf I ever see you even down touching the barbed wire,\u201d he said,\n\u201cT am going to just make dust out of you.\u201d And of course, we never went back again. That was,\nthese are some experiences living on the border.",
        "A: Well, it was a very simple conversation because we had a language problem, it was mainly sign\nlanguage quite a bit, and we were talking about, basically, these people were talking about their\nchildren, they showed pictures of their families and the word peace, Salaam or Shalom in Hebrew,\nwas constantly mentioned. And I have a feeling that all of us involved, probably, if they are,\nhopefully they are alive, will always remember this and that kind of softened us up, so we know that\nhuman beings can relax under certain circumstances and we don't have to be enemies. It was the\nfirst time that I realized that an Arab can, doesn't necessarily have to be my opponent, you know?",
        "A: About a hundred, about a hundred, and all from Hungary. But other kibbutzim had sometimes\nmixed.\nEnd of Tape 6, Side A\nTape 6, Side B",
        "A: At first I was very, very idealistic. Then somehow, I felt a little bit disappointed where in our\nkibbutz, all kinds of political groups tried to kind of tear us apart. And there were more and more\narguments and somehow this and the fact that as the country settled down into so-called peace, if we\ncan call it, the usual symptoms that every nation in the world experiences, surfaced, such as crime\nand... but the fact that there were Jewish criminals, that shocked me. You know, I was so naive that\nI thought that anybody goes to Israel, certainly doesn't want to do anything to hurt another human\nbeing. There were even, even murderers, and I just one day after another, these things, they added\nto my little disappointment, but I was still enjoying myself because I love to be outdoors and we, we\ndid the physical work and it was all that a young person wants for self-image, good self-image, we\nhad a very good self-image of ourselves. There were two things that contributed to my, to my\ncoming, going back to Hungary eventually in '51. One was, all of a sudden I realized that I, in all\nmy life I loved my father very, very much, and this is a, I mean it's a fact, there is nothing you can\ndo about it, I loved my father more than I loved my mother. Somehow I always considered my\nmother a little bit of a, of a kind of petit bourgeois that I never really completely understood. And I\nthought that she was a little bit, she was just in another, in other words, she wanted me to be also,\nyou know, like she was, and play the piano and all these things and I was not the type. So I was not\nthat close to her even though I was with her all the time and practically, I was also instrumental in\nsaving her life in the war when I dragged her with me everywhere and all this, but my father, and I\nrealized I spent very little time with my father as a young man because he was always away in, in\nthe concentration camp. And now he was home and now they couldn't come any more, Hungary\nwas sealed. And then I also, at the age of nineteen, became somehow involved with a group of\ncynical people. And I met them here and there and some of them I knew from Hungary and they\nwere married to this and this, I just somehow was under the influence of these who saw nothing nice\nany more in Israel except the bad things. This, the homesickness plus the fact that then I began to\nget all kinds of propaganda material from Hungary and somehow, this was the third thing, I was\nmisled by all this, what I read, and I thought that the situation changed and Hungary is such a\nmarvelous country today. And my parents tried to communicate to me, even though they never\nwanted me to really go away, but now they didn't want me to really come home, they were afraid\nwhat would happen to me. And that, they just apparently didn't come across quite well because I,\neventually I just decided I want to go back to Hungary, and probably homesickness had a great deal\nto do, I, at that time as a young man, I didn't realize that you can't go home again, you know? I\nenvisioned that everything is going to be back and all this. Well, I then applied to the Hungarian\nEmbassy, got a permit and the Israelis, of course, didn\u2019t keep me there, and in 1951, I returned to\nHungary. And those were the worst years, aside from October 15th, those years were the worst\nyears of my life, the next two or three years.",
        "A: The kibbutz was also very well organized, this was an old kibbutz and it was like a clock work.\nAlso, there was a hierarchy which naturally some people didn't understand, but I had no argument\nwith that because I realized a person who came here fifty years ago when there was nothing here\nexcept rocks and Arabs shooting at them, has, is more equal, right, than somebody who arrives here\ntoday. It was well run, it was a wealthy kibbutz, there was very good food, there was culture, they\nmade sure that orchestras are coming, good ones, entertainment, no, I had absolutely no feeling of\nlet down in this respect. No, I admired the way they carried on. Just a little, just a little thing that\nshows that how they thought of everything: shoveling manure, for example, of course, not\nsomething that somebody wants to do for the rest of his or her life, so or washing dishes in the\nkitchen, so there were, there were certain things in the kibbutz that 1t was not a, an area where you\nwere assigned permanently, they were temporary. And so everybody knew that once in a month I\nhave to shovel manure and once a month or twice a month, I have to wash the dishes, so, there were\nsome other, but even this was taken care of, you know, I think in a very human manner.",
        "A: I was naively thinking about going to the university and continuing with my education to become a\nteacher, a high school teacher, and so I went back through the Bosporus, Turkey, Black Sea,\nRomania and then Hungary. Travelling through Romania by train, in 1949, excuse me, 1951, was\nquite an experience, the people just looked at me, looked at me and since there are quite a few\nHungarians in Romania, I then... eventually they found out that I speak Hungarian, so there was\nalways a Hungarian there and asked me and I very naively give all the details of my life and all this\nand that, and I didn't understand why they looked at me, just looked at me, just looked at me, and\nalso Romania was tremendously gray and I could only think of 7984, going across Romania. And\nthat was only the beginning, 1951, you know?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: Yes, I refer to the book 1984, or the movie rather, okay? It's the same thing, but the movie is the\none that I always keep in my mind when I think of Romania. So I arrived on the Hungarian border\nand here was an officer on the border looked at my papers and all this and he, I'll never forget what\nhe told me, he said to me, \u201cI don't know where you come from, but it must have been very bad, very\nbad there, that you come from.\u201d And he looked at me and said, \u201cWelcome to Hungary.\u201d And this\nwas a border guard officer. And I thought this is a strange thing, what does it mean? Well, I\nlearned very quickly. When I boarded the train again on the other side of the border, it was just as\ngray as coming through Romania and then finally when I arrived home, I looked around, I realized\nthat I was totally, totally misled. Never have I been misled before or after the way I was. I arrived\nthere and it was the grayest, most colorless, most suspicious, paranoid society you can imagine.\nAnd my bad period started with, of course, not being able to get a job, any job, there was no one,\ngoing to the university, of course, was ridiculous to think about because I was an unreliable element,\nI came home, number one, from the West, I was an imperialist agent, as far as they were concerned,\nnot only that, I was a Zionist imperialist agent. And it took me almost six month to get a job to\nsweep a floor, to sweep floors and clean oil off the concrete in a garage, in a state-owned garage.",
        "A: With great connections, the fact that my father was from the working class and many of his brothers\nand their friends were involved, but mainly their friends of where they come from, this suburb of\nHungary, a very poor one, suburb of Budapest, where now the communist officials with great\nconnections, but nobody wanted any names, nobody wanted to stick out their neck, they just\nsomehow pushed some paperwork somewhere and I was an, kind of an auxiliary labor help, a no\nname person whom they hired because they needed somebody to clean something. And that was\nthe only job I could get. What hurt me even more was the fact that my good friends on the street,\nsome of them who stayed in Hungary, not too many because most of them escaped, but they would\nnot want anything to do with me because most people didn't want to touch me, didn't want to talk to\nme, they don't know me, they rather would go to the other side of the street than to meet me. Some\nprobably out of disgust that how stupid a human being can be to come back to this, and others for\nfear.",
        "A: Yes, yes, because I had been out, it doesn't have to be, it didn't have to be Israel, anyone, it was a\ntotally paranoid society, everything that happened in the Soviet Union was copied the next day, you\nknow. So the, I worked in this garage for about six month and I always noticed with great nostalgia,\nhow they have these posters about urging workers to go to college and I wanted to go to college,\nand I went to the Party secretary of the firm which had about twelve garages, had to sign a paper\nthat recommends you to go to the next step and every time I went to see him, he laughed at me, he\nsaid, \u201cYou know that you are here by the grace of a few people and not, you have no merits to go\nthere.\u201d So the, my break came when the secretary became very ill, the Party secretary of the firm,\nand they sent out a temporary Party secretary, and she was a woman, she was very busy when I\nentered, you know, dirty and overalls and all this, and when I told her what I wanted, I got an, this\nopportunity and try, now, when I told her what I wanted, she said, \u201cWell, I don't have time to write\nyou a recommendation. I'm glad that a worker wants to go to college, we need working youth, why\ndon't you dictate what you need to my secretary and I will just sign it.\u201d So I passed the first hurdle,\nwith this I went to the university where I had to submit this. This was a committee, they\ninterviewed you and they read your, you had to write your, your biography, autobiography for\neverything, everything. So here was a committee, admitting committee, the Young Communist\nLeague, the Communist Party, one from the faculty, et cetera, about, I would say, seven, eight\npeople. And when they got to certain points, they said, \u201cCome on, you must be joking that you\nreally think that, you know, you can come here.\u201d Well, I left and as I was going out a man whose\nname was Mr. Bartos, he was on the faculty, this was the Hungarian Teachers Academy, this was\nthe university where I wanted to go, it was called the Teachers Academy, but it was part of the\nuniversity. He came out and he said, \u201cHolczer, Holczer, didn't your father play on a certain soccer\nteam?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d He said, \u201cDidn't your father have four or five brothers playing on the same\nsoccer team?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes.\u201d And he said, \u201cOkay, come back in September and see, maybe\nsince you were a minor when you left the country, I will try and write to the Ministry of Education,\nmaybe something can be done.\u201d Well, I was holding my breath for three months, I went back in\nSeptember and I went into the Party secretary's office, they had no idea who I was, they couldn't\nfind any paper, anything, so I was looking for him. And I found him and he said, \u201cJust a second.\u201d\nHe went into the Party secretary, he came out a few minutes later and he said, \u201cI am very happy to\ninform you that the Minister of Education, on the basis that you were a minor when you left\nHungary, give you special permission to enter the university.\u201d And he said, \u201cNow, this was the last\ntime you ever talk to me, you ever looked at me, you ever even thought that we have anything to do\nwith each other. Never again.\u201d He said, \u201cThat is the price. You understand?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d Said,\n\u201cand say hello to your dad.\u201d That was it. I went home, my father remembered him, they played on\nthe same team. And he was the head of the physical education branch of the faculty, you know?\nAnd this is how I got in. And I had a very, very good time because I found out ninety-nine percent\nof the kids thought the same way as I did and there were very few communists, very few. And yet,\nwhen it came to 1953, I almost was, I was thrown out for about one week. Stalin was dying and\nwhen he, in his last breath, he looked up, he saw doctors around him and he was paranoia, he said,\n\u201cWho are these?\u201d They said, \u201cDoctors.\u201d And Stalin was very anti-Semitic and he said, \u201cAre they\nJewish doctors?\u201d And I think, out of twelve or so, seven or eight were Jewish, they said, \u201cYes.\u201d\nThey said, \u201cArrest them.\u201d And they were, all the doctors around Stalin were arrested a few days\nbefore he died. And then, when this happened, in Hungary, too, they were looking for Jewish\ndoctors or anybody who was, had anything to do with Zionists because they called them the Zionist\nconspiracy against Stalin and they found me at the college. They had to, since this was a chain\nreaction, that went down. So they found me and they told me to go home and that I am a Zionist\nthis and Zionist that. And Stalin died three days later and I mean, I was just heartbroken because it\nwas before exams and all this and it was in March and I was ready to take my exams soon and then\nwhen everything died, died down, and the so-called Thaw, this is what they called it politically, the\nThaw started, then they called me back and they said forget about the whole thing and continue.",
        "A: Mmm-hmm.",
        "A: My father's former employers, either died or escaped in 1947 or 1948, to the West, so this, what I\nmentioned, was a volunteer work. Everybody, basically, had to volunteer to do something. This\nwas volunteer work, he volunteered to be appointed to this position and this was not a paid job.\nAnd it did not require a great deal of his time. He immediately looked for some opportunity and\nstarted to work for a co-op, a lot of co-ops started and what co-ops were are a group of people who\nbanded together and formed a what you would call a, maybe a small enterprise, as long as they\nworked under the ruse of a cooperation and everything was divided, the profit if there was any, and\nthey paid their taxes to the state, this was what the communists considered kind of a happy in-\nbetween of state farms or state enterprise and private enterprise. Because private enterprise was\nphased out gradually, except in cases such as a shoe maker that, you know, repairs shoes, but even\nfor that, eventually, they had co-ops, shoemaker co-ops or tailor co-ops or this, but a few, a few of\nthose branches, that you could not really work any other way except in a co-op, but he was working\nfor a co-op where he rose eventually, he was a very smart man, and he rose to be kind of a midlevel\nmanager, but also working and this co-op was working with a lot of women who would then get the\nmerchandise and do it at home. They were making shopping nets and shopping bags and things like\nthat that anybody can do on a sewing machine at home. And then they would bring it in and so\nactually they had a very, a very small area, a very small base and just a warehouse and he enjoyed\nthis, he enjoyed it and he was very much liked. The only problem he had occasionally is that they\nasked him, because he was such a good worker, and he received all kinds of awards that he didn't\nreally want particularly because he was not very, you know, infatuated with the communist system,\nthey always wanted him to join the Party because he was a perfect, what they called cadre, cadre, he\ncomes from the working class, he was a hard-working man, he was an honest man, he rose from\nnothing to a midlevel manager, so he was an ideal person. But he never joined, he always said,\n\u2018No, absolutely no.\u201d So that, he was such a good worker, they left him alone.",
        "A: No, my mother was totally just a mother and a housewife, she never had any, any, and I can't\nremember my mother having, you know, political opinion or anything like that, she had other\ninterests. She read a lot and went to the movies and she loved visiting around during the day, she\nwas kind of a social butterfly.",
        "A: Yes, that was my, in college, geography and history.",
        "A: Interestingly, with most people, you could talk politics. You know, eventually, throughout these\nyears, we isolated the ones who were suspicious to us and... because they were always eager beaver\nParty workers and give big speeches and some of them did big speeches and we knew that we can\nstill talk to them, they\u2019re just careerists and they just want to go ahead. But I would say the great\nmajority, even in the worst days, we could still discuss things. Obviously, we didn't do it on the\nstreet, we didn't do it elsewhere except in our own home or in a restaurant where there was a lot of\nnoise and they couldn't discern, you know, who says what. So in this respect, we did not really have\na kind of a prison atmosphere in college. And our professors, I would say eighty percent of them\nwere very much against the regime and occasionally they let that go in very, you know, ambiguous\nstatements. We recognized it immediately and all this, but just to give you one example, most of us,\nwe had to go to Russian instruction every day, most of us either didn't show up or if we did, we\ndidn't listen, we didn't learn anything, and after going through college, at the end you had to take a\nstate exam. And I, the exam in Hungary at that time was you had to draw a written note on which\nyou had a topic. And you were given fifteen minutes to take notes on that topic from your memory,\nyou were given a pencil and some paper, and when you were called upon, this was your turn and\nyou could talk about, introduce your topic and there was a committee. And I went to my Russian\nexam, and this happened to other people too, and I drew my topic and I couldn't even read the title,\nlet alone, couldn't read the title, I yust, in these years I just never bothered to read, to learn enough to\nread. Today of course, I'm not very proud of this, because now I know that the more languages you\nspeak, you know, the more lives you have, but those days, this was a political statement, they\ncouldn't believe it, they just couldn't believe it because I was straight A in my subjects and so there\nwas tremendous animosity toward me from the police, from the Party secretary and all the others.\nCan we stop?\nEnd of Tape 6, Side B\nTape 7, Side A",
        "A: Oh, the Russian exam. And then I found out later that some of my classmates had the same\nproblem and, eventually, they decided not to, not to have us back, so they just gave us a D and they\nwere very angry about it. But in a way it was their fault, too, because how could we get up to that\npoint, going through all classes, didn\u2019t they realize that something is wrong? Well, this, I remember\nthis very distinctly, that that was one way to show our reaction to what was going on. And\notherwise, even the ones who were very active in the Communist Party, most of them always gave\nus a signal that this is all a show, there is nothing to worry about. There were very few people. So\nwhen I left the college, at that time, you, I became a teacher and we were supposed to go to the\ncountryside, they could not, you could not teach in Budapest the first year and I was then assigned\nto a little, small village, not far from Vacz, from my mother's birthplace, only a few miles and taught\nthere for a year. And this was a small village of a minority, Hungary has very few minorities, but\nthey have some Slovak minorities in the North, these were Slovaks and they speak, they spoke very\nlittle Hungarian, but they would not admit it because they were afraid that there would be\nrepercussion, so they asked for a Hungarian teacher, they could have asked for a Slovak-speaking\nteacher, too. And it was quite an experience, but it has nothing to do with being Jewish or with the\nHolocaust, none of that came up, it was just a totally different one. And then after this year that I\nspent in... I made contact again, I wanted to get back with a youth organization and I found\ninterestingly that the Communist Youth Organization, the Pioneer organization probably could use\nme because, I mean I went through the boy scouts, I went through the Zionists, I had some very\ndefinite ideas and I answered an ad and became a director of a summer camp. They looked for a\nyoung teacher who, I had about twelve other young teachers with me and it was in Budapest, it was\njust a day camp, and it turned out to be such a good experience that the local Communist Party\nsecretary asked me if I would like to come and teach in the district. And I said, \u201cNaturally, this is\nit!\u2019 And so I was transferred to, just to a suburb of Budapest and I taught there until the Revolution\ncame and I escaped again.",
        "A: '53.",
        "A: Yeah, the Revolution came in '56, okay, so. . .",
        "A: Yeah, right. One year in the countryside and two years in this suburb. Junior high.",
        "A: During the Revolution, they asked me to organize a Democratic Teacher's Union. I was not a Party\nmember, they knew that I was not also an anti-Party member either because, and this I wanted to\nbring out and emphasize, that as a Jew in Hungary, you could never be truly an anti-communist\nbecause you knew one thing, as long as the Communist Party was in power, there would be no\npogroms and your life is safe. And this is what happened after communism, and communist fall,\nmost of my relatives and friends who were in Hungary, this was their greatest fear, that what will\nhappen to them now. And anti-Semitism is now rampant in Eastern Europe, in Hungary, too. So\nthis is just an interlude, I just wanted to say something about that. So I was just teaching in this\nsuburb and until the Revolution and as a, and during the Revolution, they sent for me and they\nwanted me to get the Democratic Teachers Union together, various democratic organizations, and\nall this. And I came out to a couple of briefings with people, with the local council, the town\ncouncil, the district council and one day there was some fighting out there and I saw a bunch of\npeople with armbands, the Arrow Cross armbands. And I looked out the window and all my desire\nto ever do anything or to stay there, just went away. Right in that moment. I realized that this is\nnow when I have to leave. Even though I had a very good life, the last three years, after I was\ntransferred to Budapest, I had a very, very good life, relatively speaking, you know? A good salary,\nI started to write for the newspaper, the... stories about young people. I ran camps and financially,\nand I got all the recognition and awards and all this, I couldn't complain. But when I saw, when I\nsaw that, the symbol, I went home and I said, \u201cThis is it. I will never return except to visit.\u201d And I\ntold my parents, \u201cIn two weeks, I'm leaving.\u201d",
        "A: Well, when I was transferred to Budapest, immediately I started to teach geography, they had these\nso-called pioneer houses, these were buildings where the kids can come back in the afternoon and\ndepending on their interests, join groups, study groups. And I was running the geography group\nwhich was a lot of introduction and simulations of how a river is meandering and then old river 1s\nmeandering, a lot of tests, hands-on type of activities. I took them to hike and I taught them how,\norientation in nature and all, everything that was romantic in the boy scouts. And from this, I kind\nof organized a group of very enthusiastic kids who eventually would follow me anywhere, you\nknow, and it appealed to me as a young, and I can still do that, and so then people saw this and they\nhired me to run big camps. But I always neglected the political thing, that was not, I never really\ncared for the politics, but I emphasized the romantic thing. I even wrote a book for the Pioneer\nmovement and suggested a completely new uniform and emblems and all this, what kids love at that\nage, because the Pioneer uniform is the most, was the most impractical thing a child can have. A\nwhite shirt, can you imagine, with dark blue pants and a red kerchief, I mean, and nothing on it, they\nwere not, they couldn't have any emblem anything, so I said, \u201cNo, a child wants to see his or her\nachievements, right there, he or she wants to show it to the world.\u201d And so they were, they were\ngiving me some free hand to do it and I did a lot of this, submitted it, it was accepted, so this 1s what\nI loved, that I could have some influence and push them away, mainly from politics, into romantic\nactivities, you know, and that is the one, that is, I think that pleased me a_ great deal. And\neventually, it was a, I did it until the very last day, until I left Hungary, and I still corresponded with\nmany of my kids who were in my group as adults. And when I went back later on, ten years or\nfifteen years later, some of these kids were running the same kind of camps and organizations and\nthey always came and they said, \u201cYou know, if you had told us that in the middle of the night we\nhave to leave our homes so that nobody will wake up and assemble in a place, we would have been\nup there. And we would have been following you all the way out to the border.\u201d I didn't tell them\nthat I was leaving because I didn't want them to even have this silly idea, but after I left some of\nthem learned about it and three of them came after me and ended up in Switzerland, but eventually\nwent back to Hungary. So occasionally, when I am in Hungary, I do bump into them and I go out\nand look up some, and those who were very nice to me, I always see. I even see the Communist\nParty secretary, the woman who was influential to get me, I took my wife, too, to see her during the\nlate \u201870s and early \u201880s, she and her husband, I just, they were good people. They came from the\nold communist underground, you know? And though we never talked about it, I'm sure they were\njust as disappointed in what happened to Marx ideas as most other people. But they would never\ndiscuss it because they were too loyal to the Party.",
        "A: Yeah. I was on the street all the time because I believed that I have this, anybody, most Holocaust\nsurvivors have an intuition, have a, somehow, a sixth sense and we always wanted to read the\ncrowd. The mood of the crowd. And so I was in the street all the time, watching what's happening,\nkind of sensing the undercurrent. I was like an animal and I knew that I knew exactly what was\ngoing on. And I knew that these people eventually could be up to no good or quite a few of them\ncould be up to no good because, you know, the leopard doesn't lose its spots and even though it all\nstarted with great democratic slogans, eventually after two weeks, it did disintegrate and there were\na lot of fascist groups and I did not want to live under Russian tanks, but I was glad, myself, that the\nRussian tanks came back. I just didn't want to live under that system either, but at least 1t saved the\nlives of a lot of people because there were ugly incidents. The Revolution started for two weeks, the\nfirst one week was kind of democratic and looked like democratic and the second week, just\neverything disintegrated and the crowd went berserk and I didn't trust any of that any more.",
        "A: Well, unfortunately, after looking at all the countries where anti-Semitism 1s so rampant, has been\nand still is, I must conclude that all Catholic countries are that way in Eastern Europe, only the\nCatholic countries. Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia, these are the countries where, and some\nof them have very little Jews, in Poland there are only a few thousand Jews left. I have experienced\nanti-Semitism all the time, [coughs] excuse me, and even when I go home nowadays to visit, well I\nhaven't been to Hungary for the last three years, but the letters I receive from my relatives constantly\nrefer to that and my family was never very much interested in bringing this out because they are,\nrather, they consider themselves Hungarians, the ones who are living in Hungary today and I'm\nalways surprised that this is a main concern to them, so apparently this situation has never changed.\nIn 1919, Hungary became the first fascist country of Europe, even before Hitler, and stayed that\nway, at least, even today under the current, the undercurrent is very anti-Semitic, the Jews are\nresponsible for everything just like in the Middle Ages.",
        "A: Well, the Revolution was defeated in the first week of November and it took me about ten to\nfourteen days to get going. I just wanted to say goodbye to my good friends and my family and also\nI had a cousin who wanted to come with me and I had to do a little preparation there, too, because\nhe was just a high school graduate and a very green fellow at that. And eventually he brought his\nfriend, so the three of us started out and in about ten, ten to fourteen days, I can't remember exactly,\nbut no more than two weeks. I just wanted to see exactly what works, what doesn't work, how can I\napproach the border, the most practical way, a lot of people were practically there and then captured\nand brought back to Budapest. And the repercussion was nothing but still, you didn't want to go\nthrough all this and then in the last second, just before you would go over to Austria, captured, you\nknow, be captured, so I kind of did a little homework, that's all, and tried to think of the practical\naspects of how to do that.\nEnd of Tape 7, Side B\nTape 8, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. I... basically, I want as little to do with Hungary as possible, and Hungary usually\ncome up in my dreams, in a nightmare.",
        "A: Yes. I... obviously I\u2019m not that devoted to Hungary. I\u2019m not a person who really believes much\nin national identity, you know, I just... I feel that cause more problems, that and religion, than\nanything else, so I\u2019ve never been a patriot of basically any country, and there... I still am not. So,\ndoes it sound all right? Yeah, an eye on there. All those countries, so they wouldn\u2019t turn Fascist.",
        "A: Okay, yeah.",
        "A: This was probably off the record.",
        "A: You don\u2019t want to... although I can, you know, I can...",
        "A: I\u2019m willing to say this on tape, too.",
        "A: Doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Well...",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t mind visiting Hungary, but... and the reason I don\u2019t mind visiting, because I still\nhave friends and some relatives I care to see and I care to be with. But, on the whole, when I am\nthere, I feel like a total stranger, which is not... which is not just because of what happened to\nme, it\u2019s also a tremendous generation gap. Most of the people of my age, are... [dog barks]\nprobably you have to stop that.",
        "A: Yes, that I... as I mentioned, I like to be with people, but the feeling of totally estranged, I realize\nis not just what happened... because of what happened to me, but also because I am now a... I...\nreaching the age when most people are just not around any more. And I... it\u2019s a strange thing to\nwalk through streets where you used to play, and you know that nobody is there any more from\nyour previous life. However, when I hear some anti-Semitic remarks, which you can hear often\nin Hungary, even today, or I see some very rude behavior, then I realize that I am very lucky not\nto be here, yeah. So... and I have never been a patriot of Hungary. I\u2019ve never had a Hungarian\npassport in my life. I\u2019ve always been really, stamped. Every document I ever had in Hungary,\nhad a big... a ZS on it, which meant I was a Jew. So, since I was never a first class citizen, not\neven a second class, no citizen at all, I just don\u2019t have any attachment to the country, as such. I\ndo have attachment to certain places where I grew up.",
        "A: Oh yes, I became an American citizen in 1961, and so I always kid people who ask me, when\nthey hear my accent, what happened to me, how come a foreigner is teaching American\ngovernment? Some of my students question me and I said, \u201cWell, I have been an American much\nlonger than you, and your parents.\u201d And so...",
        "A: Oh, definitely. I must be honest and say that I do not have nationalistic feelings, as most people\nwould have. The flag or a national anthem doesn\u2019t really mean much to me. I don\u2019t consider that\npatriotism. But I like a lot of things here, especially the constitution, and I appreciate the fact that\nI can live a free life and for them I am very grateful and my patriotism manifests itself this way,\nand not by waving the flag.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t, because I couldn\u2019t... I couldn\u2019t read it, I didn\u2019t speak English, and in Hungary, they\nwere not very eager to translate the American Constitution as I was growing up. But when I\ncame here, and I began to learn English and eventually when I went back to school, and was a\nhistory major, I had to... so, base... my first encounter with the Constitution was in college, in\nFresno.\n?",
        "A: Oh I thought that it was a tremendous document, naturally, and I still admire the people who\nwrote it. I consider them geniuses, creating something from nothing, truly, and I wish that we\nhad some of that caliber walking around today in Washington.",
        "A: Yes, because I never in my life held any kind of citizenship or any kind of passport. And the fact\nthat now I have something that will... unfortunately, that in the 20\" century, the fact that you are\na human being, with two eyes and a nose and everything else on you, 1s not sufficient proof for\nyou to travel around the world and be protected by international law. Considering all this, I felt\nmuch safer now that I have a country behind me and I am protected in case I am in trouble\nsomewhere. Yes, it meant a great deal, because those days, I liked to travel a lot, and it was a\nsense of security that I had from it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, since I came from a Communist country, and before that a Fascist country, initially the\nU.S. was never painted as a paradise. Never even painted as any country that is desirable to live\nin. All I heard about it was negative. However, I was raised in a family, my father was a very\nenlightened man, and he raised me on the truth, so I knew that this is the country of the free. And\nI had no qualms about this. The thing that bothered me a great deal about coming here, and also\nI, as I mentioned before, I did not come here... this was not my first choice, you know, I had to\nfollow my cousin. What bothered me, I have... I was never that much in favor of modern times\nand fast times, and a landscape with skyscrapers, that was not my vision of my future life. I was\na typical European, who felt a lot more comfortable in... on a narrow street with half-timbered\nhouses, and a lot of people on the street, and sidewalk caf\u00e9s, and little restaurants. Then to go to\na country where none of this would exist. So I had my reservations this way, emotionally. I had\nno qualms about the United States politically, but I was worried about how can I adjust to a place\nthat doesn\u2019t have much traditions.",
        "A: Yes, yes, very much so. I still am very nostalgic when it comes to, for example Christmas. I\nconsider our life here quite plastic and I understand why. I am not faulting anyone for it. I know\nthat a country that 1s so young as the United State, just never had the opportunity to develop\nthose traditions that European countries have, that existed now for thousands of years. And so...\nBut it is just sad. I feel that a great deal of problems come from the fact that we are so young, and\nwe grew too quickly, almost like a teenager who just became totally uncoordinated.",
        "A: Well, in the war, we listened, as long as he was around, and we had an opportunity, we listened\nto London, to the BBC, it was... and occasionally, I think, but I am not so sure, even the Voice of\nAmerica could be heard. And, of course there, we heard a great deal about the western... so-\ncalled western world. And realized that while we are living there as practical slaves, in the\nwestern world, people have a very good life. And that appealed to me a great deal.",
        "A: I think it was no more than two weeks. It was just a screening process to just give a very\nsuperficial screening, so certain elements, undesirable elements would not sneak into the\ncountry. They were looking for members of the Communist Party and unfortunately, people who\nwere sick, because with certain illnesses, you could not gain entrance to the United States. For\nexample, if you had TB. And then, from there... and also, they were in charge of sending you\nsomewhere. So, they were kind of dispatchers.",
        "A: Saint Louis.",
        "A: Yeah, Saint Louis, Missouri.",
        "A: In Saint Louis... Saint Louis, Missouri, I was welcomed by the family, by that time, adopted, of\ncourse, just symbolically, my cousin, and we were united. They were a... you might say upper-\nmiddle class American family with some problems and they thought that getting two Hungarian\nrefugees would probably mitigate their circumstances. And I was, within weeks, working for a\nwholesale jewelry company. I was just a stockboy. And, very simple work, and that was my job.\nAnd on weekends, as long as my cousin was with me, of course, we were walking around and\ngoing to a movie, even though we couldn\u2019t understand much of it. But just planning, eventually,\nto be integrated into this society. And on weekdays we worked, we went home, we watched\ntelevision. And the family was... it was a very interesting situation, because the man was manic\ndepressive and we could never figure out what his moves would be next. The... his wife was a\nvery darling woman, and she was the one who tried to figure this out, that with two Hungarian\nrefugees, the situation might change. They had a mentally retarded son in an institution, who\ncame home on weekends and they had another son at home, a very brilliant young man, who was\nalways creating something electrical, or mechanical, even. So, we had good relationship with\nhim, and I kept up with my host mother for a long time, and only when we left for Europe, that\nwas the time when I lost contact and I don\u2019t know where she is. I understand they got a divorce\nafter. It was in... unbearable to live with somebody who was so unpredictable.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, yes.",
        "A: Well, I realize that I was in a trap, because there was no way for me to go back to Europe, even if\nI wanted to, and be accepted by a... any country and get some legal status anywhere. The reason\nwas, once you were placed in a country, you couldn\u2019t really do much about it any more. So I\nknew I had to make the best of my stay here, but I certainly didn\u2019t want to stay in Saint Louis,\nbecause I was totally astonished at the prejudice in Saint Louis. Not just against Blacks, but also\nagainst just about anyone. I worked mainly, this 1s my fate, with German, it was a German\ncompany basically, a German family, German workers and I heard enough of... you cannot name\na group or a race around the world about whom they were not talking during the day, always in\nvery derogatory terms. And then I found out that Saint Louis was a very Germanic city at that\ntime. You were either of German descent, or you were Black. And luckily, when I became very,\nvery upset about this, my Black fellow workers, first by sign language, probably, and later on, as\nI learned my English, pidgin English back then, they invited me on weekends to be... to go\naround with them, because they said one cannot just sit at home. And they introduced me to the\nSaint Louis that most people who were born there, probably, wouldn\u2019t know. I went to just about\nevery nightclub, I heard just about every jazz band that there existed those days, that came to\nSaint Louis. And many times, in a huge dance hall, I was the only white face. And of course,\nsometimes, I ran into almost trouble too, because of that.",
        "A: No, because most of those Germans were Jews, and... but that didn\u2019t prevent them from being\nprejudiced against me too, and they knew that they were... that I was Jewish. It was just a general\nthing in Saint Louis, to look down on anyone who is not an established person. And I felt this,\neverywhere. I just... and the situation at home, where I was staying with these people, was also\nnot very happy. And that, I think, contributed to my thoughts that, how nice it would be to go to\nsome other place.",
        "A: Yes, yes, that surprised me very, very much. In one of these weekend excursions, I was\nintroduced to a very charming college student, she was Black, and we started to date. And\neventually, she explained to me that we cannot see each other any more, because her life was in\ndanger, and my life was in danger. And she said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand this now, but twenty\nyears from now you will understand. And as much as it hurts me, we have to stop seeing each\nother.\u201d And that was my first great introduction to prejudice, really, on a personal, you know,\nbasis.",
        "A: No, I mean, you know, I came from a society that was tremendously prejudiced and I thought I\nam coming to a society that is much more different and much more positive about these things.\nAnd it really surprised me that there was so much dislike and hatred, that I knew could not be\nerased very soon.",
        "A: This was in 1957, and by 1957, June, I was gone. So I only lived there for five months or so. And\nI... my English was not good enough to read newspapers or even discuss anything political with\npeople. I did watch television, because I felt that 1t was a good way to learn, and I got certain\nideas, but I am not aware that I was... anyway I ever met, you know, this kind of a problem in\nSaint Louis, no.",
        "A: Well, when you are... this is my great argument against bilingual education, that when you have\nto, you learn everything. You can learn Chinese probably, just as well as you learn English. No,\nfor Europeans, English is an easy language to learn. Not so easy to write, but to learn, because\nit\u2019s... the grammar is much simpler than some European languages. I just put my mind to it, and I\ndecided, if I am here, I might as well do it. I could have gone to Cleveland, for example, and live\nmy life as a Hungarian, but I wanted to be integrated into the society, and I love the English\nlanguage, that\u2019s the truth. I think of all the languages, even though I admit that French is a very\nbeautiful language to listen to, but I love the English language, I love... and this is why I love to\nread and I learned just by listening and my willpower, I think, helped me to get through. And\namong all the people eventually I associated with, who arrived at the same time, I made the most\nprogress, because I just decided I don\u2019t want to belong to any Hungarian club and I don\u2019t want\nanything to do with this. I really want to learn English.",
        "A: He saw a newspaper article about us, 1n the... I think 1t was the Saint Louis Post Dispatch. He...\nBecause we were the first ones, my cousin and I think the first Hungarian refugees. And he cut it\nout and misplaced it somewhere, and only a few month after, somehow th-the article came up\nand he called us and he invited both of us to dinner, to his house. And by that time my cousin\nwas gone, so I went and I met him and his family. He just wanted to socialize and talk about the\ndays in Hungary. He came to... he had come to this country before I, right after World War II.\nAnd his wife was a former German psychiatrist, and they had one son. And...",
        "A: Yes, yes...",
        "A: ... they were. And... but of course, this doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. Interestingly, I last... I\nlost contact with them in... sometimes in the sixties, and reestablished it last year when I went to\nAspen. And Mrs. Chabay was there. The professor, Mr. Chabay, was already dead, but she was\nthere, visiting from Florida, where she lives in a retirement home. And so I had a good chat with\nher about the good old days.",
        "A: Yes, they ask me a great deal about that, naturally. But they were also very much interested in\nmy... at... in my present experiences then, which were also not very good. Something happened\nto me after I moved out of my original family, and established my independence. For a couple of\nmonth, I lived with a Hungarian couple who rented a room, because they needed some money,\nand they had a room with a separate entrance, so I rented that, and there I had a pretty bad\nexperience, and so I was just ready to leave, anywhere, in the United States. And this is when\nthey showed me a film of Aspen, Colorado, where they had the summer home, and where he was\na member of the music festival staff, and said, \u201cYou are coming with us.\u201d",
        "A: Well, it was... I don\u2019t even know if anyone in the future would completely understand it, but it\nwas just a strange coincidence that my father\u2019s company\u2019s... every company in Hungary had a\nParty secretary, they were in charge of practically life and death, what was going on. And my\nfather\u2019s Party secretary, a lady, was the mother of the person who rented the room. So, he and his\nwife immediately, when this came to the surface, they immediately were afraid that I might\nreport on them back to Hungary, which I had no interest, I couldn\u2019t care less, except one day\nthey... I heard a big argument and I realized that they were arguing about abortion. The man\nwanted his wife to abort, she was pregnant. They were very... social climbers, real social\nclimbers, who were constantly adding up, every penny on a piece of paper, figuring out when\nand how they can move, they can buy more furniture, they can buy this, they... a child was the\nlast on their priority list. And so I heard her cry, and all this, and a few days later I came home,\nand she was in a pool of blood. She had done something to herself, and I found her, and it...\nEnd of Tape 8, Side A\nTape 8, Side B",
        "A: And so the young man knew now that I... we have a secret, and he was afraid that I would report\nthis back to his mother. And of course, I had absolutely nothing to do with his mother. Then,\nnext, the mail from home stopped. I did not get any, any, any mail, which was very strange,\nbecause I had an agreement with my parents that every week we shall write to each other. They\nreceived letters from me, desperate letters, what happened to you? And nothing. This went on for\nweeks and weeks, until I went to a Party, and the woman confidentially asked me to step aside,\nand told me that she was with them somewhere, and they were a little bit tipsy, and they were\nsaying that they are stopping all my mail and stuff it under their mattress. I left the place very\nquickly, I went home, looked under their mattress, and I found all the letters, and confronted\nthem with this, and I knew that I would have to move out, and that\u2019s exactly when this happened,\nthat I was invited and they said, \u201cOh, you come with us.\u201d",
        "A: Yes. I went to Aspen, and that was like going from a cave to paradise. Not only that it was\nbeautiful and now, I had always been a mountain man, but the people, I just loved the people.\nThat was way before Aspen was discovered and made into the rich man\u2019s Mecca. It was now a...\nit was a great deal of Europeans... Americans from the 10th Mountain Division that exist... that\ntrained there during World War II, and many of its members came back and established Aspen. It\nwas just a marvelous group of people. Today, of course, they are all dead, but their names are on\nstreets, and the recreation centers and parks. And it just... it was a little bit weird for me to return\nand see all my friends names as street names and park names and all.",
        "A: What appealed to me is, number one, up on eight thousand feet, you need each other. The\nwinters are pretty harsh, and the summers were filled with tourists coming to the music festival.\nYou needed other people\u2019s help and you had to help others, too. There was just a camaraderie\nthere, a very open attitude that appealed to me a great deal. I was still young, and the fact that I\ncould get a job where I... my hours were not so regimented, even then... there, I felt so free. The\npay was good in comparison to other, you know, kinds of other areas of the United States. There\nwas so much color in the place. All kinds of people coming and going. It was just a... for a\nnewcomer, it was a marvelous, marvelous introduction to American life. There were people there\nwho were truly the most middle class, rigid family. There were people who were a very relaxed\nfamily. All kinds, and they were all... they all got along so well, that was a great surprise to me. I\nalso loved the fact that a great deal of the town, the eastern part, was still in such primitive state\nback then, that some miner shacks still had cooking utensils on the stove, just as they left them\nback at the turn of the century when the panic came and many of those miners went back to Italy\nand you... what is today Yugoslavia. So, there was a little bit of the old. Not everything was\nconcrete and glass, and well, even today the town has preserved a few buildings. I was very glad\nto see that not everything is rebuilt.",
        "A: Yes, yes, they were very much interested. These were the type of people, the locals and well,\nmost people worked in businesses that catered to tourists. And it was an asset if you had an\naccent, and if you look like somebody who had an interesting past, because they... sometimes\nthey hired me for a certain job just because I had a story. And yes, people were constantly\nquestioning you about this, and I couldn\u2019t care less, it... as a matter of fact, I enjoyed this kind of\nfifteen minutes in the sun. And so, I mean, in this respect, I had no problem.",
        "A: Mm, mm, well no, not much. The only people with whom I could really communicate about the\nwar, and what happened in Europe, were the ones who were in the European theater, and as I, as\nI mentioned before, many of the so-called 10 Mountain Division\u2019s members settled there, and I\nloved to talk to them, because they were very much involved in the liberation of some of the\nEuropean countries, so they knew where I came from. I just have to add one more thing to this,\nthat interestingly, the reason I am so fond of Aspen, even today, because I believe that my life in\nAmerica was shaped by that two and a half years I spent in Aspen. Almost every major\nfriendship, almost every major contact I had, after I left Aspen, was based on something that\nhappened to me in Aspen. Almost every one of them. I still am very close, and my closest friends\ntoday, I say, in the U.S. are those who were with me in Aspen, and those who still are alive.",
        "A: When I arrived there, immediately, the next day, I started to wash dishes in a little caf\u00e9 house\ncalled the Epicure. And I was there, I think, for no more than five days or so, when a very nice\nlooking Austrian gentleman stopped by and, who looked, I remember, who looked exactly like\nthe famous French actor, back then Fernandel, and said to me... he watched me washing dishes\nand he said, \u201cOh, I am so and so, Iam a friend of Mr. Chabay.\u201d And that was the gentleman who\nbrought me to Aspen. He said, \u201cAnd I would like you to come over and see my shop.\u201d And he\nbrought me over to his shop, he had a nice jewelry and gift shop, and it was... he was a\nwatchmaker and that was his main profession, but he also had a very, very nice place. And he\nasked me... we conversed in German, since he was Austrian and I spoke much better German\nthan English and he said, \u201cHow do you like my shop?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat a nice, nice, cute\nplace.\u201d He said, \u201cWould you like to work for me? I can give you this much,\u201d which was a lot\nmore than washing dishes. I said, \u201cBut how can you hire me? I don\u2019t speak English.\u201d He said, \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t ask you whether you speak English or not, I asked you whether you like my shop.\u201d And he\nsaid... And I said, \u201cYes,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re hired.\u201d And that was the kind of attitude that\nprevailed in Aspen. Easy going, fun loving, a lot of kidding. So I worked for Kurt Breznits, and I\nstarted to work for him, this was in 1957, about, I would say, July. And our friendship survived\nfor forty-two years, because he\u2019s the one, he and his wife, in their eighties, I visited them last\nyear. Now, I work there until late fall... early fall, excuse me. A young man came in around\nSeptember, and by that time there weren\u2019t too many people in Aspen, because it\u2019s a seasonal\nplace. At least back then, the off season, you could hardly see anybody in the street. At the end\nof September, people were leaving, the music festival was over, and the ski season came around\nin December. So everybody left, vacation, travel. A young man came in and started to talk to me.\nHe said, \u201cI got a problem, my mother has a birthday and I have to get something for her.\u201d I said,\n\u201cLook, that\u2019s not... shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d In my broken English I said that, and he looked at\nme and he immediately said, \u201cWell, where are you from?\u201d And of course, the whole story came\nabout and I said, \u201cWell, why is it a problem to buy something for your mother?\u201d He said,\n\u201cBecause she has everything.\u201d And this is how I met a then young man by the name of Sheldon\nRich, who was the son of a Chicago banking family. And on his twenty-first birthday he received\na nightclub from his parents, called, The Limelite. He just kept coming back and talking to me,\nand we just became really... friends. We\u2019d occasionally go out at night and he would bring his\ndate and I would bring a date, and had a very nice relationship. And then he came back later on,\nand he said, \u201cI have to leave my place, and there are three apartments in the nightclub. I just hate\nto leave the place unattended. Would you mind moving into one of the apartments? You can just\nstay there, and when I come back we can just share apartments, and no problem.\u201d Well, who'd...\nwho would refuse a free apartment? I moved into the Limelite apartment, and when he came\nback in December to open it that year, he said to me, \u201cLook, I desperately need somebody that I\ncan trust, to be the cashier. How would you like to work for me?\u201d He said, \u201cI double your\nsalary.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I would do that, but I am very loyal to my boss, whom I love dearly\nand I just... I just can\u2019t leave.\u201d He said, \u201cOh, this is America. We don\u2019t have to worry about that.\nI'll take care of that, P\u2019Il talk to him.\u201d He said, \u201cYou know, Robert, here, we don\u2019t even show up\nwhen we leave, we just call and say, send my check somewhere.\u201d He says, \u201cThere\u2019s no loyalty\nhere.\u201d I said, \u201cNo? You want me to be loyal to you.\u201d The conversation went on and on and on\nand I said, \u201cWell, I just cannot go to my friend, Kurt Breznits and say, \u2018I am leaving,\u2019 because\nyou double my salary.\u201d But the truth is, I needed money very badly to go back to school. That\nwas my aim, that once I mastered the language, I would go back to school. So, by the... I went to\nwork next day, and my boss and friend, Kurt Breznits was laughing and said, \u201cRobert, you don\u2019t\nhave to have these problems in this country. This is not Europe, and not only that, I would be\ndelighted if you can make twice as much money as you made here. I can\u2019t afford that salary.\u201d\nBut I said, \u201cBut we were such good friends.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, from now on, as long as you\u2019re in\nAspen, every Friday night, we will have dinner in my family home.\u201d So... and we did that, just\nevery Friday, I usually work late Fridays, so they had an early dinner, just so I can come. And we\nhad dinner together and talked a great deal. And we saw each other other nights too, but that\nproblem was solved, but I could never understand this distance that is between employees and\nemployers. I\u2019m still, even in my old days, as a high school teacher and all this, I would have been\nvery hesitant to go and report to somebody that I found a better place and I want to leave. I know\nit\u2019s silly, but 1t was just pounded into me that you are loyal. And so I worked for the Limelite,\nwhich became a very well-known nightclub those days, with a lot of folk singers, as that was the\ntime when the Kingston Trio and all the others became famous and it was the... you know, the\ngreat time of folk singing. Pete Seeger and all the rest, the... most of them came to this nightclub.\nAnd eventually, from cashier, I was promoted and eventually I ended up managing the place.\nAnd then my friend and boss, Sheldon Rich, became lucky, because his hated nightclub was\nsold. He could sell it to a group of folksingers who were singing there, three, four people, and\nthey formed a group called \u201cThe Limeliters,\u201d named after the club, became famous, and now\nthey could buy the club from him. So, he sold the club, and I became the employee of the group,\nand... up until 1959, when I left. But I maintained relations with one of the group, and his family.\nThese are people who still very much around today, you know, the four. And one of them, Glenn\nYarbrough, who was my friend, 1s still producing CD\u2019s.",
        "A: Yes, I knew that living in a tourist place, I knew that I would never have, probably, the money to\ngo out on my own, because every year, buying a place, and setting up some kind of a business,\nwas more and more expensive. As Aspen became more and more fashionable, everything\nbecame more expensive. Besides, I had no interest in opening a business. I always thought of\nmyself as an educator. I wanted to go back to school, and luckily, I got together with some\nadventuresome kids, and they told me about Alaska. They said that in Alaska you can make a lot\nof money and it\u2019s fascinating, and it\u2019s beautiful. And I loved to travel, so it was just a spur of a\nmoment when I decided that at the end of the season, around April, I would go and follow them\nto Alaska, and would try to make money, and then, eventually, that fall, I was going back to\nschool in Fresno.",
        "A: Why Fresno? Yeah, people always ask me this question, because I\u2019m the most unlikely person to\nend up in a central California town of practically no distinction. Hundred, hundred ten degrees\nheat. Why Fresno? Because they were the only ones, back those days, who answered my letters...\nnot giving me a scholarship, because I had trouble getting my records together from Hungary. It\nwas against the law, at that time, to send anything out, and I had to wait for my parents to find an\nopportunity to send it out with somebody. And so, I just... a college had to accept me on my\nword, and apparently they were afraid to do that. But Fresno said okay, you can come, spend a\nsemester, we\u2019ll find out how you function here, and then we will determine your status, based on\nthat. And we cannot give you a scholarship, but we can assure you about the National Defense\nScholarship, which was given to people who eventually end up in education. And so I applied for\nthat, and I got a National Defense loan, excuse me, not scholarship. That\u2019s what it was called\nback then. And I received that loan, and so eventually, after Alaska, I ended... I ended up in\nFresno. And of course, that was another eye opener, another piece of America that was very\nunknown to me. And it was a little bit of a crazy town, with... Fresno is the center of the\nArmenian population in America. And they were... I hit it off with them extremely well, no\nproblem, until they found out that I am writing my master thesis on Turko-American relations in\n1918-1920, and that was the time when the Armenians were persecuted terribly. And of course,\nno nation 1s all bad, no nation 1s all good. And of course, when they were reading a little bit of\nmy thesis, they found out that I was very sympathetic to Kemal Ataturk. Of course, I condemned\nthe method of getting rid of Armenians, but I was... I found some goodness. So we had some\nlittle differences, but all in all, I liked the people in Fresno. I liked them. I had a lot of foreign,\nforeign students, colleagues in the college and it was probably easier for me to navigate there,\nthan if I had gone to a big institution, where I would have been just a strange fish. Here I had a\nchance to talk to professors. It was just a very relaxed atmosphere.",
        "A: Uniformity.",
        "A: Well, I reported back, I remember to my relatives, and parents, I said, \u201cThis is not a country, this\nis a continent.\u201d I said, \u201cDon\u2019t think in terms of a country, this is a continent.\u201d It\u2019s... 1t will be that\nway for a long, long time, and I think it still is. When I travel, in spite of the uniformity that\nmodern age brings, you can still see that it is... it\u2019Il take a long time, and perhaps it shouldn\u2019t,\nperhaps this is the way it should be, that we still have areas that... like you can open your eyes\nand realize that you are not in Chicago, or not in New York. And hope that they will keep it this\nway.\nteaching, in a special ed school, in Marin county, and you mentioned you had a... you had\nwanted to go there because you had girlfriend in the area. And do you want to say anything more\nabout that time, or do you want to go on to saying something about... I\u2019d be interested in hearing\nhow you met Jan and what... kind of how your relationship grew, and was built, and whether...\nand what she knew about your past and what you talked... I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Why\ndon\u2019t...",
        "A: No, that\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Yeah, well, the... when I arrived at the Bay Area, for me that was just incredible. I practically\npinched myself every morning when I woke up and I saw the sun and looked around, and the\nscenery. I just couldn\u2019t believe that I was that lucky. I just couldn\u2019t find words to describe it to\nmy parents, the beauty of the area and the very uniqueness that the San Francisco Bay Area had\nfor me. And still, it holds just a fascination. It\u2019s almost like Europe in the United States, when I\nwalked the streets of San Francisco. I lived in Tiburon... Belvedere... no, Tiburon, I\u2019m sorry. I\nlived in Tiburon, Belvedere is just next door, which at that time was affordable for a bachelor\nschoolteacher like myself. Today, of course, it would be impossible. And I had a nice little\napartment in a duplex, overlooking what they call Raccoon Straight. And these are small, little\nislands in the bay. The sailboats were going back and forth all day. Tourists, you know, boats,\nand it was just a very, very picturesque environment. The type of people I associated with,\nmainly through school, through my job, were very pleasant. Most of them were very young, and\nwe did a lot of things together. I also had plenty of opportunity, of course, to go on my own. And\nthose days, I just was a restless spirit. I had a tendency to walk down, for example, at night, and\nsee the streets... the lights of San Francisco, and just feel that there is something going on in the\ncity that I\u2019m not part of, and I just have to hop into my car and go there. And I did that, and it\nwas then fifteen minutes, twenty minutes, I was in the city, going around. And so then, I was\nwalking around and I was happy, and I did a couple of things. And then I looked back and I saw\nthe lights of Belvedere or Tiburon or Sausalito, and I felt that there... something must be going\non and I\u2019m not part of it, so I hopped in my car and went back. So I was just restlessly looking\nfor that unknown beauty which really was just around me, all over. And I loved to hike up on\nMount Tamalpais. Mill Valley, all those communities were very unique to me, and I thought I\nwould live my life here, probably forever.",
        "A: 1961. And, as I mentioned previously, the only job I could get here was... teaching mentally\nretarded students, but I didn\u2019t mind, because I thought of the old Hungarian proverb that said for\nany... for something that you like, you would even let people chop wood on your back, and I\nstrongly believe in this. And so, I just... I didn\u2019t really consider teaching these children a great\ndeal different than teaching regular children. As a matter of fact, in certain aspects, in certain\nsense, it was even easier because they were so loyal and devoted to you. Naturally, there were\nsome problems with emotionally disturbed kids, who were in this group, too. But basically, it\nwas easy, because of their love and devotion. And I stayed in it for ten years, and after ten years,\nI honestly said to myself, I\u2019m burned out, I have nothing more to give, and this is when I\nreturned to regulating... teaching so-called normal children, if there is such thing. And my wife,\nyeah, I met my wife at a teacher\u2019s meeting, and our superiors, our administrators, were a rather\nstrange bunch of people, who had sometimes very unreasonable requests, and it had nothing to\ndo with education, such as we should have two pairs of shoes in our drawers, so we would never\nhave dusty shoes. And saying this to people who had to go out in the playground almost every\nhour, I mean it was strange. And they criticized the way we dressed or what we said, or we\nlooked, and they didn\u2019t much do it to me, but to... because I was a man, and I was the only man\non the faculty of the county, but mainly to women. And... so I met my wife and at that time she\nwas married with three children. And she struck me as a kind of a person who doesn\u2019t really\nwant others to know much about her. And I found out later there was a reason for that. Then...\nand we just discussed things, and I in my mind said, \u201cOh, this lady\u2019s quite cold.\u201d That was my\nfirst impression. And never bothered really much. But, our path crossed at these meetings, and\neventually, she was writing some kind of a publication for mentally retarded teachers, and she\ncalled me up, and...",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry. No, teachers of retarded students. And she called me up and she wanted my advice in\nsomething, which I still maintain, even up today, it was just a device to strike of...\nEnd of Tape 8, Side B\nTape 9, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, and as I was saying, first, I was not really very impressed, because she was not very warm.\nAnd then the relationship changed after her phone call, when she asked for some help, because I\nthought if a woman is really cold and reserved, she wouldn\u2019t call me and ask for help. And so I\ncalled her back and we started to chat, and from there on, occasionally, we called each other. But\nwe never talked about personal things, and so, the whole thing kind of petered out. And then,\nlater, a year or two years later, I was invited to a party, and to one of our colleagues, and he said,\n\u201cOh, by the way, Jan got a divorce. She is divorced, and she looks good.\u201d And according to...\nexcuse me... according to Jan, I said, \u201cWow,\u201d which I deny. I never said such thing. But anyway,\nthis, or whatever I did, or said, they considered it some kind of a sign for me that I would like to\nsee her. So they invited her and kind of matched us together one evening, and we hit it off just\nright. And from there on, I began to see her more often, and eventually, we just decided that this\nwas a pretty serious relationship. But I was thirty-seven, thirty-six and a bachelor, and I just was\nnot going to get married without giving it some thought. So, I did what my previous girlfriend\ndid, and signed up for one year to go and teach for the Army in Germany. And I arrived there,\nand I spent a year in Germany, and that year convinced me that yes, that she would be the right\nperson for me, so I came home. And we got married on Mount Tamalpais, on the top of Mount\nTamalpais, the mountain I loved to hike around, and the mountain we both saw every day,\ncoming and going to school.",
        "A: Five, six and eight.",
        "A: Interestingly, they were more interested then, than they are now. As little children, they kept\nasking me a lot, and these days, as adults, if we meet, maybe they fear they knew... they heard\neverything. But I am surprised that my sons, who are writing all the time, just as a pastime, never\nreally ask any questions. And they are around movies concerning the Holocaust and... back those\ndays. But no. But back then yes, yes, and I told them quite a bit, and it was not really that much\nabout the Holocaust. They were too little, and I didn\u2019t want to, of course, cause nightmares, but it\nwas mainly just life, what was life when I grew up and what I... the things I did, and they were\nfascinated by my accent, and they begged us to have another child, so he or she could have an\naccent. They thought that a baby is going to be born with an accent. And they laughed at my\nmistakes that I made, because sometimes they were really funny. And inadvertently, I did say\ncertain things that just sounded very strange, and still are a saying in the family.",
        "A: Pardon me? Such as, I... for a long time, I thought that fungus is really fangus, and so everybody\ncalled fungus a fangus. Once I told them something about a lawyer, and I... instead of lawyer, I\nkept saying liar. And they couldn\u2019t understand, and in the end they said, the difference is of no...\nwhen I learn, I said, \u201cGod, there is no difference, lawyers, liars, what\u2019s the difference?\u201d And so\nthere were many cute episodes. Drift and draft, I remember I had trouble distinguishing that.\n\u201cClose the... close the door, because there is a drift.\u201d And so ever since, everybody called it drift\nand not draft.",
        "A: Yes. There is no problem there. She really wanted to know everything and I told her everything.\nAnd she read a great deal. And, as a matter of fact, she is my police woman, because she doesn\u2019t\nallow me to watch anything concerning the Holocaust on television, because she says I have such\nnightmares that she doesn\u2019t want to wake me up and it just... too much trouble. But I was amazed\nthat after we got married, how much time she... and effort she spent, and energy in reading books\non Jewish history, and then, of course, going into her favorite theme, cookbooks. She has Jewish\ncookbooks and she knows more about Jewish cooking and holidays, and... so today when\nsomebody ask me about some Jewish custom or holiday or something, I always refer them to her,\nbecause she knows a lot more about it than I do. I just, because of my indifference to religion, I\njust never really give it too much thought, of learning much about holidays and the background,\nbut she did. And of course, there was never any question about conversion, anything like this,\nbecause I myself, I was not practicing.",
        "A: Yes, and the reason was, by the time we got married, the person who probably wouldn\u2019t have\nliked me, because he was a rabid anti-Semite, her father, was gone. Her mother was a very\ntolerant person, but she was dead, too, by the time we got married. So, the only relatives around\nthat she had, was her brother and her sister, who are 20\"-Century human beings, and they are\nvery, very tolerant, and very progressive people.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yes. By the time I arrived in the Bay Area, and even before that, as soon as I could\nunderstand and speak some English, I became involved in the social and political scene very\nmuch. For example, I remember when I... even before I settled in the Bay Area, I would come up\nfor the weekend and would go down, just by myself, to North Beach, in San Francisco, to the\nbeatnik coffeehouses, and just listen, or converse sometimes with people. I really enjoyed the\nbeatnik era. I liked those people, they were very introspective and intelligent. There was kind of\na subdued, refined attitude about them that I appreciated. Occasionally, when somebody played\nthe piano, they were sipping the coffee and philosophizing, just a great time, I think, for\nliterature, poetry reading. They were all part of the scene. That truly was an interesting chapter in\nmy life, going to North Beach. Then, later on, of course, after we were married, after I came back\nfrom Europe, from my one-year stint with the Army, which was in 1966, that is when everything\nstarted, especially the Vietnam War flared up. And our family was very much involved in that.\nWe were going over to the city, and I remember making big signs. My wife joined the Another\nMother for Peace movement. We were demonstrating, and there was a very cute episode that\nhappened to us. She usually sewed a lot for herself and for the children, and bought a very nice,\nflowery material to make a dress. And we went to a big demonstration over in Berkeley, and had\nto make our own signs. And we were getting the signs ready and all of a sudden, we look down\non our youngest son, Kevin\u2019s sign, and what did we see? A beautiful flower, of some textile, and\nif we looked at it, then we realized it was her dress material that she had bought. He was so\nfascinated by the pattern, and he needed flowers, because that was the theme of the\ndemonstration, you had to have flowers on your signs, that he didn\u2019t think twice, and he was\ncutting out the flowers from... what... we didn\u2019t know what to do about it, and then we decided\njust to talk to him, that this was not really the proper thing to do, but he didn\u2019t get punished. So\nthat was Vietnam. My sister-in-law wrote to, for example, to Lyndon Johnson and told him that\nshe fears that he should not run again. And interestingly, about three days later, he came out and\nhe announced that he would not run. So that... we felt that the family can take some credit for\nthat decision. But, we, we tried to have our children go and learn a lot about the times where we\nlived in, because we realized that they were very exciting times, very unique times. And perhaps,\nI always thought later on in their lives, life will be much duller than it was back then. We also\nlived, by that time, in Inverness, 1n an area that was in the center of all these cults, and rock\nbands and so the kids were exposed to all these people and spent sometimes days, just listening\nto their music, up in the hills. It had advantages, it had disadvantages. The disadvantage in this\nrespect was that, no matter what parents would say to their children, they always had a place to\ngo and because these rock groups had open house, you could help yourself at the fridge, or\nwhatever, eating, or no matter how young you were, you were also welcome to dip into the pot\nand smoke it. And so it was in a... in the sense, difficult. And many of our children in the area,\nwere runaways. They would occasionally run away because that was just the style.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Now that is a very surprising question, because I never really thought about it, but as\nyou were asking me, I realize I didn\u2019t really think much about myself any more, as a Holocaust\nsurvivor. I just thought much as a member of the scene, so to speak. I was more involved in what\nis happening in America, and thought more about it day by day, than to think too much, to give\ntoo much thought about the past. So, in this respect, it was good, because one should not\nconstantly be visited by ghosts. So I think it, it was a good thing for me, in this respect. And you\nknow, I was part of the whole story then, and, rather, an American fighting to end the war, and\nbring justice to people who were oppressed.",
        "A: Only... only it usually... it was provoked by watching some television story, or reading\nsomething in the newspaper. Otherwise, they were going away, they were becoming distant.",
        "A: The... now, this is a very complex story. When we lived in Germany, which was from 1974 to\n1993, I would say most of the time, when there was a West Germany and East Germany, the\nHolocaust was not a big problem, mainly because the West Germans were bringing it into the\nopen. It was not something hushed up under the rug. There were discussions about it in schools. I\nspoke about it to high school students, mainly. The whole... the whole problem with the\nHolocaust and the way Germans would look at it, really started after the Unification. Now, I\nmust also say that there weren\u2019t too many people who were alive in World War II, by this time.\nBecause I was fifteen when the war ended, and I am seventy now, almost. And so, most people\nare dead, who were in World War II. Now of course, it doesn\u2019t mean that Fascism as such, is\ndead, or was even... was dead. Yes, I heard anti-Semitic remarks, and sometimes, when I felt that\nit was the proper thing to do, I responded, and sometimes when I looked at the person, and I\nrealize it was a primitive old idiot, there was no reason to say anything. It would have been\ntotally superfluous to provoke anything, because it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference. I rather\nconcentrated on talking to people of the middle and the younger generation. And I found that\nintellectually, at least, they understood what was the Holocaust. They were very ashamed and\nsorry about it, and I felt no urge to drill in, with young people especially. I felt that they were\nprogressive enough. The younger German generation amazed me, because I think they are very\nprogressive, and I think they see history in the right light. How... all this changed after the\nunification, because you had now Eastern Germany joining. A country that was never taught\nproper history, where the Holocaust, oh well, only West Germans were responsible for the\nHolocaust, because all the Nazis, according to East Germany, were in West Germany. So, those\npeople had no background, and they had... they were not prepared for this historical fact and they\ndenied it. And this is why the skinhead movement and all the neo-Fascist organizations,\nbasically, come from, East Germany, even today. Add to this the usual reasons for Fascism and\nanti-Semitism, a very high unemployment and very bad economic conditions and the fact that\nunification didn\u2019t bring immediate remedies to all their problems. So they had to again go back\nand blame the old scapegoat, the Jews, in spite of the fact that there aren\u2019t too many. So, since\nthey couldn\u2019t attack many who are living among them, they went back to the past.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh, I think that everybody basically felt the same, that we lived truly in a moment of history that\nis... has just very, very few companions. That it was something extraordinary. And now, just a\ncouple of years before, nobody would have thought that in our lifetime, something like this will\nhappen. But of course, after the Soviet regime collapsed, then, then, it was inevitable. It still, it\nwas a surprise, and it was naturally something that will always be in my mind, because just a few\nweeks before, my granddaughter, who was about fifteen at that time, came to Europe and we\nwent to the Wall in Berlin, and we had pictures of her just standing by, and I was telling her that\nyou can bring back your children here, probably, and maybe even your grandchildren one day,\nand the Wall will still be here. And so, no, nobody anticipated such a rapid disintegration.",
        "A: Yes, the... my granddaughter who 1s twenty-four... I\u2019m sorry, twenty-four? No, no, twenty-two, I\ntalk to her, she knows quite a bit about the Holocaust. And we usually go together to movies, not\nnecessarily related to the Holocaust but sometimes do, like, we saw, \u201cLife is Beautiful\u201d together,\nand I make a point to take her to movies that deal with history... modern history, or the\nHolocaust, so we can talk about it. I want her to know everything. The, the... I have two\ngrandsons and I took them too, to the Holocaust Museum. And they are at the... they were at the\nage, they went through too fast for my taste, but I hope one day they will go back and they will\nslow down. And the other... grandchildren, or potential grandchildren, are still too young to say\nanything.",
        "A: Yes, I was teaching a regular American high school, where The American Army and the\nAmerican diplomat\u2019s kids would go. Just like any other high school. We had a... that was a\nschool district, just like an American school district. It was funded by the same way, and\noperated the same way and everything was the same, only the scene was Frankfurt, Germany.",
        "A: No, no, I did not have any. I had some German friends and we talked about the Holocaust, and\nthey knew about me, but it... we never really made it into a big deal, and I never really wanted to\nmake it a big deal, I didn\u2019t want them to think that I solely exist and maintain the friendship to\nkind of pound in the subject. They knew about me, they knew about my life, and we discussed it\nin... on very civil terms, and I knew that they were genuinely interested and sorry for what\nhappened. But, other than that, no, no, I did not have any other... occasionally, my high school\nteacher friend, the German couple, they invited me to their schools, to talk. And Germans\namazed me because, in our house, for example, there was a lady who was a farmer\u2019s daughter,\nand she was in a... kind of a mid-level managerial job with a pharmaceutical company and she\nhad constantly friends from Israel, and she was not Jewish. I had another... I have another very\nold friend in Germany, I met back in the early 1960\u2019s, and we have been friends ever since, and\nshe has friends constantly visiting her from Israel. She\u2019s also not Jewish. So, there\u2019s a lot of\ncontact between Israel and Germany, and well, I don\u2019t know whether this 1s a result of a... of a\nbad conscience or something, but certainly you cannot hold somebody who was not even alive at\nthat time responsible for anything that happened. No, that would be unreasonable. But it\u2019s not...\ntoday, it\u2019s not a big issue. It is a sad fact of history, especially in the western part of Germany.",
        "A: Oh, I could have stayed in Germany, by the sheer coincidence of my name, which is a German\nname and the fact that I was, for a few month, a German citizen, in World War II. And that was\njust for a few months, so I didn\u2019t include in any citizenship, just by a mistake and because of the\nstrange happenings of the times. They classified me as German in Hungary, and temporarily we\nwere considered Germans, and of course the whole thing was... oh, they only lasted for a few\nmonth when they found out who we were. But that little episode and my name, and the fact that\nthe reason the Hungarians tossed us out, besides being Jewish, they discovered that one of my\ngreat-grandparents was born in what is called Sudetenland, which was a part of German speaking\nCzechoslovakia, which was at that time, the Austro-Hungarian empire, and all back, it all\nconnects together, and it all added up to some very tragic events, because we were not\nconsidered Hungarians, and my grandfather was deported to Auschwitz, not because he was\nJewish, but because of they said he was a foreigner. He could not prove that his grandfather was\na Hungarian, which was not true. But because of this, and other reasons, I could have gotten\nGerman citizenship. I could have gotten, probably, a great deal of money that way, because of\nwhat happened to my family in World War II, and all this, but I never had, for a second, a\nthought. I mean, how can I think about settling in Germany, and taking German citizenship?\nThere are so many reasons why I shouldn\u2019t have done this, right? Number one is an emotional\nthing, a rational thing to... that would be a little bit too much for me to bear. Second is that I have\nan American family, and my wife was ready to return to the United States. There no way would\nshe have stayed in Europe with me. So, I knew that this was temporary, and I enjoyed while it\nlasted.\nEnd of Tape 9, Side A\nTape 9, Side B",
        "A: I just want to say that I know that, for the purpose of the interview, you\u2019re interested in anti-\nSemitism and where did I run into the most, and I must say that the country where I ran into the\nmost anti-Semitic and Fascist remarks, and... is Austria. And I was amazed that the... so many\nyears after the war, I don\u2019t see a lot of changes. That here is a country that, unlike Germany, was\nconsidered a victim of Fascism, which of course, it was not, and played this role very\nsuccessfully. And today, it is just terrible. It\u2019s, the right wing elements are all over it. And you\ncan go to any pub and just wait until they have a few drinks, and there will be some talk about\nthe good old days. So, no, I thought Germany dealt with the problem much, much better than\nAustria.",
        "A: Yes, yes, we came here straight from Frankfurt, Germany, we landed in Lexington. And by that\ntime, we had a little home, because my brother and sister-in-law, who own Briarbrook Farm, had\ncalled us two years before, and asked us if we would like to buy a home here for a very, very\nlittle money, and that sounded just like a good investment. My wife, of course, immediately\nknew it was going to be our home. I just considered maybe just an investment. We bought it, and\nthen slowly, she worked on me to retire here. Because I had no intention to come here. I wanted\nto be near a big city and I loved California. And she insisted that she did not want to go back to\nCalifornia, even though she lived all her American life there, and so she won. Well, she followed\nme to Europe for twenty years, and I thought it is proper to honor her wishes and whatever they\nwere, but basically, she wanted to be close to her sister and vice-versa, so we came here, and at\nleast we could be in driving distance, within a day, to our daughter in Virginia and to our son and\nher... and his family in Nashville. So, that was an... also another consideration.",
        "A: Well, we used to visit here, almost every summer when... while we were in Europe, every second\nsummer or so, we would come back and stop here, too, for a few days. And so I could... I was\nalways very defiant when it came to this place, I just... I never really opened my eyes as to what\nis here, rather would sulk so... not in a very obvious way, but call it an inside sulker. That\u2019s what\nI was, sitting on the couch during the day, and occasionally complaining that there is really not\nmuch to do here. And this was going on, I was... I never really came here with great enthusiasm.\nAs I put it to my wife, an area that doesn\u2019t even have sidewalks in town, to walk around, what\nam I going to do there? And also the fences bothered me, that you can\u2019t go anywhere, everything\nis fenced in. And how can you take your mountain bike and, and bike somewhere? You run into\na fence within minutes. And I was just not very much for settling here. And then, I knew that she\nwas very insistent, and the last time we were visiting here, I think it was in \u201991, that was shortly\nafter we bought that little house... people were still living 1n it, the partners of the farm, and I was\nwalking around, and all of a sudden, the... my past caught up with me, because I spent a great\ndeal, as a young kid, out in nature, and I loved the smells and the... I loved the sight of a tree, the\nsmell of the grass. And all of a sudden, I began to smell and look at the very things that were so\ndear to me when I was little and I was constantly hiking with my friends. And I realized that this\nis not a bad place, and besides, it was so peaceful. At night there was no noise. And so I came\nback and the whole family was around because they were... we were celebrating our wedding\nanniversary. And I said, \u201cI want to say something to you.\u201d I said, \u201cI just made up my mind, I can\nlive here very well.\u201d And that was the end. All my sulking went away, all my reservations went\naway. I knew I was not going to come to the middle of New York City. I knew that there is not\ngoing to be any half-timbered houses when I walk into Paris. But I thought that I can make the\nbest of it, and that I can live here.",
        "A: Yes, that was my main concern. I knew that this is a beautiful state and if I drive an hour from\nhere, I can start hiking and it is really an... an open range, but culturally, I had reservations and I\nstill have reservations. I feel a little... I would have really felt much worse, perhaps twenty, thirty\nyears ago, but at the time when television brings you, especially the educational channel and the\nhistory channel and Discovery and there are so many channels now that you can get, that\nbrings... they bring a lot of good knowledgeable stuff, and this is one thing. Second, of course,\nthe internet connects you with the world. So, one is not so isolated any more. Still, I am still\nyearning to go to a town where the streets are crowded. I don\u2019t want to live on a crowded street\nall the time, but sometimes, and I want to go to a sidewalk caf\u00e9, and I want to eat some different\nfood that doesn\u2019t taste the same, and just converse with people. I feel that there is, right now in\nthis country, there 1s great suspicion. You just can\u2019t walk up to people and start talking. And\nKentucky is even better off in this respect than any other state, probably, or most other states. It\njust... there is always that suspicion in a person\u2019s mind, based on all the stories that we hear day\nby day by day by day, of violence. Violence really kind of poisoned the atmosphere in this\ncountry a great deal, and I\u2019m very sensitive to that. So, I would love to just go to a park and sit\non a bench sometimes, and just talk to strangers, as I used to when I was younger. But that\u2019s\nimpossible. We don\u2019t go to the park to begin with, because there are no... not many parks, and\nthere aren\u2019t... not too many people, if you find a park. And when it gets dark, of course, you clear\nout, and you just don\u2019t have that kind of a life, that vibrant life that you find still in European\ncities.",
        "A: Well, with neighbors, I just don\u2019t have that much with... in common. One neighbor next to our\nfarm is a hog farmer, and I don\u2019t know anything about hogs and he doesn\u2019t seem to be interested\nin many other things. And the others are way down. I go to Paris to take care of some business\nthat is necessary, post office or shopping, and this and that. And my hobbies... one of my hobbies\nis antiques, so I know the people who are in the antique business in Paris, and I can go in and\nspend some time and talk to them. But I do not have a close friend. Now my... however, my\nassociation with the so-called master gardeners association in Lexington brought me together\nwith people. I do volunteer work for the arboretum 1n season, every week, and so... one day, and\nthese are the people, usually, that I am the closest to, because we have a common interest,\ngardening. We spend time together, we have meetings. And after the season is over, we continue\nseeing each other. So, yes, but since I came back... and that has also something to do, of course,\nwith my age, too... I have not found here, anyone that I can call a friend.",
        "A: Yeah, people are funny in this respect. They are interested my accent, and I cannot really say that\nthey are suspicious or they reject me. One man, a young man told me this last year. Said, \u201cYou\nknow, you are much better off than I.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou open your mouth, and everybody says,\n\u2018Oh, what a nice accent, where are you from?\u2019\u201d And he said, \u201cI open my mouth and they say,\n\u2018Hey, you are not from here, are you?\u2019 And you know what they mean,\u201d he says, \u201cthat I\u2019m a\ndamn Yankee.\u201d And I don\u2019t know about this, but all I can say is that nobody has ever reacted\nnegatively toward my accent. I see that sometimes people smile when I talk to them, and I know\nwhy they do it and I consider it a friendly gesture. And that\u2019s about it. The only people I\u2019m really\nmad at, the ones who listen to me for awhile and say, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u2019 Because I know that they\nare putting me on. That... if schoolchildren could understand me, they could, too. But... and\nanother thing that, of course irritates me, when... my hearing is not that good any more, and this\nhas nothing to do with accent and all this, it\u2019s just that some people are very intolerant, and if\nyou ask, you know, \u201cWill you please repeat it?\u201d They just say, \u201cForget it.\u201d And the word forget it\nreally irritates me. But that has nothing to do with accent and being foreign born. Otherwise, I\nfind that people are much friendlier, even with my reservations about being suspicious, much\nfriendlier than they were in some other states that I\u2019ve travelled.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t do it any more, and frankly, I can\u2019t even come up with a good reason why. Perhaps\nit\u2019s just that I get very busy at home, and the... somehow, the familiar faces that I knew, many of\nthem left and I... it\u2019s very difficult, I think, after a certain age, to make friends and to build kind\nof a circle around yourself. And also when I first joined, the Historical Society was a lot more\nvital than it is now. I think it just settled into a routine life, and it just... I was just not interested\nany more. The museum was established, it\u2019s running smoothly. I don\u2019t think they really need me\nthere any more. So I rather concentrate on the Master Gardener\u2019s Association, where I can do\nsomething, actually work. I am always much happier when I can do physical work, than when I\njust sit around and talk about what to do.",
        "A: I... well, not strictly speaking Kentucky history, but I did take my first class, last year, in the\nhistory of Cincinnati. Cincinnati fascinated me from the very beginning, because when I saw it, I\nsaid, this is the closest thing, around here, to a real city. The others seem like villages, all of\nthem. I can\u2019t think of any place in Kentucky, that to me, looks like an urban environment. And\nthe... most of the places are, you know, just built very quickly and the original downtown...\nunfortunately, Lexington is destroyed, as we know it, and what is left of it is just struggling.\nNow, yeah, Cincinnati, yes. I was so interested in Cincinnati, and Cincinnati\u2019s history, that I took\na class, a whole week Elder Hostel class. I like to take classes with Elder Hostel, and it\u2019s usually\na hands-on class, but this time I made an exception, \u2018cause I wanted to know the history,\nbackground, and more about the area. And it was not just Cincinnati, 1t was northern Kentucky,\ntoo. It was very good. So I\u2019m hoping to do some more. And of course, here and there I read a\nbook about Kentucky. I take some authors who are local and look into their works, and David\nDick lives in the area, and his books... so, Iam. But I am not really an expert on Kentucky\nhistory, I leave this to people who are natives. I just have a kind of a... really a surface interest in\njust the basics.",
        "A: Oh, I settled this already with myself. That\u2019s it. This is my last station. I am here for good, and\nnaturally, this is not a bad place to be, and even though I might... I could think of some other\nplaces where I would rather live, but I am here now, and I make the best of it. So...",
        "A: Yes. I wouldn\u2019t have chosen it, back thirty or forty years ago, no way. Because at that time I still\nwas more, somehow I felt that I... that there was still a great deal to discover. And I know that,\nnow that I reached the age, and considering the fact that I have heart problems, that I can\u2019t just\njump around any more. And even though I would love to visit some other corners of the world,\nand our country, I have to take it easy, and this 1s basically a very good point to be. I really like\nto explore more of the eastern part of the United States. That\u2019s a very good place to be, and the\nfact that we lead here, otherwise in kind of a Norman Rockwell type life, with my brother and\nsister-in-law, that here... we have been here for six years... almost six years now, and we never\nhad a conflict, not even a minor one. We eat our meals together quite a bit. We go, usually\ntogether to the theater or a party or something. We do a lot of things together. We are... they are\nour companions, and we are theirs. And so I... considering all this, I am very happy, and at peace.",
        "A: No, no. I have never heard anything like this. I think there are so many... so few Jews here. Of\ncourse, that doesn\u2019t mean anything, there are very few Jews left in Poland, and there\u2019s still anti-\nSemitism, but no.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh that, that is... I do this with great pleasure, because I know that... in this area, there are very\nfew people, probably, who experienced the Holocaust, and even know what it is. And so, one\nschoolteacher started this program in the local schools, and she always invites me, about two,\nthree times a year. And last time, it was a closed circuit television that they put me on, with some\nother classes around Kentucky. And... but most of the time, I just talk to her classes... her\ncombined classes or some other teachers bring in classes, and these are usually kids, thirteen,\nfourteen years old, and I like to talk to them, because that\u2019s how old I was when the real disaster\nhit me. And so I can kind of get down to their level of understanding and explain certain things\nto them. And I find that they are very receptive, very receptive. So, I consider it a mission.",
        "A: Yes, Bourbon county school system. I\u2019ve never been to the Paris school system, but it\u2019s Bourbon\ncounty, which is, just basically, geographically speaking, it\u2019s also in the city, they just split, I\ndon\u2019t know why. And so I talk to the Bourbon county schools. I spoke to the high school last\nyear, but mainly it\u2019s the middle school.",
        "A: The middle school students, because of the teacher\u2019s eagerness to clarify everything, are much\nbetter informed than the high school students. I was amazed. I went to the high school, I... once I\nwent to Berea and talked to the Berea class, and that was the worst. They were just uninterested,\nsleepy people with a professor who, himself, put me asleep. I just couldn\u2019t blame the students, by\nthat time, they were so turned off, that no matter what I did, I could have stripped nude, and it\nwouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference in that class. But the middle-school kids, the junior\nhigh, they are just great to talk to. One girl... just yesterday, I was speaking to a class, and one\nlittle girl stayed behind, and I usually spend about an hour and a half with them. I speak to them\nfor awhile and then let them ask questions. And one little girl was just stay... just stood behind\nand she was waiting for me, waiting for me, when after everybody left, she came up, and she\nhugged me, and she kissed me, and she said, \u201cThis is all... for all the missed loves and kisses that\nyou could not get from your parents during those years.\u201d I thought that was just charming. And\nshe just turned around and left. It was... there was no other, you know, second thought about it.\nAnd so, it was just very, very beautiful.",
        "A: Yeah, I... that comes around a little bit more often, when the people just cannot comprehend that,\nhow can anybody who doesn\u2019t steal, doesn\u2019t cheat, doesn\u2019t embezzle, has been married for\nthirty-three years, why am I not a church goer? And that is what I have to explain many times to\npeople. Not only that, when I say I\u2019m a non-believer, of course, I think I\u2019m out of their favors.\nAnd... but I try to make a point there, too, that one does not have to go to church and belong to a\nreligion, to lead a decent life. And I say that. I look around and see how many people who go to\nchurch are in the news, beating their wives and embezzling money from the school\u2019s treasury, or\nfrom the county treasury or using highway funds for their own purposes. You don\u2019t have to go.\nYou can set your own rules. So, I do more argument about that than anything else.",
        "A: Well, I tell them always. I\u2019m not making any . Iam... I always say, I\u2019m\nJewish, but I am not a Jew... Iam a Jew, but I\u2019m not Jewish. And of course, first, nobody\nunderstands what I\u2019m talking about. And I say, \u201cEthnically speaking, I am a Jew. I come from a\nethnic group called the Semites and one of the subgroups are Jews.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cNow these people\nhave been mixed... intermingling with other people for over a thousand years, and therefore there\nis no such thing as a pure Jew, but then there\u2019s no such thing as a pure anything any more, since\nhistory mixed us up quite successfully. But, when it comes to religion,\u201d I said, \u201ceven though I am\na Jew, my religion is not Jewish. I have no religion.\u201d I said, \u201cI am not... I do not belong to any\norganized religion.\u201d So eventually I think they understand what I mean.",
        "A: Well, of course there are always those who feel that they can perhaps sway me over. And I\nalways say, \u201cLook, I\u2019m seventy years old, and you have no idea how many people tried, and you\nare just wasting your time,\u201d I said. And so eventually, they see that they are. So they give up and\nmany of them still trust me and keeps talking to me, and there are those who kind of shy away,\nbecause I might, you know, be who knows, the devil, or... you never know what they think of\nyou if you say I\u2019m a non-believer.\nEnd of Tape 9, Side B\nTape 10, Side A",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t know anybody. And several times, my cardiologist, who is Jewish, and is very\nactive in one of the synagogues in Lexington, mentioned that the rabbi is going to get in touch\nwith me, because he wants me to come and talk to some group within the congregation, but they\nnever contacted me. I really don\u2019t have any connection to any other group.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t mind. I\u2019m completely neutral. I am not going out of my way to look for it, and...\nbecause I don\u2019t like to dwell that much upon past. And... but I wouldn\u2019t reject if they... if they\nwould want to establish any contact with me.",
        "A: I consider this very similar to what was going on in Germany while we lived there. Germany had\nan economic boom in the 1950\u2019s, just like we have now, which meant that the... all the menial\nand dirty jobs were unfilled. Most Germans just wouldn\u2019t want to work in that, and also that they\nneeded more workers than the country actually could produce. So they invited in other\nnationalities as guest workers, that\u2019s what they were called, and they were mainly from Turkey.\nAnd this was back in the 50\u2019s. The German economic miracle produced a migration from\nTurkey, which was legal, completely legal. They had to have documents, they entered, they went\nto work in the factories. Now, today, in 1993... 1999, the economy... the German economy has\nslowed down considerably. These Turkish workers, the original Turkish workers, today are\ngrandparents. They brought their children back then, it was allowed, which was, I think, a very\nnice, humanitarian gesture, because Switzerland, who had the same problem, did not allow\nfamily members to follow. They could go home on vacation, send the money back, but nobody\nwas allowed to... allowed to come. So, the family members came, and you know, one family\nmember then brings another family member, and pretty soon... I think today there are close to\nthree million Turks living in Germany, a country of sixty-five million people. That\u2019s quite a bit,\nand of course, was tremendous resentment by some people to begin with. But the real problem\ncame not while the economic boom was on, the real problem came when it was over, because\nnow you had a lot of people who were already adults, and born in Germany, to Turkish parents,\nand all the rest. So now, here came the problem of what to do with them. Are they citizens, are\nthey not citizens? And welfare, are they qualified for welfare? So, I am afraid of the same thing\nhere. Right now, especially around here, in the Bluegrass, everybody who can think, knows that\nthese illegal... or legal Mexican workers are fulfilling an important job. They are working here in\na job that most other people wouldn\u2019t take. So, nobody has great reservations. When they see... I\nheard that when they see something in the paper, that a thief was arrested, or a murder happened,\nand it is a Spanish name, they do mumble about it, which is natural, I don\u2019t consider this\nextraordinary. But my biggest fear is, what is going to happen when this economic boom ends,\nand here we will be with these people. Now, they are not going to work. If they don\u2019t work, what\nwill happen to them? To their mind? What will happen to those who watch around, and will take\nthe opportunity to do the same as they do in Germany. The skinheads in Germany were burning\ndown the buildings where they lived. People died in fire, they were beaten up on the street, or\nthey were killed. Several, several times this happened. So, I hope that we'd... it doesn\u2019t come to\nthis. I think that the... we need more education, especially in the schools, to make these people\nwelcome. They are here for a reason, they are human beings, and just like anyone else in\nAmerica, they came in by the same rights. If there is illegal immigration, that is not for Kentucky\nto try to stop it, because we can\u2019t, it has to be stopped down on the border, that\u2019s not our\nproblem. But those who are here, they are here. So what are you going to do? But the churches,\nthe schools, any institution, I think should work together to make sure that people know that\nthese are human beings, these are not some alien group that is here only temporarily. They are\nnot here temporarily.",
        "A: Yeah, yes...",
        "A: ... yeah, oh, in this... in this respect, there is a comparison. I... definitely, that... they would be\nmade scapegoats, the minute the chips begin to fall. But I don\u2019t think that in America we ever\nhave a danger of the death camps or concentration camps any more. I know that we had them, of\ncourse, on a much, much smaller and different scale, for the Japanese Americans in the West\ncoast, but I don\u2019t think that would ever come to this. I\u2019m more afraid of individual treatment of\nthese people.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, and I would like to see that we deal in school, we deal with them realistically,\nthat we let their children come to school without any reservation, because children in the world\neverywhere, makes no difference where they come from, where they go, they should be in\nschool. And number two 1s that we do not go overboard with bilingual education. These kids\nknow how to speak Spanish, they should know how to speak English, and even the families, I\nthink, would appreciate the fact, that we would just throw them into an English speaking class,\nand I can guarantee that in three months, they would speak English, without even an accent.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Not for my wedding.",
        "A: Mm-mm, no.",
        "A: They came in 1967 to visit. They were here, I think, six weeks or seven weeks. And my mother,\nof course, would have loved to stay here. My father, he was just used to his life in Budapest, and\nhe was very anxious, eventually, to get back. So there was no question that they would stay here.\nAnd my father, who has always been around little businesses in his life, he did the usual thing\nthat people at that time did, from Eastern Europe, traveling to the West, they were constantly\ncounting what... certain prices on merchandise, it would cost in Hungary, in Hungarian money. I\nmean, I was thinking about getting him a little calculator, but he was so fast in his head, he\nwould beat any calculator. So, his favorite place... and we lived in California when they were\nwith us, was Long\u2019s Drugstore, which is the equivalent of any big drugstore chain in our area.\nAnd he... he would just... if we did something, the rest of the family, with my mother, and he did\nnot want to be part of it, he just said, \u201cOh, just drop me at Long\u2019s Drugstore,\u201d and he would\nspend an entire day at Long\u2019s Drugstore, looking... going around, looking everything, figuring\nout prices and this. So, yeah.",
        "A: ... the Long Drug... the employees began to get a bit suspicious, what is this man doing here, and\nhe was smiling always, because he couldn\u2019t speak a word of English. So, finally, I had to... I\nexplained, I talked to the people, and said, \u201cThis is my father, he doesn\u2019t speak any English, and\nhe loves your store.\u201d And this is all he did. We drop him off here, he\u2019s totally harmless. He never\nkilled a fly in his life. He just likes to... and so they laughed, and they just... and eventually they\nall kind of tried to communicate with him and he with them. And another thing that... just blew\nhis mind, that all you can eat little places in San Francisco. And we used to go to one that had\nvery nice stuff, steam table, of course. And he just could not understand that here, we were five,\nseven people go, and of course, the kids kept going back and taking more and this and that, and\nso finally he said, \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said, \u201cin Hungary, a restaurant like this would go broke in one\nday.\u201d So, my wife went to get the manager, and it... she was a very nice lady, and explain to her\nwhere my father comes from and what these questions are, so she sat down with us, and she\nsaid... \u2018cause my father said, \u201cHow do you make money, all you can eat?\u201d So, she then pointed\nout to my father, that look, \u201cHere is your granddaughter. Look what she has. She really didn\u2019t\ntake much. Look at your wife, she didn\u2019t eat that much. Look at you, you didn\u2019t eat that much.\nThe two boys,\u201d she said, \u201cthe two boys, okay, so they might take up... up to the price that they\npaid, but look, all of you, you\u2019re eat...\u201d and so, she was very patiently explaining. She said, \u201cOur\nproblem is not what people eat, it\u2019s what people try to put into their jacket.\u201d She says, \u201cYou\u2019d be\nsurprised how many people come in here with a bag, and all this.\u201d My father could not\nunderstand this, that even in America people... because he had, certainly, a very idealistic view\nof America. But I forgot to tell you that every time we picked him up from Long\u2019s Drugstore, he\nlearned this sentence to say. First he learn it in... he said it in Hungarian, then I taught him how\nto say in English, so the children can understand. He says, \u201cThis country 1s invincible.\u201d After\nlooking at the drugstore, he made up his mind, that based on this wealth that is in this... yust in\nthis store, and the way people just come in and can afford and buy, all this... he said, \u201cThis\ncountry, my son, 1s invincible.\u201d He had unlimited faith in this country. And I don\u2019t know whether\nin a previous interview I told you, when people ask him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here?\u201d He told\nthem a joke. I think I...",
        "A: ... [say it, so I\u2019m not going to repeat that, but he... he truly, he... with all the wealth, and\neverything else that just enchanted him, he... and the nice aesthetics of the stores, he was ready to\ngo home.",

        "A: Yes, we are enthusiastic members of the Elder Hostel program. We have... my wife, I think,\nparticipated in just about fifteen or so, and I am just about five behind. And what we usually do,\nwe are taking hands-on type classes. My idea is that I want to know everything before I go,\nabout... a little about a lot of things, such as I have always wondered about blacksmithing. What\ndoes a blacksmith do? How does he do it? So I took a class in blacksmithing. I took a class in\nkaleidoscope making, because that interested me... me, too. How does a kaleidoscope work?\nHow do you make one? And I took several classes in wood turning, which I enjoy very much as\na hobby. We also took a beautiful class, which was not hands-on, but still something similar, to...\nin Hawaii, an Elder Hostel class for two weeks. We were studying the volcanoes, the rainforest\nand then Polynesian culture. My wife is very active in basket weaving. She\u2019s a member of the\nbasket weavers... Kentucky Basket Weavers Association, or whatever... I don\u2019t know if this is\nthe official name, but she participates, she exhibits sometimes. Also, she\u2019s a quilter, so as a\nquilter, she comes in contact with a lot of truly Kentuckians. And she doesn\u2019t ever come home\ncomplaining that maybe they considered her an outsider. She feels very much at home with all\nthese people. We also go to West Virginia, to Cedar Lake, which is also a - an Appalachian\ncenter for crafts, and take a hands-on class. Our next class, hopefully, we are on the waiting list,\nwe have taken a class in Charleston and we want to go back, this is our next class. We studied\noutdoor cooking and we are going back now to study Charleston\u2019s gardens. We take trips.",
        "A: No, South Carolina, South Carolina, Charles... Charleston, South Carolina. And while there, we\nvisited Virginia, Savannah, and we were fascinated by Savannah, it was just walking around in a\nEuropean city. And in Kentucky, too, occasionally we take trips. We love to go, as I mentioned,\nto Cincinnati. We go up to Louisville. My wife, as a quilter, goes sometimes to western\nKentucky, which is the quilter\u2019s place, you know, Paducah is the quilter\u2019s museum. In other\nwords, we are active here, and I took the class in History of Cincinnati, in northern Kentucky.\nAnd I plan to... oh, I belong to the Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, a lot of conservationist\norganizations. I volunteered to participate in the Kentucky water watch program, which I\nenjoyed very much. It just ended with the Licking River, and the branch here in Paris, Stoner\nCreek, was our responsibility. Four times a year we had to go down and take samples, and... so\nthat was, I felt I was part of Kentucky, doing this. We are... we try to stay active and my wife 1s\nmainly involved with these quieter things, and I am... I like to get involved with something that\ntakes me out in nature and puts me in a kayak, or out there, really fighting the elements. I still\nhave a little bit of that spark. So, if I can manage, and if my heart gets better after the operation\nthis fall, I\u2019d like to buy a canoe or a kayak, one of the two, and just go on these little rivers here.\nSo...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. That\u2019s about it. I mean, I can\u2019t... can\u2019t really...\nConclusion of Interview\n"
