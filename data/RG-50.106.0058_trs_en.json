        "Question: Joan Schwab interview tape number 1, November 5, 1996, Billian Cline,\ninterviewer. Tell me about you home life before Hitler came to power.",
        "Answer: We lived in an apartment in the tea garden area, and I remember some of the\nlovely art pieces we had, which I loved very much and we went to a private schoolmy\ntwin brother and I with another girlso there was only three of us going to a private teacher\nfrom age six to ten. And then we went to another private school which was mixed\nChristians and Jewish. I think we were only there for about a year, and then we moved to\na Jewish school in (?Altmorebeat?) I believe it's now called the Anne Frank School in\nthat area because we visited it a few years ago.",
        "Q: Tell me about your experiences at home and with respect to your Jewish community\nor Judaism?",
        "A: We belonged to a congregation called Adas Israel, and we went to synagogue every\nSaturday morning, and of course we kept the high holidays. I knew that my mother came\nfrom Budingen, and from parents who were not in the least religious, and in fact my\ngrandfather, who moved in with us in 1936 when things started getting difficult for Jews\nin small areas in Germany, he always said I fought for the Kaiser and I'm German and I'm\ngoing tol've been born in Germany, I'm going to die in Germany, of course, he didn't he\ndied in the concentration camp in Theresienstadt, but he moved in with us in '36 and so\ndid my uncle.",
        "Q: Did your grandfather object to the degree observance in your house as compared to his\nhome?",
        "A: No, he didn't object, and I think he and my uncle, his son, who moved in with us at the\nsame time would go out and eat ham and pork, which we didn't have in the home. We\nhad a kosher household. It was a little difficult having them come and live with us in a\nsmall apartment, but they had nowhere else to go because they're shop was taken away.\nAnd then they started helping my father in his four leather shops, and that was a great\nhelp having family to run these different shops. It was not a leather shop in the way you\nthink of it in the United States. It was a (?shumahe bedafsaticel?) And that is to say things\nthat a shoe maker would buy to repair his shoes. And it was a growing concern and it was\ncalled Rishad Brant, and in very, very small letters under Rishad Brant would be written\nIsrael Nusboum, owner, so that people would notice it was a Jewish name.",
        "Q: You observed the holidays at home?",
        "A: Yes, we observed the holidays, and I remember one of my favorite ones was Sukkot,\nand we walked through the synagogue, and there was one man who was a butcher who\nalways gave us sausages for our collection, and that was a particularly grand day, and we\nreally enjoyed that. But he fasted on Yom Kippur, and that was very important, and my\nbrother was Bar Mitzvah in 1938, but by that time we had all thought of emigrating\nalready because things were getting worse and worse. And we children were told never to\nhit back anybody who would call us Jew on the street or who would attack us. And this\nwas sort of intimidating for a youngster. We were not allowed to go to the movies, but we\nhad a cleaning woman, a Christian cleaning woman who, very sweetly, would take us\nwith her daughter to see some Shirley Temple films; so that was very exciting.\nOtherwise my parents played cards, and my mother helped also in the shop, and I\nremember a very happy childhood with cousins visiting, and I think Berlin was better to\nlive in as a Jew than than small places in Germany. I do remember one experience where\nwe went towe went to a big fest, Unter Den Linden, and Hitler and his cohorts came by\non the street, and they were policemen on horses. We thought, well, we ought see this\nman who's making such a difference in our lives, and low and behold, one of the horses\nkicked my mother, and the police were very solicitous and wanted to know our names so\nthat they could, I guess, give us some sort of help, and we were very anxious not to tell\nthem that our name was Nusboum, and my mother looked just like a Christian woman.\nShe had blue eyes and blond hair so I guess they didn't realize they we were Jewish, but I\nremember we didn't tell our name or anything we said, \"No. It's perfectly all right. Don't\nworry about it.\" I do remember that it was sort of scary.",
        "Q: That's very interesting. Tell me, what was your first experience of Nazi rise to power?\nI know you were a child, but what can you recollect?",
        "A: I remember our family talking about it and that we were scared, but we always\nthought it would pass, that the Germans would realize that Hitler really was no good, and\nthat things would be well again. Somehow one never anticipated the degree to which this\n(?youden fufulgen?) would go. So that we did think of going other seas and made\npreparations for it to go illegally because we didn't have anyone to sponsor us. But\nsomehow we always relented at the last minute and decided to stay. It was really only\nKristallnacht that repelled us to think serously of leaving Germany.",
        "Q: What was your experience of Kristallnacht or what did you hear?",
        "A: Well, it was interesting. We had a sudden telephone call from my l6yearold cousin\nwho was working in Berlin, and she told us that \"Uncle Iz\" as she called himmy father\nwhose name was Israel. Should go for a walk, and of course we immediately realized that\nsomehow he shouldn't be home so he went over and stayed with his sister because we\nknew the Gestapo didn't look in women's houses. They only looked in families. They\ndidn't look at women's houses. My uncle went to his girlfriend's house. My grandfather\nstayed home because he was 72 already. And my brother of course was only 12; so we\ndidn't think that that was dangerous. We had a visit from our janitor's wife who asked us\nwhether father was in, and we said no he wasn't, and I don't really know why she visited\nwhether she visited with a view to telling him to go out or whether the Gestapo had sent\nher on an advance to make sure that he was there, but in any event we were lucky. He\nwas gone, and about ten minutes later two black leather coated men came up and asked\nfor my father. We said he had gone out, and they very politely asked to look through the\napartment to make sure; and we said, \"Sure go right ahead.\" And of course he was gone,\nand they saw my grandfather sleeping there and asked how old he was, and we told him\n72, and after they left, I remember my mother saying she was shaking all over, poor\nthing. And of course us children we didn't realize the import of it all. But 1t was from that\nday onward that we did think of getting out of the country.",
        "Q: What steps did you take to leave the country then?",
        "A: It's so happened that at our Jewish school, there were some forms being passed around\nwhere a secondary school in London had gotten together with a parentteacher association,\nand they had decided to bring to England three children: One from Austria, one from\nCzechoslovakia, and one from Germany, in fact three girls because it was a girl's school,\nand since my parents said, well really should try to get out, I completed the form, and it\nwas sent back to England. And I was very lucky to be chosen the German girl to go to\nEngland to school. So in May 21--I shan't never forget it of course--we went to the\nrailroad station, and off I went with the children's transport. It was a dreadful experience\nbecause there was a Polish woman on the platform who was being dragged away by\nGestapo men by her hair, and she was screaming, and we didn't really know whether we'd\nall by arrested before we left. So it was very awful in leaving my parents really not with a\nview that I wouldn't see them again because I never thought that would happen. But it's a\nnew experience to go a country with another language, and I remember I had a little gold\nring and in the compartment, the train compartment, somebody mentioned that, \"oh, we\nshouldn't have any jewelry with us.\" And I remember going to the toilet and hiding this\nlittle gold ring, and after we got to Holland, I picked it up again. I think it was in the\ngarbage can, something like that. But 1t was--we were very happy when we left Germany.\nIt was like we could suddenly breathe freely, and there was some people in the railroad\nstation that brought us cookies and crackers and welcomed us with juices. And it was like\nbeing in another world, and it's very odd, but after I left Germany, I started growing and\ngetting bigger. I used to be a really thin little thing, and I guess being in a free country\nmakes you think and eat differently, and I became a normal |3yearold.",
        "Q: Tell me, you say your parents were planing to emigrate. Had they made any attempts\nto emigrate as a family?",
        "A: Only illegal attempts. My father was very scared that at the last minute at the border\nwe would be caught, and of course that would be worse than not going out at all. So when\nI left, one of the things my parents had tried to get us out, which I did tried to do and I did\nmanage to get my twin brother out, but unfortunately the war broke out, and I could not\nget my parents out, and they perished in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: On Kristallnacht, when your father was fortunate enough to leave the house, do you\nknow of any other men who were not so well prepared, and what happened to those?",
        "A: Yes, I remember about six weeks after Kristallnacht, my father's brother who was a\nteacher in Dortmund came back from concentration camp, and he had frostbitten fingers\nand toes, and he looked absolutely dreadful. He had been in a concentration camp. And\nthen my English teacher came back from concentration camp and his teeth, his front\nteeth, had been smashed in. And it was a very dreadful experience for us because as\nchildren you grow up trusting, trusting your parents, trusting the system, and all of a\nsudden you realize that you're on the outside looking in, and things won't get better.",
        "Q: These men came back from concentration camp?",
        "A: Well, as far as I can remember, I guess the Germans were not ready yet to keep men\non a permanent basis; so that they let them go after about six weeks, and then they fined\nall Jews for the murder of Vom Rath, and we all had to give up part of our silver and pay\nmoney to compensate the Germans for having lost Vom Rath which was the excuse, of\ncourse. And eventually, of course, they did get concentration camps ready, but at that\ntime they didn't have sufficient facilities to keep people. And I think they would have\nbeen very happy to let all the Jews go out of the country, because but of course they\nweren't allowed to take their money with them anyway, so they would have kept the\nmoney and got rid of the Jews.",
        "Q: They would have been happy to get the Jews go, but the Jews weren't ready to go\nthen?",
        "A: No. I think the Jews were ready to go, but they didn't want to go without any money,\nwhich is what they would have had to do. My father lost his four stores. They were all\nbroken into, and things were stolen, and after that he didn't have any work anymore. So it\nwas living on your income, whatever you had, but not making any more money. So it was\na matter of really thinking we have to get out of here. But it was easier said than done.",
        "Q: What was your experience as a Jew in the non Jewish community before Hitler and\nthen after Hitler came aboutcame to power. Was there any change in the attitude of your\nfriends and neighbors?",
        "A: We really didn't have Christian friends because of the school we went to with the\nother little girl was Jewish also, and just like in any big society in an apartment life, you\ndon't really have neighbors with whom you associate. So I can really say because we\nwere all in Jewish circles.",
        "Q: Was there any change among the people that you weren't necessarily friendly with, but\nneighbors? Did you discern increased hostility?",
        "A: No. We lived our lives completely apart, but we were very careful not to give any\nneighbors cause to criticize us. I remember very clearly listening to the BBC and foreign\nbroadcasts, and our parents always while they were listening, had us gomy brother went\nto one door, and I went to the other to make sure the noise wasn't penetrating the\napartment so thatbecause you could get arrested for listening to foreign news services.",
        "Q: On your train ride out of Germany and toward England, tell me how were you\nprovided for? Did you take food along with you?",
        "A: I don't really remember whether we took food along, but we did get fed when we\ncrossed the Dutch border, and we were also fed on the ship before we arrived in England.\nAnd I shall never forget that because we had white bread, which I had never seen before\nand cornflakes, which was another thing that was new in my life, not having eaten cereals\nin Germany. And then by train we were taken to London to a hallI guess it must have\nbeen in the railroad station, and names were called of children, and various people picked\nthem up and when my name came, there was a young blonde girl by name of Yolanda\nwho came and picked me up, and she explained to me that she was the ward of the head\nmistress of the school who had really been very much ahead of her timesingle woman\nwho had adopted a German, a Czech, and an Austrian child. And the German teacher had\npaid for my school education, which I didn't find out until the very end. Anyway, I'm\nproceeding myself. We went to the home of a Norman and Elsie Denim where I was to\nlive. They had a daughter about my age who went to the same school and a son four years\nolder, and Yolanda spoke a little bit of German to me, and this was when she got to the\nhouse, she said, \"Well, that's the last time I'll be speaking German with you.\" And I was\nsort of scared because I didn't speak very much English. But everybody was very\nwelcoming. And I do remember that we had tea, and everybody sat around the table, all\nthese new people chattering in English, and there was something that looked like\nchocolate paste, and I asked the young boy by name of Hue what it was, and he spoke a\nlittle German so he explained to me that it was chocolate the (?retch?) It turned out to be\nMarmite and very spicy, and I learned very soon to take very little of it. And then I went\nupstairs and cried. I went into the bathroom and cried, and after that I guess I decided this\nwas my new life, and I was going to have to accommodate to it. And people were very,\nvery kind. I'm still in touch with Marry, my foster sister, and Hue, my foster brother. We\nvisit each other's homes, and we've been very close friends.",
        "Q: Were you able to contact your parents during this period?",
        "A: I wrote to my parents on a regular basis, and they answered, and Auntie Elsie took me\nto a Jewish language school every Sunday, which was a big sacrifice for her because they\nwere very devout Plymouth Brethren Christians, and so she missed the Sunday morning\nservice taking me to Hebrew class.",
        "Q: What were you permitted to bring on your trip to London when you left home?",
        "A: Well, I remember I was allowed to carry one suitcase, which of course we each had to\ncarry ourselves, and I remember my mother buying me some nice clothing to take along,\nall of which turned out to be completely unsuitable because we wore uniforms to school.\nAnd as soon as I got to London, friends of Marry's would contribute school uniforms for\nme to wear, and as I said, I grew too quickly after that that in no time flat I had out gown\nall my beautiful clothes. I remember that when I was evacuated to Chichester after the\nwar had started, Auntie Elsie sold my clothes, and all I got from these beautiful\ngarmentswhich actually I think I never wore againwere three pairs of black woollen\nstockings which I detested but which were part of our school uniform and I had to wear.\nAnd I guess I've always remembered it because I was so unhappy about losing all these\nbeautiful things. But makes sense; they didn't fit me anymore.",
        "Q: How did you feel? You were from obviously from a welltodo family, and suddenly\nyou're taking handmedowns from other families. You were an impoverished child. How\ndid that affect you?",
        "A: Well, it didn't bother me too much. Everybody was so kind, and it bothered me a little\nbit about the clothes as I said, but generally speaking, I was feeling so liberated and\nwonderful to be out of this scary atmosphere where you couldn't say what you thought,\nand all of a sudden I could say whatever I felt like, and when I saw a policeman and I\ncringed, Auntie Elsie would say, \"You don't have to be afraid of \u2018our Bobbies',\" which\nthey were called in England. \"They will always be there to help you.\" And it was such a\nwonderful feeling to be free, really free.",
        "Q: How did you feel about being Jewish in an essentially Christian community?",
        "A: I didn't worry about it at all because everybody was so very kind to me that I just felt I\nwas one of the people, and nobody ever asked me was I Jewish. Nobody treated me\ndifferently because I was Jewish. And as children will, they take for granted that\nwhatever happens to them is the right thing, so I had no worry about that.",
        "Q: Tell me more please about your experience in the Jewish Sunday school.",
        "A: Well, we walked across the common every Sunday morning, and I went to Hebrew\nclass, and having been told by my parents that I really should try and get our family out\nof Germany, I approached the head rabbi who was teaching us one Sunday morning and\nasked him if they could not find a home for my brother. And he looked at me and he said,\n\"Oh. You're the little girl who lives with nonJewish people.\" And I said, \"Yes, I am.\"\nAnd he said, \"Well, until you move to a Jewish family, there's nothing we can do.\" So I\nsaid to him, \"But if I move to a Jewish family, I'm already taking away the place that my\nbrother could take.\" And he said, \"No, no there's nothing we can do until you move to a\nJewish family.\" So I left Sunday school very depressed and very unhappy and started\ncrying on the way home, and Auntie Elsie said to me, \"What's the matter? Why are you\ncrying?\" And I told her about the incident, and it was Auntie Elsie and Uncle Norman\nwho decided to adopt my brother who then came to England at the beginning of\nAugust 1939 and started to process papers for my parents to come over, but unfortunately\ndue to the war breaking out in September, they never made tt.",
        "Q: How did you feel telling Auntie Elsie what the rabbi had said to you?",
        "A: I was very ashamed that a Jewish person would do a thing like that. I'm still ashamed.",
        "Q: How did that effect your feelings towards Judaism?",
        "A: Well, that's an interesting question because inat the outbreak of war, we werethe\nchildren that is to sayall of the school were all evacuated to Chichester, a small, very old\ntown in the south of England. And there was no Jews in Chichester. My Uncle Norman\nwrote to my father through the Red Cross asking whether it would be all right for Hans,\nmy brother, and myself to go to church, and my father wrote back and said that his\nchildren were old enough to know what was right, and that if he felt that since there was\nno Jewish house of worship, we should go to Sunday schoolthat he should feel very free\nto send us.",
        "Q: Did Uncle Norman want to convert you?",
        "A: No. Not at all. Which is why theyUncle Norman was a customs official in the British\nCivil Service, but he was interested in religion and had studied religion theology, and in\nfact he was a doctor of theology which he never, never talked about. But that was why he\nwas interested in Jews and Judaism because, of course, he understood the connection\nbetween the Old and the New Testament.",
        "Q: What was Auntie Elsie's attitude toward you as a Jew?",
        "A: Auntie Elsie treated me not as a Jew, but as another child in the home. She endeared\nherself to me because I had brought a doll to England, and during the transport its eyes\nhad fallen out, and she took me to a doll hospital and had the eyes put back in. And the\ndoll meant very much to me. It was the only cuddly thing, and the family was not a\ncuddly family so that all of a sudden physical contact was gone. I guess as Jews or\nGermans, perhaps we were more physically effusive certainly my family was with\nhugging each other which the Denim family never did.",
        "Q: Did your brother fit into the family there?",
        "A: Well, he fitted in very well because he had Hue as a companion, and of course, he was\nonly there for about three weeks because at the beginning of September, we were\nevacuated to Chichester.",
        "Q: How did you adapt to the new school especially in a language you didn't understand?",
        "A: It was difficult the first two or three days, but being thrown into an Englishspeaking\nhousehold and going to an Englishspeaking school, I ended up just like Yolanda. In no\ntime flat I wasn't speaking German anymore, only English, and I'm a little bit ashamed of\nmyself because when I picked up my brother at the railroad station, I imitated Yolanda\nwhen we got home and I said, \"That's the last time I've spoken any German to you,\nHans.\"",
        "Q: As I remember you were very angry when Yolanda did that to you.",
        "A: Yes. I'm afraid so.",
        "Q: Was how long was it between the time you arrived London or in England and Hans?",
        "A: It was about two months, and I remember that it was difficult at school, but I was\nplaced into a lower class so that I had less difficulty catching up, and the children were\nvery kind. Occasionally they would tease me, and I remember one of them calling me\nfish face. And I went home, and I asked Uncle Norman, \"What's fish face?\" And he said,\n\"Well, it's nothing very bad, but next time you see the girl who said this to you, you just\ncall her dog's body.\"",
        "Q: What subjects were your favorite in school?",
        "A: I would say English was my favorite, and geography I loved, and art. I loved drawing.",
        "Q: And the sciences?",
        "A: Well, I was never too good at the sciences I'm afraid.",
        "Q: How about your brother?",
        "A: My brother's strength was mathematics, but of course, since he came in August, he\nnever went to school in London. He started going to school in Chichester after we were\nevacuated.",
        "Q: How did you find the level of education in England compared to what you had\nexperienced in Germany\u2019?",
        "A: I would say it was about on the same level.",
        "Q: Same amount of homework and number of hours in school?",
        "A: Yes. I would say it was very _+ yes. I would say it was very comparable.",
        "Q: Tell me about your experience in Chichesteryour home life and schooling.",
        "A: It's a long story really because it was my main life in England. I was in Chichester\nfrom just before the war started until 1944. I went to high school there, and I graduated\nfrom high school, and at that point the school went back to London. By brother and I\nwere locatedbilitted was the word--in a small home where a very old lady and her\nmiddleaged daughter lived. Her middleaged daughter was working, but it was really no\nenvironment for a teenage boy and girl so that within a very short period of time, we were\nreassigned separately, my brother to one household and I to another. And he stayed in the\nhousehold he was in and was very happy, went to public school, and went back to\nLondon in 1944 also. I on the other hand was with a family where the woman actually\nhad a nervous breakdown after I got there. I kept hoping it wasn't me, and I don't think it\nwas, but one of her neighbors who was a dear lady took me into her house. She had three\nother evacuees, and we all slept in one double bed, and there was a dog who scared me to\ndeath. I had never had experience of a dog, and the first thing this dog did was to upset a\nhot cup of chocolate over my lap, but we got to like each other very much eventually.",
        "Q: Your were three, four girls in one double bed?",
        "A: Yes. We were four girls in one double bed, and we had a shower every two weeks,\nand it was a matter of putting money in the (?g1za?) to get hot water in the bathroom\nwhere was really the only place you could get hot water. And we would take turns in\nbeing first, second, third, fourth in the bathtub. And it was so cold that first winter. I was\nnot used to just having a fireplace in the living room and no other place in the house not\nheated because in Berlin, we had had central heating, and we had hot water in the\nbathroom. Here we had no hot water and worst of all, the toilet was outside the house.",
        "Q: Was this a poor family?",
        "A: I would say it was a lower middle class family. But they were lovely people. The lady\nwhom I called Auntie Nell, she had been educated age until 14; so she didn't have too\nmuch education, she could barely write. Her husband was a fishmonger and eventually\nwas called up into the police. Thethe other children went back to London after this falsel\nforget what it was called, but in the first winter, there was no air raids so the children\nsome of them did drift back to London. I stayed with Auntie Nell, and when her husband\nwas called up, she and I grew very close. She had no children, and I had no mother; so\nshe was very protective of me. They had very little money, but I remember one birthday\nshe gave me a bicycle which enabled me to ride to schoolwhich I had to do twice a day\nbecause we came home for lunchinstead of walking the two miles which was a long way\nto walk. She was a lovely person. I'm still in touch with her. She's just entered an old age\nhome in Chichester.",
        "Q: You say that the other children went back to London; so did you have a bed to\nyourself?",
        "A: Well, actually what we did was she and I slept in this double bed, and the other room\nwas rented out to another person to make a little more money because they really didn't\nhave very much money. There was one man whoMr. Watts, who came every summer and\nstayed with her while he was selling his ice cream, and I remember Mr. Watts coming to\nthe house and saying, \"I want to stay with you this summer,\" and Auntie Nell said,\n\"You're welcome.\" And he said, \"What's this little girl doing here? Is she German?\"\nAnd Auntie Nell said, \"Yes, she's German.\" And he said, \"Then I don't want to stay with\nyou.\" And she said, \"That's perfectly all right. The little girl is going to stay with me\nwhether you stay or not.\" He finally relented and decided to stay there; so between being\nGerman and Jewish, it was hard road to plow.",
        "Q: Was Auntie Nell a devout Christian, and did shewhat was her feelings about you're\nbeing Jewish?",
        "A: No. She wasn't a devout Christian, but like most uneducated people, they felt Jews\nwere different. Now of course, since I lived with her for so long, she realized that I wasn't\ndifferent, but in the beginning I had a diary which I locked. It had a lock on it, and I\nwould write in there when I was unhappy, and one day I came home and she had broken\nthe lock on the diary and read my diary which then made me never write in the diary\nagain. But I didn't hold it against her because she really was very kind. It made me\nunhappy for a little while.",
        "Q: What was it that she read in the diary? Was it anything that effected your relationship\ntoward her?",
        "A: No, it wasn't because it was still in German.",
        "Q: I see. Are there any experiences while you lived in Chichester that are particularly\nmemorable to you?",
        "A: Well, there are several. One was that due to the fact that we had only cold water to\nwash with and no bathroom, I took a catlick in the kitchen in the morning, and one day\nmy schoolteacher said to me, \"Inga, you've got a dirty neck,\" which was very\nembarrassing and humiliating, and after that I even managed to wash my neck with cold\nwater. That was one experience. Another one was went I was bicycling home from school\nthere was a German airplane very, very low in the sky, and I felt sure 1t was going toto\nmachine gun me, and so I dashed off the bicycle and into a doorway and of course that\nthis (?hagencoits?) the swastika still frightened me so much.",
        "Q: What happened to the plane?",
        "A: I don't really know. It might have crashed. We did have an air force base not too far\nfrom us called Tangmere, and it could be that the German plane was looking for this air\nforce base to bomb.",
        "Q: Back to Sunday school. Any incidents or stories you want to tell me about going to\nSunday school and going to church?",
        "A: I sort of resented going to Sunday school at church, and there was a dear old man who\nwas in charge of Sunday school, and whenever he called on me with a question, he would\nsay, \"My child of Aberham.\" He always called me his child of Aberham. And I would\nargue with him fiercely because I was very well acquainted with the Old Testament, of\ncourse not with the New, but it was something which came to mean a lot to me, and I got\nto the point where one night I dreamt about Jesus Christ, and I felt that, yes, I was\nconverted, and it made me very happy. Jesus Christ to me was someone I could talk to\nanywhere, not just in church. I would be in the bathroom, and I could talk to him or in the\nkitchen or in my bed, and somehow I remember Yahova as being a very strict god, a god\nwho was jealous of his prerogatives and to me, I guess Jesus was more of a friend and\nfather which I did not have.",
        "Q: Any other experiences at Chichester?",
        "A: Yes. Chichester was a wonderful place to grow up in. It was a small city and our\nstratum secondary school was housed in the Chichester High School building, and we had\nsome rooms that we worked in, and Chichester High School had some rooms that they\nworked in. The teachers lived near the school and looked after us in many ways other\nthan at school, and when we were 16 years old, we were called before a counsel in\nTunbridge Wells and asked whether we would give away any secrets to Germans who\nwould promise us that our parents would be saved.",
        "Q: Who is this \"we\"?",
        "A: We is my brother and myself, and so we said of course we wouldn't. Of course I never\nreally knew what secrets we could possibly have known at age 16 to give away to\nanybody.",
        "Q: Do you feel that the English were still very skeptical of you as Germans?",
        "A: I think that they were not too skeptical of us because we didn't speak German\nanymore. Our English was perfect, and we were still children; so I don't think that we had\nany difficultly in that respect.",
        "Q: Do you know what the motivation was behind this inquiry?",
        "A: Oh yes. Themany Germans at the beginning of the war had been interned and sent to\nthe Isle of Man and were not allowed to stay in areas which they considered to be\nimportant such as London and Birmingham and Manchester and so on, but wellyust like\nduring the first world war, lots of people didn't play Wagner because he was a German\ncomposer. So we were considered German refugees rather than Jewish refugees. It was\njust the fact that my brother and I were so young that saved us from being interned in the\nfirst place.",
        "Q: You were considered German rather than Jewish?",
        "A: Yes, absolutely. Yes, absolutely.",
        "Q: After Chichester you returned to London. Whom did you stay with?",
        "A: I went back and stayed with the Denims. By that time, my foster brother had left and\nwas in Sri Lanka and Marry was at university in Cambridge, and my brother had found\nhimself a job with--with a lawyer somewhere in London. So I was the only one that\nremained, and I stayed with the Denims. I had one scholarship in Chichester and decided\nthat I wanted to go to secretarial school because I was very much aware of the fact that I\nwas being supported by people who were not my parents, and I also felt that if my parents\nwere saved after the war, I would want to have a profession to look after them. So I\nstudied for a year to be a secretary shorthand in typing and bookkeeping and got a job in\na London law office.",
        "Q: In this London law office while you were working there, you remained with the\nDenims?",
        "A: Yes, I remained with the Denims, and I don't remember paying them any money for\nstaying there. I must have offered it, but I guess they just didn't accept it, but I was very\nhappy with them. We went to to church together because by that time I was converted. I\nbecame a Sunday school teacher and mymymy remembrance is that Auntie Elsie took me\nto the Jewish community to let them know that I had been converted, and they were not\nvery happy about this, and I had some rabbi in Oxford who would write me letters and\nask me to answer them to make sure that I knew what I was doing which I did for a\nwhile.",
        "Q: Your brother, what happened to his affiliation with Judaism?",
        "A: He had no affiliation to Judaism, but he also was not religious in any other way. He\nended up marrying an English Christian girl and still lives in England now.",
        "Q: Did he raise his children with any affiliation?",
        "A: None whatsoever.",
        "Q: And when you married, did you raise your children with any affiliation?",
        "A: No, I did not. My husband is Jewish also refugee from Germany, but he was not\nreligious, and by that time I was no longer religious either so that we have brought up our\nchildren, he was in the foreign service. We brought them up all over the world, and we\nwanted them to know about religions, but we were never religious.",
        "Q: Do your children identify themselves as Jewish?",
        "A: One daughter does because she is married to a Jew, and although they are not\nreligious, they don't go to synagogue at any time, but their son was Bar Mitzvah, so that's\na sign of Judaism anyway.",
        "Q: And the other daughter?",
        "A: The other daughter was never religious. She's a professional, and she's about to marry\na Catholic gentleman who is not religions.",
        "Q: Did you have anymore experiences after you returned to London?",
        "A: Well, yes, we did. We had something called the doodlebugs. And the V2 rockets\nwhich the Germans sent over; and for six weeks, were slept in an air raid shelter with 300\nother people, and we survived it. I got to work one morning, and the office had been\nbombed, and we had to clear out glass. And I was with a friend one weekend, and I had\nbeen making a hat in the garden and after a doodlebug crashed nearby. It happened to end\nup in a tree. We could never get to it again. But we spent a lot of time cleaning up after\nthese doodlebugs. I didn't know anybody who had been hurt by them, because by that\ntime people were sleeping in shelters.",
        "Q: What exactly are doodlebugs?",
        "A: They are pilotless planes, really, rocketsthe first rockets. And they were programmed\nto go down over cities such as London, and they would make a noise. You could hear the\nmotor, and all of a sudden the motor would stop, and within a few minutes it would crash\nso that whenever you heard the motor stop, you dove under the table because you were\nscared that it might crash right over you.",
        "Q: Did you continue to hear from your parents during the war?",
        "A: We had a letter from our parents in 1941 just before they left for Theresienstadt and\nasking us if we could raise a certain amount of money so they could go to Shanghai.\nUnfortunately, we couldn't raise the money, and so they did go to Theresienstadt. I\nremember receiving one letter after they were in Theresienstadt, but after that we never\ndid, and I think that we felt it was not possible to write to them. We may have been\nwrong. Perhaps this could have been done, but we were so far away from anybody who\ncould have given us any advice on this that we never did write and felt that 1f we wrote, it\nwould be construed as writing to the enemy.",
        "Q: What did happen to your parents, and how did you learn about it?",
        "A: My parents at one point in 1944 were sent from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz, and I\nbelieve almost immediately killed there. The way I found this out was after the war, I\nwent to Germany as a translator for the US War Department, and when I was in\nGermany, I used to go to the Joint Distribution Committee in Munich every week to see\nif I could find their names. And I would put in the names of all my entire family, of\nwhom there were 18 members, to see if anybody got out alive, but we heard from some\nlady who had met them in Auschwitz, and she said that they had been killed. And of\ncourse, their names never turned up. Of all the people whom I put in traces for, only one\naunt and one cousin were saved.",
        "Q: All the rest perished?",
        "A: Everyone else perished. Everyone else perished.",
        "Q: Tell me more about your experience as a translator in Munich. When did you go\nthere? What were the conditions?",
        "A: We were trained in Paris and given American uniforms. Then we went to a little place\ncalled Pullach, which is outside Munich, and I was a translator of letters which had been\nconfiscated for censorship. Letters, that might have let us know where some Nazis were\nhiding so these could be prosecuted. I was only 18 at the time; so I was one of the\nyoungest people there. All the camp consisted of elderly refugees who had been in\nEngland during the war. Also some AmericanAmericans who had come to America as\nrefugees, all of us speaking German and English of course. And I was there for two years,\nand after being there a year, and meeting some British people, I got to realize that I was\nreally the only one who thought of myself as British. Everybody else all, the other\nEnglish people that I knew thought of me as a German refugee. On the other hand, I felt\nthat Americans had definitely assimilated, felt American, were treated as American and\nso I said okay I'm under 21, and I'm free, and I'm not close to my brother really, and my\nparents are dead, and I decided to immigrate to the United States. I wrote to an aunt in\nLos Angeles of whom I learned through her GI sons who were in London. And I was sent\nan affidavit, and so at the ripe old age of 21, I came to the United States which was, apart\nfrom going to England, probably one of the best decisions I could have made.",
        "Q: How did you learn about this opportunity to translate in Germany\u201d?",
        "A: I learned of it through a member of the church, strangely enough, who told me that\nAmericans were hiring British subjectsBritishnot necessarily citizens, to go to Germany,\nand I felt that was the best way to find out about my parents.",
        "Q: Did youwere you well paid? Were you able to subsist on what you earned there?",
        "A: We were very well paid, and I got to know a lot of people in the same position I was,\nand it was so wonderful to see the Germans so poor and humiliated and little kids\ncollecting cigarette stubs, and I think those two years in Germany got out of my system\nthis terrible hatred that I bore for the Germans because after that, I was able to go to\nAustria as an American diplomatic wife and to treat Austrians like any other people\nwhich I may not have been able to do if I hadn't gotten this hatred out of my system.",
        "Q: You have any other recollections of this time that you'd like to share with us?",
        "A: Well, there is one more. Little Binette which I feel very strongly about and that was\nthe Denims always prayed in the living room before going to church, and it was toward\nthe end of war, in fact it was after the war, and it was just before I went to Pullach that we\nwere praying in the living room, and after Uncle Norman finished his prayers Auntie\nElsie, in a very unaccustomed manner because she never used to pray aloud, decided to\npray, and say that if anything happened to my parents and they died, she could not\nbelieve that they would not go to heaven just because they had not known Jesus Christ,\nand I'll never forget it. It was so touching. It still makings me cry.",
        "Q: Thank you very much, Joan. This has been a very interesting and worthwhile history\nto share with the researchers of the Holocaust Museum.",
        "A: You're very welcome. Thank you.",

        "Answer: We lived in an apartment in the tea garden area, and I remember some of the\nlovely art pieces we had, which I loved very much and we went to a private schoolmy\ntwin brother and I with another girlso there was only three of us going to a private teacher\nfrom age six to ten. And then we went to another private school which was mixed\nChristians and Jewish. I think we were only there for about a year, and then we moved to\na Jewish school in (?Altmorebeat?) I believe it's now called the Anne Frank School in\nthat area because we visited it a few years ago.",
        "A: We belonged to a congregation called Adas Israel, and we went to synagogue every\nSaturday morning, and of course we kept the high holidays. I knew that my mother came\nfrom Budingen, and from parents who were not in the least religious, and in fact my\ngrandfather, who moved in with us in 1936 when things started getting difficult for Jews\nin small areas in Germany, he always said I fought for the Kaiser and I'm German and I'm\ngoing tol've been born in Germany, I'm going to die in Germany, of course, he didn't he\ndied in the concentration camp in Theresienstadt, but he moved in with us in '36 and so\ndid my uncle.",
        "A: No, he didn't object, and I think he and my uncle, his son, who moved in with us at the\nsame time would go out and eat ham and pork, which we didn't have in the home. We\nhad a kosher household. It was a little difficult having them come and live with us in a\nsmall apartment, but they had nowhere else to go because they're shop was taken away.\nAnd then they started helping my father in his four leather shops, and that was a great\nhelp having family to run these different shops. It was not a leather shop in the way you\nthink of it in the United States. It was a (?shumahe bedafsaticel?) And that is to say things\nthat a shoe maker would buy to repair his shoes. And it was a growing concern and it was\ncalled Rishad Brant, and in very, very small letters under Rishad Brant would be written\nIsrael Nusboum, owner, so that people would notice it was a Jewish name.",
        "A: Yes, we observed the holidays, and I remember one of my favorite ones was Sukkot,\nand we walked through the synagogue, and there was one man who was a butcher who\nalways gave us sausages for our collection, and that was a particularly grand day, and we\nreally enjoyed that. But he fasted on Yom Kippur, and that was very important, and my\nbrother was Bar Mitzvah in 1938, but by that time we had all thought of emigrating\nalready because things were getting worse and worse. And we children were told never to\nhit back anybody who would call us Jew on the street or who would attack us. And this\nwas sort of intimidating for a youngster. We were not allowed to go to the movies, but we\nhad a cleaning woman, a Christian cleaning woman who, very sweetly, would take us\nwith her daughter to see some Shirley Temple films; so that was very exciting.\nOtherwise my parents played cards, and my mother helped also in the shop, and I\nremember a very happy childhood with cousins visiting, and I think Berlin was better to\nlive in as a Jew than than small places in Germany. I do remember one experience where\nwe went towe went to a big fest, Unter Den Linden, and Hitler and his cohorts came by\non the street, and they were policemen on horses. We thought, well, we ought see this\nman who's making such a difference in our lives, and low and behold, one of the horses\nkicked my mother, and the police were very solicitous and wanted to know our names so\nthat they could, I guess, give us some sort of help, and we were very anxious not to tell\nthem that our name was Nusboum, and my mother looked just like a Christian woman.\nShe had blue eyes and blond hair so I guess they didn't realize they we were Jewish, but I\nremember we didn't tell our name or anything we said, \"No. It's perfectly all right. Don't\nworry about it.\" I do remember that it was sort of scary.",
        "A: I remember our family talking about it and that we were scared, but we always\nthought it would pass, that the Germans would realize that Hitler really was no good, and\nthat things would be well again. Somehow one never anticipated the degree to which this\n(?youden fufulgen?) would go. So that we did think of going other seas and made\npreparations for it to go illegally because we didn't have anyone to sponsor us. But\nsomehow we always relented at the last minute and decided to stay. It was really only\nKristallnacht that repelled us to think serously of leaving Germany.",
        "A: Well, it was interesting. We had a sudden telephone call from my l6yearold cousin\nwho was working in Berlin, and she told us that \"Uncle Iz\" as she called himmy father\nwhose name was Israel. Should go for a walk, and of course we immediately realized that\nsomehow he shouldn't be home so he went over and stayed with his sister because we\nknew the Gestapo didn't look in women's houses. They only looked in families. They\ndidn't look at women's houses. My uncle went to his girlfriend's house. My grandfather\nstayed home because he was 72 already. And my brother of course was only 12; so we\ndidn't think that that was dangerous. We had a visit from our janitor's wife who asked us\nwhether father was in, and we said no he wasn't, and I don't really know why she visited\nwhether she visited with a view to telling him to go out or whether the Gestapo had sent\nher on an advance to make sure that he was there, but in any event we were lucky. He\nwas gone, and about ten minutes later two black leather coated men came up and asked\nfor my father. We said he had gone out, and they very politely asked to look through the\napartment to make sure; and we said, \"Sure go right ahead.\" And of course he was gone,\nand they saw my grandfather sleeping there and asked how old he was, and we told him\n72, and after they left, I remember my mother saying she was shaking all over, poor\nthing. And of course us children we didn't realize the import of it all. But 1t was from that\nday onward that we did think of getting out of the country.",
        "A: It's so happened that at our Jewish school, there were some forms being passed around\nwhere a secondary school in London had gotten together with a parentteacher association,\nand they had decided to bring to England three children: One from Austria, one from\nCzechoslovakia, and one from Germany, in fact three girls because it was a girl's school,\nand since my parents said, well really should try to get out, I completed the form, and it\nwas sent back to England. And I was very lucky to be chosen the German girl to go to\nEngland to school. So in May 21--I shan't never forget it of course--we went to the\nrailroad station, and off I went with the children's transport. It was a dreadful experience\nbecause there was a Polish woman on the platform who was being dragged away by\nGestapo men by her hair, and she was screaming, and we didn't really know whether we'd\nall by arrested before we left. So it was very awful in leaving my parents really not with a\nview that I wouldn't see them again because I never thought that would happen. But it's a\nnew experience to go a country with another language, and I remember I had a little gold\nring and in the compartment, the train compartment, somebody mentioned that, \"oh, we\nshouldn't have any jewelry with us.\" And I remember going to the toilet and hiding this\nlittle gold ring, and after we got to Holland, I picked it up again. I think it was in the\ngarbage can, something like that. But 1t was--we were very happy when we left Germany.\nIt was like we could suddenly breathe freely, and there was some people in the railroad\nstation that brought us cookies and crackers and welcomed us with juices. And it was like\nbeing in another world, and it's very odd, but after I left Germany, I started growing and\ngetting bigger. I used to be a really thin little thing, and I guess being in a free country\nmakes you think and eat differently, and I became a normal |3yearold.",
        "A: Only illegal attempts. My father was very scared that at the last minute at the border\nwe would be caught, and of course that would be worse than not going out at all. So when\nI left, one of the things my parents had tried to get us out, which I did tried to do and I did\nmanage to get my twin brother out, but unfortunately the war broke out, and I could not\nget my parents out, and they perished in Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yes, I remember about six weeks after Kristallnacht, my father's brother who was a\nteacher in Dortmund came back from concentration camp, and he had frostbitten fingers\nand toes, and he looked absolutely dreadful. He had been in a concentration camp. And\nthen my English teacher came back from concentration camp and his teeth, his front\nteeth, had been smashed in. And it was a very dreadful experience for us because as\nchildren you grow up trusting, trusting your parents, trusting the system, and all of a\nsudden you realize that you're on the outside looking in, and things won't get better.",
        "A: Well, as far as I can remember, I guess the Germans were not ready yet to keep men\non a permanent basis; so that they let them go after about six weeks, and then they fined\nall Jews for the murder of Vom Rath, and we all had to give up part of our silver and pay\nmoney to compensate the Germans for having lost Vom Rath which was the excuse, of\ncourse. And eventually, of course, they did get concentration camps ready, but at that\ntime they didn't have sufficient facilities to keep people. And I think they would have\nbeen very happy to let all the Jews go out of the country, because but of course they\nweren't allowed to take their money with them anyway, so they would have kept the\nmoney and got rid of the Jews.",
        "A: No. I think the Jews were ready to go, but they didn't want to go without any money,\nwhich is what they would have had to do. My father lost his four stores. They were all\nbroken into, and things were stolen, and after that he didn't have any work anymore. So it\nwas living on your income, whatever you had, but not making any more money. So it was\na matter of really thinking we have to get out of here. But it was easier said than done.",
        "A: We really didn't have Christian friends because of the school we went to with the\nother little girl was Jewish also, and just like in any big society in an apartment life, you\ndon't really have neighbors with whom you associate. So I can really say because we\nwere all in Jewish circles.",
        "A: No. We lived our lives completely apart, but we were very careful not to give any\nneighbors cause to criticize us. I remember very clearly listening to the BBC and foreign\nbroadcasts, and our parents always while they were listening, had us gomy brother went\nto one door, and I went to the other to make sure the noise wasn't penetrating the\napartment so thatbecause you could get arrested for listening to foreign news services.",
        "A: I don't really remember whether we took food along, but we did get fed when we\ncrossed the Dutch border, and we were also fed on the ship before we arrived in England.\nAnd I shall never forget that because we had white bread, which I had never seen before\nand cornflakes, which was another thing that was new in my life, not having eaten cereals\nin Germany. And then by train we were taken to London to a hallI guess it must have\nbeen in the railroad station, and names were called of children, and various people picked\nthem up and when my name came, there was a young blonde girl by name of Yolanda\nwho came and picked me up, and she explained to me that she was the ward of the head\nmistress of the school who had really been very much ahead of her timesingle woman\nwho had adopted a German, a Czech, and an Austrian child. And the German teacher had\npaid for my school education, which I didn't find out until the very end. Anyway, I'm\nproceeding myself. We went to the home of a Norman and Elsie Denim where I was to\nlive. They had a daughter about my age who went to the same school and a son four years\nolder, and Yolanda spoke a little bit of German to me, and this was when she got to the\nhouse, she said, \"Well, that's the last time I'll be speaking German with you.\" And I was\nsort of scared because I didn't speak very much English. But everybody was very\nwelcoming. And I do remember that we had tea, and everybody sat around the table, all\nthese new people chattering in English, and there was something that looked like\nchocolate paste, and I asked the young boy by name of Hue what it was, and he spoke a\nlittle German so he explained to me that it was chocolate the (?retch?) It turned out to be\nMarmite and very spicy, and I learned very soon to take very little of it. And then I went\nupstairs and cried. I went into the bathroom and cried, and after that I guess I decided this\nwas my new life, and I was going to have to accommodate to it. And people were very,\nvery kind. I'm still in touch with Marry, my foster sister, and Hue, my foster brother. We\nvisit each other's homes, and we've been very close friends.",
        "A: I wrote to my parents on a regular basis, and they answered, and Auntie Elsie took me\nto a Jewish language school every Sunday, which was a big sacrifice for her because they\nwere very devout Plymouth Brethren Christians, and so she missed the Sunday morning\nservice taking me to Hebrew class.",
        "A: Well, I remember I was allowed to carry one suitcase, which of course we each had to\ncarry ourselves, and I remember my mother buying me some nice clothing to take along,\nall of which turned out to be completely unsuitable because we wore uniforms to school.\nAnd as soon as I got to London, friends of Marry's would contribute school uniforms for\nme to wear, and as I said, I grew too quickly after that that in no time flat I had out gown\nall my beautiful clothes. I remember that when I was evacuated to Chichester after the\nwar had started, Auntie Elsie sold my clothes, and all I got from these beautiful\ngarmentswhich actually I think I never wore againwere three pairs of black woollen\nstockings which I detested but which were part of our school uniform and I had to wear.\nAnd I guess I've always remembered it because I was so unhappy about losing all these\nbeautiful things. But makes sense; they didn't fit me anymore.",
        "A: Well, it didn't bother me too much. Everybody was so kind, and it bothered me a little\nbit about the clothes as I said, but generally speaking, I was feeling so liberated and\nwonderful to be out of this scary atmosphere where you couldn't say what you thought,\nand all of a sudden I could say whatever I felt like, and when I saw a policeman and I\ncringed, Auntie Elsie would say, \"You don't have to be afraid of \u2018our Bobbies',\" which\nthey were called in England. \"They will always be there to help you.\" And it was such a\nwonderful feeling to be free, really free.",
        "A: I didn't worry about it at all because everybody was so very kind to me that I just felt I\nwas one of the people, and nobody ever asked me was I Jewish. Nobody treated me\ndifferently because I was Jewish. And as children will, they take for granted that\nwhatever happens to them is the right thing, so I had no worry about that.",
        "A: Well, we walked across the common every Sunday morning, and I went to Hebrew\nclass, and having been told by my parents that I really should try and get our family out\nof Germany, I approached the head rabbi who was teaching us one Sunday morning and\nasked him if they could not find a home for my brother. And he looked at me and he said,\n\"Oh. You're the little girl who lives with nonJewish people.\" And I said, \"Yes, I am.\"\nAnd he said, \"Well, until you move to a Jewish family, there's nothing we can do.\" So I\nsaid to him, \"But if I move to a Jewish family, I'm already taking away the place that my\nbrother could take.\" And he said, \"No, no there's nothing we can do until you move to a\nJewish family.\" So I left Sunday school very depressed and very unhappy and started\ncrying on the way home, and Auntie Elsie said to me, \"What's the matter? Why are you\ncrying?\" And I told her about the incident, and it was Auntie Elsie and Uncle Norman\nwho decided to adopt my brother who then came to England at the beginning of\nAugust 1939 and started to process papers for my parents to come over, but unfortunately\ndue to the war breaking out in September, they never made tt.",
        "A: I was very ashamed that a Jewish person would do a thing like that. I'm still ashamed.",
        "A: Well, that's an interesting question because inat the outbreak of war, we werethe\nchildren that is to sayall of the school were all evacuated to Chichester, a small, very old\ntown in the south of England. And there was no Jews in Chichester. My Uncle Norman\nwrote to my father through the Red Cross asking whether it would be all right for Hans,\nmy brother, and myself to go to church, and my father wrote back and said that his\nchildren were old enough to know what was right, and that if he felt that since there was\nno Jewish house of worship, we should go to Sunday schoolthat he should feel very free\nto send us.",
        "A: No. Not at all. Which is why theyUncle Norman was a customs official in the British\nCivil Service, but he was interested in religion and had studied religion theology, and in\nfact he was a doctor of theology which he never, never talked about. But that was why he\nwas interested in Jews and Judaism because, of course, he understood the connection\nbetween the Old and the New Testament.",
        "A: Auntie Elsie treated me not as a Jew, but as another child in the home. She endeared\nherself to me because I had brought a doll to England, and during the transport its eyes\nhad fallen out, and she took me to a doll hospital and had the eyes put back in. And the\ndoll meant very much to me. It was the only cuddly thing, and the family was not a\ncuddly family so that all of a sudden physical contact was gone. I guess as Jews or\nGermans, perhaps we were more physically effusive certainly my family was with\nhugging each other which the Denim family never did.",
        "A: Well, he fitted in very well because he had Hue as a companion, and of course, he was\nonly there for about three weeks because at the beginning of September, we were\nevacuated to Chichester.",
        "A: It was difficult the first two or three days, but being thrown into an Englishspeaking\nhousehold and going to an Englishspeaking school, I ended up just like Yolanda. In no\ntime flat I wasn't speaking German anymore, only English, and I'm a little bit ashamed of\nmyself because when I picked up my brother at the railroad station, I imitated Yolanda\nwhen we got home and I said, \"That's the last time I've spoken any German to you,\nHans.\"",
        "A: Yes. I'm afraid so.",
        "A: It was about two months, and I remember that it was difficult at school, but I was\nplaced into a lower class so that I had less difficulty catching up, and the children were\nvery kind. Occasionally they would tease me, and I remember one of them calling me\nfish face. And I went home, and I asked Uncle Norman, \"What's fish face?\" And he said,\n\"Well, it's nothing very bad, but next time you see the girl who said this to you, you just\ncall her dog's body.\"",
        "A: I would say English was my favorite, and geography I loved, and art. I loved drawing.",
        "A: Well, I was never too good at the sciences I'm afraid.",
        "A: My brother's strength was mathematics, but of course, since he came in August, he\nnever went to school in London. He started going to school in Chichester after we were\nevacuated.",
        "A: I would say it was about on the same level.",
        "A: Yes. I would say it was very _+ yes. I would say it was very comparable.",
        "A: It's a long story really because it was my main life in England. I was in Chichester\nfrom just before the war started until 1944. I went to high school there, and I graduated\nfrom high school, and at that point the school went back to London. By brother and I\nwere locatedbilitted was the word--in a small home where a very old lady and her\nmiddleaged daughter lived. Her middleaged daughter was working, but it was really no\nenvironment for a teenage boy and girl so that within a very short period of time, we were\nreassigned separately, my brother to one household and I to another. And he stayed in the\nhousehold he was in and was very happy, went to public school, and went back to\nLondon in 1944 also. I on the other hand was with a family where the woman actually\nhad a nervous breakdown after I got there. I kept hoping it wasn't me, and I don't think it\nwas, but one of her neighbors who was a dear lady took me into her house. She had three\nother evacuees, and we all slept in one double bed, and there was a dog who scared me to\ndeath. I had never had experience of a dog, and the first thing this dog did was to upset a\nhot cup of chocolate over my lap, but we got to like each other very much eventually.",
        "A: Yes. We were four girls in one double bed, and we had a shower every two weeks,\nand it was a matter of putting money in the (?g1za?) to get hot water in the bathroom\nwhere was really the only place you could get hot water. And we would take turns in\nbeing first, second, third, fourth in the bathtub. And it was so cold that first winter. I was\nnot used to just having a fireplace in the living room and no other place in the house not\nheated because in Berlin, we had had central heating, and we had hot water in the\nbathroom. Here we had no hot water and worst of all, the toilet was outside the house.",
        "A: I would say it was a lower middle class family. But they were lovely people. The lady\nwhom I called Auntie Nell, she had been educated age until 14; so she didn't have too\nmuch education, she could barely write. Her husband was a fishmonger and eventually\nwas called up into the police. Thethe other children went back to London after this falsel\nforget what it was called, but in the first winter, there was no air raids so the children\nsome of them did drift back to London. I stayed with Auntie Nell, and when her husband\nwas called up, she and I grew very close. She had no children, and I had no mother; so\nshe was very protective of me. They had very little money, but I remember one birthday\nshe gave me a bicycle which enabled me to ride to schoolwhich I had to do twice a day\nbecause we came home for lunchinstead of walking the two miles which was a long way\nto walk. She was a lovely person. I'm still in touch with her. She's just entered an old age\nhome in Chichester.",
        "A: Well, actually what we did was she and I slept in this double bed, and the other room\nwas rented out to another person to make a little more money because they really didn't\nhave very much money. There was one man whoMr. Watts, who came every summer and\nstayed with her while he was selling his ice cream, and I remember Mr. Watts coming to\nthe house and saying, \"I want to stay with you this summer,\" and Auntie Nell said,\n\"You're welcome.\" And he said, \"What's this little girl doing here? Is she German?\"\nAnd Auntie Nell said, \"Yes, she's German.\" And he said, \"Then I don't want to stay with\nyou.\" And she said, \"That's perfectly all right. The little girl is going to stay with me\nwhether you stay or not.\" He finally relented and decided to stay there; so between being\nGerman and Jewish, it was hard road to plow.",
        "A: No. She wasn't a devout Christian, but like most uneducated people, they felt Jews\nwere different. Now of course, since I lived with her for so long, she realized that I wasn't\ndifferent, but in the beginning I had a diary which I locked. It had a lock on it, and I\nwould write in there when I was unhappy, and one day I came home and she had broken\nthe lock on the diary and read my diary which then made me never write in the diary\nagain. But I didn't hold it against her because she really was very kind. It made me\nunhappy for a little while.",
        "A: No, it wasn't because it was still in German.",
        "A: Well, there are several. One was that due to the fact that we had only cold water to\nwash with and no bathroom, I took a catlick in the kitchen in the morning, and one day\nmy schoolteacher said to me, \"Inga, you've got a dirty neck,\" which was very\nembarrassing and humiliating, and after that I even managed to wash my neck with cold\nwater. That was one experience. Another one was went I was bicycling home from school\nthere was a German airplane very, very low in the sky, and I felt sure 1t was going toto\nmachine gun me, and so I dashed off the bicycle and into a doorway and of course that\nthis (?hagencoits?) the swastika still frightened me so much.",
        "A: I don't really know. It might have crashed. We did have an air force base not too far\nfrom us called Tangmere, and it could be that the German plane was looking for this air\nforce base to bomb.",
        "A: I sort of resented going to Sunday school at church, and there was a dear old man who\nwas in charge of Sunday school, and whenever he called on me with a question, he would\nsay, \"My child of Aberham.\" He always called me his child of Aberham. And I would\nargue with him fiercely because I was very well acquainted with the Old Testament, of\ncourse not with the New, but it was something which came to mean a lot to me, and I got\nto the point where one night I dreamt about Jesus Christ, and I felt that, yes, I was\nconverted, and it made me very happy. Jesus Christ to me was someone I could talk to\nanywhere, not just in church. I would be in the bathroom, and I could talk to him or in the\nkitchen or in my bed, and somehow I remember Yahova as being a very strict god, a god\nwho was jealous of his prerogatives and to me, I guess Jesus was more of a friend and\nfather which I did not have.",
        "A: Yes. Chichester was a wonderful place to grow up in. It was a small city and our\nstratum secondary school was housed in the Chichester High School building, and we had\nsome rooms that we worked in, and Chichester High School had some rooms that they\nworked in. The teachers lived near the school and looked after us in many ways other\nthan at school, and when we were 16 years old, we were called before a counsel in\nTunbridge Wells and asked whether we would give away any secrets to Germans who\nwould promise us that our parents would be saved.",
        "A: We is my brother and myself, and so we said of course we wouldn't. Of course I never\nreally knew what secrets we could possibly have known at age 16 to give away to\nanybody.",
        "A: I think that they were not too skeptical of us because we didn't speak German\nanymore. Our English was perfect, and we were still children; so I don't think that we had\nany difficultly in that respect.",
        "A: Oh yes. Themany Germans at the beginning of the war had been interned and sent to\nthe Isle of Man and were not allowed to stay in areas which they considered to be\nimportant such as London and Birmingham and Manchester and so on, but wellyust like\nduring the first world war, lots of people didn't play Wagner because he was a German\ncomposer. So we were considered German refugees rather than Jewish refugees. It was\njust the fact that my brother and I were so young that saved us from being interned in the\nfirst place.",
        "A: Yes, absolutely. Yes, absolutely.",
        "A: I went back and stayed with the Denims. By that time, my foster brother had left and\nwas in Sri Lanka and Marry was at university in Cambridge, and my brother had found\nhimself a job with--with a lawyer somewhere in London. So I was the only one that\nremained, and I stayed with the Denims. I had one scholarship in Chichester and decided\nthat I wanted to go to secretarial school because I was very much aware of the fact that I\nwas being supported by people who were not my parents, and I also felt that if my parents\nwere saved after the war, I would want to have a profession to look after them. So I\nstudied for a year to be a secretary shorthand in typing and bookkeeping and got a job in\na London law office.",
        "A: Yes, I remained with the Denims, and I don't remember paying them any money for\nstaying there. I must have offered it, but I guess they just didn't accept it, but I was very\nhappy with them. We went to to church together because by that time I was converted. I\nbecame a Sunday school teacher and mymymy remembrance is that Auntie Elsie took me\nto the Jewish community to let them know that I had been converted, and they were not\nvery happy about this, and I had some rabbi in Oxford who would write me letters and\nask me to answer them to make sure that I knew what I was doing which I did for a\nwhile.",
        "A: He had no affiliation to Judaism, but he also was not religious in any other way. He\nended up marrying an English Christian girl and still lives in England now.",
        "A: None whatsoever.",
        "A: No, I did not. My husband is Jewish also refugee from Germany, but he was not\nreligious, and by that time I was no longer religious either so that we have brought up our\nchildren, he was in the foreign service. We brought them up all over the world, and we\nwanted them to know about religions, but we were never religious.",
        "A: One daughter does because she is married to a Jew, and although they are not\nreligious, they don't go to synagogue at any time, but their son was Bar Mitzvah, so that's\na sign of Judaism anyway.",
        "A: The other daughter was never religious. She's a professional, and she's about to marry\na Catholic gentleman who is not religions.",
        "A: Well, yes, we did. We had something called the doodlebugs. And the V2 rockets\nwhich the Germans sent over; and for six weeks, were slept in an air raid shelter with 300\nother people, and we survived it. I got to work one morning, and the office had been\nbombed, and we had to clear out glass. And I was with a friend one weekend, and I had\nbeen making a hat in the garden and after a doodlebug crashed nearby. It happened to end\nup in a tree. We could never get to it again. But we spent a lot of time cleaning up after\nthese doodlebugs. I didn't know anybody who had been hurt by them, because by that\ntime people were sleeping in shelters.",
        "A: They are pilotless planes, really, rocketsthe first rockets. And they were programmed\nto go down over cities such as London, and they would make a noise. You could hear the\nmotor, and all of a sudden the motor would stop, and within a few minutes it would crash\nso that whenever you heard the motor stop, you dove under the table because you were\nscared that it might crash right over you.",
        "A: We had a letter from our parents in 1941 just before they left for Theresienstadt and\nasking us if we could raise a certain amount of money so they could go to Shanghai.\nUnfortunately, we couldn't raise the money, and so they did go to Theresienstadt. I\nremember receiving one letter after they were in Theresienstadt, but after that we never\ndid, and I think that we felt it was not possible to write to them. We may have been\nwrong. Perhaps this could have been done, but we were so far away from anybody who\ncould have given us any advice on this that we never did write and felt that 1f we wrote, it\nwould be construed as writing to the enemy.",
        "A: My parents at one point in 1944 were sent from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz, and I\nbelieve almost immediately killed there. The way I found this out was after the war, I\nwent to Germany as a translator for the US War Department, and when I was in\nGermany, I used to go to the Joint Distribution Committee in Munich every week to see\nif I could find their names. And I would put in the names of all my entire family, of\nwhom there were 18 members, to see if anybody got out alive, but we heard from some\nlady who had met them in Auschwitz, and she said that they had been killed. And of\ncourse, their names never turned up. Of all the people whom I put in traces for, only one\naunt and one cousin were saved.",
        "A: Everyone else perished. Everyone else perished.",
        "A: We were trained in Paris and given American uniforms. Then we went to a little place\ncalled Pullach, which is outside Munich, and I was a translator of letters which had been\nconfiscated for censorship. Letters, that might have let us know where some Nazis were\nhiding so these could be prosecuted. I was only 18 at the time; so I was one of the\nyoungest people there. All the camp consisted of elderly refugees who had been in\nEngland during the war. Also some AmericanAmericans who had come to America as\nrefugees, all of us speaking German and English of course. And I was there for two years,\nand after being there a year, and meeting some British people, I got to realize that I was\nreally the only one who thought of myself as British. Everybody else all, the other\nEnglish people that I knew thought of me as a German refugee. On the other hand, I felt\nthat Americans had definitely assimilated, felt American, were treated as American and\nso I said okay I'm under 21, and I'm free, and I'm not close to my brother really, and my\nparents are dead, and I decided to immigrate to the United States. I wrote to an aunt in\nLos Angeles of whom I learned through her GI sons who were in London. And I was sent\nan affidavit, and so at the ripe old age of 21, I came to the United States which was, apart\nfrom going to England, probably one of the best decisions I could have made.",
        "A: I learned of it through a member of the church, strangely enough, who told me that\nAmericans were hiring British subjectsBritishnot necessarily citizens, to go to Germany,\nand I felt that was the best way to find out about my parents.",
        "A: We were very well paid, and I got to know a lot of people in the same position I was,\nand it was so wonderful to see the Germans so poor and humiliated and little kids\ncollecting cigarette stubs, and I think those two years in Germany got out of my system\nthis terrible hatred that I bore for the Germans because after that, I was able to go to\nAustria as an American diplomatic wife and to treat Austrians like any other people\nwhich I may not have been able to do if I hadn't gotten this hatred out of my system.",
        "A: Well, there is one more. Little Binette which I feel very strongly about and that was\nthe Denims always prayed in the living room before going to church, and it was toward\nthe end of war, in fact it was after the war, and it was just before I went to Pullach that we\nwere praying in the living room, and after Uncle Norman finished his prayers Auntie\nElsie, in a very unaccustomed manner because she never used to pray aloud, decided to\npray, and say that if anything happened to my parents and they died, she could not\nbelieve that they would not go to heaven just because they had not known Jesus Christ,\nand I'll never forget it. It was so touching. It still makings me cry.",
        "A: You're very welcome. Thank you.",
        "A: I was born on March 24, 1926, together with my brother Hans in Berlin, Germany. My\nparents were Israel Nusboum and Tony Nusboum (?Ne Ziheil?)\nConclusion of Interview\n"
