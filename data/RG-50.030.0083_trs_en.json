        "Q: Okay. Can you tell me your name please?",
        "A: Okay. My name is Helen Liebowitz Goldkind.",
        "Q: Can you tell me where and when you were born?",
        "A: I was born in Czechoslovakia, July the 9th, 1928.",
        "Q: What was the name of the town?",
        "A: Volosyanka.",
        "Q: Where is that?",
        "A: That's...uh...in Carpathia.' It's...It was a little town. It was a little town in Czechoslovakia.",
        "Q: Tell me about your childhood.",
        "A: Well, we were seven children and I was next to the last one. I was sixth. It was a happy\nchildhood. We didn't really have much but, you know, as a family we... enjoyed my\ngrandparents and my uncles and my sisters and brothers. It was a...1t was a very happy\n' Carpathian Ruthenia. Prior to World War II, this was part of Czechoslovakia. After the war, it\nbecame the Transcarpathian Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR.\nfamily.",
        "Q: Tell me what you did growing up?",
        "A: Well, I went to school and I did everything that a normal child would do; played with my\nneighbors and...uh... sust..... was just a happy child.",
        "Q: Tell me about some of your memories.",
        "A: As a child? Well, my memories were very, very good until I.... I was together with my\nfamily and with my neighbors and everybody else there. But then we were occupied by the\nHungarians and a few years later we were occupied by the Germans. So when the Germans\ncame in, this is when I started seeing and feeling different things. Now the difference was\nthat we weren't allowed to go out at night anymore. We weren't allowed to go shopping, only\nat a certain time. But it didn't take long, maybe six weeks after the occupation by the\nGermans, that we were rounded up and we were taken to a...uh....ghetto. And that is to\nUzhgorod [Czech: U_horod]. That was the capital of Carpathia. Now that was something\nthat was horrible in my life and actually what happened was maybe four weeks after the\nGermans were there, they took my brothers and my father away and they told us that they're\ngoing to be in a work camp. You know, that they weren't going to be in the army, but they\ngonna be working. So my mother and, and us children--my grandparents were there--left. A\nfew weeks later after they took my father and my two brothers away, this 1s when they\nrounded us up and...and took us to that ghetto actually. In the ghetto it was, you know, we\nwere sleeping on the floors, on concrete, but we had blankets that we took from home when\nwe left the house. They ...uh...told us that we can...we've got to leave everything except only\nwhat we can take with ourselves. So I remember my grandfather. He was...uh...a very old\nman. He was past 80. And he had a box...he had a Torah. I don't know how to explain it. The\nTen Commandments or whatever...a Torah. And he did not want to leave it because he felt\nthat wherever he is going to be, we will be needing it. How can we live without it? So, we\nhad to deal with that. We...we wrapped that Torah up and we carried it with us. (Sigh) When\nwe got to...uh...the ghetto, the older people were using it. You know, they were still very\nreligious and they felt that this Torah perhaps is going to save us or the world.",
        "Q: How did they carry the Torah?",
        "A: We carried it in...by...1n our hands. You know we wrapped it up in sheets and whatever we\nhad and we just carried it with us. But when we got to the...when we got to the...you know,\ninto the ghetto, every day it was somehow worse. Sometimes they wouldn't let us have\nwater. Sometimes they wouldn't let us get out of the barracks and what we lived on is on\nsoup. They gave us soup and...and bread. So that in itself was a horrible thing. But still you\nwere with the family, especially me as a young adolescent. I wasn't paying much attention to\nthat.",
        "Q: How old were you at this time?",
        "A: I was between 13 and 14 in the ghetto. But then all of a sudden they, the Germans, you\nknow, came on the loud speaker and they told that every older Jew that has a beard and he's\ngot to report to a certain barrack. And, of course, we didn't know what will happen there with\nthem. So my mother went along with him.",
        "Q: With whom?",
        "A: With my grandfather. And what they did is they...and my grandfather also had a...a prayer\nshawl, a tallis [NB: tallith] they call it. So they made these men put on these _ tallisen, these\nprayer shawls, and they told them to start praying. And while they were praying, they started\nbeating on them and they started cutting their beards. So my poor grandfather... and my...my\nmother had to watch that while this was happening to her father and she couldn't come to his\nrescue because, you know, you...you just killed if you...1f you go near there. So this poor old\nman had to endure the pain not only the physical pain, but the beating, but also the cutting of\nthe beard. And my grandfather never saw himself without a beard. So he continued crying\nfor a couple of days and my mother didn't know what to do with him. So she told...she gave\nhim a scarf and he put it around his face and he tied...tied his scarf on top and then he put on\nhis hat, you know. The older Jews, you know, wore these black hats. And that's how he\nwalked around because he couldn't see...he couldn't accept himself without a beard. First of\nall, he was very religious and that was against his religion and beside that, it was strange to\nsee himself. So we stood in the ghetto for a few weeks and then when they got enough\npeople into the ghetto for a train, for a full train load... It took about another six weeks to get\nthese people together from all these little towns into this ghetto. And they gave us...they\nlined us up, and they gave us a loaf of bread near the train and they told us they're relocating\nus. They're taking us someplace where we are being needed to work. And they gave us a\nbucket there for if we need to use it, but the way they packed us into these cattle cars, it was\nso packed that if one wanted to stretch his legs, he just couldn't because he had a person\non...on him. So...then when we were packed into this cattle car they locked the door from the\noutside and we stayed in this cattle car until it...1t was midnight and midnight the train started\ngoing. You know, there were many, many sick people, many small children. It was really,\nreally chaotic there inside. We didn't know where we were going. So it...you know, it was so\nnoisy and it was so tense. I...I don't know how to describe it, but anyway there was a lot of\nolder people that fainted and some of them died because they were old and ill. So they were\nlaying there with us. When we got to Auschwitz, and we really didn't know about\nAuschwitz. The thing is that they...these cattle cars, they had windows on top, small\nwindows. So sometimes, you know, the younger children would stand on one each other's\nshoulders and would wanta look out where we go, what it is. So as we were driving through\nthe country side I remember my sister kept me on her shoulder because I also wanted to see\nwhat's going...what's...what's going on there. And I saw the farmers showing to me like this\n(finger across throat). I...I really didn't know what they were saying. And...and a young adult\nit yust didn't sink into my head that they're telling me something. But it was strange to see\nthese farmers. They were all showing like this (finger across the throat). I told my sister. I\ntold my mother that that's what they were showing me. Well, anyway when we got to\nAuschwitz it sort of didn't sink in. I didn't expect that I was brought to a death camp. I just\ndidn't. But when I got to Auschwitz and they opened the doors and the SS with the dogs\nwere standing there and there was a big flame in the back of the camp, a very big flame. And\nit smelled. It smelled liked someone would be roasting something, something. And the SS\nwere screaming, \"Heraus! Heraus! Heraus!\" \"Get out! Get out!\" Some of them were trying\nto go out and whoever couldn't go out, they were helping each other. Like my sister...I had\ntwo sisters coming with me. One was holding on to my grandmother because she was old\nand she couldn't walk very well, so she was trying to help her out. My mother was holding\nonto my brother and sort of trying to hold on to me to. But what they did is they pulled my\nbrother away from her. They...they pushed my brother to the left and my mother and my\nother sister and me to the right. So my little brother noticed that my mother is going a\ndifferent way so he started running after her and they started beating on him. And my mother\nheard his voice so she was...she looked back, so she was running back to my brother. And\nthen they started beating on her. So she was pleading. She went on her knees pleading to that\nSS man to please let me go for this is my child and he won't be able to survive without me.\nHe's so little. He was six years old. So after they beat her up, they pushed her to the left with\nmy brother and there I remained with my sister. We were trying to run with my sister...my\nmother too but they wouldn't let us because when we got to Auschwitz they already needed a\nmanpower. Of course, at that time we didn't know. So they wouldn't let us. And we looked\npretty...you know, we looked pretty healthy yet. So they wouldn't let us run to my mother. So\nthey started beating on us, on my sister and me. And my sister says to him, \"You know,\nsomething smells terrible here.\" He says, \"Well, we're just roasting pigs.\" And...uh...then\nyou see these mothers coming down with little kids and they're...they're trying to pull these\nkids out of their mother's hands. And, you know, when you try to separate a family, it's very\ndifficult. It's very difficult. People put up fights. It...1t was so much screams. So there was a\ntruck. I remember that truck. So the parents, the...the mothers that wouldn't give up these\nchildren and they were beaten up and the kids got hurt, so they grabbed these kids and they\nthrew them on the truck and they really didn't look how they throwing them on the truck. So\nat that time we saw that something horrible is happening the way these people were\nbehaving to little children, to little babies. And, of course, on that truck there were people,\nyou know, very sick people going, you know, they were throwing sick people there\nand...and...and these children that gave them a tough time. They were just thrown on the\ntrucks. And there were so many mothers that were running after the trucks, and of course\nthey beat them and they pushed them back. So that was the opening of these...of these train\ndoors. This is the first thing that I have seen there.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: Go ahead. Keep talking. Tell..tell me more about...tell me more about what happened at\nAuschwitz. What happened with the--?",
        "A: Okay. Okay. So...uh...that...that big fire so maybe being that my sister and I was so young, it\nwas like scary. It was...felt like you're going into the fire. And as we were walking, the\npeople that worked there, they told us... they told us that they're gas...you know,\nthey're...they're gassing more people than they can burn in the crematortum so they had\nto...they have to burn them in the pits. And we still...we thought that some person is just\nbeing cruel telling us that. So...and we walked, we walked, you know, they had a long line of\nyoung people walking and as we were approaching these barracks there, there was...we\nheard music. There was a man is telling us that they are burning people because they can't\nburn them in the ovens. They can gas more than they can burn. And here we hear music! It\nwas very, very confusing to us. When we got closer, our room...a...a... a barrack or whatever\nyou want to call it, opened up and they told us to undress. And, of course, you know, the SS\nwere walking around there and there was so many girls that didn't want to underess\ncompletely and they started beating on them and they had to get undressed. And then they\nstarted shaving our heads and...uh...1 remember staying there and these SS walking around\nus and if the girls would put down their heads, just trying to, just trying to hide, they would\ncome up and they would take their whip and they would pull their heads up like this with the\nwhip and they would look at us and then they would start whipping us. So we...we felt that\nthere is something terrible going on but we didn't, still didn't think that maybe people are\nbeing put into a gas chamber either. So then we took a shower and they gave us a...uh...a\nstriped dress and they gave us wooden clogs and that striped dress had a number. And that\ntook place during the night. We kept on asking where's...where's my little brother. Where's\nmy mother? Where's the rest of them? Because we thought we'll meet someplace. They\ndidn't...you know we...they separated us right and left, my mother and my brother and my\ngrandmother and my grandfather, my family went to the left and my sister and I were the\nonly one from my family that I found myself with so we kept on asking each other\nwhere...where is the rest of them. Nobody knew. Nobody knew. Nobody knew. And then\nwhen they gave us the dress and they lined us up after a long, long time. You know, by the\ntime they shaved a thousand girls' heads, it takes a long time. And...uh...1t was...it was at\nnight. I remember it was at night. And they let us into our barrack. They...you know, they\ntook us to our barrack. When we got to that barrack, there were, you know, like on the\nbottom there was three...uh...three different parts to that...to where we had to go and sit down\nor lay down. So I was on... remember, on top of that thing...on top of that bed or whatever\nyou would call it. And I would just sit there and my sister and we...we had...we were six girls\nto a place...uh...maybe that...that wide, and we would have to just lay there and we were just\nwondering what's happening. We just...we couldn't figure it out. So these barracks were\nmade...they were made out of wood and there were cracks between them. So early in the\nmorning they took us out around 4 o'clock. It was dark yet and I wasn't looking around too\nmuch. So they let us stay there for an hour and they were counting us and...uh...after they\ncount us they told us we can go back in there. That was the first night. That was the first\nmorning. When we got back in it was already about, you know, daylight and I took a look\nthrough the cracks and I saw people hanging on these wire fences. It was such a terrible\nsight. I wasn't...1 just wasn't prepared for all that. And I say to my sister, \"Look what's\nhappening. You know, look what's happening. People are...are hanging on these fences.\nThey're dead.\" They were got electrocuted because many of them...some of them were\naware of the electric fences and some of them thought maybe they want to escape or to go\nlook for their parents or go look for their family. So they...they were hanging there. We were\nin all day. All day we were in. In the morning they gave us some soup and all day we were\nthere and wondering what will happen. And, of course, we were locked in from the outside\nso there was no way to get out to see where we are, what's happening, what's going on\nbecause... because whatever happened, whatever they did with us, it was always during the\nnight. So at night they...they brought in some bread and they gave us a slice of bread. And\nagain during the night they were taking us to the bathrooms. It was also again a barrack. So\nwe got to this bathroom everybody in... There was water. So everybody was trying to wash\ntheir faces or go to the bathroom, but it was...those... those Kapos...you know, these Kapos\nwere people that were taking care of us, watching over us. They started beating us like\nif...you know, I remember I sit down to want to go to the bathroom like a human being. It\nwas...and she started beating on me because she thought I was there too long. I was black\nand blue from her. My sister got me to..to where the water was running and she was trying to\nwash me up. And that was the experience the first day, first... second day. And...uh ... finally,\nyou know, after everybody sort of got their beating, knowing, you know, saw how we were\ntreated, they lined us up again and they took us back to that barrack. And that was during the\nnight. The next day, again, they got us out at 4 o'clock and they told us to stay for an hour.\nSo the next day, the people that were a little bit weaker couldn't stay for an hour. It was cold.\nThey couldn't stay for an hour so they sort of like collapsed. So what happened was they\ncame and they pull these girls out, these people out and they...also a truck came and they\nthrew them on the truck. And...uh...when we were in Auschwitz, we never...we never knew\nwhere these people are going once they were on the truck. Because I think if a lot of people\nthey would have known once they get on the truck that they'll never see the light again, I\nthink maybe they would have tried harder right at the beginning. But...uh... they didn't know\nso they...that's how it was going on for about... was in Auschwitz for about five weeks with\nthis routine. And...uh...every morning, they just pulled other...other people out because they\njust..they just ..some of them were just giving up somewhat. You know, they ...the beating\nwas...was So bad that I think they just didn't wanta live right of death. They just didn't wanta\na go through everyday this...this beating. So...so we were weeded out, but thank God, one\nday a Kapo came in and said that we have to line up again. That was after already we were\nlined up. And they looked everybody over. Whoever looked strong enough to them, they\nagain put them to the right and me and my sister was put to the right and then other girls\nwere put to the left and they...the girls from the right were taken away, and the girls from the\nleft stayed...stayed where they were. And they put us in another barrack with...by the time\nwe got there, there were already other girls there. And during the night, they took us to\nthe...to the railroad station. But we recognized the railroad station because when we got to\nAuschwitz, I remember the sign. The sign said...uh...uh... \"Arbeit macht das Leben suf.\" I\ndon't know if you understand. It said that \"work makes...uh...uh...life happy\n[sweet]\"...something like that.7 So when we got to the station, we were glad that...we felt we\nwere going to get out of this place; because, as you know, I mean, getting out from\nAuschwitz by a gate and not by chimney, I was lucky. So we were...we were maybe a\nthousand girls there. And they...again they put us into...uh...to cattle cars. And we stayed in\nthese cattle cars, you know, the rest of the night and during the day. The cattle cars didn't\nmove, but we were locked in. Yal, they also gave us a bread. And during the night...during\nthe night, we heard like bombs were exploding and that noise. We were...we were...we were\nkinda happy. We were...we were figuring maybe they're going to bomb the tracks and these\npeople aren't going to be coming. Because I left some uncles and aunts in the ghetto and a lot\nof my family in the ghetto. So I...you know, I was talking to my sister and the other girls and\nwe were saying, \"Oh, My God, they're gonna...they're bombing the tracks.\" We weren't\n* Possibly \"Arbeit Macht Frei\"; \"Work makes one free.\"\nmoving. The bombing the tracks in...you know, the family we left behind isn't going to come\nhere. But...uh... that...that was maybe for an hour, an hour and a half, that noise\nconstantly...constantly. And all of a sudden it stopped. It stopped and we're sitting there in\nthat railroad...in that car. In the middle of the night all of a sudden...and we thought that\nmaybe that...that it was bombed and that's why they're not taking us anymore. But in the\nmiddle of the night, again, we started off. We went...they ...they...you know the train started\nmoving. And so when we also didn't know, you know, where we're going or what happens.\nNobody knew. They didn't tell us what was happening to us, what's going to happen to us.\nSo...uh...but we were stronger people. We were, you know, we were weeded out. We were\nhealthier. We were healthier. So we were just trying to talk and figure out what this world is\ncoming to, what's happening, and that...you know, you didn't see anybody saying anything\nexcept the beatings and...and the brutalities and...(sigh)... Finally, after a couple of days we\nwound up...it...1t was in Germany. They took us to Germany and, again, we were walking\nfrom these trains and they took us in again to barracks like in Auschwitz but...but it was\nsmaller. It was a smaller camp. It was a smaller camp. And they put us into these barracks\nagain and they gave us some soup. And the next day, again, they putting us out and they told\nus to get out again. For a hour we had to stay in line and they were counting us. And after\nthat they gave us a slice of bread and some soup and they told us to march. We should go.\nAnd we...we marched and marched maybe for an hour and we got to a munition factory.\nWhen we got to the muniton factory, they took these girls and placed them in different\nplaces. And they placed me near a... uh... near a...uh...like...1it was like a pump, to pump the\nexplosive into bombs. They were maybe [motioning] that tall. And I had to do it so fast that\nit was going with the machine and as the machine was working, I had to work with the\nmachine. So, of course, in the beginning 1t was okay because I still wasn't that weakened.\nBut after awhile, you know, the little bit of hair that we had became red from the poison,\nfrom that gunpowder. Our eyes were yellow. Our bodies were yellow. The reason why is\nbecause we worked night shifts and day shifts. So the night shift, and we worked the night\nshift, they closed the doors and the windows so we had no circulation. So this poison was\ngoing into our system. When we worked during the day, it wasn't too bad because the doors\nand the windows were open. So there weren't that many girls that were falling, but during the\nnight is when a lot of girls just fainted and just... just died because the body was full of\npoison. Well, anyway, we were working there for a few months. We got weakened and my\nsister...she's two years older. And at that time I just felt mentally that I can't go on anymore.\nBesides physically...I was physically broken. So what she would do is she would give her\nslice of bread and she would...uh...she would say, \"No, you're not gonna die. You're not\ngonna leave me here alone. Your not gonna die.\" She...uh ...she was like afraid of being\nalone. So...so I was trying to hold on to my life because I saw what she care...you know, the\nway she carried on. When we were walking back and forth to work...you know, it was an\nhour's walk, maybe more...and it was cold. So whenever we could pick up, like a rotten\npotato or something we would pick it up. Or if we would find paper...1f we would find paper,\nwe would put in into the...uh...into that dress that we had so that we should keep warm. And,\nof course, if we could find a rag on the road sometimes, we would secretly want to pick it up\nand tie it to our clogs because at that time it was already snowing there in eastern Europe and\nthe clogs were falling off our feet and we ...1f we wouldn't pick them up quick enough, then\nwe would be walking barefooted. So...uh...1 remember one time...uh...we were walking on\none side of the street and Russian soldiers and French soldiers... The reason why you knew\nthey were Russian and French soldiers is because they let them...they were prisoners and\nthey let them wear the uniform. It's just that the buttons I remember were off. They had no\nbuttons. And...uh... the men...they were...uh..., you know, big men with these big hats and\nwe...we were trying to figure it out. We thought they were Russian. So...uh...believe me they\nlooked like they suffered, but evidently what happened was they must have gotten more food\nthan we did. So a French soldier threw some bread across the street into our group. So the\ngirl that was lucky was there and she picked it up, but the SS saw that she grabbed that bread\nand he started beating on her and beat on her and beat on her until she no longer could, you\nknow, so she fell to the floor. And we just walked away, and we never saw her. But that\nwould even happen if some girl would pick up...[ mean when we...when we wanted to pick\nup something from...that was laying on the road, that... that would have to be like, you know,\nthat the SS shouldn't see. You would have to look around and see because if they found you\npicking this up, you know, you were beaten up and it depended how strong you were\nwhether you can take that beating or you can't. So...uh...and the girls were starting to get\nweak. You know, after...after awhile, you just can't take that punishment, the physical and\nthe mental it's just...1t's just you can't go on. We were there for a long, long time...for a long\ntime going on. It was may...it was maybe 500 girls left at that time in our bunk...in our...in\nour,...uh...you know, in our group. And as weaker as we were getting, we were trying to...we\nwere trying to help each other sort of. So...the S...so the SS had one kitchen that the girls\nworked in...1n the kitchen, cooking for the SS people and us, we had another kitchen. It was,\nyou know, cooked soup. So there was a girl in..in my...happened to be in my bunk there. She\nhad a sister. She was lucky. She worked in the SS kitchen so, you know, she...she was\nsurviving all right. But her sister wasn't surviving too well. So she sneaked some bread and\nbrought it to her sister and they sort of...the Kapo caught her taking that bread to her sister.\nWell, they were both...both beaten up right there. And then they ordered all of us to come out\nand they took both of these girls and they hung them there on the gallows. I remember. I...I\nremember I still if I have nightmares, these faces come in front of me. If I think back on them\nI just, you know, I think they were trying so hard to survive and, therefore, they were\npunished. And they were so young. They were so young. And that was going on, but...uh....\nExcuse me. I don't want to do that.",
        "Q: Take your time. Take your time.",
        "A: I'll take a little bit of water. I feel we were still perhaps treated better than a lot of them\nbecause we worked...because we worked, but still, you know, after awhile you just can't take\nit. You know, you can't take it. So again, I... couldn't get up in the morning anymore. And\nmy sister would come and just literally stand me up because she knew that if I'll remain in\nthe barrack that I'll just disappear...that, you know, she'll never see me again. So she would\nstand me up and she would hold me up for the hour that we would have to stay outside in the\ncold. It was so cold. And then she would drag me to work. She would actually drag me to\nwork. And she would do her work and she would try to do my work. And...uh...1t was...I just\nfelt that I am not going to make it there in the end. But then all of a sudden, it was a long\ntime. It was maybe nine months, a year, and we were already...we didn't look like people.\nWe looked, you know, with...with deep red hair. I...It was like an orangey red hair. Our\nbodies were yellow. We were very skinny. I weighed maybe 70 pounds, 60 pounds. You\nknow, I just didn't look human anymore and I was burned up with that gunpowder. It was\nhot. That gunpowder is hot. So I was...my body was burned with the gunpowder. And one\nday...one day they came...they let us stay inside. They didn't take us to work. So what\nhappened was they bombed. Every night when we were there, we were praying, praying they\nshould bomb this factory, this munition factory. Even though we were there, they never let\nus out when the bombing was going on. They never let us out. They just locked the doors.\nBut we...we didn't care. We almost felt well, you know, we...we won't live through it\nanyway, might as well go. But...uh...one day, it just so happened when we weren't there, that\nfactory was bombed. So that was the day when they gave us off. And next day they took us\nto...make... they told us that we're not going to work anymore in that. They didn't tell us it\nwas bombed. But they told us we won't...we won't be able to go there, but we're going to\nwork someplace else. So they took us to work on a road, to build a road. Which was better\nbecause on a road you were on the fresh air. And...uh ...you know, you tried doing as much\nas you can and even...you know, even if sometimes you got a...a...a whip, you could have,\nyou know, you...you sort of overcome it faster than working constantly in this poisoned\natmosphere. But still we worked on that road maybe...uh...you know, a...a few months and\nagain they locked us in. They locked us into this barrack. We were...we were very few left.\nWe were maybe 200, maybe 200 left. And...uh...we were locked in from the outside\nand...and nobody came at 4 o'clock to open up this barrack. So...uh...we...we got scared. We\nfigured what they'll do is just destroy us in this barrack. And...uh...nobody came and nothing\nis happening. The SS we don't...we looked through the cracks and we don't see a soul. And\nwe were there a day and a night. Nobody bothered us. Then middle of the day we see some\ncivilians came with a truck, with an open truck and they opened up our..uh.... you know,\nour...uh...barrack and they said that we weren't needed there anymore and they're taking us to\nanother place. So they put us on that open truck and as I said, we got there, there was maybe\nabout...maybe a thousand, twelve hundred girls. When we...when we left there, there was an\nopen truck full, maybe 200 girls, maybe. And they didn't tell us where we were going, but\nthey put us in that open truck and that was civilians. There...there were no SS men, and they\ntook us to Bergen-Belsen. When we got to Bergen-Belsen...uh...you know most of the\npeople would have to stay in. And we were thrown in in a barrack. My God! There were all\nkinds of dead people laying there and the smell of dead people...uh... People that lost their\nminds from all this going through already....uh...the way they looked. I mean we didn't look\nso good either because we...we were a different color. We were yellow and we had orange\nred hair. We...we... we looked like to them probably also like we're not from this planet.\nWell, anyway they were infected with typhus already. So we were laying there and...uh...also\ngot you know, we also got soup in the morning, but we didn't get the bread anymore in\nBergen-Belsen. And we were there for a few weeks, a month. Uh, my sister got sick. She\nwas the strong one and I was the sick one and she got sick. Evidently what happened she\nwas... she was infected with typhus. She got the typhus, got to her faster than to me. So she\nhad high fever and...uh...and I saw that she was talking deliriously. She...she...she no longer\nspoke, you know, normally and she was laying near the floor and she says to me, \"You know\n[...I see tanks coming down.\" And I thought she was sick. I thought she was sick. She was\ndreaming...she's delirious. I did...wasn't moving. I wasn't moving because....then all of a\nsudden, the noise from the tanks, that scared me actually. So I moved over to see through\nthese cracks and when we saw it was tanks and that was the English...the English with tanks\nand with cars and with trucks. And they opened up these barracks. And when they opened up\nthese barracks, you know, they were just staring at us there. We stared at them. A lot of\nthem...the...the girls that had the strength to get up did and were running over to these\nsoldiers. Prob...you know, probably a lot of them got scared because we looked so horrible.\nAnd a lot of them were sick, you know, going... So they were looking at us. We were\nlooking at them. We didn't know what to make out. We didn't know it was the liberation\narmy. We just didn't know. But they weren't hitting us, so we...we thought at least, you\nknow, they're not hurting us. And my sister...uh...was laying there. She..she wasn't happy.\nShe wasn't sad. And I was looking at my sister and I saw the end is coming to...you know\nhere. And then I looked at these people and I felt My God, there're not hitting us. Maybe\nthey can help us. But I saw that time is going out. So what happened was they took...you\nknow, after a day or so, they...they made hospitals, you know, on the premises. They took\nbarracks and they made like hospitals and they were trying to save the ones that are still\nbreathing. So they came and they picked...they came with these red, you know, there were\nlittle cars with red...red crosses and they picked my sister up and there here I wanted to go\nwith her but they wouldn't let me go with her because she was very sick. And...uh...they took\nher away. So, there I was by myself and I couldn't move too much, but the English were\nstarting to give us already at least food. And I couldn't eat. I couldn't eat much so I...I maybe\nwould eat a slice of bread, but I couldn't eat. But the people that could...you know, that they\nwanted to eat. They wanted to save themselves. They starting eating and then they got sick.\nThey got sick and they got diahhrea and oh, what was going on there. So finally when\n[...when I saw my sister isn't coming, I felt that I need to go and look for her. I... wanted to\ntake a walk. And there were, you know, there were mountains of corpse just laying there.\nBut what...what's happening when we got liberated, there were...uh...organizations like the\nHias, they asked us our names and so I figured...and we gave them our names. So I figured I\nam going to find my sister's name somewheres because when they had these mass graves\nafter the liberation, they had there a plaque with names, the ones they knew that they died\nafter the liberation. So I...so I went over to one big, you know, it was like a mountain with\ncorpses and I started reading hopefully that I will find my sister's name. At least I will know\nwhere she is, you know, and...uh...I didn't find it. And that's what I remember. I just\nremember all these corpse. This mountain of corpse. And I evidently blacked out because\nthat's all I remembered from there. What... Shall I continue?",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: What they did after they got themselves a little organized is that they...they went around with\nthese cars and they picked up everybody that was breathing, hopefully that they will save\nand they probably picked me up but I don't remember where it was and how it was. I don't\nremember. But I was 1n this makeshift hospital for weeks with a high fever. I also got typhus\nand...uh...after a few weeks, you know, they did. I sort of...uh...was surviving. I was\nsurviving. And the first thing when my fever broke a little bit, my...my first question was,\n\"Where is my sister?\" So they started asking me...uh.... what happened to her? So I told\nthem that, you know, what happened. They came and they just, you know, she was very sick\nand they took her away. And after awhile, after, you know...uh...I remember it was a week or\nso, maybe more, somebody...and I was getting a little better, they came and told me that my\nsister did survive from all...from.... So anyway, then they right away reunited us. So we were\ntogether. So we were in that place still for a long time because we were very, very sick\nand...and that was in Bergen-Belsen in this makeshift hospital. And then all of a sudden they\ncame to tell us that...uh...1f we wanta go back to Czechoslovakia, we could go back to\nCzechoslavakia. But we were very weak and we were verty...uh...we just...we didn't know\nwhat we want. We didn't know what we want. And we knew we couldn't go there on our\nown because we were very weak, so we didn't go. So we remained in Bergen-Belsen. And\nthen the Swedish Red Cross offered to take in some survivors, the sick ones, the real sick\nones and...uh...they...they took us to Sweden. When they took us to Sweden...uh...we still\nlooked like...like corpse. We still didn't have hair and I was full of sores. Uh...And people\nwere coming over to...uh...to us...to...to...to comb...to...to touch us and we...we again would\nlook at them like: \"My God, aren't they afraid of us? Look how we look.\" They were very\nkind. They were... they were just very nice people. And we were in a hospital there. We were\nin a hospital. I remember they gave us root beer to drink and I didn't want to drink it and they\nsaid, \"No. Drink it. Drink it. That'll make you feel better.\" And, you know, a person that\nwants to survive, I was drinking the beer. So it's in Sweden where I really came to myself at\n..at... You know I felt again like I...uh.... am sort of human. And I think...uh...and, of course,\nat that time I was already, you know, a little bit older and I started looking at this world and\ntrying to figure it out, what had...what has happened. So picking up the pieces here and there,\nI recognized that we were there alone. We knew...at that time we already figured out what\nhas happened to my family. But up until then, to tell you the truth, we didn't allow ourselves\nto think that they would take all these kids that came with me to the gas chamber...my\nmother, my grandfather, my grandmother and the family that came with me, that these were\nthe ones who went to a gas chamber to be gassed for no sin committed. So that was difficult\nfor me in Sweden to deal with. (Sigh) They put me into a place where they start, you know,\nwe were... It was like a school. We worked a half a day and a half a day we...we studied. And\nlife was very good, but it was very sad. So we had some people talking to us and we had so\nmany questions. They...uh...they were doctors who were talking to us. They were very\ncareful on how they are letting us in on it, but still the bottom line was that we lost. We lost\neverybody. So my sister and I was left and then, again, they were trying...what they were\ntrying to do after the war is get families together and I remember...I remember a...when I was\nlittle that I had a sister that went to America. So they asked me do I know about a family. I\nsays, \"Yes, I had a sister, that she went to America and she lives in Brooklyn.\" And I gave\nthem their names. And...uh...they put our names in a paper in here...in the United States\nso...probably in the Brooklyn paper or whatever, and a friend called up my sister that\nshe...because my sister would talk about her family. She wonders whether she'll see them or\nanybody will be left or what's happening to us. And...uh...that friend calls her up and says,\n\"You know, I saw two names--Liebowtiz names--in the papers. Maybe you should call up\nthe Red Cross and they might be able to give you some information where they come from.\"\nAnd my sister did that and they were in touch with us. And...uh...after a short while they got\nus reunited. They brought us here to the United States. And this is how we...I got here.",
        "Q: Where did you come to?",
        "A: We came to Brooklyn and with my sister, and we lived with my sister for awhile and then, of\ncourse, I got married.",
        "Q: Was your sister married?",
        "A: My sister was here was married. Yes. Uh...what I have is a lot, you know, being that I\nspeak...I couldn't talk about it for a long time. I did not talk about it for a long time.\nAnd...and I...I think...I...[ made a decision when I had my first child that I will not talk about\nit. The reason why I didn't want to talk about it is because I was afraid I will talk about it so\nmuch. What I...[...1 am telling you is just highlights of certain days, not day by day.\nAnd...and to me it was if..1f my kids will hear what I have gone through that Hitler will get to\nthem too and I wanted sort of like save them from, from that and, therefore, I didn't talk\nabout it. I didn't talk about it. They...uh...they guessed. They... they knew that something isn't\nright because during the day I could control my emotion and I was busy. I was very busy. I\nworked. I was trying to raise a family and so I could control what's there behind my head, the\npast. But sometimes I would just go in and cried for weeks. That there was nothing to...I\ncould do stop and they always felt well did they do something. DId they annoy me? And I\nkept on reassuring that they didn't do. It's just that I just don't feel good when they were little.\nSo they knew that it...1t wasn't...that I wasn't sort of completely a normal.... It wasn't a normal\nsituation because they couldn't figure out why I would be like that. And then sometimes\nwhich you cannot control is the nightmares, you see. The nightmares you can't control.\nSo...uh...in the beginning we lived in a small apartment and...uh...you know the kids could\nhear me scream and my husband would wake me up. But at...but by the time my husband got\nme up...really got me up so I don't really that I should be up. It took a little while. In the\nmeantime the kids heard my screams. And so. But they knew that they cannot talk to me\nabout it. So this is how they knew what was happening, but I didn't talk about it.",
        "Q: When you came to Brooklyn, did you talk about it with your sister who lived here?",
        "A: To my sister, it was very difficult. What happened was when we came here and we saw\nchildren on the street and they were free. They were running around and they played in the\nplaygrounds. And we say the people and they...you know, I keep on asking are they Jewish.\nAre they Jewish? Because I thought all the Jews...that happened to all the Jews. And they\nsays, \"Yeah.\" So, you know, we had to deal with that. You know that there are Jewish kids\nthat survived. And...uh ...1t...you know, it also...I...you know, I had to have help because of\nthe nightmares. The nightmares were terrible. The nightmares were very exhausting. And\nyou can't control them. You cannot control a nightmare. And, again, I stayed with my sister\nand she had two children. So it was like a...like a continuation. It was like a continuation of\nit. (long, long pause) So that's...that's the way I lived until, you know, I got married. I met\nmy husband and started having my own family. And...uh... I said I have to be strong\nand...uh...you know, I...[ made a comm... I feel I brought my children into this life that I owe\nthem something that I need to bring them up. And to tell you the truth, I was so many times\npast my...you know what what was passing my mind is I'll bring up my children that will be\ndifferent than the people with dealt with me because the people that dealt with me reacted\nlike not people. Not human! And I worry...I mean...I...I really thought about it all the time\nhow my kids will be brought up. Will they be different people? Will they be different? And\nI so much wanted them to be different than what I saw. So I think I concentrated on that a\nlot. I really did. I, because it was with me constantly. And I...1 was lucky. I..I...1 do\nhave...uh...1 brought up three children. I don't know if I should talk about them or I\nshouldn't?\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: You want to stop for a minute?",
        "A: Okay. I think I would like to say now something of why I talk now. How much time do I\nhave?",
        "Q: We have a little bit.... We have a little bit longer. You have talked for a little over an hour.",
        "A: Already over an hour.",
        "Q: Yeah. You've done beautifully. You've really done beautifully. All right.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Is there something you want to ask me that I may be...uh... I was just telling you highlights.",
        "Q: Okay. Is there anything I missed? Is there anything you'd like to add?",
        "A: Well, what I would like to...uh...say is the reason why I...uh...decided talking about it\nbecause I really think it's important. I know I cannot bring back my family, my little brother,\nthe million and a half children that were destroyed, that were gassed, but perhaps maybe I\ncould reach some people that make them understand that this did happen and it can happen\nagain if we are not going to be if we are not going to be aware of our surroundings. I...I think\nthat every person...every person on earth should examine this, what has happened in the\nHolocaust because a thing like that can happen again and we need to watch that it shouldn't\nnever happen again to no minority, to no minority. And therefore I feel I need to get this\nacross to the world, maybe to...even to our future generation and tell them that this cruelty\nhas been done to people from other people and to watch out. I...uh...1 have nine\ngrandchildren and there're all great, but one of them is a little bit gifted and when I look at\nhim and I say to myself, \"I have so much hope in him that he might do something good with\nbeing that he's got so much ability, something good for society.\" And then when I look at\nhim and then I think of my brother, little brother and all these other kids, I say to myself,\n\"My God. Who knows what these kids would have been...what they would have\naccomplished if they would...1f they would be given a chance just to live...just to live.\" So\ntherefore I think every child on earth should be given this chance just to live and prove itself\nand not so brutally being destroyed.",
        "Q: Thank you very very much.",
        "A: I also would like to add to this. I speak in the Children's Center and I come up with many\nchildren and they have many questions and I like children. Children are curious. And they\nalso come in with mothers or with some chaperons and I talk to them. So after I get finished\ntalking to the children, the parents or the chaperons come over to me and they ask me\nquestions. And the reason why I want to tell this little story is because I feel I reached a\nperson. A lady came over to me and she says to me, \"You know my father was a SS person\nand he said it wasn't that bad. So I looked at the lady and I felt that I need to get something\nacross to her and she should make her own mind on how bad and how good it was so I\nstopped for a second and looked at her beautiful children. And I said to her, \"You know the\nSS people were volunteers. They were volunteers. The SS were the people in Auschwitz that\nlived on the premises with their families. They had better housing and nobody threatened\ntheir lives. But they were...their job was to take innocent kids and older people ...sick people,\nall kinds of people, escorting them to the gas chamber. And then after the job was done, they\nwent home to play with their children. So what can I tell you. You'll have to figure it out how\nbad it was.\" And I could see...I really have a lot of respect for that lady that she was trying to\nfind the truth I feel. She was searching. She was trying to hear everybody. And I am hoping\nthat she found the truth and that she...uh...will be able to make decisions accordingly and for\nthe people around her you know that she...and with her children. I...I feel that it can be done\nwhen you raise children to bring them up and show them right from wrong because my kids\nthey would tell me always, \"Well, Mom when I grow up, you'll be so proud of me.\" I says,\n\"Honey, I am already proud of you, you know. You...you're the best and the finest.\"\nAnd...uh...we never told them what they should do in their lives. We never did because we\nfelt they are individuals and they need to do what they need to do. So the oldest...the oldest\none is doing research and even today, when she...you know, she does something\ngood...something comes across, she loves to share it with me. She says, \"You know, Ma, I\ntold you I will try, you know. We'll do something to better humanity.\" And...uh...my\nyounger daughter, she...uh...teaches children that have...uh...have a problem and she too tries\nso hard...I think she too tries so hard to...uh...to make me feel that she 1s doing something\ngood or right or whatever you would call it. And...uh...my son..our son...he...uh...he is a\ngastroenterologist; and so I feel like God took away a lot from me, but God gave me a lot\nback. And in...and what I wanted to achieve in life after the Holocaust I hope and I think I\nmaybe achieved it by looking at my kids, what they do. And...and you know, having my\ngrandchildren and they...they too are nice and hopefully, they'll...they'll do something good\nfor humanity and not for destruction.",

        "A: Well, we were seven children and I was next to the last one. I was sixth. It was a happy\nchildhood. We didn't really have much but, you know, as a family we... enjoyed my\ngrandparents and my uncles and my sisters and brothers. It was a...1t was a very happy\n' Carpathian Ruthenia. Prior to World War II, this was part of Czechoslovakia. After the war, it\nbecame the Transcarpathian Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR.\nfamily.",
        "A: Well, I went to school and I did everything that a normal child would do; played with my\nneighbors and...uh... sust..... was just a happy child.",
        "A: As a child? Well, my memories were very, very good until I.... I was together with my\nfamily and with my neighbors and everybody else there. But then we were occupied by the\nHungarians and a few years later we were occupied by the Germans. So when the Germans\ncame in, this is when I started seeing and feeling different things. Now the difference was\nthat we weren't allowed to go out at night anymore. We weren't allowed to go shopping, only\nat a certain time. But it didn't take long, maybe six weeks after the occupation by the\nGermans, that we were rounded up and we were taken to a...uh....ghetto. And that is to\nUzhgorod [Czech: U_horod]. That was the capital of Carpathia. Now that was something\nthat was horrible in my life and actually what happened was maybe four weeks after the\nGermans were there, they took my brothers and my father away and they told us that they're\ngoing to be in a work camp. You know, that they weren't going to be in the army, but they\ngonna be working. So my mother and, and us children--my grandparents were there--left. A\nfew weeks later after they took my father and my two brothers away, this 1s when they\nrounded us up and...and took us to that ghetto actually. In the ghetto it was, you know, we\nwere sleeping on the floors, on concrete, but we had blankets that we took from home when\nwe left the house. They ...uh...told us that we can...we've got to leave everything except only\nwhat we can take with ourselves. So I remember my grandfather. He was...uh...a very old\nman. He was past 80. And he had a box...he had a Torah. I don't know how to explain it. The\nTen Commandments or whatever...a Torah. And he did not want to leave it because he felt\nthat wherever he is going to be, we will be needing it. How can we live without it? So, we\nhad to deal with that. We...we wrapped that Torah up and we carried it with us. (Sigh) When\nwe got to...uh...the ghetto, the older people were using it. You know, they were still very\nreligious and they felt that this Torah perhaps is going to save us or the world.",
        "A: We carried it in...by...1n our hands. You know we wrapped it up in sheets and whatever we\nhad and we just carried it with us. But when we got to the...when we got to the...you know,\ninto the ghetto, every day it was somehow worse. Sometimes they wouldn't let us have\nwater. Sometimes they wouldn't let us get out of the barracks and what we lived on is on\nsoup. They gave us soup and...and bread. So that in itself was a horrible thing. But still you\nwere with the family, especially me as a young adolescent. I wasn't paying much attention to\nthat.",
        "A: I was between 13 and 14 in the ghetto. But then all of a sudden they, the Germans, you\nknow, came on the loud speaker and they told that every older Jew that has a beard and he's\ngot to report to a certain barrack. And, of course, we didn't know what will happen there with\nthem. So my mother went along with him.",
        "A: With my grandfather. And what they did is they...and my grandfather also had a...a prayer\nshawl, a tallis [NB: tallith] they call it. So they made these men put on these _ tallisen, these\nprayer shawls, and they told them to start praying. And while they were praying, they started\nbeating on them and they started cutting their beards. So my poor grandfather... and my...my\nmother had to watch that while this was happening to her father and she couldn't come to his\nrescue because, you know, you...you just killed if you...1f you go near there. So this poor old\nman had to endure the pain not only the physical pain, but the beating, but also the cutting of\nthe beard. And my grandfather never saw himself without a beard. So he continued crying\nfor a couple of days and my mother didn't know what to do with him. So she told...she gave\nhim a scarf and he put it around his face and he tied...tied his scarf on top and then he put on\nhis hat, you know. The older Jews, you know, wore these black hats. And that's how he\nwalked around because he couldn't see...he couldn't accept himself without a beard. First of\nall, he was very religious and that was against his religion and beside that, it was strange to\nsee himself. So we stood in the ghetto for a few weeks and then when they got enough\npeople into the ghetto for a train, for a full train load... It took about another six weeks to get\nthese people together from all these little towns into this ghetto. And they gave us...they\nlined us up, and they gave us a loaf of bread near the train and they told us they're relocating\nus. They're taking us someplace where we are being needed to work. And they gave us a\nbucket there for if we need to use it, but the way they packed us into these cattle cars, it was\nso packed that if one wanted to stretch his legs, he just couldn't because he had a person\non...on him. So...then when we were packed into this cattle car they locked the door from the\noutside and we stayed in this cattle car until it...1t was midnight and midnight the train started\ngoing. You know, there were many, many sick people, many small children. It was really,\nreally chaotic there inside. We didn't know where we were going. So it...you know, it was so\nnoisy and it was so tense. I...I don't know how to describe it, but anyway there was a lot of\nolder people that fainted and some of them died because they were old and ill. So they were\nlaying there with us. When we got to Auschwitz, and we really didn't know about\nAuschwitz. The thing is that they...these cattle cars, they had windows on top, small\nwindows. So sometimes, you know, the younger children would stand on one each other's\nshoulders and would wanta look out where we go, what it is. So as we were driving through\nthe country side I remember my sister kept me on her shoulder because I also wanted to see\nwhat's going...what's...what's going on there. And I saw the farmers showing to me like this\n(finger across throat). I...I really didn't know what they were saying. And...and a young adult\nit yust didn't sink into my head that they're telling me something. But it was strange to see\nthese farmers. They were all showing like this (finger across the throat). I told my sister. I\ntold my mother that that's what they were showing me. Well, anyway when we got to\nAuschwitz it sort of didn't sink in. I didn't expect that I was brought to a death camp. I just\ndidn't. But when I got to Auschwitz and they opened the doors and the SS with the dogs\nwere standing there and there was a big flame in the back of the camp, a very big flame. And\nit smelled. It smelled liked someone would be roasting something, something. And the SS\nwere screaming, \"Heraus! Heraus! Heraus!\" \"Get out! Get out!\" Some of them were trying\nto go out and whoever couldn't go out, they were helping each other. Like my sister...I had\ntwo sisters coming with me. One was holding on to my grandmother because she was old\nand she couldn't walk very well, so she was trying to help her out. My mother was holding\nonto my brother and sort of trying to hold on to me to. But what they did is they pulled my\nbrother away from her. They...they pushed my brother to the left and my mother and my\nother sister and me to the right. So my little brother noticed that my mother is going a\ndifferent way so he started running after her and they started beating on him. And my mother\nheard his voice so she was...she looked back, so she was running back to my brother. And\nthen they started beating on her. So she was pleading. She went on her knees pleading to that\nSS man to please let me go for this is my child and he won't be able to survive without me.\nHe's so little. He was six years old. So after they beat her up, they pushed her to the left with\nmy brother and there I remained with my sister. We were trying to run with my sister...my\nmother too but they wouldn't let us because when we got to Auschwitz they already needed a\nmanpower. Of course, at that time we didn't know. So they wouldn't let us. And we looked\npretty...you know, we looked pretty healthy yet. So they wouldn't let us run to my mother. So\nthey started beating on us, on my sister and me. And my sister says to him, \"You know,\nsomething smells terrible here.\" He says, \"Well, we're just roasting pigs.\" And...uh...then\nyou see these mothers coming down with little kids and they're...they're trying to pull these\nkids out of their mother's hands. And, you know, when you try to separate a family, it's very\ndifficult. It's very difficult. People put up fights. It...1t was so much screams. So there was a\ntruck. I remember that truck. So the parents, the...the mothers that wouldn't give up these\nchildren and they were beaten up and the kids got hurt, so they grabbed these kids and they\nthrew them on the truck and they really didn't look how they throwing them on the truck. So\nat that time we saw that something horrible is happening the way these people were\nbehaving to little children, to little babies. And, of course, on that truck there were people,\nyou know, very sick people going, you know, they were throwing sick people there\nand...and...and these children that gave them a tough time. They were just thrown on the\ntrucks. And there were so many mothers that were running after the trucks, and of course\nthey beat them and they pushed them back. So that was the opening of these...of these train\ndoors. This is the first thing that I have seen there.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Okay. Okay. So...uh...that...that big fire so maybe being that my sister and I was so young, it\nwas like scary. It was...felt like you're going into the fire. And as we were walking, the\npeople that worked there, they told us... they told us that they're gas...you know,\nthey're...they're gassing more people than they can burn in the crematortum so they had\nto...they have to burn them in the pits. And we still...we thought that some person is just\nbeing cruel telling us that. So...and we walked, we walked, you know, they had a long line of\nyoung people walking and as we were approaching these barracks there, there was...we\nheard music. There was a man is telling us that they are burning people because they can't\nburn them in the ovens. They can gas more than they can burn. And here we hear music! It\nwas very, very confusing to us. When we got closer, our room...a...a... a barrack or whatever\nyou want to call it, opened up and they told us to undress. And, of course, you know, the SS\nwere walking around there and there was so many girls that didn't want to underess\ncompletely and they started beating on them and they had to get undressed. And then they\nstarted shaving our heads and...uh...1 remember staying there and these SS walking around\nus and if the girls would put down their heads, just trying to, just trying to hide, they would\ncome up and they would take their whip and they would pull their heads up like this with the\nwhip and they would look at us and then they would start whipping us. So we...we felt that\nthere is something terrible going on but we didn't, still didn't think that maybe people are\nbeing put into a gas chamber either. So then we took a shower and they gave us a...uh...a\nstriped dress and they gave us wooden clogs and that striped dress had a number. And that\ntook place during the night. We kept on asking where's...where's my little brother. Where's\nmy mother? Where's the rest of them? Because we thought we'll meet someplace. They\ndidn't...you know we...they separated us right and left, my mother and my brother and my\ngrandmother and my grandfather, my family went to the left and my sister and I were the\nonly one from my family that I found myself with so we kept on asking each other\nwhere...where is the rest of them. Nobody knew. Nobody knew. Nobody knew. And then\nwhen they gave us the dress and they lined us up after a long, long time. You know, by the\ntime they shaved a thousand girls' heads, it takes a long time. And...uh...1t was...it was at\nnight. I remember it was at night. And they let us into our barrack. They...you know, they\ntook us to our barrack. When we got to that barrack, there were, you know, like on the\nbottom there was three...uh...three different parts to that...to where we had to go and sit down\nor lay down. So I was on... remember, on top of that thing...on top of that bed or whatever\nyou would call it. And I would just sit there and my sister and we...we had...we were six girls\nto a place...uh...maybe that...that wide, and we would have to just lay there and we were just\nwondering what's happening. We just...we couldn't figure it out. So these barracks were\nmade...they were made out of wood and there were cracks between them. So early in the\nmorning they took us out around 4 o'clock. It was dark yet and I wasn't looking around too\nmuch. So they let us stay there for an hour and they were counting us and...uh...after they\ncount us they told us we can go back in there. That was the first night. That was the first\nmorning. When we got back in it was already about, you know, daylight and I took a look\nthrough the cracks and I saw people hanging on these wire fences. It was such a terrible\nsight. I wasn't...1 just wasn't prepared for all that. And I say to my sister, \"Look what's\nhappening. You know, look what's happening. People are...are hanging on these fences.\nThey're dead.\" They were got electrocuted because many of them...some of them were\naware of the electric fences and some of them thought maybe they want to escape or to go\nlook for their parents or go look for their family. So they...they were hanging there. We were\nin all day. All day we were in. In the morning they gave us some soup and all day we were\nthere and wondering what will happen. And, of course, we were locked in from the outside\nso there was no way to get out to see where we are, what's happening, what's going on\nbecause... because whatever happened, whatever they did with us, it was always during the\nnight. So at night they...they brought in some bread and they gave us a slice of bread. And\nagain during the night they were taking us to the bathrooms. It was also again a barrack. So\nwe got to this bathroom everybody in... There was water. So everybody was trying to wash\ntheir faces or go to the bathroom, but it was...those... those Kapos...you know, these Kapos\nwere people that were taking care of us, watching over us. They started beating us like\nif...you know, I remember I sit down to want to go to the bathroom like a human being. It\nwas...and she started beating on me because she thought I was there too long. I was black\nand blue from her. My sister got me to..to where the water was running and she was trying to\nwash me up. And that was the experience the first day, first... second day. And...uh ... finally,\nyou know, after everybody sort of got their beating, knowing, you know, saw how we were\ntreated, they lined us up again and they took us back to that barrack. And that was during the\nnight. The next day, again, they got us out at 4 o'clock and they told us to stay for an hour.\nSo the next day, the people that were a little bit weaker couldn't stay for an hour. It was cold.\nThey couldn't stay for an hour so they sort of like collapsed. So what happened was they\ncame and they pull these girls out, these people out and they...also a truck came and they\nthrew them on the truck. And...uh...when we were in Auschwitz, we never...we never knew\nwhere these people are going once they were on the truck. Because I think if a lot of people\nthey would have known once they get on the truck that they'll never see the light again, I\nthink maybe they would have tried harder right at the beginning. But...uh... they didn't know\nso they...that's how it was going on for about... was in Auschwitz for about five weeks with\nthis routine. And...uh...every morning, they just pulled other...other people out because they\njust..they just ..some of them were just giving up somewhat. You know, they ...the beating\nwas...was So bad that I think they just didn't wanta live right of death. They just didn't wanta\na go through everyday this...this beating. So...so we were weeded out, but thank God, one\nday a Kapo came in and said that we have to line up again. That was after already we were\nlined up. And they looked everybody over. Whoever looked strong enough to them, they\nagain put them to the right and me and my sister was put to the right and then other girls\nwere put to the left and they...the girls from the right were taken away, and the girls from the\nleft stayed...stayed where they were. And they put us in another barrack with...by the time\nwe got there, there were already other girls there. And during the night, they took us to\nthe...to the railroad station. But we recognized the railroad station because when we got to\nAuschwitz, I remember the sign. The sign said...uh...uh... \"Arbeit macht das Leben suf.\" I\ndon't know if you understand. It said that \"work makes...uh...uh...life happy\n[sweet]\"...something like that.7 So when we got to the station, we were glad that...we felt we\nwere going to get out of this place; because, as you know, I mean, getting out from\nAuschwitz by a gate and not by chimney, I was lucky. So we were...we were maybe a\nthousand girls there. And they...again they put us into...uh...to cattle cars. And we stayed in\nthese cattle cars, you know, the rest of the night and during the day. The cattle cars didn't\nmove, but we were locked in. Yal, they also gave us a bread. And during the night...during\nthe night, we heard like bombs were exploding and that noise. We were...we were...we were\nkinda happy. We were...we were figuring maybe they're going to bomb the tracks and these\npeople aren't going to be coming. Because I left some uncles and aunts in the ghetto and a lot\nof my family in the ghetto. So I...you know, I was talking to my sister and the other girls and\nwe were saying, \"Oh, My God, they're gonna...they're bombing the tracks.\" We weren't\n* Possibly \"Arbeit Macht Frei\"; \"Work makes one free.\"\nmoving. The bombing the tracks in...you know, the family we left behind isn't going to come\nhere. But...uh... that...that was maybe for an hour, an hour and a half, that noise\nconstantly...constantly. And all of a sudden it stopped. It stopped and we're sitting there in\nthat railroad...in that car. In the middle of the night all of a sudden...and we thought that\nmaybe that...that it was bombed and that's why they're not taking us anymore. But in the\nmiddle of the night, again, we started off. We went...they ...they...you know the train started\nmoving. And so when we also didn't know, you know, where we're going or what happens.\nNobody knew. They didn't tell us what was happening to us, what's going to happen to us.\nSo...uh...but we were stronger people. We were, you know, we were weeded out. We were\nhealthier. We were healthier. So we were just trying to talk and figure out what this world is\ncoming to, what's happening, and that...you know, you didn't see anybody saying anything\nexcept the beatings and...and the brutalities and...(sigh)... Finally, after a couple of days we\nwound up...it...1t was in Germany. They took us to Germany and, again, we were walking\nfrom these trains and they took us in again to barracks like in Auschwitz but...but it was\nsmaller. It was a smaller camp. It was a smaller camp. And they put us into these barracks\nagain and they gave us some soup. And the next day, again, they putting us out and they told\nus to get out again. For a hour we had to stay in line and they were counting us. And after\nthat they gave us a slice of bread and some soup and they told us to march. We should go.\nAnd we...we marched and marched maybe for an hour and we got to a munition factory.\nWhen we got to the muniton factory, they took these girls and placed them in different\nplaces. And they placed me near a... uh... near a...uh...like...1it was like a pump, to pump the\nexplosive into bombs. They were maybe [motioning] that tall. And I had to do it so fast that\nit was going with the machine and as the machine was working, I had to work with the\nmachine. So, of course, in the beginning 1t was okay because I still wasn't that weakened.\nBut after awhile, you know, the little bit of hair that we had became red from the poison,\nfrom that gunpowder. Our eyes were yellow. Our bodies were yellow. The reason why is\nbecause we worked night shifts and day shifts. So the night shift, and we worked the night\nshift, they closed the doors and the windows so we had no circulation. So this poison was\ngoing into our system. When we worked during the day, it wasn't too bad because the doors\nand the windows were open. So there weren't that many girls that were falling, but during the\nnight is when a lot of girls just fainted and just... just died because the body was full of\npoison. Well, anyway, we were working there for a few months. We got weakened and my\nsister...she's two years older. And at that time I just felt mentally that I can't go on anymore.\nBesides physically...I was physically broken. So what she would do is she would give her\nslice of bread and she would...uh...she would say, \"No, you're not gonna die. You're not\ngonna leave me here alone. Your not gonna die.\" She...uh ...she was like afraid of being\nalone. So...so I was trying to hold on to my life because I saw what she care...you know, the\nway she carried on. When we were walking back and forth to work...you know, it was an\nhour's walk, maybe more...and it was cold. So whenever we could pick up, like a rotten\npotato or something we would pick it up. Or if we would find paper...1f we would find paper,\nwe would put in into the...uh...into that dress that we had so that we should keep warm. And,\nof course, if we could find a rag on the road sometimes, we would secretly want to pick it up\nand tie it to our clogs because at that time it was already snowing there in eastern Europe and\nthe clogs were falling off our feet and we ...1f we wouldn't pick them up quick enough, then\nwe would be walking barefooted. So...uh...1 remember one time...uh...we were walking on\none side of the street and Russian soldiers and French soldiers... The reason why you knew\nthey were Russian and French soldiers is because they let them...they were prisoners and\nthey let them wear the uniform. It's just that the buttons I remember were off. They had no\nbuttons. And...uh... the men...they were...uh..., you know, big men with these big hats and\nwe...we were trying to figure it out. We thought they were Russian. So...uh...believe me they\nlooked like they suffered, but evidently what happened was they must have gotten more food\nthan we did. So a French soldier threw some bread across the street into our group. So the\ngirl that was lucky was there and she picked it up, but the SS saw that she grabbed that bread\nand he started beating on her and beat on her and beat on her until she no longer could, you\nknow, so she fell to the floor. And we just walked away, and we never saw her. But that\nwould even happen if some girl would pick up...[ mean when we...when we wanted to pick\nup something from...that was laying on the road, that... that would have to be like, you know,\nthat the SS shouldn't see. You would have to look around and see because if they found you\npicking this up, you know, you were beaten up and it depended how strong you were\nwhether you can take that beating or you can't. So...uh...and the girls were starting to get\nweak. You know, after...after awhile, you just can't take that punishment, the physical and\nthe mental it's just...1t's just you can't go on. We were there for a long, long time...for a long\ntime going on. It was may...it was maybe 500 girls left at that time in our bunk...in our...in\nour,...uh...you know, in our group. And as weaker as we were getting, we were trying to...we\nwere trying to help each other sort of. So...the S...so the SS had one kitchen that the girls\nworked in...1n the kitchen, cooking for the SS people and us, we had another kitchen. It was,\nyou know, cooked soup. So there was a girl in..in my...happened to be in my bunk there. She\nhad a sister. She was lucky. She worked in the SS kitchen so, you know, she...she was\nsurviving all right. But her sister wasn't surviving too well. So she sneaked some bread and\nbrought it to her sister and they sort of...the Kapo caught her taking that bread to her sister.\nWell, they were both...both beaten up right there. And then they ordered all of us to come out\nand they took both of these girls and they hung them there on the gallows. I remember. I...I\nremember I still if I have nightmares, these faces come in front of me. If I think back on them\nI just, you know, I think they were trying so hard to survive and, therefore, they were\npunished. And they were so young. They were so young. And that was going on, but...uh....\nExcuse me. I don't want to do that.",
        "A: I'll take a little bit of water. I feel we were still perhaps treated better than a lot of them\nbecause we worked...because we worked, but still, you know, after awhile you just can't take\nit. You know, you can't take it. So again, I... couldn't get up in the morning anymore. And\nmy sister would come and just literally stand me up because she knew that if I'll remain in\nthe barrack that I'll just disappear...that, you know, she'll never see me again. So she would\nstand me up and she would hold me up for the hour that we would have to stay outside in the\ncold. It was so cold. And then she would drag me to work. She would actually drag me to\nwork. And she would do her work and she would try to do my work. And...uh...1t was...I just\nfelt that I am not going to make it there in the end. But then all of a sudden, it was a long\ntime. It was maybe nine months, a year, and we were already...we didn't look like people.\nWe looked, you know, with...with deep red hair. I...It was like an orangey red hair. Our\nbodies were yellow. We were very skinny. I weighed maybe 70 pounds, 60 pounds. You\nknow, I just didn't look human anymore and I was burned up with that gunpowder. It was\nhot. That gunpowder is hot. So I was...my body was burned with the gunpowder. And one\nday...one day they came...they let us stay inside. They didn't take us to work. So what\nhappened was they bombed. Every night when we were there, we were praying, praying they\nshould bomb this factory, this munition factory. Even though we were there, they never let\nus out when the bombing was going on. They never let us out. They just locked the doors.\nBut we...we didn't care. We almost felt well, you know, we...we won't live through it\nanyway, might as well go. But...uh...one day, it just so happened when we weren't there, that\nfactory was bombed. So that was the day when they gave us off. And next day they took us\nto...make... they told us that we're not going to work anymore in that. They didn't tell us it\nwas bombed. But they told us we won't...we won't be able to go there, but we're going to\nwork someplace else. So they took us to work on a road, to build a road. Which was better\nbecause on a road you were on the fresh air. And...uh ...you know, you tried doing as much\nas you can and even...you know, even if sometimes you got a...a...a whip, you could have,\nyou know, you...you sort of overcome it faster than working constantly in this poisoned\natmosphere. But still we worked on that road maybe...uh...you know, a...a few months and\nagain they locked us in. They locked us into this barrack. We were...we were very few left.\nWe were maybe 200, maybe 200 left. And...uh...we were locked in from the outside\nand...and nobody came at 4 o'clock to open up this barrack. So...uh...we...we got scared. We\nfigured what they'll do is just destroy us in this barrack. And...uh...nobody came and nothing\nis happening. The SS we don't...we looked through the cracks and we don't see a soul. And\nwe were there a day and a night. Nobody bothered us. Then middle of the day we see some\ncivilians came with a truck, with an open truck and they opened up our..uh.... you know,\nour...uh...barrack and they said that we weren't needed there anymore and they're taking us to\nanother place. So they put us on that open truck and as I said, we got there, there was maybe\nabout...maybe a thousand, twelve hundred girls. When we...when we left there, there was an\nopen truck full, maybe 200 girls, maybe. And they didn't tell us where we were going, but\nthey put us in that open truck and that was civilians. There...there were no SS men, and they\ntook us to Bergen-Belsen. When we got to Bergen-Belsen...uh...you know most of the\npeople would have to stay in. And we were thrown in in a barrack. My God! There were all\nkinds of dead people laying there and the smell of dead people...uh... People that lost their\nminds from all this going through already....uh...the way they looked. I mean we didn't look\nso good either because we...we were a different color. We were yellow and we had orange\nred hair. We...we... we looked like to them probably also like we're not from this planet.\nWell, anyway they were infected with typhus already. So we were laying there and...uh...also\ngot you know, we also got soup in the morning, but we didn't get the bread anymore in\nBergen-Belsen. And we were there for a few weeks, a month. Uh, my sister got sick. She\nwas the strong one and I was the sick one and she got sick. Evidently what happened she\nwas... she was infected with typhus. She got the typhus, got to her faster than to me. So she\nhad high fever and...uh...and I saw that she was talking deliriously. She...she...she no longer\nspoke, you know, normally and she was laying near the floor and she says to me, \"You know\n[...I see tanks coming down.\" And I thought she was sick. I thought she was sick. She was\ndreaming...she's delirious. I did...wasn't moving. I wasn't moving because....then all of a\nsudden, the noise from the tanks, that scared me actually. So I moved over to see through\nthese cracks and when we saw it was tanks and that was the English...the English with tanks\nand with cars and with trucks. And they opened up these barracks. And when they opened up\nthese barracks, you know, they were just staring at us there. We stared at them. A lot of\nthem...the...the girls that had the strength to get up did and were running over to these\nsoldiers. Prob...you know, probably a lot of them got scared because we looked so horrible.\nAnd a lot of them were sick, you know, going... So they were looking at us. We were\nlooking at them. We didn't know what to make out. We didn't know it was the liberation\narmy. We just didn't know. But they weren't hitting us, so we...we thought at least, you\nknow, they're not hurting us. And my sister...uh...was laying there. She..she wasn't happy.\nShe wasn't sad. And I was looking at my sister and I saw the end is coming to...you know\nhere. And then I looked at these people and I felt My God, there're not hitting us. Maybe\nthey can help us. But I saw that time is going out. So what happened was they took...you\nknow, after a day or so, they...they made hospitals, you know, on the premises. They took\nbarracks and they made like hospitals and they were trying to save the ones that are still\nbreathing. So they came and they picked...they came with these red, you know, there were\nlittle cars with red...red crosses and they picked my sister up and there here I wanted to go\nwith her but they wouldn't let me go with her because she was very sick. And...uh...they took\nher away. So, there I was by myself and I couldn't move too much, but the English were\nstarting to give us already at least food. And I couldn't eat. I couldn't eat much so I...I maybe\nwould eat a slice of bread, but I couldn't eat. But the people that could...you know, that they\nwanted to eat. They wanted to save themselves. They starting eating and then they got sick.\nThey got sick and they got diahhrea and oh, what was going on there. So finally when\n[...when I saw my sister isn't coming, I felt that I need to go and look for her. I... wanted to\ntake a walk. And there were, you know, there were mountains of corpse just laying there.\nBut what...what's happening when we got liberated, there were...uh...organizations like the\nHias, they asked us our names and so I figured...and we gave them our names. So I figured I\nam going to find my sister's name somewheres because when they had these mass graves\nafter the liberation, they had there a plaque with names, the ones they knew that they died\nafter the liberation. So I...so I went over to one big, you know, it was like a mountain with\ncorpses and I started reading hopefully that I will find my sister's name. At least I will know\nwhere she is, you know, and...uh...I didn't find it. And that's what I remember. I just\nremember all these corpse. This mountain of corpse. And I evidently blacked out because\nthat's all I remembered from there. What... Shall I continue?",
        "A: What they did after they got themselves a little organized is that they...they went around with\nthese cars and they picked up everybody that was breathing, hopefully that they will save\nand they probably picked me up but I don't remember where it was and how it was. I don't\nremember. But I was 1n this makeshift hospital for weeks with a high fever. I also got typhus\nand...uh...after a few weeks, you know, they did. I sort of...uh...was surviving. I was\nsurviving. And the first thing when my fever broke a little bit, my...my first question was,\n\"Where is my sister?\" So they started asking me...uh.... what happened to her? So I told\nthem that, you know, what happened. They came and they just, you know, she was very sick\nand they took her away. And after awhile, after, you know...uh...I remember it was a week or\nso, maybe more, somebody...and I was getting a little better, they came and told me that my\nsister did survive from all...from.... So anyway, then they right away reunited us. So we were\ntogether. So we were in that place still for a long time because we were very, very sick\nand...and that was in Bergen-Belsen in this makeshift hospital. And then all of a sudden they\ncame to tell us that...uh...1f we wanta go back to Czechoslovakia, we could go back to\nCzechoslavakia. But we were very weak and we were verty...uh...we just...we didn't know\nwhat we want. We didn't know what we want. And we knew we couldn't go there on our\nown because we were very weak, so we didn't go. So we remained in Bergen-Belsen. And\nthen the Swedish Red Cross offered to take in some survivors, the sick ones, the real sick\nones and...uh...they...they took us to Sweden. When they took us to Sweden...uh...we still\nlooked like...like corpse. We still didn't have hair and I was full of sores. Uh...And people\nwere coming over to...uh...to us...to...to...to comb...to...to touch us and we...we again would\nlook at them like: \"My God, aren't they afraid of us? Look how we look.\" They were very\nkind. They were... they were just very nice people. And we were in a hospital there. We were\nin a hospital. I remember they gave us root beer to drink and I didn't want to drink it and they\nsaid, \"No. Drink it. Drink it. That'll make you feel better.\" And, you know, a person that\nwants to survive, I was drinking the beer. So it's in Sweden where I really came to myself at\n..at... You know I felt again like I...uh.... am sort of human. And I think...uh...and, of course,\nat that time I was already, you know, a little bit older and I started looking at this world and\ntrying to figure it out, what had...what has happened. So picking up the pieces here and there,\nI recognized that we were there alone. We knew...at that time we already figured out what\nhas happened to my family. But up until then, to tell you the truth, we didn't allow ourselves\nto think that they would take all these kids that came with me to the gas chamber...my\nmother, my grandfather, my grandmother and the family that came with me, that these were\nthe ones who went to a gas chamber to be gassed for no sin committed. So that was difficult\nfor me in Sweden to deal with. (Sigh) They put me into a place where they start, you know,\nwe were... It was like a school. We worked a half a day and a half a day we...we studied. And\nlife was very good, but it was very sad. So we had some people talking to us and we had so\nmany questions. They...uh...they were doctors who were talking to us. They were very\ncareful on how they are letting us in on it, but still the bottom line was that we lost. We lost\neverybody. So my sister and I was left and then, again, they were trying...what they were\ntrying to do after the war is get families together and I remember...I remember a...when I was\nlittle that I had a sister that went to America. So they asked me do I know about a family. I\nsays, \"Yes, I had a sister, that she went to America and she lives in Brooklyn.\" And I gave\nthem their names. And...uh...they put our names in a paper in here...in the United States\nso...probably in the Brooklyn paper or whatever, and a friend called up my sister that\nshe...because my sister would talk about her family. She wonders whether she'll see them or\nanybody will be left or what's happening to us. And...uh...that friend calls her up and says,\n\"You know, I saw two names--Liebowtiz names--in the papers. Maybe you should call up\nthe Red Cross and they might be able to give you some information where they come from.\"\nAnd my sister did that and they were in touch with us. And...uh...after a short while they got\nus reunited. They brought us here to the United States. And this is how we...I got here.",
        "A: We came to Brooklyn and with my sister, and we lived with my sister for awhile and then, of\ncourse, I got married.",
        "A: My sister was here was married. Yes. Uh...what I have is a lot, you know, being that I\nspeak...I couldn't talk about it for a long time. I did not talk about it for a long time.\nAnd...and I...I think...I...[ made a decision when I had my first child that I will not talk about\nit. The reason why I didn't want to talk about it is because I was afraid I will talk about it so\nmuch. What I...[...1 am telling you is just highlights of certain days, not day by day.\nAnd...and to me it was if..1f my kids will hear what I have gone through that Hitler will get to\nthem too and I wanted sort of like save them from, from that and, therefore, I didn't talk\nabout it. I didn't talk about it. They...uh...they guessed. They... they knew that something isn't\nright because during the day I could control my emotion and I was busy. I was very busy. I\nworked. I was trying to raise a family and so I could control what's there behind my head, the\npast. But sometimes I would just go in and cried for weeks. That there was nothing to...I\ncould do stop and they always felt well did they do something. DId they annoy me? And I\nkept on reassuring that they didn't do. It's just that I just don't feel good when they were little.\nSo they knew that it...1t wasn't...that I wasn't sort of completely a normal.... It wasn't a normal\nsituation because they couldn't figure out why I would be like that. And then sometimes\nwhich you cannot control is the nightmares, you see. The nightmares you can't control.\nSo...uh...in the beginning we lived in a small apartment and...uh...you know the kids could\nhear me scream and my husband would wake me up. But at...but by the time my husband got\nme up...really got me up so I don't really that I should be up. It took a little while. In the\nmeantime the kids heard my screams. And so. But they knew that they cannot talk to me\nabout it. So this is how they knew what was happening, but I didn't talk about it.",
        "A: To my sister, it was very difficult. What happened was when we came here and we saw\nchildren on the street and they were free. They were running around and they played in the\nplaygrounds. And we say the people and they...you know, I keep on asking are they Jewish.\nAre they Jewish? Because I thought all the Jews...that happened to all the Jews. And they\nsays, \"Yeah.\" So, you know, we had to deal with that. You know that there are Jewish kids\nthat survived. And...uh ...1t...you know, it also...I...you know, I had to have help because of\nthe nightmares. The nightmares were terrible. The nightmares were very exhausting. And\nyou can't control them. You cannot control a nightmare. And, again, I stayed with my sister\nand she had two children. So it was like a...like a continuation. It was like a continuation of\nit. (long, long pause) So that's...that's the way I lived until, you know, I got married. I met\nmy husband and started having my own family. And...uh... I said I have to be strong\nand...uh...you know, I...[ made a comm... I feel I brought my children into this life that I owe\nthem something that I need to bring them up. And to tell you the truth, I was so many times\npast my...you know what what was passing my mind is I'll bring up my children that will be\ndifferent than the people with dealt with me because the people that dealt with me reacted\nlike not people. Not human! And I worry...I mean...I...I really thought about it all the time\nhow my kids will be brought up. Will they be different people? Will they be different? And\nI so much wanted them to be different than what I saw. So I think I concentrated on that a\nlot. I really did. I, because it was with me constantly. And I...1 was lucky. I..I...1 do\nhave...uh...1 brought up three children. I don't know if I should talk about them or I\nshouldn't?\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Okay. I think I would like to say now something of why I talk now. How much time do I\nhave?",
        "A: Already over an hour.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Is there something you want to ask me that I may be...uh... I was just telling you highlights.",
        "A: Well, what I would like to...uh...say is the reason why I...uh...decided talking about it\nbecause I really think it's important. I know I cannot bring back my family, my little brother,\nthe million and a half children that were destroyed, that were gassed, but perhaps maybe I\ncould reach some people that make them understand that this did happen and it can happen\nagain if we are not going to be if we are not going to be aware of our surroundings. I...I think\nthat every person...every person on earth should examine this, what has happened in the\nHolocaust because a thing like that can happen again and we need to watch that it shouldn't\nnever happen again to no minority, to no minority. And therefore I feel I need to get this\nacross to the world, maybe to...even to our future generation and tell them that this cruelty\nhas been done to people from other people and to watch out. I...uh...1 have nine\ngrandchildren and there're all great, but one of them is a little bit gifted and when I look at\nhim and I say to myself, \"I have so much hope in him that he might do something good with\nbeing that he's got so much ability, something good for society.\" And then when I look at\nhim and then I think of my brother, little brother and all these other kids, I say to myself,\n\"My God. Who knows what these kids would have been...what they would have\naccomplished if they would...1f they would be given a chance just to live...just to live.\" So\ntherefore I think every child on earth should be given this chance just to live and prove itself\nand not so brutally being destroyed.",
        "A: I also would like to add to this. I speak in the Children's Center and I come up with many\nchildren and they have many questions and I like children. Children are curious. And they\nalso come in with mothers or with some chaperons and I talk to them. So after I get finished\ntalking to the children, the parents or the chaperons come over to me and they ask me\nquestions. And the reason why I want to tell this little story is because I feel I reached a\nperson. A lady came over to me and she says to me, \"You know my father was a SS person\nand he said it wasn't that bad. So I looked at the lady and I felt that I need to get something\nacross to her and she should make her own mind on how bad and how good it was so I\nstopped for a second and looked at her beautiful children. And I said to her, \"You know the\nSS people were volunteers. They were volunteers. The SS were the people in Auschwitz that\nlived on the premises with their families. They had better housing and nobody threatened\ntheir lives. But they were...their job was to take innocent kids and older people ...sick people,\nall kinds of people, escorting them to the gas chamber. And then after the job was done, they\nwent home to play with their children. So what can I tell you. You'll have to figure it out how\nbad it was.\" And I could see...I really have a lot of respect for that lady that she was trying to\nfind the truth I feel. She was searching. She was trying to hear everybody. And I am hoping\nthat she found the truth and that she...uh...will be able to make decisions accordingly and for\nthe people around her you know that she...and with her children. I...I feel that it can be done\nwhen you raise children to bring them up and show them right from wrong because my kids\nthey would tell me always, \"Well, Mom when I grow up, you'll be so proud of me.\" I says,\n\"Honey, I am already proud of you, you know. You...you're the best and the finest.\"\nAnd...uh...we never told them what they should do in their lives. We never did because we\nfelt they are individuals and they need to do what they need to do. So the oldest...the oldest\none is doing research and even today, when she...you know, she does something\ngood...something comes across, she loves to share it with me. She says, \"You know, Ma, I\ntold you I will try, you know. We'll do something to better humanity.\" And...uh...my\nyounger daughter, she...uh...teaches children that have...uh...have a problem and she too tries\nso hard...I think she too tries so hard to...uh...to make me feel that she 1s doing something\ngood or right or whatever you would call it. And...uh...my son..our son...he...uh...he is a\ngastroenterologist; and so I feel like God took away a lot from me, but God gave me a lot\nback. And in...and what I wanted to achieve in life after the Holocaust I hope and I think I\nmaybe achieved it by looking at my kids, what they do. And...and you know, having my\ngrandchildren and they...they too are nice and hopefully, they'll...they'll do something good\nfor humanity and not for destruction.",
