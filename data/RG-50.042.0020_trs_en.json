        "LILY MALNIK\nFebruary 27, 1992\nBeep.\nI want you to tell me the story of how you ended up working for the factory owner, and giving a\nmanicure to the SS, so, you probably want to tell that you were in hiding in the country with your\naunt and uncle.\nI'm sorry, something just came out before we added our stock.\nIs it essential?\nI'm going to start while you guys are slating.\nBeep.\nI want you to tell the story of how you ended up working for the factory owner, and giving a\nmanicure to the SS. I want you to give sort of a one-liner context, maybe, my brother had mother\nhad already been taken, and I was in hiding\nwith my...uh huh. Okay. Uh, my family was taken already while I was convalescent in, in my aunt\nand uncles' home after uh, co-uh, ton-uh-tonsillitis operation, and uh, I had nobody but my aunt and\nuncle, and I stayed with them, and I acquainted people that lived next door to us, which uh, liked\nme very much, and they suggested that I should come and work for them while we were in hiding,\nand nobody will know that I am Jewish, and um, the Germans, when they invaded Belgium, took\nhis factory over, so uh, I was doing camouflage work in the factory, and the owner was very, very\nnice to me and was trying to help me so that we could stay in the apt and uh and, and live there and\na little bit of money I made there, I helped my aunt and uncle to buy groceries, and um, while I was\ndoing the work, at night, in the evening, there was another neighbor who knew I was Jewish, and\nhe had a beauty shop, and they uh, made connection with this uh, gentleman there, and, uh, asked\nfor me to go and work there, and learn the trade as uh, an apprentice to do manicuring. And, uh, so\nI was learning the trade in the evenings to be a manicurist. And, in the evening, I would practice\non, on the owner of the beauty shop, how to do the nails, and uh, one day, the owner from the\nfactory, told me, uh \"Lily, I request uh for you to do something for me. You, don't go to work in",
        "the beauty shop, but come into our apt and help me uh in the kitchen because we are entertaining\nGerman people, who uh control the factory, and, I said, \"How can I do that?\" I said, '\" They'll know\nI'm Jewish, and they'll take me away,\" and he says, \"Don't worry, I promise you, you won't come\nout of the kitchen. I'll come in and I'll give you orders in the kitchen, and you won't have to show\nyourself over there, and um, please do it,\" and I, I couldn't refuse the man, he was so nice to me,\nand he was trying to help me, so I said, \"Okay, I will.\" And I went uh, that night to his house,\nwhich was next door to our apt, and uh, and the dinner, everything went very good, and while I was\nfinishing up, he came in, and he says, \"Lily, please don't be nervous, but I told him that you were a\nmanicurist, and uh, one of the German officers, uh, would like, uh, are requesting for you to give\nhim a manicure.\" Well, I almost dropped dead right there because I was so frightened, and for an\nexcuse, I gave, I told him, \"I don't have my tools with me, I can't do it, and, and I'm scared, and and\nI will cut his fingers.\" So, uh, he says, \"Calm down. I have tools, and you'll go there, and uh, you'll\ngive him a manicure.\" I says, \"How can I? I'll, I'll, I'll be uh shaking all over.\" And, he, he\ninsisted I should do it. And, so, I went in, uh, there was nothing for me else to do. I went in, and\num, I spoke very little. I pretended um, I didn't understand what they were saying because they\nwere speaking German in bet-between themselves, and I gave him a manicure, and he gave me a\ngenerous tip he had. And how I didn't cut his, his uh, uh fingers, I don't understand to this day\nbecause I was a nervous wreck inside of me, and that was one of the m-terrible experiences that uh\nI had to experience before I even was caught in Belgium.",
        "Tell the story of the tenant, who denounced your aunt and uncle, how they left them, and you say\nthe factory owner had overheard the Germans come to search.",
        "Uh, in that same apt where I lived with my aunt and uncle, one night after work in 1n the um beauty\nshop, I came home, and my aunt and uncle were crying and were very upset, and they told me,\n\"Lily, we have to leave.\" Uh, some neighbors came and told us that uh, the new tenants that moved\nin uh, we lived in an apt bldg, and we each had apartments, so uh they found out that we were\nJewish, and they denounced us, and how it working to them, I don't know to this day, but they\nknew that that night, the Germans were coming to take us away, so I quick ran over to our next\ndoor neighbors, which was my boss from the factory, and I told him, and uh I, I, we were in\ndespair. He says, \"Take the keys of the factory. Tell your ma-uh, your aunt and uncle to go and\nhide there overnight. They can only stay there one night. You come and stay with us in our apt.,\nbut tomorrow morning when they leave, they should not come back to the apt, they should go out\nand find another place and never come back here.\" So, I went back to my aunt and uncle that\nevening, and I gave them the keys of the factory. I told my aunt and uncle to take whatever they\ncan with them, and stay in the factory overnight, and leave the next day in the morning, and I went",
        "to sleep over in um, my boss\u2019s apartment. Well, it didn't take long, maybe about midnight or | o\nclock, I really don't know what time it was, we heard the trucks come, and uh, the squeaking of the\ntrucks and they stopped, and it so happened that the apt where I slept, the wall of the bedroom was\nthe other side of the apt of our living room from my aunt and uncle. We heard them come up, we\nheard them go in the apt, we heard their screams and their hollering because they didn't find us.\nThey were very angry and upset. They were throwing the furniture all over the apartment. The\nwalls of the uh bedroom where I was sleeping was vibrating from the, from the uh banging and,\nand throwing the uh, the furniture around. And then they left. But, before that, the owner was so\nuh nervous and upset, he ran to the window and uh, he uh looked down, and the wife was so\nnervous and upset, she grabbed my hand, we were laying in bed, and she said, \"Lilly, please Lilly,\npray to your God that they shouldn't find us. And other wise they're going to shoot us and they're\ngoing to take you away. Please pray to your God, and, and, that your god should hear you, and\nthen she was hollering at her husband to get away from the window because she was afraid that\nthey would see him, and they would then come upstairs, but thank God, nobody saw us, and\nnobody told that I was there, and they drove off. And this is how they really saved my life,\nbecause I wouldn't have been here, because I was able to hide for 2 yrs like that, until uh, my aunt\nand uncle and I was caught.",
        "Uh, tell me that story how you got picked up.",
        "Well, um, when um, my aunt and uncle were in hiding, they went and found another neighborhood.",
        "The neighborhood was not a real good neighborhood. It was well, uh, low uh working people live.\nAnd, um, and they took um, one room uh, furnished, and uh, and they stayed in that little room,\nand uh, I befriended a friend who I worked with in the factory. She was a girl about maybe 2, 3\nyears older than me, and she liked me very much. When my aunt and uncle moved away from the\nneighborhood, and I was in despair, I didn't know where to go, and I mentioned it to her, I said, and\nshe knew I was Jewish, so, she says, \"Lily, don't worry. I'm going to tell my mother that you're\ngoing to come and live with me, with us.\" I says, \"How can I do this? I can't not, I cannot,\" they\nwere working people, they really, they had no money, and uh, I said, \"Your mother is not going to\nlike that. She says, \"My mother will, will do it for you.\" And so she asked her mother, and her\nmother agreed that I should come and stay with them. So, uh, the money that I was making, I gave\nto her mother to, for me to help with the room and board, but then naturally I started to worry about\nmy aunt and uncle, and I knew...",
        "We have to reload.",
        "Okay.\nBefore we do anything, let's get some room tone. That means just be silent...\nThe following is 30 seconds of room tone with air conditioning, rooftop ventilators are starting\nnow.\nEnd room tone. We're changing film now to Camera Roll 2, Sync take 3 1s up.\nBeep.\nWhy don't you pick it up, I think you were\nI was, I was nervous, and ,and uh, and worried about my aunt and uncle, and um, I decided one\nmorning on a Sunday, early, that I would go and visit them where they were in hiding. They\nnaturally did not know that I was coming, and I surprised them, and I came to visit them. Towards\nevening when I wanted to go back to um, the girl where, who invited me to stay with her, my uncle\nsaid, \"Leah, uh, Lilly, don't go back. Sleep over tonight, and uh, I am worried for you to go\nthrough this section because the man that lived around there in that neighborhood, in the evening, it\nwas summertime, and it was very hot, they would sit outside on the curbs of the street, and drink\nbeer, and look at everybody who's wal--and naturally they knew one another, and knew everybody\nwho lived in that neighborhood, so my uncle was worried for me to go back, and he said, \"Stay,\nalready here and sleep over.\" My aunt was very upset. She said, \"No, the people who are keeping\nLilly will worry where she is, and why she didn't come back. Let her go, and there is no bed here\nanyhow.\" So, my uncle wouldn't hear about it, and he says, \"I'll make a bed for her on the floor in\nthe kitchen.\" There was only 2 little rooms, and uh um, so and, so my aunt finally gave in, and I\nslept over that night, and early in the morning, I don't know what time it was, it was very early, I\nheard terrible banging at the, uh, at the door where I was sleeping at the head, and I jumped up\nfrom the floor, and I looked out the window, and there were the Germans with their rifles up the\nair, looking at the window, uh, 1n case somebody was trying to escape, they would shoot you, and I\nknew right then and there that we were caught, and this is how my aunt and uncle and I were\narrested, from um, Jette in Brussels, where I was hiding with my aunt and uncle.\nAnd so then did you get transported right away?\nNo, uh, they took us by truck from that little um, small apt, and uh, they took us to a jail in",
        "Brussels, which was uh, a lot of different little cells, and they packed us in, in, in each little cell, we\nwere very, very crowded. We couldn't even turn around, we were standing like sardines in that\ncell. I remember we couldn't breathe. The smell was terrible, and the screams and cries that came\nfrom the other uh cells was very uh frightening, and we were very bewildered and exhausted from\nstanding like this all day long, and finally at night, they took us out of those cells, and put us in\ntrucks, and they moved us away, and uh, after we travelled for a while, we arrived in a little town\ncalled Malin. Malin, wa-there was a detention place where they gathered all the Jews that they\ncaught from Belgium and they brought them to Malin, and they kept them there until they had\nenough people for a transport, and when they were ready to have the transport, they sent them away\nto the concentration camps, so I was in Malin with my aunt and uncle, I would say maybe 6 or 7\nweeks, I really have no idea how long I stayed there, it seemed to me a long time, and uh, when we\ncame in, uh, naturally they, uh, right away they said we have to give up all the jewelry and all the\nmoney, and all the uh whatever we had personal belongings, and if you don't do it, you will be hurt\nand you will be punished. And, uh, again we heard screams and cries and carrying on. Some\npeople in other places over there, they, behind doors, they were torturing for information, and um,\nand we were very, very frightened, and that's how we arrived in Malin, and we stayed there in a big\nroom and um, I found out afterwards that uh, Malin before the war was a, a Cassern??, which um,\num, from um, from horses and army, an armory, and that's, that place they uh, they turned it into\num, the detention place for the uh Jewish people that they caught, and from there, it was in the\nearly fall, we were transported to um the concentration camp, and we went into cattle wagons, and\nwe did not know where our destination was going to be. And, we left, uh for good, fr-from\nBelgium. And, I understand that uh, afterwards, that our was the 25th transport, which was the uh,\nthe 2nd last transport that left Belgium, and after that, Belgrum was liberated.",
        "Describe the transport and then the arrival part.",
        "The transport was horrible, just terrible, they gave us a ration of bread, and the children got a can of\nmilk, and we were herded in into cattle wagons. The cattle wagon that I ended up with my aunt\nand uncle was a coal wagon, so the fl-the floor from the cabin was black, and I don't know how\nmany people were in the cattle wagon, we uh, we were herded in with so many people, it was like\nin that other jail where we couldn't even sit or, or we had to stand up most of the time, and we\ncouldn't move. They gave us 2 buckets on each side of the cattle wagon to uh, to relieve ourselves,\nand before we knew it, the ca-the the, the uh, the pails were turned over, and we lay like this in that\ndirt, for, until we arrived into the camp, and uh, we couldn't breathe. There, there, there was no air,\nthere was a small little window with wires that were over the windows so that nobody could\nescape, and we went that like that for maybe 3 or 4 days, I don't know how many days we went, in",
        "between the, the, the, we were riding, the trains had to stop because the sirens would come on, and\nuh, and then they wouldn't ride the trains when the sirens were on, and then we would start again,\nand we, and people were getting very, very restless, and very nervous, and they got upset with one\nanother, because their tension of uh, of uh, of patience was running out, so they started arguing\nwith one another, and uh, and fighting, and there was noise, and all of the sudden, the German put\nhis rifle in, in the window and he was just shooting at, at bland, at people, and then he hollered we\nshould be quiet, and he shot 2 or 3 people that way, and we settled down, naturally, because we\nwere afraid that we were going to get shot. And this is how we arrived. And when we arrived it\nwas dawn, and I understand, the camp was called Birkenau. And in Birkenau, when I arrived, we\nwere so exhausted and so tired. I only had eaten the bread in the, in the train, and my aunt wouldn't\nlet me drink the mild because she thought I should save it for later, but I had to leave all my\npackages and the milk on the side because they told us to drop all our belongings, and I was so\nupset that I couldn't drink my milk, I remember, and uh, and then we went into a line, they told us\nto go into a line, and uh, we were facing Germans. The Germans were everywhere with dogs. The\nGerman Shepherd dogs, they were sniffing at us, and , and I heard screams because cert, uh certain\ndogs would attack people, and I would hear shots, but anyhow, we stayed in line, and as we came\ncloser to the Germans, I saw this tall man, which I didn't know at that time who he was, and he\ndirected us where to go, to the right or to the left. My aunt went to the left, and I had to go to the\nright. I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye to my aunt because I thought she was just going\nto register us, to give our names and identification, and afterwards I found out, when I went into the\ncamp, that she went to the left, and the left meant crematoria, which meant the ovens, and I was\ngoing into the concentration camp. This is how I arrived in Aush--in Bergen-Belsen. No, no, no,\nno, excuse me, I made a mistake, in Birkenau.\nWe're almost about to run out. I'll ask you a quick question. Who was the doctor and how did you\nknow who he was?\nI was told that the man who directed us from the left to the right, he, with his finger, he went to the\nright or to the left, and he was Dr. Mengele, and each time I, afterwards, when we saw him, we saw\ndeath in front of our eyes, because they called him the angel of death. When we saw him, we, we\nsaw, we saw hell, because we kn--we thought for sure we were going to die right there and then,\nbecause he sent everybody to the gas.\n(Loud background noise)\nI thought that was turned off.",
        "Beep.\nWhy don't you describe registration. Let's start with Fromm's?? selection, and also give your age at\nthis point in time. Describe registration and then.....\nWhat do you mean by registration.\nGoing in and getting processed.\nOkay, when we um, when we arrived, uh, in Birkenau after we went to the right, they um, took us\nto, they called in Amplausing, which was the bathhouses, and uh, we stayed there for hours after\nwe showered, and then they cut our hair, and uh, we gave them our name, although it di--that didn't\nmatter, I don't think, and uh, we stayed in the bathhouse for hours when it was freezing. The\nwindows were covered with ice, we couldn't even look out, and we were waiting for our clothes to\ncome back, and uh, and we stayed in a, in a tremendous big room with no heat, and we were wet,\nand uh, and we waited like that for hours, and finally when we got our clothes, they were not our\nclothes, they were inmate clothes, and we were hungry, and we were very exhausted because we\nhad no rest from the train trip, and we still had no food, and finally, that's how they brought us to\nthe uh barracks in, in Birkenau, and uh, and, and we had the bunks. The bunks were out of uh 3\nlayers, the bottom, the middle and the top, and I uh received a top bunk, and there were about 14\npeople on each layer sleeping, and when one had to turn over, we all had to turn over because we\nwere so packed and there was no room on, on, on the bunk to sleep, to make uh so that we could\nlay down. And, uh, uh, we were sleeping on straw mats, and the wooden planks, and the next day,\nthey called us back to the uh Amplausing house, in the, where the showers were, and they uh,\ntattooed us, and that was really the registration that we went through. And, uh, they gave me a\ntattoo, and my number was A-5143, and uh, I have to go back because um, we were the fi-only\n25th transport where they had given us this tattoo, and then the next day they called us back and\nscratched it out, and gave us that new number, because they made a mistake. Uh, I understand it\nwas because those people were dead already, I was told, and they told us we should never answer\nour name, by our name, from now on we are uh this number, this is our name. And, I don't have to\ntell you the terrible feeling I had in my heart when at my age, of a girl of 15 years old, that you are\ntold that your name is number, forget your name, you don't have a name anymore, that you had to\nshave it off, and you're hungry, and you have no clothes, and you're freezing, and your family is\ntaken away. It was very hard for me to accept that (starts crying), and yet I don't know how I made\nit because I got a hold of myself, and I pushed all this behind me, and I says I have to live, and I",
        "have to be strong, and at that young age, I felt like I was 90, I felt I had a lifetime already in those 2\ndays that I arrived in Birkenau. That was my first 2 days there with the rest of the inmates that\nmade it with me because their families also went to the right, and we had decided the young girls\nthat were left, that we should all stay together and try to survive together because our families were\ntaken together to the ovens, so they said, \"Let's us all stay together. Together we will be strong,\nand we will make it, we will lick them, they will not kill us, and we will come out and be free. Just\nlet's hope till the war is ended, and, and that's what we tried to do, until we were deported from\nAuschwitz, but we, we stayed together all, and, and that gave us strength to survive.",
        "Talk about volunteering for hard labor. Talk about some of the ways that you could take ------------\n--to survive.",
        "Well, we found out in Birkenau, that if you were idle, you were going to be taken by the trucks, and\nsent to the crematoria. So we volunteered any job that came up, and in the beginning when we,\nwhile we were in Birkenau, the uh, the jobs were very, very hard, and I don't know what they were\ntrying to make us do, but we were carrying big rocks, tremendous stones, they told us to go from\none hillside to the next with those rocks, and we had to carry them. We had no gloves, we had no\nworking clothes, and we scratched our bodies from the scraping of the rocks and we carried them\nback and forth, and our backs and feet were aching us with no food, no water, and we did this all\nday long, and whoever fell and couldn't do it, they just whipped and the dogs were walking next to\nus, and one day a German officer came and told the block ----------, which is the woman in charge\nof the barracks, that he needed a group of people to work in a kitchen in another camp. And the\nBelgian girls I was with, we all decided to volunteer, and to uh try and uh be picked for that job.\nSo, we stayed in the uh roll call, and uh, and we looked the German straight in the face, uh, funniest\nthing is that uh, uh in the, the, or inside of us, it, it, 1t told us when we should not look at the\nGermans or when we should look them straight in the face, and show them that that, here we are,\nwe want that job, and instinct told us when to do that and when not to, so we looked him straight in\nthe face, the German should pick us, and sure enough he took the whole row of those Belgian girls\nthat we were with, and uh, and we were picked for that job. And, uh, because if we were going to\ncontinue to do this volunteer work in Birkenau with those rocks, we were going to die, and, and we\nthought any job would be better than that. And this is how we arrived in Auschwitz. And, um,\nAuschwitz was maybe 3-4 miles away from uh, Birkenau. I really have no idea how far it was, the\ndistance, but that was a new camp that opened up, and we were put into -------------, which means\n\"to be concentration camp.\" And we went into the kitchen. The old people who worked there uh\nshowed us and taught us the uh, how to go and two, two girls were um were picked for each stove\nor uh kettle, which meant there was big tremendous room in that kitchen, and they had uh maybe",
        "uh 25-30, I have no idea how many big ovens with uh, uh round big tremendous ovens, and we\nwere supposed to do the cooking in them. And, um, we scraped those ovens, and we put the ovens\non, and um, the fire, and uh, we had to make the soup, and then we had to make the coffee, and uh,\nthe coffee w-and the food after we did it, we filled a big tremendous pail, uh, there were big army\npails. We had to carry them out uh 2 by 2, and it was very, very heavy, and the labor was just as\nhard as those tremendous rocks that we were dragging, and I, I thought I was going to do, I, I cried\nmyself to sleep every night because I thought I couldn't do that hard labor. First of all, I was so\nyoung and I,and uh malnutrition, but we thought when we , we heard kitchen, working in the\nkitchen, that we would have extra food, and that will give us strength, and, and, and we were trying\nto buy time to survive. But, sure enough, we got used to the hard work, and I learned to carry those\nhard big heavy buckets of pails, and carry them out into the camp so that the uh, uh inmates could\ncarry them to their barracks, and uh, and this is how we worked there for about 4 or 5 months, in\nthe kitchen with the Belgian girls.\n-------------------------(Sandy says something).\nChanging film, camera roll 4 1s up, sync take 5 is up.\nBeep\nCan you tell me about the transports, what you saw and what you knew about them, who came on\nthem and what happened to them.\nThe transports in Auschwitz?\nYeah.\nTransports were coming in day and night, constantly. The only thing that I knew of is the people\nthat came into the camp, once they were in the camp, uh, they were, they were safe enough to live\nthrough until they were transported to another ca-camp, and each one of them was directed to\ndifferent works to do in the, while they were in the camp. Once you had to go to the left, they were\nput on the truck. The children, the old people, the sick people, some people uh, they would\nwhisper, the inmates who uh received us at the dock, at the, as we came off of the cattle wagon,\nthey had taken inmates and, and to direct us what to do, put the packages down, stay in line, don't\ncry, don't do this, don't do that. Keep your child, they would say, they would whisper to us, nobody\nshould see, give your child to an old lady, we didn't know what they were talking about, and some\nmothers wouldn't give up their children, so Dr. Mengele who told them to go to the right and the",
        "left, would tell the mothers with the children to go to the left, and uh, and this 1s how uh there\nended up in the trucks, and, and they were sent to the crematoria. The crematoria, there were 6 of\nthem, that was burning day and night, and uh, at the end there was 5 because one was broken, and\nuh, when the trucks uh, was filled up with, with the people, the uh, they, we had our orchestra with\nuh inmates that they formed and the orchestra was accompanying the trucks with music while they\ndrove off, so that, I presume, I don't know why, what the orchestra was doing there, but I presume,\nto make the people not scared or they shouldn't panic, and, and this is how they went to their death,\nwith the music, going to the crematoria, saying that they were going to shower, and uh, and go into\nthe concentration camp. They went in thinking they were going to take a shower, and uh, and go to\nthe camp, but they were gassed and then burned. And this is what I found out when I came into,\ninto the concentration camp, and how I worked there, and, and, and I knew all this was going on\nand, and one time, a transport of Hungarian people came, and I understand, I was told that these\npeople had no food for 2 days, and they put them in 2 barracks, and they had no food, and they\nwere going to send them to the crematoria. I don't know how uh ,uh, this was uh, uh told to me, but\nthat was the word that was wor-went around in the camp, and they didn't know that. And, I felt so\nterrible for them, I felt like I had to do something to make, at least they shouldn't be hungry before\nthey die, so I s--I made up my mind, I didn't tell anybody, I had made up my mind to steal a bucket\nof boiled potatoes because we always cooked one day in advance, and I filled that bucket up with\npotatoes, and at night, I risked my life because I could have been shot, we're not supposed to be out\nof the barracks at night, after a certain hour, and I went into one of--I snuck in to one to, one of\nthose barracks, and quietly I gave a potato to each inmate in the beginning of the uh bunks, as I\ncame in, and uh, not realizing, I, I started a terrible commotion because all of the sudden they\nfound a potato in their hands, and so people started screaming, they wa-and ripping me apart, they\nwanted a potato because they hadn't had food for so long, and when I was almost half empty with\nthe potato pail, the lights all of the sudden turned on, and the Block Eldester, which is the uh, the, I\nmentioned before, the uh, person in charge of that barrack. She says, \"What are you doing here?\"\nAnd, I got caught, so I said, \"I'm giving some potatoes away to the people.\" She says, \"Give me\nthat pail. Do you know I could have you shot right now?\" She says, \"and get back to your\nbarracks.\" So, she uh, she took the potatoes away from me, and I had to naturally leave and I was\nlucky that she didn't turn me over to the Germans, because I would have been terribly punished, or\nGod knows what would have happened to me for what I did, not realizing how I could have really\nrisked my life for to do something like that, but I felt so terrible knowing what was going to happen\nthat these people were condemned, and that they were going to die, that I wanted to do something\nto, to, to help a little bit to do something, and, and, and, and the next day when I got up in the\nmorning the 2 barracks was empty, and they were gone, and that was a terrible experience for me.\nThe Gypsies went right away from the transport, they didn't even go into the camp, they sent them",
        "right to the oven. And the old people like I said, and children, I understand, afterwards, that\nchildren up to 16 years were sent away. Luckily when I arrived in, in the camp, I always looked a\nlittle bit older because I was tall, and I was developed, and evidently Dr. Mengele made a mistake\nwith my age, because uh, he probably thought I was older otherwise I would have gone to the\novens too. And uh, God was with me. That I survived that.",
        "Talk about the suicides of those who gave up, and how you felt yourself and what you used to do.\nEvery once in a while ------------human beings, we have ups and down feelings. As much as we\nfought them and we tried to keep our morale up, but there were times where it was so low that we\ncouldn't bear anymore, and we would break down, and being that we stuck together with the\nBelgian girls, there was so many different nationalities in the camp, it was a melting pot. There\nwere Russians and Poles and Belgians and Frans, French and Holland and German people and\nCzechoslovakian and Hungarian, we were all mixed together, but each one of these different\nnations who, whoever they were formed little groups and they, and they were like little families,\nand this is what gave us the strength to go on and to push and to lift--to survive, so naturally, uh,\nevery once in a while when somebody could not make it, we would get up in the morning and we\nwould find one or two people who would end their lives at the wires, because the wires were\nelectrocuted. It wasn't too often, but I did see about 3 or 4 in the in the time that I was in\nconcentration camp in Auschwitz, that I did see about 3 or 4 dead people that were clung to the\nwires because they could not stand it anymore, and they had to end their lives. And, and one of\nthose time, it w-it was my turn where I almost wanted to end my life because it, I was for hours\nstanding in appel, that day. Appel means roll call, like you do in the army, and being that it was\nwinter time in Auschwitz, it, 1t was a terrible cold. I don't know what the degree was but we were\nin, in constant uh, uh cold terrible weather, and everything was icy, and the, we were always in\nmud in Auschwitz, but that particular day we were standing on ice, and uh, we were standing for\nhours in appel because they uh was, there was one person that was missing, and not until they had\nthe right count could we go into the barracks. And, uh, uh, I don't know what happened, we were\nstanding there for hours in roll call, and I was turning blue, and I couldn't, I, the cold got to me, to\nmy heart, and finally, after they let us go, I passed out. The girls were holding me while I was\npassed out because if I would have fallen down, that would have been the end of me. They would\nhave dragged me away, and I would have gone on the wagon out from the camp and into the oven.\nSo, they held me up, and when I came to, I was in the barrack. I was frozen. I was blue. Uh, they\nwere working on me to massage me. Uh, we happened to be uh mixed with some Polish uh\nChristian people, and they, in, in the same barrack when I was working in the kitchen, and those\npeople were at the end, and they had the better spots in the um barrack. They used to sit around the",
        "oven because there was one long um brick uh chimney, I don't know how to call it, it was a long\none, and at the end there was a little oven. That was supposed to heat the whole barrack, but they\nonly had it on for maybe a 1/2 an hour in the morning and the rest of the, of the day it was cold,\nbut the Polish people...\nWe've got to reload.\nBeep.\nThe Polish people were also inmates, just like we were, but they had better um, um, they were not\ntreated like the Jewish people were, and uh, they resented us there because, in a way they were\nantisemitic too, they didn't, they didn't like the Jews either, so they were knocking us around in, in,\nin the barracks. And, they always hovered over that tiny little oven, there was always uh, uh\nfightings going on because we wanted to warm us our ourselves also, and they would push us\naway, but when they brought me in, as much as they didn't like the Jews, for some reason, they uh,\nmade room for me, and they uh, let me go near the oven so I should warm up, and they were\nworking on me, and uh, uh, uh massaging me, so when I came to, I don't know what came over me,\nI was so, I was exhausted, I was cold, I was frozen, and I wanted to give up right there and then. I\nwas terribly emotionally upset, and I started to cry, couldn't stop, and, and I wanted to end it right\nthere, and I screamed that I was going to run to the wires, and naturally everybody stopped me, and\nuh, the next day I felt much better, and uh, and this is how we made it in in the camp of Auschwitz\nbecause when uh you were down, your friends tried to pick you and lift you up, and the next day it\nwas my friend's turn, and then I worked on her, and tried, and helped her to bring her morale up,\nand this is how we survived, we played it day by day, we could never, we never knew what the\nnext moment was going to bring, and we never knew if the next day or next hour we were going to\nbe whisked away by the trucks with the Germans, and the dogs that would come in and chase us on\nthose trucks, and, and then to the ovens. And, and that's, that's how we lived there. The 4 or 5\nmonths that we lived there wasn't months, to us it was 5-10 years. To us every day was, was a\nyear, that we lived through in, in, in Auschwitz, and in the camp.\nDid any of you, or did you see any acts of resistance of any sort or sabotage?\nNo, I did not see any of that, but, I will answer your question. It was impossible for us to do this\nbecause we had no weapons. They had the weapons. They would shoot us like we were dogs, and\nuh, we had no weapons, we were weak, and you, you couldn't fight, fight an army with bare hands,\nbut I feel that every day that we lived in concentration camp and we survived it, to me was a",
        "heroism uh by itself, because we made it and we survived this terrible life we had there, and by\nresi--by this we resisted Hitler to show him that we are here to, to stay, and he could not finish the\nrace of the, of the Jewish people, and I feel by that, we resisted. And, and, and it was very uh, uh,\nheroism right there and then, with our bare hands we, we, we tried to fight for our lives, and, and, I\nthink that is your answer right there.",
        "What about religious resistance? Was there religious resistance?",
        "Well, some people were religious and there was no way we could uh, uh, uh, uh say prayers so we\nsaid it to ourselves, whoever was religious. Uh, the food was only a piece of dry bread and the\nsoup, and the water that we could drink there which was nothing but rust anyhow, that came out of\nthe spicket, but uh, uh , if anybody wanted to pray, so he said it to himself or, they laid in bed, in, in\nthe bunks, and they prayed. Um, I myself, I questioned God because uh, I was very religious when,\nuntil I came into the camp...because my grandmother raised me and she was a orthodox old lady,\nand uh she made me say the prayers every morning, and um, when I came to camp and I saw what\nwas going on, and I saw I was living in hell, I said, \"Where is heaven?\" and, and, and \"Where is\nGod? How can he see what goes on here, in this, in this terrible hell, and let 1t happen?\" So, I\nquestioned God, as young as I was, and, and, I was terribly hurt, and, and I says, \"There must not\nbe a God, otherwise that wouldn't happen.\" I was, I would sneak out of guar--out of the barracks at\nnight in Auschwitz, and I was risking my life by doing that because we had towers, watchtowers\nwith the Germans with the rifles, and if they would see something in a shadow they would shoot\nright away, but yet there were times when I had to be all by myself, and, and, and be with my own\nthoughts, and I would sneak out of the barracks when nobody knew, and ev--I thought everybody\nwas sleeping, and I would go all the way in the back of the camp, and it, it, 1t seemed that I like that\nvery much, to be by myself, and I would look up at the sky because I would feel, that was the only\nfree thing I could look at, that was out in the open, above the wires, and I would talk to the stars,\nand I would say, \"Where is God? Why does, is he punishing us like that? And, and how long will\nthat go on?\" And I would talk to the stars and I would say, \"The stars are looking down at us in the\ncamp, and they see what is happening, and the same stars are shining to the outside world, where\npeople are free, and they can do what they want to do, and, and be happy, and live a wonderful life,\nand we live here in a hell, and we don't know from moment to moment if we're going to live or die,\nand, and, and not to be human beings, worse than animals. A dog is taken better care of than we\nare. And how come the free world is allowing all this, and is not stopping this terrible thing that\ngoes on at this time of, of uh in civilization.\" And, and then, naturally the answers were never\nanswered to me, and after I cried myself out real good, I would sneak back into the barracks, and\nlife would start all over again in the morning with the terrible work that I had to face, and, and",
        "hunger.\nTell me about the death march. How did that happen?\nWhen Russia was coming close to Auschwitz, word came that we were going to be evacuated, and\nthat is the, at that time , we were separated from the Belgian girls. The only, was one young lady\nwhich was one year younger from me. Her name was Christian. She was the only one that stayed\nwith me, and I promised the rest of the girls that I was going to watch out for her. And, uh, and\nthat's how we left the concentration camp of Auschwitz. And we started marching, and we\nmarched for days, and, and uh, I have no idea how many days we marched, and also uh, a couple\ntimes we went into wagon cars again, and then, we had to get off of them, and start walking again,\nand it seemed that to each camp we arrived, they were already overfilled with people because they\ncondensed the camps as the Russian were coming closer, and there was no room, and uh, we were\njust exhausted on the road because um, we had very little food, and we were just exhausted from\nwalking, and a lot of people, while we were walking through Poland, we uh, tried to escape,\nthinking that they could speak the language, the Polish language, and they would run away, but we\nused to hear shots all through the marching as we were walking, we heard shots and we heard\npeople being shot, and we saw how the people were falling in the ravines, ravines, in the ditches,\nbehind trees, behind shrubs, on hills, it, it, it was like a war zone, with wounded people, and, and,\nand dead people all over on both sides of the roads, there were dead people who were trying to\nescape, and also for people who couldn't keep up with the march, because as we walked and we got\nexhausted, and our feet were killing us, and people were falling behind, and the Germans were\nshooting everybody who couldn't keep up with the death march, and this is the reason why they\ncalled that the Death March, because that so many people died on that road before they arrived into\na concentration camp, and this is how I arrived in Bergen-Belsen from that death march.\nEleven seconds to run out.\nChange film, camera roll 6 is up, sync take 7 1s up.\nBeep.\nI want you to talk to me now about your friendship and your caring for Christian?? and what that\ngave you and what it gave her. I just want you to think back on how important that relationship\nwas, and how it helped you or hurt you, whatever it did.",
        "Christian was a very sweet young naive little girl. And, I actually grew close to her because of her\nuh, to me she was a young child, as young as I was, but I felt that she was a baby, and uh, I worried\nover her, and uh, she was my sister I didn't have that I lost. And, uh, she does not know why she\nwas taken. I'll be very honest, I think they made a mistake with her. I think she didn't even have a\nJewish name, I mean, Christian, I don't know of any family, of any Jewish family would know uh,\nwould name a, a girl by that name because it's a gentile name, it's not a Jewish name. Anyhow,\nChristian does not know, did not why she was caught, she was picked up in the street, and uh, she\ndidn't know why she was in camp, and she came from France, so we spoke French always, and she\nwas very um, she was helpless, and I was the strong one, supposed to be (laughs), so I took care of\nChristian as much as I could, I watched over her. I urged her where she had to go to work with me,\nand uh, I was her mother, and maybe that, in turn, gave me the strength to go on, because I worried\nover her. Our, I kind of, uh realized that afterwards, I didn't see it at that time, and I didn't\nunderstand it, but afterwards, I put kind of 2 and 2 together, and thinking that because I worried\nover her, I had to be strong to watch over her, and that gave us the chance to survive as long as we\ncould. And, so, that's how we were in Bergen-Belsen. I watched over her over the march, and\nurged her to keep on walking because she wanted to fall behind, and I knew she would be shot, so\nI kept pushing her. There were times where I was angry and scolded her, and that's how she kept\nup, but then at the end, towards the end of the liberation, before that, Christian got sick because\nAuschwitz, I mean Bergen-Belsen was just terrible. It was just the opposite of Auschwitz. In\nAuschwitz we had to work in order to survive, and in Bergen-Belsen we were sitting idle; there\nwas no work there. And, the decay of the camp was terrible. The whole camp stunk and was dirty\nand was full of decay, and uh , typhus, and this is how Christian got sick and got the typhus and got\ndelirious, and uh, one night she was so delirious she uh saw her parents in front of her eyes, and she\njumped up from the ground because we were sleeping on the bare floors, and she saw her family\nand she started running to her family she thought, and she only was stepping on the sleeping people\nand made a whole big commotion, and I naturally tried to calm her down, and uh, while I was\ntrying to calm her down, the uh, the woman in charge of the barrack came and with a stick started\nbeating on me because I was making a commotion, we were not supposed to be speaking, it was\nsupposed to be quiet at night, and she hit me so hard until the um stick was broken, and naturally I\ncouldn't budge for 2 days. I was all broken up and bruised, and as sick as Christian knew she knew\nsomething was wrong and because she, she did not give me any problems those few days, and\nnaturally Christian got worse and worse, and um, Christian died of Typhus in my arms. I was\ntrying to nurse her with a teaspoon of sug, of uh, black coffee that I had gotten after standing for\nhours at, at the kitchen, maybe somebody would take pity on me and give me some coffee. I was\nhoping somebody would recognize me in the uh kitchen because I worked in the kitchen in\nAuschwitz, and um, it happened twice where somebody gave me a little bit of soup, and then one",
        "time a little bit of coffee, and I would run back to the barracks, and, and feed it to Christian, but\nChristian could not make it, she failed me, and she died in my arms, and uh, when she died, I put\nher down, and I pretended she was asleep, and I covered her up because people knew that she was\nsick, and I did not tell that she was dead for after 2 days because I wanted to have her ration and her\nfood, and I pretended she was asleep, and then I was afraid that they would discover that she was\ndead, and that she would start smelling, and uh, I told the uh, block eldester, the lady in charge that\nChristian died, and they uh took her away. They took her away in Bergen-Belsen they did not take\nthe people and burn them or put \u2018em, or bury them, they just piled them up outside of the barracks\nin front of our door, and the pile was as high as 6 or 7 feet of corpses in, in front of each barracks\nwe lived with the dead people, and this is where Christian was. And for days, I could not look at\nChristian because I knew she was laying there, and one day, my guilt was bothering me so because\nI knew she was there and I wouldn't look at her, I decided to go see her. And when I looked up at\nher, I saw Christian, but something worried me and puzzled me, and I didn't know what was wrong,\nand I said uh, somebody stole her skirt, and she was laying from waist down, naked as a skeleton,\nwhich they called in Au--in Bergen-Belsen was a musselman, which meant uh, before you died\nyou were skin and bones, you looked like a musselman which was a skeleton, and she was a\nskeleton laying there, and she had a navy blue jacket, but the navy blue jacket wasn't blue, it was\ngrayish or white, and it puzzled me, I says, why would somebody steal a skirt and change a jacket\nfrom a blue one to a white one, and not take everything and just leave it there, so I leaned over\ncloser to the pile of the dead people, and there I saw that Christian blue jacket was covered with\nterrible lice. The lice was a big as the black ants that you see sometimes in ground, and they were\njust crawling all over Christian's body and the jacket, and, and that made that blue navy jacket\nwhite, and I couldn't take it anymore, I almost fell on the dead, on the dead people myself, I was in\nsuch shock. And I just ran away because I, I was in terrible shock, I, I, I saw the terrible lice eating\nher up, and it it was just too much for me to take, and I never looked at Christian again. And I was\nso disillusioned, and I was so in despair that to see that beautiful young girl who never even knew\nshe was Jewish ended up in concentration camp and dying like that. (Cries) And then, I think that's\nwhen I gave up trying to fight for my life, and I came down with the typhus. And I was very, very\nsick, besides being sick with typhus, I had a terrible accident in, in the barracks at the end and I was\nbruised on my leg here, and my leg was on fire because it was like a terrible big bump that I had\nthere, and my f--my foot was on fire; between my foot and, and the typhus and the fever, I almost\ndied. And this is how the camp was liberated from that um, at, at that time, and um, they um\npicked me up and wrapped me up in a blanket, and they took me into the uh showers, and the\ninmates, the Germans that they caught, they made them uh put white uniforms on and, and they\ntook care of the inmates who were very, very sick, who needed care right away, and they had built\na hospital outside of uh, uh Bergen-Belsen to uh put those terrible sick people and to help them to",
        "uh bring them back to health, and this is how they wrapped me up in a blanket and showered me\nand cleaned me, the German SS did that, and then brought me into that uh hospital, and uh, I\nunderstand, um, Canadian doctor who looked at my leg, and I could see in his face that my leg was\nterrible, and he said, uh, he had a translator, and in French, they told me they were going to try and\nsave my leg, and um, afterwards I found out that I had gangrene in my leg, and he almost\namputated that leg, and I was still fighting for 2 months in that hospital because I still had the\ntyphus, and this is in the conditions that they found me. I don't know if I weighed 65 pounds when\nI was liberated, I was more dead than a live. And, maybe another week, I would have been gone,\nand I would have never survived it. And, it took me...\nWe just ran out.\nBeep.\nCan you talk about the things you remember from your senses, like smells, like sounds. Are there\nthings vivid in your memory from those times??\nCertainly, a few, uh, when we arrived in Auschwitz, it was always damp. The sun never shone\nthere. It was never shining, I never, may-maybe if it, if I saw it maybe 2, 3 times was the most, in\nall the months I was there. It was always muddy and damp and the grounds were always covered\nfull of mud. We smelled a terrible smell because of the ovens from the crematoria, and at certain\ntimes depending the weather, the climate, the winds, we all, all also would have ashes falling down\non us. And when, tell you the truth, when Polish people say, who lived around Auschwitz, that\nthey did not know, they wouldn't, when they denying, they say they did not know what went on in,\nin Auschwitz. I know they're lying because if we smelled it, I know they smelled the terrible flesh\nof the people being burned, and this is what I remember in Auschwitz, and that's why I say It was a\nliving hell over there. I remember as a, as, as a young girl one time, seeing a terrible movie, and it\nlooked like cave people living, and they were slaves, and they were living in caves, and for some\nreason, I compared Auschwitz with that movie because we lived instead of caves, it was\nAuschwitz, but we liv--we lived in uh in the mud like they did, and the fire and the ashes, and the\ngrey color of uh, of the sky was down on us, they never saw the daylight. Neither did we. And, uh,\nI thought I was part of that movie, that uh, and, and that was hell to me. And I used to think, if I\never die, no matter how bad of a person I will be, which I don't think I am, but if ever I am going to\nbe a bad person, and if there is a God, if he's going to punish me, I will never go to hell, because\nI'm living it already, I've been in hell, so I know I will go straight to heaven, I always used to think\nthat, and to this day I really think that still because I've been there already. That's one of the",
        "feelings that I have. Now, in Bergen-Belsen, the decay and the dirt and the dead people we lived\nwith because there we lived with the dead people, and the terrible uh, terrible odor we lived with\nbecause there was no toilets there. They had made ditches, and we had to go in the ditches to uh, to\nurinate there, and to, to do our bowel movements, and it was never covered, and it stayed like this\nfor months, and this is why people were dying like flies. And every day, there's not a day that\ndoesn't go by even now, to this day, that there isn't something that reminds me of concentration\ncamp. And if I go on a train, and if I go on a trip, and I hear the doors being slammed, I am back in\nthe cattle wagons because I hear the motion of the trains, and I hear the doors being slammed\ntogether, and if I go for a joyful trip to New York for a wedding or a bar mitzvah or a show in the\ntheater, and before we get into New York, and we get into New Jersey, and I see the, see the\nfactories with the tall chimneys with the fires, I see the crematories. I will never forget that. I lived\nwith the dead people all the time. I might laugh on the outside and I might have a good time, and\nthe people don't know what goes on in my heart because I came from hell. And if I hear a siren,\nI'm back in Belgium, and I'm back in the basement trying to protect ourselves from the bombs.\nBut your same heart kept you alive in that hell, didn't it?\nThat same, because of my youth, I feel. The will to live, I was not ready to die, and I am the only\none who survived of my whole family who went into concentration camp. I was the youngest, and I\nwas the youngest that came out. And the reason I feel I am the one who survived was because of\nmy youth. I had the strength to go on, and also because I was taken two years after my whole\nfamily was taken. My family was taken in 1942, I lost them all. And, I was taken in 1944. My\naunt was unlucky, she had to go to the right, by Dr. Mengele, he told her to go to the light, t-to the\nright, and me to the left, and that's and this is why she, she died. And my uncle never, he was, he\nwas taken to the men's camp, and I never heard of him afterwards. I had one more aunt that lived\non in hiding in Belgium. My mother's sister. And, for some reason or another, when word came to\nme in Auschwitz when Belgium was liberated, I had made up my mind right there and then, I knew\nthat my aunt Sarah was alive with her two children, and uh, I was so happy for her, but I cried\nmyself to sleep in the bunk feeling sorry for myself that I was in Auschwitz. But, I did not stop to\nthink and realize that God forbid, she could have been caught and sent to another camp. I didn't\neven want to think about that. And sure enough, when I was liberated, she found me in Belgium.\nTalk about how important cleanliness was to you, and what kinds of things you did to try to keep\nclean under those awful conditions. Clean, very much I was not, to be very honest with you. In\nAuschwitz, I kept clean, very clean because we were able to shower as much as we knew that the\nsame showers were giving gas to the people, but we were a little bit privileged because we worked",
        "in the kitchen, and the German people are very clean, so they would order us to go every so often\nand shower in the showers, and we knew that we were going to be showered, so we were not\nscared, although you never knew what, what they had, kind of tricks they had up their sleeve, but\nwe risked it. So, in Auschwitz it wasn't too bad for me to keep cleanliness, and for a piece of\nration, I would exchange for a piece of soap, so I could wash and keep clean, but in Bergen-Belsen\nit was a different story. Bergen-Belsen was just terrible. I, I say even a animal, a dog, does, is, is\ncleaner. We, it was just terrible. The decay and the smell, and the odor that was going on, and we\nhad no water to bathe, and there was uh, uh, there was a sink there with some um, the spickets at\nthe barracks, which was, it, it the water was not even running fl-fluently, 1t was just drip, drip, drip.\nAnd you couldn't do nothing, you had to hold it like this to have a little bit of water, and then it\nwas all red, it was all rusted because the pipes were all terrible rusted up. And, we, we couldn't\nwash, we couldn't bathe, and we were covered with lice, we just couldn't help it, and from the lice\nwe got the terrible typhus and diphtheria, and from, this was a terrible sickness, we couldn't control\nit, and we had accidents and we couldn't wash ourselves, and this is how we lived. In this terrible\nconditions in Bergen-Belsen.\nHow do you want the people you lost to be remembered?\nWhat can I tell you? How, how can you describe a whole family of 58 people or 60 I don't know\nexactly how many we were, who died in vain for nothing, only because of one reason, because they\nwere Jews, who were not even, they did not even belong to a political party. They were minding\ntheir own business trying to make a living for their families, living in peace, a loving family in\nBelgium who worked hard to survive, not to be burdens to the country, and for no reason to be\npicked up middle the night and to be taken on trucks and trains and cattle cars and to be uh, uh, uh\nbeaten up and, and, and then dying concentration camps in, in ovens, what do I tell my children?\nH-how, how can I describe my family that I dearly loved, and I was taken away from them at the\nage of 15, that young, to be left all alone. I'll be very honest with you, in the beginning when I got\nmarried, I was afraid to have children myself because I wa--I was afraid to bring them in this\nhorrible world. And then I said to myself, \"No, I have to show Hitler that he could not kill us all.\"\nLet's just put one more roll on and finish this thought.\nBeep.\nI want you to go back to where you said, \"I have to be honest with you, I didn't want to have\nchildren.\"",
        "I didn't want to have children because I was afraid that another war would come one day, and that\nmy children shouldn't have to live through the same thing I did, and then I said, \"No, I have to\nshow the terrible people who wanted to kill us all, that they cannot kill a race, and I have to build a\nnew family because they took my family away. I have to have another new family growing, and\nour name sh-should go on in the future. They cannot finish us, and I decided to have children th-\nthen. And, I have 3 beautiful sons, and when my sons were old enough to know what went on in\nthe past, and how we lost, and why they ask me questions, \"Where is my grandma and my\ngrandfather?\" and aunts and uncles, they didn't understand when they were tiny why they didn't\nhave family. Little by little I told them. And I told them the experiences I had during the war, and\nwhy they don't have family, and I urged them, one day you will have a family, and you will tell\nyour children what went on, and sure enough, my children know, and now their little children, my\nlittle granddaughter wants to know what my number on my arm is. And I tell her in no certain\nway, I cannot shock her too much, but I tell her, that it was from a camp where I was taken in\ndetention, and I hope that in the near future, that all the schools and all the children will know, so\nthat they can fight and to, to see that it should never happen again because it, it would be\ndoomsday if it ever God forbid, happens again. When another war should come and try to kill\neverybody, just because they are a race. I'm not just saying Jews, but that they are against a race, it\nshould never ever happen again.",
