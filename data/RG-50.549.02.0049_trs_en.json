        "A: Frida Adler.",
        "Q: Frida Adler. And y -- where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Salatvina, which was at the time Czechoslovakia, Sep-September 14,\n1926.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- up -- acouple of years after you were born. Why did you family move from\nCzechoslovakia to Belgium?",
        "A: [really don\u2019t know. Children were not informed. I -- I -- Lot of -- There were a lot of\nimmigration into Belgium to work the coal mines and the -- I think my father must have\nended up in a steel factory. Why, exactly, I think -- I really don\u2019t know, I mean, we never\nask, we were never told, so I really don\u2019t know what the reason was. But instead of\ncoming to the States, we just -- we moved to Belgium, I guess. We went to Belgium on --\nwe arrived in Liege, Belgium, on May eight, 1929. I came to the States, landed in New\nYork, on May eight, 1946.",
        "Q: Do you -- Do you do anything special on that date, or do you always remember when\nMay eighth rolls around?",
        "A: I remember May eight, because the war started about that day. The Germans invaded\nBelgium. Yes, I remember May eight, because that\u2019s when I lan -- I always remember\nMay eight, when I landed in the State ands can\u2019t forget it.",

        "A: That just something I remember. No, I don\u2019t do anything special, no.",
        "Q: Okay. Had your family had a long history in Czechoslovakia, in Salatven-vena, before\nyou left?",
        "A: My grandparents came from Salitva, on both sides. Both my parents came from that\ncity and all the f -- so far as I know, from both sides, mother and father, they both were\nfrom that town. I don\u2019t know where they came from before, my son 1s trying to find\nancestry and so far, on my father\u2019s side, he can\u2019t -- on the Adler, he cannot find anything.\nThere are only four of us left on my father\u2019s side. Two cousins in Belgium, one male, one\nfemale. One in Israel, he was born there, on my father\u2019s youngest brother, and me in the\nStates. On my mother\u2019s side, there are quite a few cousins all over. One of them was in\nEquador, died about a year ago. Canada, the United States. They\u2019re all over and I -- I\ndidn\u2019t know most of them, until I came to the States and then they came later than I did,\nbut some in Israel, they\u2019re about all over, on my mother\u2019s side. But no one seems to be\nable to tell me where we went back further. I tried to find out what my grandparents died\nof, but by the time it dawned on my to find out, all the people from that age -- from that\nera, were gone, so I have no idea. I think I was told my mother\u2019s father, after World War\nOne, develops wa -- wa -- I don\u2019t know what kind of disease, diphtheria, whatever went\naround. I understand he worked for the railroad, that\u2019s all I know. But we di -- we don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: What were your -- your parents names, and -- and what did they do for a living?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s maiden name was Esaacovic, and she learned man\u2019s tailoring when she\nwas a young girl, that much I know. My father -- they were orphaned, they were both\norphans when they were married. My father, I understand, came from a very poor family.\nThere were seven children left, and they did the best they could, I guess, to support the\nchildren. Once you were poor, you were poor, I guess, there. And maybe that\u2019s what\nbrought them to -- you know, what -- that\u2019s what made them -- wha -- to go to Belgium,\nand I -- he -- I know he lost his -- his job and I think he was in a stee -- in a -- a steel\nfactory, because Belgium had that coal mines and steel factories. And then my -- what\nmy mother did, she picked up the tailoring, but they -- she did it at home, and she did --\nshe worked for several tailors and made the pants. They cut and then we used to roll it up\nand bring it to the house, and -- and then eventually, she brought in somebody to help\nwith the sewing, 1s the way -- and my father slowly did -- you know, yo-you iron with a -\n- with an iron that was heat -- that was heated. And he did the heavy work for her. And he\neventually went into that, because after the war, that\u2019s what he did. My father\u2019s brother,\none of the younger brother, also went to Belgium, and he was a tailor. And I guess he\nwent into business after the war, to manufacture, instead of individual suits, that they\nwent into manu -- quote, manufacturing, not to the -- to the extent that it was in the\nStates, but that\u2019s what they did is, they went into manufacturing men\u2019s clothing, 1s what\nthey did.",
        "Q: So, your family was somewhat struggling financially, in those early years, is that\nright?",
        "A: As far back as I can remember. We didn\u2019t feel it. I had wonderful parents, I -- they\nworked very hard, my mother worked very long hours and I remember wor -- I guess,\nduring the -- what you call season, she worked very, very long hours, is -- 1s what I\nremember. We -- If w -- If they struggled financially, we didn\u2019t get the brunt of it. I\nmean, I can\u2019t place myself missing anything or -- or -- or being in need of anything. My\nfather had a sister who did men\u2019s shirts, you know, individual. All our clothes were made\nby dressmakers. The suits were made by my uncle, and she -- I remember my aunt did\nnightgowns for us. So, we were very well dressed, I don\u2019t remember ever hav -- going\nhungry, so whatever they did, they provided for the children, we didn\u2019t feel any need, or\nany loss, or -- or -- I don't recall anything like that.",
        "Q: You mentioned the importance of their lo -- of your parents love and support for you,\nin helping you get through, after the war. What were their wishes for you, or what were\ntheir -- what do you think their goals were for you as --",
        "A: Yeah, I didn\u2019t want to -- I didn\u2019t want to go to school. We didn\u2019t have to go to high\nschool, and I wanted dressmaking and dress designing, and they insisted that I get a high\nschool diploma. So I was forced in going into high school. And in -- when the Germans\ninvaded in 1940, they -- in Li\u00e9ge, I found out in -- I talked to someone who was from\nAntwerp they started sooner. But in Liege, where we were, they -- I continued going to\nschool until 1942, and I -- just before I was to graduate, get my diploma, that\u2019s when they\nstart -- they didn\u2019t allow Jews to go to school, and -- but when the war started, my parents\nkind -- bent, and I stayed in the same school that I went -- wha -- what do you call it?\nInstead of going at -- academically, I went into a school where I was taking pattern\nmaking and dressmaking. They said --",
        "Q: Vocational s --",
        "A: The vocational school, they said it\u2019s all right, as long as I get a high school dipo --\ndiploma, is -- is what happened. And I remember, couldn\u2019t get fabrics, because it was\nwar, and I remember distinctly, my si -- my middle sister had entered high school, and I\ntook a coat that I had, took it completely apart, pressed, laid it flat, and learn -- and I\nmade a -- cut the coat to fit her, to learn to make it. So I did not get my high school\ndiploma, but I was just before graduation, so I was able to go to school. And then -- We\nspoke Yiddish at home, of course, until my parents learned French and even after that.\nWe had a private tutor that came and taught us Yiddish, and I used to write the letters to\nthe rest of the family, I guess, in Czechoslovakia, but I don\u2019t remember how to read, or\nhow to write Yiddish. I speak it, I understand it, but I can\u2019t -- no longer read or write it.",
        "Q: So when you lived in Liege, did you speak just Yiddish and French, or did you speak\nany other languages?",
        "A: No, no, f -- Yiddi -- We -- We spoke Yiddish and French. My parents spoke\nHungarian when they didn\u2019t want us to understand something. Otherwise, they --\nOtherwise they -- what we -- we spoke Yiddish, I mean my -- my parents came from\nOrthodox background, and in Salitva, I guess the way of life was the -- th-the way of\nJewish life in the calendar and everything.",
        "Q: Will you tell the names of your -- your two sisters, and -- and tell us something about\neach of them?",
        "A: Okay, my middle sister is Berta, she was -- we were two and a half years apart. She\nwas -- loved dancing and whatever, but my parents didn\u2019t go for the arts, for some reason\nor other. They felt education, that did not include it. And my little sister, Nellie, I don\u2019t\nknow what was wrong with her, I know she was very fragile at first, and of course, being\nthe youngest, she was spoiled. That\u2019s how I remember, I used to get angry at her, because\neverything I did, she wanted to do. I didn\u2019t like chicken soup, so if I didn\u2019t eat it, she\ndidn\u2019t want to eat it, and I was told that I would get it for both of us, because she did\neverything I did. I was a very finicky person, even in those days. For instance, I had a\nbicycle, and Berta had a bicycle, and then she outgrew that bicycle, it went to Nellie, so\nshe -- Berta and I had to share a bicycle and if it rained on it, I would wipe it and take\ncare of it and she was ma -- much more li -- much more relaxed about it. She was a very\nwarm, very outgoing person. That\u2019s -- That\u2019s about all I can tell you.",
        "Q: Okay, I\u2019m just going to ask some questions about -- about the chronology of your\nwartime experiences. Okay, we know that the Germans invaded in \u201940, and that from --\nthat -- that there were restrictions and so forth, and -- instituted sometime after the\nGermans started -- after the Germans occupied Belgium and Li\u00e9ge. And then, in 1942,\nyou just mentioned that you -- you stopped high school. And then at some point, you\nmentioned in your first interview that your father was called to Dunkirk, to -- to build --",
        "A: Well, we do -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s was the rumor.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The first thing they did 1s call young people. I looked at -- at -- in an encyclopedia in\nthe library and they did not mention the -- the -- the f -- the young people, because the\ntwo very close friends I had were called. And then later, they called men between certain\nages, I -- I don\u2019t remember. And the rumor was, I don\u2019t know how true it was, that there -\n- we\u2019re going to build fortifications in Dunkirk. Whether that was true or not I don\u2019t\nknow. And my father was called, and I\u2019Il never forget him because it was a Saturday and\nI can see my father coming up the stairway, we lived on a -- above a -- a business, and he\nhad his hair shaved, and my mother said -- asked him where he was going, and he said,\n\u201cI\u2019m going to report, because they say if the men go, they won\u2019t touch the rest of the\nfamily.\u201d And my mother said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe them, I don\u2019t trust them.\u201d And that\u2019s when\nthey decided -- it was a matter that I remember, of either trying to go across to France,\nwhich was very serious, because my cousin -- I -- my father\u2019s sister\u2019s boy, who was eight\nat the time, his mother had died, the father had remarried, and his wife ha -- his -- th-the\nwoman he had remarried brought -- sh -- he\u2019 Il -- he left the woman with two children and\nshe brought my cousin to us, so there were six of us to cross a border. You had to pay\nsomebody to get you across. You didn\u2019t know if you would make it. And then they turned\nto this Catholic family and that\u2019s how we got the house where we went into hiding.",
        "Q: Okay. So, your father just did not -- he evaded the call to go?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: You wanted to --",
        "A: Yeah. [inaudible]. Yeah, that, see? According to my notes, it star -- it started -- th-they\ncalled it a labor draft. I didn\u2019t know at the time that\u2019s what it was called, and it was in\nJuly, 1942.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And d -- as a matter of fact, the couple who came in to join us in hiding afterwards, he\nwas a friend of the family, he was the same age as my father\u2019s brother, who had also\nmoved to Belgium, and she had worked for my parents in, you know, helping with the\nsewing. He had gone on the train.",
        "Q: And what was his name?",
        "A: Shlumalvit -- shl -- sh -- his name was Yankel Shlumavitch, Jacques. And they had a\nlittle boy, a b -- a baby, I don\u2019t even think he was a year old. She was five years older\nthan I, and -- and he went on the train and then this is how we knew -- I guess I don\u2019t\nknow to -- at which point we -- we went into hiding and I guess the -- the conductors, the\npeople who worked on the train -- don\u2019t forget these were Belgian citizens, opened the\ndoors and said, \u201cYou\u2019re going into,\u201d -- I think Germany, or Poland, it was before they\nentered Germany -- \u201cwhoever wants to run, run.\u201d And a lot of the young man who had\ngone, got off the train and went into hiding, but my father hadn\u2019t gone.",
        "Q: Okay. So, Yankel Shmulavits --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- was married to Rasha?",
        "A: Rachelle --",
        "Q: Rachelle.",
        "A: Y -- That\u2019s right, you are right.",
        "Q: Okay. And -- And yo-you all went into hiding at -- 1n this --",
        "A: They joined -- Rachelle and Jacques and the baby joined us to -- 1-1-in hiding. They\nwere in the same house, we were in hiding.",
        "Q: Okay. And do you -- the -- the Catholic family to whom the home you -- you were\nstaying in belonged, do you know their names?",
        "A: No, it -- the person who got -- who got us the house, okay -- we lived across the street\nfrom a church. Now, that part of Belgium is very, very Catholic, and there was a family --\nit\u2019s a long story -- one part -- one member of the family lived upstairs of us, and they\nwere very close with the church. I mean, there\u2019s Catholic, and, you know, no matter\nwhich religion, and wa -- one of the -- one of the sons was a Trappist. One of them had\ngone 1 -- was in the service, but came back and had gone to the country, and my parents\nturned to these people, and the one who had gone to the country knew about the house.\nThe house belonged -- The house belonged to a -- was a guard house for the castle. And\nwe -- I don\u2019t know if these people knew we -- we occupied, you know, if the owner\u2019s\nknew, that I don\u2019t know. I know -- I remember, somehow or other f -- I knew that we\npaid the rent for six months. And after that, I don\u2019t know what happened, I don\u2019t know if\nwe didn\u2019t pay or anything, because I-I really -- I really cannot tell you, it was not brought\nup, so -- I did -- we did not know who -- we never met, we never knew who the people\nwho owned the land, because it was on land that belonged -- is it a -- was it a count or a\nduke? I really -- I really can\u2019t remember, because we never met him, didn\u2019t even know he\n-- I don\u2019t even remember their name. I don\u2019t even know if they knew, at first, 1f it was a\nJewish family. I don\u2019t know how we got the house, I don\u2019t know what information they\ngave us. The farmers around us, in no time at all, they knew we were Jewish. I mean,\nthere was no -- no way of -- of hiding it, but as far as the owners, I have no idea, no idea.",
        "Q: Was there a name of -- of the town where you were staying?",
        "A: Yeah, Gomzayodomon, yeah, Gomzayodomon.",
        "Q: How far was it from Li\u00a2ge?",
        "A: You know, that\u2019s a good question, I don\u2019t know. We used to ride it by bicycle, my\nsister and I used to go into Li\u00e9ge by bicycle, and when I went later on and became a maid\nin the city, that\u2019s how -- that\u2019s why I went -- did not go out with my family. I used to go\nhome by bicycle. It -- It was hard because it was hilly, but otherwise, I don\u2019t know. I\nreally, really -- I never looked into it, never asked. You know, we didn\u2019t ask questions, I\nnever -- even when I went back, I never asked how far it was. I did go -- I think I wen -- I\ndon\u2019t remember if I went by bus, or if my uncle had a car and took me there. I don\u2019t even\nremember. But, you know, Belgium is a small country, so -- at the -- at the time it seemed\nbig, but it\u2019s a small country, next to this one.",
        "Q: And you were staying at this place for 22 months, is that right?",
        "A: Well, I was not there the whole time, because I eventually went to Lie\u20acge, some -- into\nthe home of -- this woman was a widow to a coal mining engineering -- engineer. And\nshe had a son who was an Ob/Gyn, and he was about 40 years old, and you know, they\nused to receive patients in their home, and they needed a maid. So, they knew I was\nJewish and I went to Liege, and walked around with a false ID, went home, traveled by\nbicycle and I was there when the Gestapo came --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- to arrest the family.",
        "Q: And do you know -- remember their names, the name of the -- of the woman and the\nson",
        "A: [indecipherable] Dr. Bastin, B-a-s-t-1-n, I think, yeah.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: All right. And so that was the son, and then --",
        "A: And -- And the mother, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. So, somehow I\u2019d seen the figure of 22 months --",
        "A: Well, we were in hiding 22 months from the time we went -- that -- that the -- the\nGermans started deporting the Jews from Liege until -- until liberation in September, so\nyou count 22 months, is the way they counted it.",
        "Q: So, it was around July \u00b042, til around May --",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: -- May \u00b044?",
        "A: No, the allied troops came into Brussels, in September 1944. I remember it was just\nbefore my birthday, yeah. So I think the -- I think that whoever -- whoever counted the\nhiding, they figured 22 months. That\u2019s all -- That\u2019s all I know, yeah.",
        "Q: So, do you have a sense of the approximate time when you started to work as a maid\nfor the -- for the doctor?",
        "A: I -- I was 16 years old, I remember, because three days before my 17\" birthday, which\nis September 14, I was allowed to go home every other weekend, meaning Saturday to\nSunday, that was my time off. And I -- of course, I traveled by bicycle, and I don\u2019t know\nwhat the trucks ran on, but not on gasoline and they were very slow going up the hills, it\nwas a butane -- whatever comes -- smoke comes out of there, and it was -- we all did this,\nwe hooked onto the truck. You know, it was an open ta -- panel truck. I'll never forget it,\nI had a -- a skirt and blouse on, the -- the skirt, we used to call it jepaison, it was gathered,\nsomething like a trundle skirt and it had a bib, you know. And I -- There were two -- was\nit one or two guys on the back of the truck, and it had like a pole, and I hooked on with\nmy left hand, to the pole, to go up the hill. And the wind was blowing, and my skirt\ncaught on to the truck, and I guess I lost -- I got panicky, I didn\u2019t want to tear the skirt,\ndon\u2019t forget you -- you couldn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t replace clothing, and I fell to my right\nside and broke my right collarbone. And they put me on the truck and I remember saying\nvery distinctly in French, for some reason or other, this sticks very clear in my mind, I\nsaid, \u201cDon\u2019t let me die three days before my birthday.\u201d So I knew I fell September 11,\nthat\u2019s how I remember. And they brought me home and I had to stay home and all they\ndid is take gauze bandage and put my arm -- you know, no sling, no anything, and I have\npicture, I think they took it when they did the --",
        "Q: Mm-hm, yeah --",
        "A: -- yeah --",
        "Q: -- it was on your video --",
        "A: -- yeah, and --",
        "Q: -- yeah.",
        "A: -- that -- that -- that wa -- that was in September, yeah.",
        "Q: 1942, it would have been, right? That was going to be your 16\" birthday?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no. That must have been \u201943, because you know, I didn\u2019t keep\ntrack of wh -- of when we went, I -- I never knew that these things were going to come\nup, but no, I was in the house at first, for quite a long time.",
        "Q: Yeah, okay.",
        "A: And I was 16 -- between my 16\" and 17\" birthday that we were in there.",
        "Q: Okay. So that, when you broke your col-collarbone a few days before your 17\" -- 17\"\nbirthday?",
        "A: Three days before, I say, \u201cDon\u2019t let me die three days before my birthday.\u201d That I\nremember distinctly.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t get any medical treatment at all?",
        "A: Yeah, there isn\u2019t anything they can know, I ma -- my bone -- my bone is still not set\nright. I don\u2019t feel it, I have no pain. I was told that I would suffer the rest of my life with\narthritis. I don\u2019t even know that it\u2019s broken. I don\u2019t feel it, I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s not\nuntil year -- not that many years ago that they came up with something to set collarbones,\nthere isn\u2019t much they could do.",
        "Q: Okay, that -- that makes it clearer, and then -- let me just pause for a second. As far a -\n- d-- so you mentioned that you had false identification papers?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So did you have extensive contact with the underground while you were there?",
        "A: I? No. I think my father did, from what came up afterwards, but we were not told. I --\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, everything was done to protect the children and I guess they\ndidn\u2019t tell us too much. All I -- I -- I really don\u2019t know, because you know, it\u2019s not like\ntoday where the kids know everything, and -- but we didn\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. I -- I\nhave a feeling that my father, I-I -- I don\u2019t know, he either went to the farmers to get food\nfor the underground -- I really couldn\u2019t tell you, I have no idea of what my fa-father\nmight have done or not done, as far as the underground. I have no idea.",
        "Q: Okay. You got word at some point, that your mother and your sisters had been --",
        "A: Arrested.",
        "Q: -- deported -- arrested. You -- At that time, I assume you were working as a maid,\nstill?",
        "A: Yes, I was -- I was in Li\u00e9ge, I was with Madam Bastin, the do -- and Dr. Bastin, and\nthat was the weekend I was to go home. And I got a call, and it was code -- a coded, so\nthey didn\u2019t say the Gestapo arrest your family, cause you had to be careful what you\ntalked on the phone. And I did understand when they told me not to go home. And my\nfather was in the hospital, that\u2019s why my father was not deported. And I\u2019m trying to\nthink. I have to remember in French. Hopital de Labarvare, I think it\u2019s called, and he had\nentered the hospital on Friday. He had either an ear infection, an eye infection, I don\u2019t\nknow, and the doctor felt he should go in the hospital. And my sister Berta was supposed\nto bring in shaving cream and soap, you know, they didn\u2019t provide them. And I got ahold\nof Dr. Bastin, of course, and he had my father released from the hospital, and we got ona\nbus to go home, to go back to that -- to the house, and that\u2019s when we found out exactly\nwhat happened, they came at five o\u2019clock in the morning. And the farmers tried to save\nthe children, my mother tried to save the children. From one of the farmers we -- we were\ntold that one of the Gestapo asked my little sister -- and they didn\u2019t ask -- he asked -- they\nask where my father was, and my little sister answered, \u201cHe\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d I\nunderstand he slapped her because she was lying, which was the truth. That\u2019s what we\ngot from the farmers who were there.",
        "Q: Was it a farmer who had called to -- to give you in code, the information?",
        "A: No, no, I -- you know, I cannot -- it sounds terrible, I cannot remember who called me.\nIt might have been the same man who helped us with the papers. I really don\u2019t know, I\ncannot remember who called me, cannot remember.",
        "Q: Okay. Going to flip the tape over.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape two, side B, of an interview with Frida Wallenstein. And -- And then you\nmentioned in your video interview, it\u2019s -- le -- correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but it sounded as\nif the Bastin -- Dr. Bastin, and -- and Madam Bastin, thought that it was too dangerous\nfor you to stay with them any more.",
        "A: [inaudible]",
        "Q: And then you went -- yo -- did you -- where did you go from there?",
        "A: I went -- I went, very temporarily with Monsieur, Madame Libare. They ha -- They\nwere the ones we communicated with w-while my -- my -- you know, while they were all\nin the citadel, on the outskirts of Liege. There were packages that went and notes slipped\nin. Don\u2019t forget the -- the civilians worked and went back and forth and they were very\nanti-German. And I went there, but at that ti -- I don\u2019t know, I must have stayed a very,\nvery short time, maybe a couple days. Monsieur Libare had been called to go to work to\nGermany, because they were losing on the Russian front at the time, and they called --\nwe're talking Gentiles, Catholic where I was, to go to work the factories. They needed\nmanpower while their man went on the front. And what happened is these -- these men --\nmy father was also called on his false ID with it, and the -- I guess, quote, the mayor,\nfrom the village, who had -- where -- we had ID\u2019s where we were registered 1n the\nregister, so in case they took the ID\u2019s, they could check we were there. He notified them\nthat they made a mistake on my father\u2019s age and made -- they made him 10 years older,\nso he didn\u2019t go. But, what happened with the other people, and in -- like with Monsieur\nLibare, the -- the man would go on the train, hand in their papers, a-an-and get off the\nother side of the train and go home. So you had a lot of the Gentiles, who were, quote,\nhiding, th -- 1 -- were not legitimate -- were -- were hiding at home, so when I went there,\nthey were afraid they would come for him and find me, or they\u2019d come for -- for me, and\nf-f -- and -- and you know, find him, so I stayed there, and then --",
        "Q: Were they in Lie-Liege?",
        "A: Liege, yeah, that was in Liege, and then Madame Bastin had a daughter, very, very\nnice, who was married t-to a lawyer and they had a little boy called Jacques, I remember\nhe used to come in the kitchen and I used to help him with my homework -- with his --\nmy home -- with his homework. And I guess it\u2019s through them, that they found a lawyer,\nit was a woman lawyer, and I went to her house and stayed with her for a very short time,\nbecause then they took the Jews from the citadel and shipped them to Marlene, where\nthey gathered the Jews from Belgium, to ship them out. And that\u2019s when I went to\nBrussels.",
        "Q: Okay. How did you get word that the Jews -- that -- that --",
        "A: That they went with -- from --",
        "Q: -- finch -- that you -- that they were deported?",
        "A: How did I get --",
        "Q: That your -- That your mother and sisters were deported?",
        "A: Well, we knew, somehow, that they were sending them to Marlene. As a matter of\nfact, they kept it from my father, because my father just wanted to go out with his wife\nand the children. My father just never was the same afterwards. And who it was, I don\u2019t\nknow, but somebody knew that -- well, it\u2019s li -- you know, like the -- the man who got on\nthe train and somebody said, you know, \u201cYou're -- You\u2019re being deported, whoever\nwants to run, run.\u201d I have no idea who -- you -- words got around. It\u2019s like, when there\nwas sabotage, it was -- word spread like wildfire that -- that the people were being\nstopped, there was a sabotage and people were arrested. I don\u2019t know, we -- all I know,\nthat we knew they were going out t-to Marlene and that\u2019s when I went to Brussels, and\nstayed the last three months of the war.",
        "Q: Wh -- And how did you know where to go? How did you make arrangements of\nwhere to stay in Brussels?",
        "A: I stayed in Brussels with a couple by the name of -- his name was David Friedman. As\na matter of fact, his family, same family, owned a Buick agency here. I mean, I\u2019m going\nback to the original owner in Cleveland. And, as a matter of fact, he was a brother to\nJacques Slomovitch. Why they had different names, I never understood, but they were\nbrothers. And he was in bru -- in Brussels, and his home was never touched, because he\nhad married a German woman who was not Jewish, and he -- they had a son, yo -- yo --\nyo -- Hakeem, I don\u2019t know how to pronounce it in English. And I went there because I\nwanted to send packages to -- to -- to my family in -- in -- in Marlene. But they didn\u2019t\nstay long enough for me to send any packages. And I don\u2019t know, it was Madame\nFriedman, I don\u2019t know how she knew, she said, \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019re -- they\u2019ve been\nde -- they\u2019re -- they were deported.\u201d And I never sent packages into ma -- into Marlene,\nbecause Marlene was close to Brussels, and who would have taken the package. You\nknow, the -- all this was kept quiet, so I re -- I have no names, I have -- I have no idea\nhow she found out, I have no idea. I remember, because she forced me to go to the show\nat the time. I don\u2019t -- You know, we didn\u2019t know about the concentration camps the way\nthey were, with the gas chambers. I remember crying like crazy and she forced me to go\nto the show with, I think y-yo -- Hakeem, with her son. That\u2019s how I remember.",
        "Q: But you had -- you had no -- it sounded like you weren\u2019t sure about what deportation\nmeant at the time.",
        "A: Right. We didn\u2019t know -- We didn\u2019t know the gas chambers, we didn\u2019t know the\ntorture. I didn\u2019t know anyway. There were Germans who had es -- Jews, and who had\nescaped from Germany, into Belgium, but the -- the concentration camps as far as the gas\nchambers, not th -- in -- if my parents knew, they didn\u2019t tell us. I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: And during the time that you were in Brussels, th -- I -- I -- you se -- mentioned in\nyour testimony that your father was arrested at some point --",
        "A: Point.",
        "Q: When did that happen?",
        "A: It happened right after my mother and sisters were arrested. I understand he went to\nthe police and he said -- I don\u2019t know the details, that he had stolen -- I guess what they --\nwhat -- what the underground did -- is -- you know, farmers had to turn in their quotas\nwhether it was wheat, eggs, butter. And what they -- what the underground would do is\ngo to the farmers and get loads of stuff, that found it\u2019s way on the Black Market, found\nit\u2019s way -- you know, you had -- I remember the two amer -- th-the plane that fell, and I\nknow they never caught whoever was in -- in the plane and we were told there was an\nAmerican plane. Then you had the underground, it had to be [indecipherable] and things,\nand then the -- the farmers would call and say they were robbed, and I don\u2019t know if\nthat\u2019s what my father participated in, but they arrested him and they put him in jail. And\nhe would come up for trial and I -- he hired a lawyer and I went and I told the lawyer, I'll\nnever forget it, \u201cGet my father liberated, or freed, whatever,\u201d and I said, \u201cI'll kill you.\u201d\nBecause I knew that he would have arrested him and deported him. So, he would come\nup for trial, they would postpone his trial. And then when war was over, I had to get a\nlawyer, because we were foreign citizen, we were not Belgian citizen, and because he had\ncommitted a crime, I guess, they were going to deport him. So it took a lawyer. I turned --\nI think I went to -- to -- to Madame Bastin\u2019s son-in-law, yeah, to have him -- whatever he\ndid, he did. I -- He never took a fee or anything, and -- and my father was let go and\nstayed in Belgium.",
        "Q: Let me make sure that I understand why you told the lawyer, \u201cYou free my father or\nPl kill you.\u201d",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Is the -- because --",
        "A: Be-Becau-Because, he was going around, and I guess he wanted to -- to -- to be with -\n- with -- with my mother and with the children and I guess that\u2019s what it was. I don\u2019t\nknow what else, he was trying every which way to -- to -- to -- to free them. As a matter\nof fact, there was somebody -- I think it\u2019s pretty true that he paid to have my mother and\nthe children out of -- out of the citadel and then it never worked out because I think it was\ntrue that there were -- we\u2019re talking German soldiers, we\u2019re not talking Nazi, we\u2019re\ntalking German soldiers, who would take money and be bribed and let -- you know, help\npeople escape from there. I don\u2019t know deta -- you know, this was all -- all hush hush and\nI left right after the war, so I never found out a lot of things. But you have to realize that\nhe -- in the citadel, you had people who were accused of -- of sabotage and things, and\nthey went into the citadel, not just Jews. So, I know when I saw Rachelle years later in\nIsrael, she told me that a -- a German soldier pa -- brought her milk and passed it through\nthe bar to give to the baby. So, there was something going on that the detail -- you know,\nnothing was talked about and I left shortly -- a year after the war, when it was still war\ntorn and people were coming back, so I never got details. And I guess I never went into\nany details. I didn\u2019t ask.",
        "Q: So it was your concern that if your father was freed, he would just get himself\ndeported?",
        "A: Yeah, you got it, that\u2019s right. Whatever that meant, I don\u2019t know if I realized the f --\nthe full meaning of it, I don\u2019t know. I -- I really don\u2019t know. I have no idea.",
        "Q: But you had the -- the --",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: -- impression that your father was not s-stable.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s right. He didn\u2019t care what happened to him. He didn\u2019t care -- for -- after\nthat, he -- he didn\u2019t care. As a matter of fact, when he died 10 years later -- he had\nremarried, and I did see his widow, and she told me he never -- he never overcame the\nloss of my mother and the si -- and my sisters, he never. He didn\u2019t care, because he had a\n-- a blood clot, a thrombophlebitis, thrombophlebosis, whatever it 1s, and he was told to,\nyou know, flat in bed, you know, to -- until the -- all the clot dissolved, and he didn\u2019t\ncare, and that\u2019s why -- my understanding was that\u2019s why he died, the -- that the blood clot\ntraveled and killed him.",
        "Q: When was that, that he died?",
        "A: 19 -- November 18, 19 -- whata -- \u201955.",
        "Q: Okay, all right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Not -- Not so long after the war ended.",
        "A: Well, 10 years.",
        "Q: 10 years.",
        "A: 10 years, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: 10 years.",
        "Q: So, it sound -- my impression is that you were -- you had been, as a girl, fairly\nsheltered by your parents, and they had protected you, and -- and you -- and you had not -\n- you hadn\u2019t been rich, but you had been well taken care of --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And now, all of a sudden, towards the end of the war, after your mother and sister\nwere deported, you were -- you were like the head of the family, and the kids --",
        "A: I was left alone, I had to battle for myself. I had money; we each had 200 dollars sewn\ninto our coat, and my aunts address in Cleveland. And I found myself completely -- I\nguess completely grown up. I mean, I was left alone, I mean I was -- I don\u2019t know. I --\nWell, actually, we matured -- we call it matured, when we went into hiding, and when I\nwas a maid in -- in the Bastin\u2019s house. She was not a very nice person. He was. He was --\nI -- He married, years later, my school friend wrote to me. She -- She was not very nice to\nwork for, she -- first of all, I was a live-in maid and there was a woman who was\nsupposed to come -- I don\u2019t remember, two times, or three times a week, and she quit and\nI was doing the work of two people in a house that was kept immaculate, with -- don\u2019t\nask. So, I had to fight her off, too, I mean, she was very demanding. You know how 1 -- I\n-- | was -- I was a -- I was a kid, I was 16 years old. I look at my grandchildren and I\nthink to myself, oh my God, I were -- what do I -- how was I doing at that age. This is\nwhat\u2019s happening to me now.",
        "Q: How did you adjust to that roll that had suddenly been thrust on you of just being so\nresponsible? Did you -- Was it -- Were you able to do it?",
        "A: I -- I guess I had no choice and then I went back to live with my father, my aunt and\nuncle -- my father\u2019s brother and his wife, who had managed to go to -- to -- to France,\ncame back with two children. And I fought, and my father and I fought and that\u2019s why I\ncame to the States.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, you talked about that some in your first interview, of that difficulty --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- with your father.",
        "A: He was not the same any more. I just -- It was his idea to come to the States to my\naunt, you know, it was not -- 1-1t -- it\u2019s so hard to go into those details, you know. My\ncousin, who was deported with my mother, is -- the father came back, made it through\nSwitzerland, because his wife was pregnant and Switzerland allowed, I think that\u2019s what I\nwas -- we were told, the pregnant women. And he came back and he blamed my mo --\nmy mother, my father for the boy going out with my mother. And I was so mad at my\nfather because he let him live with us. And we were very cramped, we had three rooms,\nmy aunt and uncle came and I could tell you stories, but it\u2019s not -- it really isn\u2019t worth it,\nit just -- it was not the same life, I mean we had a makeshift apartment, we were bombed,\nwe were -- you couldn\u2019t get places to live, and I don\u2019t know, whatever. And my cousin,\nwho is now in Paris, was left alone and she came to live with us for awhile and my aunt --\nmy aunt -- don\u2019t want to go into it, in case she listens to it. It was not pleasant, it was very\n-- it was very, very difficult. It\u2019s -- It was not normal life, although my father did get food\nand we never went hungry, but otherwise, it was no life. It wasn\u2019t the same any more.",
        "Q: And this was in bru -- did you stay in Brussels?",
        "A: No, no, in Li\u00e9ge. I went ba -- I c -- I came -- I came back. I wanted to be with my\nfather for my 18\" birthday and I got on a train in Brussels, got as far Louvain, couldn\u2019t\ngo any further, because I didn\u2019t realize they were still fighting, I guess, arou -- in the\noutskirts of Li\u00e9ge, and we got on a ni -- I don\u2019t know how many of us got -- got on a -- on\na American jeep and we finished and went into Liege, and I went to Monsieur and\nMadame Libare, and stayed there until I got to -- my father was freed and I went to live\nwith him.",
        "Q: Where did he live at that time?",
        "A: Who, my father?",
        "Q: Your father.",
        "A: Yo -- Yo -- Well, we got a pla -- we got a quota half a house, or whatever you want to\ncall it, and we got together. I stayed with Monsieur and Madame Libare until then.",
        "Q: Was there any issue of property that you had lost?",
        "A: No, no, no, we -- we didn\u2019t own -- we don\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t own property. We wal -- We\nalways rented. And I don\u2019t know who took -- who t -- who emptied the belongings in the\nhouse in the country. I have no idea. There\u2019s so many -- I -- I -- I didn\u2019t inquire, I didn\u2019t -\n- | didn\u2019t dig into it. I guess -- I don\u2019t know, if I think back, who knows what I was\nthinking? I really don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t ask.",
        "Q: And at that time, was -- were you all -- you and your father still holding out some --\nsome hope that even though what you knew that you thought maybe your family would\ncome back?",
        "A: People -- People were coming out of the concentration camps. As a matter of fact,\nRachelle is the only one who survived. And he would go to fortune tellers, he kept hoping\nand hoping, and I remember some guy came out of the concentration camp, and I\nremember him s -- telling my father, \u201cDon\u2019t hope, I took the bodies out myself from the\ngas chambers.\u201d It was somebody who was from Li\u00e9ge, who knew them. And then\nRachelle came back, and I did see her. When I saw her in Israel, many years later, she\ncouldn\u2019t remember that I saw her before I came to the States. And we didn\u2019t talk in the --\nthey didn\u2019t talk in those days. And I left, but w-what I understood afterwards is my father\nblamed Rachelle for my mother being exterminated, because when they went into the\ncamps, they didn\u2019t know -- they were separating the women and, you know, with\nchildren, and the story I got 1s somebody told Rachelle to hand the baby to my mother. So\nmy father felt that she went into the gas cham -- because, immediately they went in,\nbecause she handed the baby to my mother. The story I got when I went back is, they\ndidn\u2019t know what was happening and she handed the baby to my mother not knowing\nthat that was going to happen. My cousin was then 10 years old, and I was told -- and I\ncan\u2019t remember who said, that came out of the concentration camp, said that my sister\nBerta was given the option of going with the women or to go with my mother, and she\nchose to go with my mother. How true, who knows? But that\u2019s what we were told.",
        "Q: And this was Auschwitz, yes?",
        "A: Auschwitz, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you -- So, when Rachelle came back, you -- she didn\u2019t talk to you at all about what\nhad happened?",
        "A: Nope. No.",
        "Q: Do you remember seeing her again, and the --",
        "A: Oh --",
        "Q: -- just about that mom -- what that moment was like?",
        "A: She -- I -- I -- I can see her, but I can\u2019t think of what we talked about. I know she was\nsterilized by Mengele. She couldn't have children, or something. And I don\u2019t even know\nif I understood the feel -- full meaning of it. Don\u2019t forget, we were -- we didn\u2019t have sex\neducation and war, y-you do -- you don\u2019t appreciate the full meaning of it. I -- Even when\nI saw her a year later -- years later, when I went to Israel -- I have a letter from her, too,\nbecause I -- that\u2019s how I found out the dates and the details and she says this was very\nhard for her to talk about. That\u2019s all I know. I never dug into it, I never faced th-the --\nwhat really happened, until many years later, until I went back to Belgium and my aunt\ntold me, but I -- I didn\u2019t want -- I guess now that -- in retrospect, I didn\u2019t want to know. I\nwas one of these people who didn\u2019t want to know.",
        "Q: Were you having hopes for the future at that point? Were you thinking about that?",
        "A: Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing. I had no thought of future, had no thought of\nanything, just a ca -- I guess day to day. You\u2019re asking me things, you know, and how did\nI feel? In those days I just -- nope, absolutely nothing, and was -- my father, or some --\nwe contacted my aunt in Cleveland and I came to Cleveland, is what I did.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You di -- Did you have any preference of where you would go?",
        "A: I had no choice, because my -- the only relative we had in the States, was my aunt in\nCleveland. And I -- She signed the affidavit for me, so I had no choice, I had to come to\nCleveland, I had to come to her.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in Li\u00e9ge before leaving?",
        "A: Well, we were live -- the war was over in September \u00b044, and I left Belgium, I got on\nthe boat in LeHavre in May one, 1945 -- \u00b040 si -- wait a minute, I came in \u00b046 -- \u201946,\nyeah, and that\u2019s when I left. So I stayed in Li\u00a2ge from September 1944, to just -- well, I\nleft Li\u00a2ge, because I stayed overnight in Paris, to the beginning of May. I left -- I left\nMay one from LeHavre and arrived in New York May eight, 1946.",
        "Q: So that year before you left Liege, you -- you\u2019re living with your father and -- and\nwith -- can you tell me the names of the other people you were",
        "A: Well my -- my father\u2019s brother Josef and his wife Hosa, and their two children,\nWilliam and Mary, who were little tots. And I saw them again as teenagers, I went back a\nyear after my father died. Then I went back once more and then two years ago, I went\nwith Elder Hostel to France and my cousin Miriam, who\u2019s a married woman with two\nyoung adult children, came to Paris and we spend the day together. So, that what was left\nin Li\u00e9ge, and then I -- my fa -- one of my father\u2019s brother, Gesa, we made contact with\nhim, through my cousin from Israel, and he came to the States via his wife, because on\nmy father\u2019s side, there was no one. And I remember before I left Belgium, we heard from\nhim, and he had applied to come to the States and I was going to wait for him, and he\nsays, \u201cNo, you go ahead, and I\u2019ll join you afterwards.\u201d He came about two years later,\nand he went to New York, and I practically ran to New York. I got on the Empire State\ntrain and I went in on a -- [ think it was a decoration weekend, or Fourth of July, and boy,\nthat Grand Central Station was mobbed. He recognized me for some ra -- reason or other,\nbecause he used to travel and he used to come to Li\u00e9ge -- I mean, my mother, th -- the\nwhole family adored my mother, and he was in New York, and then he had TB of the\nspine and moved -- was transferred to Denver, to the National Jewish Hospital there. And\nhe -- he was the only one, my uncle in Liege died. He had a heart murmur or something\nwhen he was a kid and he died of a heart condition. My uncle, my father\u2019s -- I guess -- I\ndon\u2019t know if he was the youngest or -- or his sister was the youngest. She died of\nchildbirth [indecipherable] abortion. Th-Th-The brother, Libou, was sent to Israel, he was\n11 years old, and we heard from him after the war, and he was killed with a shrapnel in\nhis yard, he was on -- I don\u2019t know, he was on the kibbutz, or they had sent money to him\nalready. When they were fighting -- they had the war to become Israel, and I\u2019m in touch\nwith my cousin still yet, who was born you know, in -- in Israel, he lived in Denver, so\nthat\u2019s the four of us left, but otherwise there 1s -- there\u2019s no one left on my father\u2019s side.",
        "Q: Was there any possibility of staying in Liege, or was that out of the question?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. The papers were made. As a matter of fact, if it would a happened later,\nthis 1s -- was a f -- cousin of my father, he was the same age as my Uncle Josef and he\ncame up through Italy with the Jewish Brigade, and somehow or other was -- knew we\nwere in Li\u00e9ge, and he found us in Li\u00e9ge, and as a matter of fact, he stayed with me in\nBrussels until I got on the train to go to Paris to come to the States. Had it happened later,\nhe probably would have arranged for me to go to -- to what was at the time, Palestine. Th\n-- Could have very easily ended up in Israel, as well as in pa -- as -- as well in -- as 1n the\nStates. I mean, it was just timing I guess, because when -- by the time he came to\nBelgium, I -- the -- the paperwork had already started to come to the States, and I never\nreversed it. I wasn\u2019t thinking, really. I got cold feet. When I got off the boat, I was one of\nthe last one to get off the ship.",
        "Q: [inaudible]",
        "A: Yes, yes. Everybody was off but me.",
        "Q: Just going back for a minute. Did -- Did you have any Zionist feelings at all?",
        "A: Nope. I think as a kid, you know, you remember vaguely, I must have belonged to\nsomething that had to do with the Zionism, but I don\u2019t remember -- it just something very\nvague. Vi -- I don\u2019t even know the name of the organization, I remember little si -- I\u2019m\ngo -- I remember going to meetings, but it\u2019s so vague, I couldn\u2019t even tell you.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I just couldn\u2019t even tell you, because the only one who went to -- to, at the time\nPalestine, was my father\u2019s brother.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You mentioned that -- that your family was -- was religious and -- and --",
        "A: They came -- They came -- My -- Both my [indecipherable] that was life in the -- in\nthe country, were Orthodox, but in Liege, they didn\u2019t keep it. They a -- a small Jewish\ncommunity. My father was not a believer. We went to services and was because of my\nmother. My father was not into it. I remember he used to talk and they gave him a hard\ntime for Bar Mitzvah, because he couldn\u2019t afford a new suit or something like that. My\nfather was not into it, and then my Uncle Gesa, who was a waiter, and travel and used to\ncome to Belgium, I guess he didn\u2019t keep kosher and for whatever reason or other, I don\u2019t\nthink we kept kosher any more. And then we had the war. But I know my mother, even\nwhen -- because we had food on Black Market in Belgium, would not touch, like pork.\nShe could not -- She did not touch it. I don\u2019t th --\nEnd of Tape One Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: No, you can never predict who\u2019s going to be interested, and who isn\u2019t.",
        "A: But see, my son was not -- didn\u2019t dig into it either, and then he was going to dig into it\nwith my -- my -- my late uncle in Denver, and my uncle died of a heart attack, so he\nnever got -- he wanted his experiences.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. This is tape number two, side A, of an interview with Frida Wallenstein.\nBefore we go on to talk about your journey, I wanted to ask you about Judaism after the\nwar. We were just talking about how -- what your family\u2019s religion was before the war.\nDid Judaism play a role right after the war ended?",
        "A: Not one bit. I -- The -- We had a synagogue, Orthodox of course, and the rabbi had\ngone to Russia on a visit and got caught during the war, so we didn\u2019t even have a rabbi. I\nwent to the synagogue because I knew I had a male cousin and I had two female cousins,\nand I thought maybe I would run into their husbands, which I never did. My cousin Louie\nwas 1n Manila. I don\u2019t know where AI was, the one -- I-I-I can\u2019t remember. So I never\nfound them, but there was, I guess soldiers, somebody gave money. I had never heard of\nHanukkah, not that I remembered giving money for the kids. I never saw anything, I --\nthe only reason I went to se -- to the synagogue was to see if maybe I could turn up one\nof my cousins. But there was no contact with the religion, at least on my -- on my part,\nand on my father\u2019s part, I don\u2019t remember anything.",
        "Q: Okay, so you left from LeHavre on what boat? And -- And around when?",
        "A: Oh, okay, I left le -- I went from Liege to Brussels, war torn -- first of all, I had trouble\ngetting a passport, because Czech -- where I was born became Russia, and we were told\nwe could remain Czech or become Russian, and we found out my father could not remain\nCzech because he had not served in the armed forces. So I had to go to Brussels, and I\ndon\u2019t remember who suggested I go to the Office of the Foreign Ministry in Brussels, and\nI had to get papers to prove that I was no longer a Czech citizen. And I didn\u2019t get what a\npassport, they call it a laissez-passe, which means let through, translated literally, good\nfor one year, and so I could put my visa on. I had to go to Antwerp to get my visa, and it\nwas through a school friend, not a Jewish girl, whose father worked downtown, next to\nthe town major\u2019s office. He didn\u2019t speak French, he didn\u2019t -- a-and my -- my friend\u2019s\nfather didn\u2019t speak English and they wrote a letter to the embassy and I got a visa much\nsooner than -- than if I would have waited on a regular basis, because after I came to the\nStates, my father told me that I got called to go get my visa. And you couldn\u2019t get\npassage because the GI\u2019s were coming back, the war brides were coming. And I can still\nsee the travel agent. I was at a friend\u2019s house and he says, \u201cI got passage for you.\u201d And I\nfound my father, he had to borrow money to -- to pay for my passage. And I went from\nLiege to Brussels with my father, and this cousin from Israel, and I remember he told my\nfather, \u201cYou go back, I\u2019m a soldier, I\u2019ll be able to get transportation.\u201d And I think it took\nme longer to go through the border of Belgium, France, than it took me to travel, because,\nyou know, it was still after the war. France was still war -- we had everything, food,\neverything, France didn\u2019t. Stayed overnight in Paris. I met a woman on the train, and\nsomebody on the train, a French woman -- there was Black Market going on between\nBelgium and Germany, Belgium and France, and she picked up the Belgian accent, and\nwanted to know if we had Belgian money -- and stayed in Paris overnight. And there was\na young girl who had married a GI, and this woman was very sophisticated, and we went\nto LeHavre. War -- Was in ruins, I remember the debris and everything. And I came on a\nboat, that I used to call a ship, called the SS Uruguay. And we were 10 in a cabin, and we\nlanded in New York on May eight, in 1946.",
        "Q: Why didn\u2019t your father go with you?",
        "A: There was no reason for him to come to the States, I mean, he didn\u2019t have anybody. It\nwould have had to be my aunt, was my mother\u2019s sister, would have signed the papers, he\n-- he -- I don\u2019t know, I never asked.",
        "Q: But he thought it would be better for you to go?",
        "A: It was bet -- It was better, it just -- it just -- I wou -- I -- I was a young woman, he -- he\njust -- he just didn\u2019t know how to handle it. We were fighting, we were arguing, we were\n-- [remember he didn\u2019t allow me to wear lipstick, I was 18 years old. Lots and lots of\nreasons. I just -- It -- It\u2019s very hard to go into it, and very personal, so I -- it just didn\u2019t\nwork out. I don\u2019t even realize what I was doing by coming to the States, truthfully. I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "Q: What were the thoughts in your head in the time that you were in -- on the ship?",
        "A: What were the thoughts? I think I was blank. I -- I -- I don\u2019t think I thought anything,\nall I -- the -- the only thing I remember, I saw raw celery for the first time in my life,\nserved on the ship, and I thought, \u201cWho eats raw celery?\u201d And I think maybe I realized\nwhat I did, is when I went -- when we landed, when -- you know, when -- when we\ndocked, I should say, and my aunt, my uncle and my cousin Louie had a ca -- my cousin\nLouie had a car, drove to New York. There were two families who had known my mother\nback in Czechoslovakia, who had migrated to New York years ago, and they left my\nmother about the same age I came, and I guess they must have -- th -- th -- my aunt and\nuncle came -- came to the dock where -- where we -- where we docked there, and my\ncousin had just borrowed a hat from one of the people on -- on -- on the thi -- because\nthey couldn\u2019t imagine what was happening to me, and I think I was afraid to get off the\nboat. I really was afraid to get off the boat. I -- I know they were cleaning -- I think\nmaybe the whole boat was cl -- was cleaned by the time I got off. And I think that\u2019s when\n-- | think that\u2019s when I got scared, but until then, no. First of all, I was a little seasick, not\ntoo much, I remember, and you were with te -- you know, nine other people in the cabin\nandI don\u2019t -- I think my mind didn\u2019t even project into anything at all. I mean, I didn\u2019t\neven think of language barrier. I didn\u2019t think of anything. I --",
        "Q: Did you speak any English?",
        "A: I did a little bit, because I had studied English six years prior to coming to the States,\nand maybe I have a knack for languages. I mean, it came out upside down and\neverything, but I managed -- I -- I-I remember sitting down and writing letters in English,\nwith the dictionary. I don\u2019t know how, because two years is not a lot. But, what saved me\nwith my aunt is I spoke Yiddish. See, she spoke Hungarian, but I was able to\ncommunicate fluently in Yiddish, so that I was able -- I had no problem at home. I had no\nproblem whatsoever. And then -- And then I found myself living -- I di -- I didn\u2019t think of\nanything. I don\u2019t remember even being concerned about language barrier, I didn\u2019t even\nthink of it.",
        "Q: And so you got off in New York, and then traveled to Cleveland?",
        "A: By car, yeah. We stayed in New York overnight. I remember my -- they took me to a\nstore and they bought me a coat and I thought it was the ugliest thing, but it wasn\u2019t -- you\nknow, don\u2019t forget, the styles were entirely different. I came with a coat, it used to be a\nnavy blanket, and my uncle was a tailor, you know, he had come back, and he made it for\nme. I mean, you couldn\u2019t get fabrics, you couldn\u2019t -- this is how y -- this is war torn, this\nis -- and I remember it was a fuchsia coat, I'll never forget. I think I have a picture in it,\nwith black lapels and a ba -- a belt. And I wanted bananas, because for money you could\nget just about everything in Belgium, and the first boat, the banana boats came in just as I\nwas leaving, and I remember my aunt eventually hiding the bananas, cause she was afraid\nI would get sick. And I remember distinctly, I had a soft boiled egg, and I had never seen\nthis, where they crack the egg, and put it in a little dish. I was used to eat it in the shell, in\na -- in an egg holder, and I thought my stomach was going to turn, and I couldn\u2019t say\nanything. But what saved me is, you know, especi -- and with the p -- even the people\nwho knew my parents, it -- to families, is -- is the Yiddish, I was able to communicate in\nYiddish.",
        "Q: What was your aunt\u2019s name?",
        "A: Lana Bern, she -- yeah, Lana Bern. She had three children, one daughter in California,\none daughter who was married already, in Cleveland. She lived a -- wait a minute, Edna\nli -- no, Edna lived upstairs, yeah. She had a two family with a third floor, and my cousin\nLouie wasn\u2019t married and was still living with her.",
        "Q: Ah, just backtracking for a moment, what -- do you remember what your first\nimpressions were of New York?",
        "A: Of New York itself? No. The im -- what a -- what really impressed me 1s, you know,\nwe drove back from new -- we drove from New York to Cleveland, so we\u2019re through\nPennsylvania, and I just looked at the vastness of this country, I just -- I think I was awed,\nI was numb. That 1m -- New York, I don\u2019t remember anything from New York, I mean,\nas far as the city, I mean, we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t sightsee, I mean, these people were\nanxious to see me and to learn and -- and things like that. What awed me was the country,\nand my cousin Louie was teasing me, something about the mountains and going through\nit, or anything like that. I mean, the ten -- there was the Pennsylvania Turnpike, but not\nthe Ohio Turnpike, and then it turned dark and he continued driving, but during daylight,\nI just looked at all that Pennsylvania country and I just -- I wa -- just awed. But New\nYork? No, I didn\u2019t remember New York, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t go -- I don\u2019t even remember\nwhich store we went to go shopping for my coat.",
        "Q: Did -- Did you talk to your near relatives at all about where you had come from, what\nhad hap -- just happened to you, what you were going through?",
        "A: What -- What happened when I came to my aunt, okay, is there 1s a -- a -- quite a\ncommunity from Solotvona in Cleveland, and people came to see me, I was -- there was\none guy, I don\u2019t know how he got here before me, because he was a DP, he had been in\nthe concentration camp, and he came to see me also. And people came to get information,\nnews, and I kept saying -- I guess I must have been quote boatlag, I don\u2019t know, is there\nsuch a thing? And I kept saying, I don\u2019t know anything, because I was in Belgium, so I\ncould not bring them any news or anything from before the war from Solotvona, because\nI was two and a half years old when my f -- you know, when we left to Belgium. I had\ndistant cousins who came, I mean people came because they wanted -- they wanted news\nfrom Solotvona, and I -- and I remember k -- kept -- in Yiddish kept -- that I remember\ndistinctly, I kept saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything, I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d and you know, and --\nand what saved me again was the Yiddish because these people, from that generation\ncame and -- and spoke Yiddish, and I couldn\u2019t give them any information, but nobody\nasked me information about Belgium because they came -- they came from -- from --\nfrom Czechoslo -- fr -- Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, whatever it was when they\ncame.",
        "Q: Did you feel that you had anyone who was really interested in -- in you and what you\nhad been through?",
        "A: No, no. As a matter of fact, what I had is I found myself, for the first time, in a Jewish\nenvironment. Grew up in a Catholic environment. And I remember distinctly that even\nwith my aunt, that I had to defend the Catholics. I had to tell them that Catholics saved\nmy life. Catholic risked their lives to save my life. Catholics were tormented, especially\nin Liege. I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t know about the other part, I just met somebody from\nAntwerp. The -- The walone, th-th-the -- the French ones were very, very anti-Germans. I\ndidn\u2019t know from -- I didn\u2019t know any anti-Semitism, unt-until Hitler started in \u201942. And\nI don\u2019t think they -- they -- they comprehended that. That 1s something I really -- th-that\u2019s\nwhat came up, is Catholic helped me, Catholic risked their lives. Catholic were persecu --\nnot to the extent the Jews were. You know, they didn\u2019t -- they couldn\u2019t take the whole\ncountry and send them to the concentration camps. That\u2019s what I had -- What happened\nto me? I -- I ha -- trying to remember my -- my aunt knew by then that my mother was\ngone, but I don\u2019t think they brought up too much at that time, of -- you know, America\nwas getting over, I guess, depression, the war, the bo -- the boys were coming back from\nthe service. And it\u2019s someth -- it\u2019s not something that was talked about that much. I\nremember, I don\u2019t know if I was setting the table, clearing up the table or what. My\nmother -- My aunt, excuse me, my aunt said something about milladec, faishadec, you\nknow, dairy made, and I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d And my aunt said, \u201cWhat do you mean, you\n-- what\u2019s milladec and faishadec, didn\u2019t your mother keep it?\u201d Oh, sure, my mother kept\nit, four years of war, two years in hiding, how are you going to keep the -- the -- the\nkosher laws, she didn\u2019t even keep them before -- before the war. That I remember, and\nit\u2019s interesting, because I -- my aunt lit candles on the Sabbath, on Friday, and it came -- I\nhad forgotten about that, it -- it\u2019s interesting what you remember distinctly, what you\nremember vaguely. I had completely forgotten about candles and blessing the candles,\nand then I remembered when I saw her doing it, and then when girlfriend of mine did it,\nand it just -- I can see my mother lighting this -- you know, and -- and blessing this -- the\nSabbath candles, but I had completely forgotten about it. And I never kept anything, to\nthis day I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: Did you start going to services?",
        "A: Nope. I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not practicing, I\u2019m not a believer. I keep -- I -- Rosh Hashanah\nand Yom Kippur is something that is very vivid in my mind. I don\u2019t remember\nHanukkah, I remember one seder. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, I will not -- you\nknow, I -- I -- what I do at home is my business. I didn\u2019t go to work. I go for the holidays\nbecause I have very close friends who are traditional and I go for breaking the fast and I\ngo for this, but I am not -- I -- Passover, I don\u2019t observe. I respect, but I don\u2019t observe.\nWhat I do at home is my business. I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m not into it. I -- What happened to my\nmother shouldn\u2019t have happened if religion was supposed to be what it\u2019s wa -- that\u2019s the\nway I feel.",
        "Q: Was it -- It sounds to me like an interesting kind of role reversal. I think people would\nassume that having lived in Europe during the Nazi era, that you would be especially\naware of anti-Semitism, and that the people in America, would be oh, you know, we --\nwe don\u2019t live in an anti-Semitic country, but it sounds like it was kind of opposite of that\nand that you came into a community that was -- that was very aware of their Judaism, and\n-- and very aware of -- of anti-Semitism. Was it difficult for you to maintain your identity\nof not -- not being oriented towards Judaism? Was that a conflict at all?",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t. I mean, I remember -- you know, I made friends right away, all -- they\nwere all American girls, they felt sorry for me. I still see them to this day, they had a\nsorority from high school. We just had a reunion because somebody came in from out of\ntown. And I remember going on the high holy days with a girlfriend, and we went from\none synagogue to the other, but as far as religion, religion for me to keep, that\u2019s not what\ndirected me, I did what everybody else did. I will -- do remember distinctly, when came\nYom Kippur, and my aunt wanted me to go to synagogue to say yisker for my mother,\nand I refused. I said, \u201cThat means I\u2019ll bury my mother.\u201d That I remember distinctly. In\nretrospect, I think I did not accept for -- what really happened. First of all, I didn\u2019t know\nthe details. People didn\u2019t talk in those days, right off, and re -- you have to realize I -- I --\nI didn\u2019t associate with the Europeans, with the DP\u2019s who came. Cousins came -- I had\nmade American friends, and I went with them, and these were 18 year old girls who --\nwho I don\u2019t think talked about -- who talked about the Holocaust, outside maybe of the\nDP\u2019s who came, I have no idea because I had no contact with them. I worked the sewing\nfactory and they came there, but nobody talked about it, so religion-wise, no, I had to\nfight and say again with the Catholics, I had -- I had to tell them that I did not face anti-\nSemitism, and I think -- I think that was something that was hard for them to accept until\nI left my aunt, and then inna -- it wa -- it was never talked about. I worked in the sewing\nfactory, there were all American girl -- girls, until the DP\u2019s came, and we had, I think, a\nHungarian forewoman, and I don\u2019t speak Hungarian. I just found myself more in\ncommon with the American girls. Maybe I was anxious to become Americanized, or\nwhatever, whatever, and all the people that affiliated with even the factory, were not\nJewish. Fa -- The friends that I made were Jewish, but the environment where I worked\nwas not Jewish. And even when I changed factories, I think I was the only Jewish girl\nworking there, when I went to Prinz beeterman. I never felt out of place working among -\n- among non-Jews. I would never -- never felt out of place, never felt different or\nanything.",
        "Q: Did you ever experience any anti-Semitism in this country?",
        "A: No, no, no, because I worked in the sewing industry, which was Jewish owned, but I\nhad heard at -- over the years, as the girls went out for jobs, I heard about discrimination\nin hiring Jews, some of the companies. But I personally, no, no, never. I was very good\nfriends with -- when I was at Prinz beeterman, pe-people of Catholic-Polish extract, I\nmean di -- didn\u2019t talk religion, religion didn\u2019t come into it. I -- I -- I -- I -- I never\nexperienced it personally, no, nowhere.",
        "Q: What were y -- What were your -- your -- you\u2019re starting to get settled in the\nCleveland area, you\u2019re starting to get familiar with -- with this new country. What --",
        "A: Very difficult. I said I was a dressmaker. I have what they call golden hands, meaning\nI\u2019m very, very good with my hands. And Cleveland was a center for the manufacturing of\nclothing. To -- My aunt took me to Lampoles, and of course I was grabbed off, and I was\nin shock, because they had rows of sewing machines. I was not used to it. And I tried to\ntell them that I had gone to school, that I wa -- I was eight -- I was almost -- Just about 20.\nAnd I told them I was a high school graduate. I was -- I wasn\u2019t graduated the high s -- it\nwas easier to say that I was educated. Looked like kid, didn\u2019t speak English but very\nlittle. And for some reason or other -- the only thing years later I could think of 1s, the\nenvironment I found myself, I could take my aunt -- even my parents, how much\nschooling did they have? And I think they put us all in the same package. Now, the DP\u2019s\nwho came, also didn\u2019t have the education, because Germany invited -- invaded, you\nknow, much earlier, and they looked at me, and I guess they thought we were stupid, and\nthey just put us in the same pot of the people who ga -- don\u2019t forget, during World War\nTwo, there was no immigration, and they put me to put piecework. And -- And I was\nraised with clothes handmade, hand finished. And I wanted to go back, but I couldn\u2019t\nbecause my laissez-passe was good for one year and it was hard. It was very had to -- t-to\nadjust to the way of life. I had trouble with some of the foods a little bit. I didn\u2019t have the\nbest facilities living with my aunt, because my cousin was still living at home, he wasn\u2019t\nmarried and I slept on the couch. I lived with my aunt for three months. And then I\nmoved in with a couple, she was British, he was a soldier in England, and he had married\na British girl. I eventually no -- moved with them. In those days, girls didn\u2019t rent\napartments. And he was the brother of a very close friend of mine, to this day, I\u2019m very,\nvery close, it\u2019s like family with me. And I lived with them, but the facilities, don\u2019t want\nto go into detail, couldn\u2019t -- 1-1t just -- just for a short time. And I had been introduced to\na -- a girl two year -- Esther, Esther Berkowitch, two years older than I was. And she\nknew of this couple who had a two family off Kinsmen, 154 in Kinsmen, and they had\ntwo rooms that they rented. Like I say, they didn\u2019t have apartments, we rented rooms, and\nthey were -- oh, I think they were about 80, even in those days, and they were ru --\nRussian immigrants, spoke very little English and they hesitated in taking in a girl in the\nroom, because, you know, werl washes her hair, puts bobby pins, in those days. But I did\nmove in with them, and I found a family, really. I got very close with one of their\ndaughter-in-law, and I lived there. I was dating very heavy and it worked out very nicely,\nbecause I spoke Yiddish fluently. And I went to work on the streetcar, and lived with\nthem until I got married, really. Until I got married in 1948, in November 1948, and I\nlived with them. And I adjusted. First of all, I did try to go back to visit my father, but\nafter the real hard adjustment was over, couldn\u2019t get a passport, cause I was not a Czech\nres -- citizen, I was not a Russian citizen, and I was not an American citizen. So I\ncouldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t get a passport, I couldn\u2019t travel.",
        "Q: How did -- So you had this pass to stay for a year, what happened after the years was\nup?",
        "A: Oh no, no, it was good for one year, it couldn\u2019t be renewed, it couldn\u2019t be renewed. I -\n- | mean, there was no way -- there was no way I could renew it, and -- and it was a te -- a\nt -- a temporary, quote, passport. I mean, only cer -- because I was migrating to the\nStates, so I couldn\u2019t get a passport.",
        "Q: Okay. So -- So the idea was you were to stay in the States until a certain amount of\ntime, when you would get -- be -- you said [indecipherable |",
        "A: [indecipherable] become an American citizen, which I couldn\u2019t wait, and I -- because I\nmarried an American citizen, if you were in the States one year, and married to an\nAmerican citizen one year at that time, you could become a citizen sooner than the five\nyear wait. So I got -- I became an American citizen in four years, as opposed to five\nyears, 1s what I did. But I was -- I came, what they call in French Sol nationalite\ndeterminet, which means I had no nationality. And I -- That was it. So I couldn\u2019t get a\npassport to go back and then I adjusted, and I made friends. I went to sorority meetings,\ndidn\u2019t understand a word, and concentrated on trying to understand. And I remember my\ngirlfriends used to burst out laughing every so often because of my French -- very, very\nFrench pronunciation. I -- Whatever it came out -- I found out years, years later, I met a\nyoung woman here in the complex who was from France, and she came for a short time,\nand for the -- bud -- my -- a few years ago, I was already speaking English fluently, even\nlost my French accent, and I heard her, with her pronunciation, and I says, \u201cNo wonder\nmy girlfriends used to burst out laughing.\u201d I learned -- I remember when I learned -- I\nused the word douche the first time. In French, a shower was a douche, so I took a\ndouche, and they were laughing, and I --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: I think she\u2019d go into my life and after the [indecipherable] because I went to school,\nand became a secretary.",
        "Q: Oh, okay. When did you do that?",
        "A: I married in \u201948. When my son was born in \u201951, we moved to Sandusky, Ohio, which\nis not far from here, Aceder Point, and we lived there for seven years. My husband\nbecame ill. I was working 1n the factory until shortly before my son was born. I had\nfemale trouble, he was born early, I had a difficult pregnancy. We moved to Sandusky,\nand we struggled. Financially, emotionally, but we made very good friends. I made some\nvery, very good friends in Sandusky. It\u2019s much developed since then. And there was no\npla -- we didn\u2019t have money, so we made friends, we babysat for each other. Spend -- We\nhad friends, we went for Christmas dinner, Easter dinner. There was a small Jewish\ncommunity, we were not active with it. We were turned down to go to services because\nwe didn\u2019t have money. That was also a slap in the face. And my hus became quite ill, was\nhospitalized, and I moved back to Cleveland. Tried to get back into the sewing industry,\nwent to Prinz beeterman, but the place had changed, ended up doing alterations in small\nstores. My son was young, went to Jewish Family Service, got no help. I very hurt\nfeelings and very -- not bitter any more, but -- and I went to work in small stores with\nalterations, which paid very, very little. My husband came out of the hospital, went into\npractice. I went to work for him, then he was hospitalized again for a very, very long\ntime. And I worked with a Social Worker, to cope with his illness, to cope with my child.\nI was very, very concerned about my child, and I worked with a Social Worker, and then\neventually with the child psychi -- my son was alright, but 1t was to help me cope, and to\ntry to keep him as even as can be. And it was through the help of a Social Worker, at the\nVA, that I had the guts to go to school, and take classes to become a secretary. I saw the\nwriting on the wall, I didn't know how long my husband would be ill, and I couldn\u2019t stay\nin the sewing industry, I worked for a small store, there were long layoffs, there were\nshort hours. And they didn\u2019t have the Social Security laws where you get Social Security\nfor -- for an ill person, 1t came later. And I went -- I went to Dyke first, and then I went to\nTri-C, because Dyke was expensive, and I finished off there. And I was working half a\nday, going to school, borrowed a tape machine, and I\u2019m talking an old tape, to -- to do my\nshorthand, which I never used eventually, anyway. Was very nervous, was very self-\nconscious, and it was through the help of a Social Worker that gave me enough\nconfidence to say -- you know, I was a foreign background, my accent was much heavier.\nI spoke English fluently, but I had never had real formal English. I went to Tri-C, took an\nEnglish class. Got me more confused than anything. And I ended up applying at\nUniversity Hospitals, couldn\u2019t pass the typing test, I was so nervous. I did pass the\nspelling test, but in those days I used to go -- in French they spell it this way, in English\nit\u2019s this way, I was still, because I hadn\u2019t worked with the English language. And I -- You\nhave to be at the right place at the right time, and they had someone who took care of\nsecretaries. I was coming out of school, I mean, I -- I had -- I had the certificates for\npassing the typing and everything, and I guess I made -- not I guess, I made an\nimpression on the head of personnel at the time. I was a foreign background, I was in the\nsewing industry, and in those days, adults didn\u2019t go back to school, very, very few, and I\nwent to Tri-C, I think I met one or two adults who went to school. And the doctor who\nhired me, he -- they told me later they felt sorry for me, because I guess I was very\nscared, I was very self-conscious. I was self-conscious of my English, and I thought I\nwould go to work. Even though I didn\u2019t pass the typing test, they sent me to three\ninterviews. I never made the third one, and I took this one. And I went -- I worked for\nhim for 10 years, because he left University Hospitals, and I was going to work three\nyears and better myself financially, but the work was so interesting, because there was\nresearch, because of the affiliation with Case West -- well, it was Western Reserve then,\nCase Western Reserve. And he left, and I stayed on for three years, and I julo -- just\nloved my work, the best thing I did was leaving the sewing industry. I was way down\nfinancially when my husband got sick. I -- His brother saved me with a few dollars. I\ndidn\u2019t have money to feed my kid at the time. I -- The sewing industry, I struggled -- I\ndid get some money, was it Social Security at the time, a little bit, and I managed to\nsurvive. And once I went into become a secretary, my su -- I was divorced, my husband\nwanted to -- the divorce, and my son went to live with him, and I got on my feet. And the\nbest thing I did was to leave the sewing industry. My mother used to say, \u201cIt\u2019s much\neasier to work with your brain, than to work with your back,\u201d which I couldn\u2019t see at the\ntime. And I worked in an environment that was intellectual, even though I was not much\nof an intellect, but I learned a lot. We had a lot of people coming and going and I just\nloved my work, because those were the days of the typewriters, we typed and we typed\nand we typed. And it so happened that everybody was foreign. The director was foreign,\nthe associate director was -- he was f -- grew up in Austria, the associate director was\nfrom Yugoslavia. We had a technician from India, with -- one time there was -- the\nsupervising technician was the only one who was an American person. And I ended up,\nfor some reason or other, my English was very, very good, and I started slowly editing\nthe manuscript. We\u2019re talking technical manuscript research. And first with the commas,\nand with the this, and slowly but surely, over the years, I edited from one paragraph to the\nother, from one part to the other, and I didn\u2019t allow him to put my name on as whatever\nhe produced, and produ -- the only place I allowed him to acknowledge me, he wrote a\nbook on babies born with birth defects in the brain, because I was secretary to the\nDivision of Neuropathology. And that\u2019s the only place my -- that I allowed him to\nrecognize m -- I used to tease him, I says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be affiliated with this.\u201d And\nthe work was very, very interesting. He left --",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Reinhart Friede. It was very interesting, because my name is Frida, but his was F-r-1-e-\nd-e, and only twice was there a mi-mix up, because I didn\u2019t hear the doctor in front of\nFriede, otherwise -- and I spell mine F-r-i-d-a. But, we -- only twice it happened that the\nnames were confused. And he was a very straight faced, he looked very stern, but oh, did\nwe have fun. I mean, we had technicians who were a lot of fun. I never lost a day\u2019s pay. I\nlearned to get on my feet, I learned to invest money, in a small way. And I ret -- And\nthen, they had a new director who came, who was a complete opposite, Dr. Gambetti. P.\nLuigi Gambetti, with such different personality, I thought I would never make it, and for\nthree years, it just didn\u2019t work, and his wife wa -- he\u2019s an MD, his wife is a Ph.D., and\nshe came, she\u2019s from South America, and it took three years to adjust, and to this day, I\ngo and I visit with them, I invite them for dinner. Their daughters came in from out of\ntown, I went. And I was able to say, \u201cDr. Gambetti, I don\u2019t understand Italian.\u201d And I\nwas able to close the door and say, \u201cYou have to hear me,\u201d because his mind was\nsomeplace else, and I was handling a lot, a lot of money on grants. And I retired from\nthere just in time, before -- as the health industry is changing, there\u2019s no more Division of\nNeuropathology, as far as the hospital is concerned. I had hospital work, and bulk of my\nwork was Case Western Reserve University, because of the research, and they eventually\nhired another secretary, she took my place as a matter of fact. And I ended up handling\ngrants, and I kept screaming, \u201cI trained to be a secretary, not a bookkeeper.\u201d Finally got\nthe stuff on the computer, and it was double work, because the computer did not\ncommunicate with the accounting department of Case Western Reserve University. So I\nwas projecting on the computer, and multiplying, but then I still had statements every\nmonth. And I just didn\u2019t like my work any more, because I didn\u2019t do the manuscripts.\nYou know, the word processors came out. I didn\u2019t read them over and over. Today they\nare all type, they are all manuscripts more or less, change them, you know, on the word\nprocessors. So it just wasn\u2019t the same and the set up with the administrators who are\nchanging, and I got out just in time. I don\u2019t think I could have survived it. But I learned a\nlot, my mind was working and he gave me a party when I retired, Dr. Gambetti. No\nsecretary had what I had. He -- Dr. Russman, the ass-associate director, had a daughter\nwho was doing, on the side or second job, or whate -- she did catering on her own, and\nwe went to the conference room in one of the -- in the Bowwell Center. And he gave me\na going away party with beef tenderloin, white wine, flowers, you name it. And I know\nwhat displeased me 1s I had to invite everybody in the -- in the Institute of Pathology,\neven the people I didn\u2019t care. I had to think of people from Case Western Reserve that I\nhad a lot of contact, from the hospital. I think I had about 100 - 110 people. And we had a\nstorm that day. My girlfriend from Beria never made it, they were iced in. And they\npresented me with a gift certificate that just about covered a cruise, because I told -- I was\nso tired, I was trying to wind up everything, not to leave loose ends, be -- by the time I\nleft, and it didn\u2019t work out. Everything changed afterwards, anyway. And that\u2019s the going\naway he gave me. I went shortly after, with a tray of candy and was able to write a note,\n\u201cT know it\u2019s because of you that I had this.\u201d Today they couldn\u2019t do it, because the money\nisn\u2019t there, but that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what I got as a going away for retiring. It was such a\ndifferent environment than the sewing industry, especially in the small shops. I worked in\n-- in the sewing industry I worked with, at the time, many Polish immigr -- DP\u2019s actually,\nwho had gone through anti-Semitism, the camps. And when you sew, your mind is not\noccupied, so they would tr -- you know, they would talk about different things. And they\n-- | was raised whatever I do is good enough, and I was not afraid of anything. I mean, tar\n-- | was a shy girl and everything, I mean, talk about what was left, after that I just\nblossomed out until I wasn\u2019t afraid of anything, and I wasn\u2019t afraid to speak back. And it\n-- the store I worked in, it was the couple who owned it. He was low key, she was -- I\ndon\u2019t know why these people were afraid of her, she used to come down and I don\u2019t\nknow. The bookkeeper was an American born American, and she thought she was\nsomething better than anybody else.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about the alteration store?",
        "A: The alterations, and the store, she -- I mean, I faced her -- I -- I was not -- I was not\nconcern, I mean I just put her straight. And I used -- I remember one time, I say, \u201cWhat\nare you afraid of?\u201d I says, \u201cWe all leave, they can\u2019t keep the store going, they need us.\u201d\nYou know, there was six or seven of us working there. So, when I left there, my biggest\npleasure was, as I was going to school and working there, and I decided I had to give up\nthe working, ya -- because I couldn\u2019t practice my typing. I did well in shorthand, but not\nin typing, and I just couldn\u2019t keep up. My husband was hospitalized out of town, and I\nwas driving back and forth on the weekend. And my biggest pleasure was when I went in\nand I was hired, through University Hospitals, I bought a used car, and I went in, because\nI had befriended -- her name 1s -- was Litta Ridman, she was 80 years old at the time.\nAnd I came in with the keys, and I said -- not knowing what I was walking into, I said,\n\u201cI\u2019m secretary to the professor of neuropathology at Western Reserve University,\u201d and\nwas it Fran, the bookkeeper or was it the owner Mr. Philips, who say, \u201cWhat\u2019s\nneuropathology?\u201d And as a foreigner, it made me feel so gra, because I don\u2019t know why,\nin the small stores, they just -- they try to -- to make you look down. And the head fitter\nwas a German woman, Jewish woman, who knew less than I did in alterations, I guess,\nfor some reason or other, she had learned, and really was -- at times she was alright. She\nhad a husband who had MS or something. She had problems, but I just put my foot down,\nbecause I said, \u201cShe has problems, so do I.\u201d\u201d And I remember a couple times, I took a\ngown and I threw it at her, because I knew more than she did as far -- nobody could take\naway the sewing from me. Took me a hard time struggling to become a secretary because\nI was confident in sewing, but not as a secretary. B-Yet after working there, it worked out\nall right. I mean, I was confident, I was comfortable, I was respected and I worked in an\nenvironment that, you know, the hospi -- 1t wasn\u2019t even the hospital, it really is\npathology, neuropathol -- you know, you get cornered in one small division -- where I\nwas respected, and there -- there -- there ca -- there th -- you had MD\u2019s, Ph.D.\u2019s, and very\nplay -- you know, nobody put on the air, you were accepted, on -- on -- on -- on a same\nlevel. So I -- I worked myself out, and I started, quote, living. It\u2019s not a full life. My son\nwent off to Kent, married. I have three beautiful granddaughters. One just graduated from\nhigh school. She is off to college in va -- in Virginia, she\u2019s off to college. Alicia just\nturned 18, Whitney will be 16 in September, and Erica, the little one, just was Bats\nMitzvahed in May. And I hoped to go back and forth to Virginia, really. Besides, I\u2019ve\nbeen traveling on a trip, a big trip once a year. And it\u2019s hard to see my grandchildren\ngrow up, because I look at them and think to myself, \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s the age I was\nthat Germans walked in on that time.\u201d And things are surfacing, I guess, that maybe I\npushed back, that I didn\u2019t want to face. I have guilt feelings, when things are very, very\nbad for me. Not lately, so much. When I\u2019ve gone through difficult times, I have felt that I\nwas being punished, that I deserved it, because I didn\u2019t suffer the same as my family did.\nAnd it -- it just happens every so often, and I think what I\u2019m going to do now 1s try to call\nit quote, finalize. I\u2019m going to look into a trip to go [indecipherable] feeling -- and I know\nthere\u2019s nothing there, to go to yadva -- to -- not to Yad Vashem, to Auschwitz, just to get\nit out of my system. And for many years, I thought, oh maybe my sister is floating around\nsomeplace, and doesn\u2019t know where she is. And I think, as I get older, I realize how alone\nI am. I have no sisters, I have no nieces. My husband comes from a ra -- broken family,\nand I have no nieces and nephews. The fe -- cousins that I have -- I have one that I\u2019m\npretty close with. But he\u2019s quite ill now, 1s -- as it is, their children live in the same area\nwhere my son lives, all three of them. But I have, as far as family, family, but I ha -- I\nhave no close ties. But I have -- still have friends from -- I met when I came to the States.\nMy girlfriend Esther, with whom I\u2019m very, very close, died many, many years ago, of\nbreast cancer. Many years ago. And I have two of the -- the girls that I met from the\nsorority that I consider family. I go there -- I -- I\u2019m not invited, I\u2019m expected. But what\nhappens, we\u2019re all getting older, so now the children are doing the holidays and it so\nhappen they\u2019re out of town. So, my life is changing a little bit, you know, as far as that\u2019s\nconcerned. But they\u2019re -- they\u2019re two friends -- I have other ones too, that I can depend\non, and I consider family, but you realize, I don\u2019t know why, it scares me sometimes,\nbecause I don\u2019t want to get depressed, I don\u2019t want to run into -- to the elderly lev -- you\nknow, left alone or something like that. And -- And to feel, you know, I do -- I do get\ndown, but everybody does at one time or other. I seem to overcome it, and I\u2019m very\nthankful for what I have, really. I\u2019m comfortable financially. I take one big trip, at least\nonce a year. Went to the -- a national parts la -- parks last year with a friend. The year\nbefore, I was in France. I have plans to go to Iceland in September. I\u2019ve gone with Elder\nHostel, and I go for short trips to an Elder Hostel with a friend, or I\u2019ve gone by myself. I\nwent to Equador by myself, had a strange room mate, the same thing to France, and that\u2019s\nabout it, really. But the guilt -- the guilt -- the guilt is there, the guilt is. Although I don\u2019t\nface real hard times, like when my husband was ill, and things came up, and it\u2019s a\nterrible, terrible feeling. I used to also shudder when I used to hear the airplanes, when\nthey had the propellers, but now they have the jets. But I -- When the airplanes used to\ngo, I just -- just absolutely shuddered, but now with the prope -- with the jets, you don\u2019t\nget it, so I -- I don\u2019t feel 1t any more. I don\u2019t quite have the nightmares I used to -- to\nhave. I guess I\u2019m settling, I guess. Trying to enjoy my grandchildren. Not one of them\nbelongs to me, they all take after the father\u2019s side of the family, their grandfather, and the\nmiddle one takes after her mother\u2019s side of the family, because one 1s strawberry blonde,\ntwo redheads. And the eyes and the shapes, there isn\u2019t one that belongs to my side of the\nfamily, nothing\u2019s come out. But, make the best of it. So, I\u2019m not unhappy, it\u2019s maybe not\na full life, but I\u2019m contented, make the best of it, you know.",
        "Q: I have few questions. One is, if you\u2019re -- just talking about your idea of going to\nAuschwitz to get -- to get it out of your system --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and I -- and I -- it reminded me of what you said about after you arrived in the U.S.,\nand -- and your aunt had wanted you go and say yisker for your mother --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and you weren\u2019t ready, because you didn\u2019t want to bury her.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Is this kind of like saying I\u2019m ready to -- to bury her, or did that ever happen?",
        "A: I -- ?'m -- You know, first of all, when I went back to Belgium, 10 years after I came -\n- a year after my father died, my aunt brought up some of the ho-horrors, which I didn\u2019t\nwant to listen to. And then people started talking about the Holocaust. I never -- When I\ntalked about it, I talked about my years in hiding, things like that. I did not talk about\nwhat happened in the concentration camps. When it really, really surfaced is when I was\ninterviewed for the museum, and I had to bring all that up. I had to dig in on -- oh, and I\nsaw -- I saw Rachelle in Israel, spent a -- a night -- a day with her. I dug into a lot of\nthings, and then I worked with a young man, I can\u2019t think -- I have his name written\ndown, and he sent me -- I have the papers that show the number of th -- their records that\nwere kept in Liege, of the numbers of the transport. And I guess -- No, I think I\u2019ve\naccepted it, I just -- I just -- there\u2019s some -- I don\u2019t know if Pll go, but I\u2019m going to look\ninto it, just to -- I don\u2019t know what good it\u2019ll do just to -- I don\u2019t know why, I mean it\u2019s\nnot going to do any good. There\u2019s very little left, I\u2019m aware of it. And maybe go and see\neastern Europe, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know why I have to do it. But I\u2019ve accepted a long\ntime ago, if you can accept some -- something like that, there\u2019s still -- I don\u2019t know, some\nfeelings or something. And now, with the grandchildren sometimes asking questions, it --\nit has -- it has to -- it has to be accepted. I mean, there\u2019s no two ways about it.",
        "Q: What do your grandchildren ask you?",
        "A: That\u2019s interesting. Not much, not much, not much.",
        "Q: You were mentioning earlier that -- that one of them is particularly interested.",
        "A: The little one has asked me -- excuse me -- more questions. Sh -- I had her in the car\nwith me, by myself, and she said, \u201cYour mother died,\u201d or something like that, and she\nstarted asking me -- when she just did a -- a project on immigration, and I gave her all the\npapers, and she did ask me why I left my father, which was very hard for me to explain.\nYou know, there\u2019s -- there were such hard feelings, there\u2019s no -- no need to bring it up\nany more, it\u2019s in -- in the past, and I just told her my father thought it was better for me to\nbe with my aunt. She\u2019s asked me more questions. Alicia, I guess through projects in\nschool, I remember I had to tell her something, and I can\u2019t remember what. Whitney, the\nmiddle one, has never asked me any questions, but that doesn\u2019t mean anything. My son\nnever asked questions either. I did hide the pictures, because everybody had died, and yet,\nwhen he le -- heard about -- that\u2019s how I found out about the museum, and he told me\nabout it, he apparently was very well aware of it, and what\u2019s interesting is he named --\nWhitney, the middle one -- I don\u2019t know how you -- they ended up with Whitney after\nmy mother, he said that it should always be remembered. And even when the girls have\nthe Bats Mitzvah, he does bring up that my family perished in the Holocaust. It\u2019s\ninteresting, because I was never very traditional. He was not Bar Mitzahed, but he\nbecame very close with the temple, and the -- the girls are very -- course, well, he became\ninvolved somehow or other, even though I never pushed it. And I did all this for my\nchildren, so lot of things surfaced when I did the interviews, and things. As a matter of\nfact, my son, when he was in Kent -- I didn\u2019t mention it, when he went to Kent, they had\nthe Yom Kippur war, and he raised money for 1 -- for 1 -- for Israel. He and his room\nmate, they lived in the Hillel House, the Hi-Hillel had rented a house and he -- and he\u2019s\nstill friends with this guy, occupied the third floor, the upstairs. And they raised money\nfor Israel. They made the national news as a matter of fact, because they raised money for\n-- he had -- it was a ham operator and when he told me was president of Hillel, I almost\nflipped because, I mean, you know, so I guess even though I was not traditional in\nkeeping the holidays, so to speak, and things like that, there\u2019s some Jewishness in him\nand the girls are -- went through Bats Mitzvah and everything like that, so something is\nprojected on him. And it\u2019s hard to tell with Alicia how much she feels or how much she\ndoes or -- you never know, and first of all, they live long distance. Maybe if they lived in\ntown, it would be different, I don\u2019t know. Whitney\u2019s the only one who never asked, but\nshe\u2019s the quiet one.

        "Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Frida Wallenstein.",
        "A: -- and so, you know.",
        "Q: You\u2019re doing very well, but I know it\u2019s hard. I appreciate you doing it. I wanted to ask\nyou about -- about speaking, too, because you were mentioning about your -- the\ntestimony that you did for the Holocaust Museum. I believe that was in 1990.",
        "A: I think so. [inaudible]",
        "Q: And -- And you mentioned that it was -- that it was difficult to talk about it. Was that\nthe first time that you had sat down and -- and tried to tell your story, through, of what\nhad happened?",
        "A: Yes, that was the first time. That was the very first time, and I really had to dig, and\nyou know, sh -- I remember her saying, \u201cHow did you feel?\u201d I had to stop and think, I\nmean, how did I feel? I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not things that I think about. So you have to dig\nup all these memories and all these feelings. How did you feel? I -- I don\u2019t know how I\nfelt, I had to stop and think. Was I scared? Sure, we were scared at times. What did I feel\nwhen my mother -- when I found out about my mother being deported? I remember\ncrying in Brussels, I remember, and Madame Freidman forced me to go to -- I hated her,\nbut she forced me to go to the shul, she thought it would be better for me. You float\naround, you have no thoughts. Why I came to the States? Who knows? I have no idea -- I\nreally don\u2019t know, you -- you do things, you -- you don\u2019t think. I -- I didn\u2019t have an\naverage teenage life. I mean, I look at my grandchildren and I don\u2019t know what I would\nhave done. Of course, no matter what war, not war, every generation 1-1s different The\nkids are so much more aware than we were. There\u2019s television, there\u2019s e-mail, there\u2019s\ninternet. I mean, they\u2019re -- we didn\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t -- We didn\u2019t question, we didn\u2019t\nask. I mean, children were to be seen and not heard, so I don\u2019t know, don\u2019t remember\nanything. So, I have to dig in, to really stop and think, and remember things. I know -- I\ndon\u2019t even know if we were really cousin, my c -- we refer to her as cousin, her name is\nalso Frida. She lived in Belgium. I came to the States, and I found out years later that she\nwent to Israel. She married -- She married a French Algerian and she lives in Paris, and\nI\u2019ve seen her twice, and then we dig into things and some things she remembers and\nsome things I remember. But the first time this came about -- I don\u2019t think it did the\nsecond time, she -- she had to wake me up during the night because I had nightmares.\nWhen I was in Paris two years ago, and my cousin Miriam came in from Brussels, we\nspend the day together, she had questions about her father and thing. And I had to stop\nand think, because we grew up as -- we didn\u2019t question, you know. Turn it off.",
        "Q: Is th -- Have you -- Did you find, when you did your testimony for the Holocaust\nMuseum in 1990, was it important to you in some way, to have talked about it?",
        "A: I did it originally to -- to -- what made me do it, because my son wanted me to do it. I\nthink until then, I did not appreciate the importance of having testimonies, you know, so\nthat, well, the non-believers will never believe it happened, but that there should be\nsomething that -- from survivors, t-to prove that these things really existed. I never\nthought of it in those terms before, never thought of it until Mark called me. As a matter\nof fa -- I didn\u2019t think they would take my -- my -- my story, because when he first told\nthem, I says, \u201cMark, they won\u2019t be interested, because I was not 1n the concentration\ncamps.\u201d But apparently it was more than just for -- from people in the concentration\ncamps, so -- but I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t see the importance of it until -- until then. And -- And\nnow, with the girls getting older, the grandchildren getting older and asking questions,\nand things like that, I feel it\u2019s important that there\u2019s testimony, what it -- what will\nhappen years later, I don\u2019t know. Look what\u2019s happening in Yugosla -- it still goes on, it\ndoesn\u2019t stop it, but at least there\u2019s proof, whoever wants to believe it, to know that it\nreally happened. And we\u2019re slowly dying off, so there isn\u2019t -- you know, a lot of people\nhave died since, and cannot testify.",
        "Q: And for yourself, personally, was it important in any way, or is it not?",
        "A: I never -- I never thought of it as being important for me. I only thought of it as being\nimportant for my -- for my son, and for my grandchildren, is -- I felt it was important. I,\nfor myself, I mean, no, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t think of it that way, anyway, no. And I\u2019m doing\nthis also because of that, because it\u2019s very difficult, you have to dig up memories that are\nvery difficult, you have to dig up feelings, you have to expose your feelings. I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] You were talking a little earlier about your -- your work, in the\ndoctor\u2019s office, and I just wanted to know when -- when you started that work, and -- and\nwhen you retired?",
        "A: I retired December, 1991, the end of the year. I worked for 27 years. When did I start?\n1975 - 1976, is when I started, yeah.",
        "Q: And then -- And then, before that, you were talking about how you had -- you\u2019d\nworked in the -- in -- in alterations, and that you had had trouble with -- when you were\nlooking for work, is it -- as a seamstress, was it the Jewish Social Services, or -- did you\nfind that -- that, during that time when you were struggling to find work, were y -- did\nyou feel that you were being discriminated against in some way, or not respected, or what\nwas --",
        "A: No, no, y-you mean, the w -- to find work? I had no trouble finding work in\nalterations. That was wide open. There was no money in it, that\u2019s what made me leave.\nBec -- I didn\u2019t go for the department stores for some reason or other. I went to the small\nshops, and sewing industry is predominantly Jewish, and I worked with, you know, a -- in\n-- in those days, DP\u2019s. I mean, today it\u2019s entirely different. I left because first of all my\nmind -- your -- y-your mind 1s not occupied, so you talk, and you bring up things. I was\nhaving problems because my husband was ill at the time, and -- and y-you have too much\ntime -- y-your mind 1s free. In other words, your hands are busy, but not your mind. And I\nneeded a better income than doing alterations. As a matter of fact, I just bought\nsomething in one of the department stores, and I had a pair of pants shortened, because I\ndon\u2019t have the -- the mach -- my machine is old and it doesn\u2019t have some of the stuff that\nI need. And I -- I don\u2019t sew any more, and I did talk to the -- the woman who fitted me.\nIt\u2019s -- I asked her -- she\u2019s from Greece, I don\u2019t know what her background 1s, and I let her\nknow that I was a fitter, cause the first one I had was terrible, was somebody new, new in\nthe country and I knew she was not a fitter. And I asked for a real fitter. Anyway, she\ncame and she said she was from Greece, and I let her know the training, and you know,\nmy background. And I said I luckily left it, because they didn\u2019t pay. And she did tell me\nthat it pays much better. I says, but not as well, probably, as the tailors, because the\ntailors supported the families, even if they did alteration, and she said yes, it was on the\nsame par. So I guess things have changed. I don\u2019t know which -- at which point in life,\nbut at the time -- at the time I did alterations, I even -- I did well. The dress shop where I\nhad worked before I went to school, I -- they were paying a dollar and a quarter an hour, I\ngot a dollar and a half. I ti -- he asked me to come and help. And I went -- A friend of\nmine, who was a secretary says, \u201cFrida,\u201d she says --I was very nervous, very self-\nconscious about becoming a secretary, I -- my foreign background, and this and that. And\nshe said, \u201cGo on temporaries, that\u2019s a good way to start.\u201d And I got a job for one day at --\nata TV station. And I remember -- What did I make? In -- th -- Mr. Philips called me\nback. Oh, and I said, \u201cUnless you pay me two dollars an,\u201d -- oh yeah, they were paying\nme two dollars an hour, temporary. I didn\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t do anything, I di -- and he --\nhe never -- he never took me, so -- and there were long layoff seasons. They weren\u2019t fair\nin the way they were laying off people. M -- Talking small store, and if I was five\nminutes late, I lost the five minutes. And I went to work for University Hospitals, for\nsome reason or other, I don\u2019t remember what I paid for bread yesterday, but I -- that was\ntwo dollars an hour, even at 40 hours, which I didn\u2019t put in, it would have been 80\ndollars, and I was --what did I earn? Oh, wait a minute. I want -- I wa -- I was earning so\nmuch more it was unbelievable. I mean, there\u2019s no comparison, and like I say, and a -- I\nretired with a pension, which I -- I don\u2019t know if the stores do it, and the small stores are\nslowly disappearing. They can\u2019t survive with all the -- all this -- chain stores, so that\u2019s\nwhat made me leave, I knew I had to support myself in a different way and I said, I don\u2019t\ncare what I do, I never, never want to face what I faced when my son was seven year old,\nwhere I did not have money to go buy food to feed him. And it never happened again, so\nJ -- I -- I had illnesses, I had surgeries, I never lost a day\u2019s work which wouldn\u2019t have\nhappened in those days in the sewing industry. And the factories, th-the sewing factories,\nthe garment far -- factory had slowly, over the years, moved south for -- for lower wages,\nand now, of course, they come from overseas, so I had to get out of -- of that\nenvironment. And whether the department stores pay better, I don\u2019t know. Sometimes I\nthink I should wan -- go back for a little bit part time, just to learn to deal with the new\nfabrics, and the new things. I still -- I still, I think, have a touch for it. I went through a\nperiod where I sewed all my clothes, I\u2019m very had to fit. But you can\u2019t get the fabrics in\nCleveland any more. There\u2019s one fabric shop left, but you da -- can\u2019t get the fine wools,\nand the silks, and the -- I can\u2019t even knit, because there are no knit shops. I can\u2019t get the\nyarns, or anything like that. That\u2019s what I miss. But I have no regret that I went to -- to\nwhere -- to what I did, the environment was entirely different.",
        "Q: What year was your son born?",

        "Q: And you were married when?",
        "A: I was married novem -- wait a minute, I was married November nine, 1946.",
        "Q: How did you meet your husband?",
        "A: A girlfriend went someplace, and my husband was there and I don\u2019t know, somehow\nor other, something came up about my speaking French, and he had studied French, and\nthat\u2019s how -- he called me, and that\u2019s how I met him. I was going with someone from\nSouth Bend, Indiana at the time. I remember going by train to South Bend, Indiana. I had\na distant cousin there, where I had spent some time, and I had met somebody. That\u2019s how\nI met my husband, to a girlfriend -- through a girlfriend. And he called me because he\nhad studied French, and he remembered. He has a fantastic memory. And that\u2019s how I\nmet him.",
        "Q: What was his profession?",
        "A: He was podiatrist. He was in school at the time. He was in school, he had two mo -- it\nwas supposed to be one year, and the year he was there, he -- they extended the class to\ntwo years. And graduated, and he went into podiatry. But in those days they were called\nchiropodists, and they didn\u2019t have -- they were very limited on what they could do, you\nknow. No surgery, they couldn\u2019t even prescribe an aspirin or anything like that. And we\nmoved to Sandusky and then just -- no matter how hard he tried it, 1t never -- 1t never\ntook off. That\u2019s why we came back to Cleveland. His illness, and then whatever. And\nthen I couldn\u2019t go to work in Sandusky because I was married to a doctor and I didn\u2019t\nhave a profession. And it was through somebody I had befriended there, that she\nsuggested I do alterations at home, and I says, \u201cWait a minute, I don\u2019t do alterations, I\u2019m\na dressma -- I know how to make a garment, but I don\u2019t know alternations.\u201d And it was\nthrough her -- I would make hems and things like that, and I made a little bit of money on\nthe side. And that\u2019s how I went into alterations when I came back to Cleveland, because I\ntried the sewing factory, but the sewing industry was not the same, I couldn\u2019t earn money\nor -- or anything like that. And I couldn\u2019t ear-earn enough to support my son. And\neventually, the Social Security laws came out, so I was able to earn, and I got Social\nSecur -- just as I got my job at University Hospitals, I got Social Security for him and for\nmy son, until he reached, you know, age where they didn\u2019t give it. So that helped me,\nbecause I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t survive on what I was making. I was a -- making 80 -- 80\nsomething dollar -- 80 -- was it 86 dollars a week, or something. 87.50, now I remember,\na week. As opposed to a dollar and a quarter, or a dollar and a half an hour. And then I\nhad benefits. I had sick days. And when -- I used to get sick every three weeks, not every\nmonth, I needed a day off. I was, you know, in bed. So, a-all together, it worked out very\nnicely. And it was a different environment. I never thought of going into an intellectual\nbackground, but it was marvelous. I mean, it was very enlightening. We had what they\ncall now Research Associate they call them. People who came from different countries\nfor two years, to do research. So you had a very diversified background, and it was very -\n- it was very good, it was very enlightening, 1t was not backbreaking, you know. If I had\nstayed in the sewing industry, I\u2019m pretty sure I wouldn\u2019t be even living here, even though\nit\u2019s not high rent or anything. I would -- I would be on subsidi -- I would have to be in\nsubsidized apartments. Nothing wrong with it, I know a lot of people in it, but at least \u2019'm\nfree to come and go, and -- as I want, and live where I want, and --",
        "Q: [inaudible]",
        "A: Course, yeah, that came out of my tape, I know. I did not feel different at any time for\nbeing Jewish while I grew up in Belgium.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, yeah, that did come out.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That did come out, because that is very true.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Go ahead.",
        "Q: Well, I -- we were just talking a little bit off tape about your experience in coming to\nthe -- to the U.S. and I wondered if you would talk a little bit about that again, about the\nreligion question.",
        "A: Oh. Oh, I -- I knew I was coming to a melting spot. I mean, I didn\u2019t understand the --\nthe -- the real details, or anything like that. I knew, even with the -- with the slavery, but\ndidn\u2019t understand the full extent of it, until I lived with it and was exposed to it. And\nwhen I would go someplace and fill out a -- when I went to Lampole, which is -- was a\nsewing factory, one of the big ones in Cleveland, and I was shocked that they ask what\nmy nationality was. And when I told -- I don\u2019t remember who I told, my family,\nsomebody, I said, \u201cI marked Czechoslovakia.\u201d And they said, \u201cYou should have said\nJewish.\u201d I says, \u201cJewish is a religion, it\u2019s not a nationality.\u201d I had to argue wh-why are\npeople so conscious of what religion somebody is. I will discuss the differences if I have\na-an -- an intelligent conversation. I worked with an Indian girl, you know, from India. I\nworked with a Black -- what they call a-an African American girl, and that was the\nbeginning of -- where the -- the Blacks were, you know, being absorbed, and things like\nthat, and talk openly -- I will talk about it. But, people will say to me about somebody,\n\u201cAre they ja -- is he, or is she Jewish?\u201d I says, \u201cIt never entered my mind to ask.\u201d\nBecause I take a person the way they are an-an-and I -- and I don\u2019t think what are they. I\ncouldn\u2019t understand, also, why they went into ethnic backgrounds, but I\u2019m learning, I\u2019m\nlearning. It\u2019s interesting to find what is their background, you know, where their parents\ncame from, because those are cultures. That I can understand. We\u2019ll discuss the -- I -- I\nwould like to take a class in comparative religion, because I don\u2019t know anything about\nthe Islamic religion, and I think it\u2019s very interesting, they all have their points. And that is\nsomething that really amazed me, w -- and at the time, I did not understand what\u2019s the\ndifference what my nationality is, but now I understand. It\u2019s just -- I just took a class on\nimmigration, through the elder campus at Tri-C, and the professor was very, very\ninteresting. He happened to be Slov-Slovenian? Yeah. And he had taught at Case\nWestern Reserve and everything. And we reached a point about the bilingual, the\nSpanish. And I told him he opened my eyes. I always felt, wait a minute, I spoke French,\nnobody bothered to have things translated in French, explain -- I had to learn English.\nEverybody who came had to learn English. And he pointed out to -- to us that Spanish,\nyou take Mexico, Texas, they were the Spanish people, and the British were stronger, so\nthe -- the English wa -- language prevailed, and everything Anglican took over. And I\nlooked at him, and I says -- he said, \u201cOh, they didn\u2019t emigrate. They were forced into\nbecoming part of the -- you know, of ameri -- part of the United States, and the English\nlanguage was dumped into them, but that\u2019s taking away what is right for them.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cOkay, now I understand, now I\u2019m willing to accept that it should be, if necessary,\nbilingual.\u201d First of all, it wouldn\u2019t hurt, but you think, \u201cWait a minute, I barely spoke any\nEnglish, I had to learn English.\u201d But I can see their point, and I knew that the streets were\nnot paved with gold, that much I knew. How hard it was to work, I don\u2019t know, I was\nnever made to [indecipherable] work, the factory flabbergasted me, because there were\nrows of machines, and it was piecework, and I was used to have one garment at the time,\nhand finished. I remember going with my girlfriend Elaine shopping for clothes and what\nI used to do is turn everything inside out to see if it was finished. And she didn\u2019t want to\ngo shopping, because even in those days, everything, you know, was -- was unfinished on\nthe inside. And I learned to -- to do piecework. And then you had the oil that went around\nconstantly around the machine. They also had -- They didn\u2019t have a lunchroom, per se,\nthey had a room where you brought your lunch, and -- and you ate in that back room. But\nyou have to realize in the sewing factories, in the summertime, you worked on winter\nclothes. Wool, the lint. And we always changed clothes. I had what they call wrap\naround, they don\u2019t see them any more. And I was just flabbergasted that that were the\ncircumstances. I wanted to take up dressmaking and dress designing again, and the\nforeman, Mr. Harris, I remember his name, said to me, \u201cFrida, don\u2019t waste your time in\nCleveland, you have to go to New York.\u201d And then I met my husband and I got married,\nso I never went through with it. But I had learned through somebody about Prinz\nbeeterman. They made suits and coats, and they made a better garment. Some things were\nstill finished by hand. And I had put an application in and I think I had put an application\nfor hand sewing for some reason or other, and they never called me. And somebody -- I\nran into somebody who said they were hired. So I re-contacted Prinz beeterman, and I\nwent to work there where the conditions were much, much better. I made a lot more\nmoney by the hour. I was making a dollar something at Prinz beeterman, I went -- I mean\nat Lampoles. Went to Prinz beeterman, and I went up as high as three dollars something\nan hour piecework. And we had a lunchroom and everything. So the -- the environment\nwas entirely -- entirely different. It was whiter, 1t was cleaner. And you have to realize,\nyou worked in the sewing factory, sometimes it reached a hundred degrees in the work\nroom. I think one of the -- 1t was a si -- a knit factory, I can\u2019t think of the name, they were\nnot far from where we were on Euclid, and they moved in the suburbs, and they had air\nconditioning, but we didn\u2019t. And then I was told at -- how bad it was -- I don\u2019t know what\nyears it was, where they had the fire in New York, in the garment factories, because of\nthe condition and they didn\u2019t care about their people. So these are the things that -- I think\nthat awed me that -- I don\u2019t know. And then I used to think, oh, I reached a point in my\nlife I used to think, wonder what my life would have been if I would have stayed in\nBelgium? I don\u2019t think I would have struggled as hard as I did after I came to the States.\nThe hardest part, financially, was when my husband was ill and hospitalized, first for six\nmonths, then he was all right for three years, went back into practice. I worked for him.\nAn -- B-But the first time with no money -- I mean, no money. Two months behind in the\nrent, utilities, you name it. And I had no one to turn to. I must say that the small Jewish\ncommunity in Sandusky rallied, and somebody came to my -- to the house and ask me if I\nneeded anything. As it is, I didn\u2019t need it, because my husband\u2019s brother gave us 500\ndollars, we -- which helped me overcome the worst of it, and then I sold the house. I\ndidn\u2019t make any money on it, but I salvaged some money and moved to Cleveland, which\na -- I figured, I wonder -- the rent was 90 - 96 dollars, and then they raised it 10 dollars.\nAnd I figured, as long as the money lasts, Pll stay there. And it turned out all right. My\nhusband came out of the hospital, went into practice and we got on our feet, quote,\nfinancially, and managed to survive. And then -- I wasn\u2019t wealthy, but I was -- I had my\nhead above water. And my concern was always, I left an eight year old child at home\nalone while I went to work. He had no way of reaching me at the factory. And luckily, it\nwas through some friends who lived in the same complex, that I knew they kept an eye\non Mark. Like, he came home for lunch, and I would prepare his lunch, and I had a little\nTV tray -- table so he could have it, and years, years later, I -- some people would made\ncomment because he went to Kent State University, and when he\u2019d come home, I would\nhave a glass of milk, and I would have a sandwich wrapped, and people used to make\ncomments about it, and I said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t have what I had, where I had to leave a child\nto come home to an empty house.\u201d I hate when -- I -- I like when people have comments,\nand my daughter-in-law teased for the longest time, because Mark was terrible in the\nmorning, I couldn\u2019t get him out of bed. And the only way I could get him to sit up wa -- I\nused to squeeze fresh orange juice, and I would go and say, \u201cMark,\u201d and I would hand\nhim a glass of orange juice. And that got -- that got him sitting up in bed. But the -- the\nfinancial difficulties were really, really bad. I don\u2019t think I thought of that time of even\ngoing back or anything. I also -- There were some hard feeling that I n -- that I never,\nnever cleared my mind, is my father adored children. He never came to see his grandson.\nI did want to go back, and they offered me the fare for a boat or something, but I never\ntold my father that I didn\u2019t have any money and how badly I was struggling financially.\nWhen I went back a year after he died, my uncle -- my father\u2019s brother Josef was still\nliving, and she said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever tell your father?\u201d And I guess I had too much\npride. I never told him, I never -- and I understand he died, he had established his\nbusiness. My father died a well-to-do man, but I never -- I never asked for anything. I\nguess we were raised --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: Did you -- This is tape number three, side B. Did you ever see your father again then,\nafter you left?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. It was a Friday, early in the morning, we lived in Sandusky, and I got a\nphone call, it was the telegram office. Didn\u2019t speak French. My uncle was sending me a\ntelegram, and they said in French, \u201cTon pere decee,\u201d and that\u2019s when I screamed, because\nthey were saying my father was deceased, and I screamed, and my husband came to the\nphone. I had no money, I had no passport, and I never went, I never saw him again,\nnever. And I went back a year later. And I went -- I saw his widow. I found out that my\nfather was very unhappily married. He had imported a woman from Czechoslovakia. You\nknow, must say this, when I came to the States, the Americans thought Europeans were\nnot discriminating because, well, we had a couple African from Belgium Congo, but you\ndidn\u2019t have the discrimination against the Black population, like here. But you wonder\nwhy there is a war going on in Yugoslavia? My father wouldn\u2019t have touched a Polish\nwoman. The -- The Czechs didn\u2019t like the Polish, the -- the Polish didn\u2019t like the\nLithuanian, I mean the -- 1-1-1t\u2019s th-the ethnic background, it\u2019s amazing, it does exist. And\nshe told me he never wa -- came. He walked around with my mother\u2019s pictures and my\nsister\u2019s pictures. And I went in to see her because my father had a ring from my mother,\nand I wanted it. And I thought, if she\u2019s wearing it, I was going to take it. She wasn\u2019t\nwearing it. And they had a couple things that were salvaged from -- I guess when my\nmother was taken away. I don\u2019t even know who stored them, never found out, never\nasked. And I guess everything came, and I took the train back to Brussels because my\nUncle Josef had moved to Brussels, and the only family I had was in Brussels. But I had\ngone to Li\u00a2ge because my father, very shortly, maybe two weeks before he died, had\nmade out a will leaving everything to his wife. And I found out that in Belgium you\ncannot disinherit a child. S -- Thr-Through a school friend in Li\u00e9ge, I -- with whom I was\nstill corresponding, she got me a lawyer. I got a few dollars, not much. I did go back to\nBelgium, but I had to go to Brussels, because my uncle was there, but the lawyer was in\nLiege. And of course, I walked in on my father\u2019s widow, and she did not know I was\ncoming. And I guess walking and seeing just a -- a couple personal belongings -- she did\ngive me the linens my mother had made by hand, I still have them, as her trousseau when\nshe was a young girl. And Ill never forget I went back to Belgium and it was dusk, and I\nwas sitting in the living room, and I was crying. And my aunt came in, and she says,\n\u201cWhat are you crying like an imbecile?\u201d And I just could not -- I could not relate to her.\nShe\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know, she raves about her -- she\u2019s crazy about her son, her daughter, I\ndon\u2019t know. And th -- She doesn\u2019t have the warmth. And she went through -- after they\nstarted picking up the Jews, they ended up in southern France. They did have a hard time,\nthey didn\u2019t go out to camps, because -- I remember they said in one camp they deported\nthe Hungarians, so they said they were Czech, and then the other camp they said deported\nthe Czech, so they said they were Hungarian. So they managed to survive. They had two\nchildren. And I don\u2019t know what kind of camps they were, because I never asked. Her --\nMy aunt\u2019s family, she had a mother, a father, two sisters and a brother. When the\nGermans invaded Belgium, they got on a train -- see, we tried to go to -- to France, we\ndidn\u2019t know they were going to invade France, her family got on a train, and the whole\nfamily was killed from the bombing, from the Germans. But yet, when I fell apart at the\nseams and came back to Brussels, and I was crying. I just couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t explain to\nher, I was exposed to -- t-t-to -- to -- to my war years, to -- to -- to -- you know, living in\nthe States, I put everything in the back. I -- I -- I guess maybe I did it intentionally, I\ndidn\u2019t think of those things. You push something out of your way, push things out of your\nmind, didn\u2019t face what really happened in the camps. And here I was, and I went back\nand all this faced me, and everything surfaced, and she just couldn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think she\ncould appreciate it. So that\u2019s the hard time I went through. And I did tell her -- she\nwanted to know why I didn\u2019t come as soon as my father died, because we had a business,\nand his widow emptied th-th-the stocks and things, so she didn\u2019t pay the taxes the way it\nshould, and I -- who even thought of it? As difficult a time as I had with my father after\nthe war, he was a fantastic father as children. During the war he -- he -- we -- we had\neverything. My father did Black Market. We never went hungry. He -- When he used to -\n- to go to the farmers and bring eggs and butter and salt on his bicycle, and -- and sell it.\nWe never -- We never went hungry. So, what happened after, was the effect of whatever\nhappened to him that maybe didn\u2019t appreciate at the time. Now that I have th -- what I\nknow is guilt feelings, because you survived, I think maybe he had guilt feelings of\nhaving survived untouched. Maybe it would have been different if he had gone out to the\ncamps and survived, I don\u2019t know. But as I matured and got older and faced the truth\nwhat happened, maybe he had guilt feelings. I don\u2019t know, he never talked about it. And\nthen, when my Uncle Gesa came, and I used to visit him quite often, I used to go to\nDenver about twice a year. Went with Mark, then went by myself. After surgery I went\nthere. And I used to say to him, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he come to the States to see his grandchild?\u201d\nAnd he just raised his shoulders and never answered, so I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t know\nwhy he came. As a matter of fact, my cousin Miriam told me in Paris that he was very\ngood to her. He was very good to her, and what happened, I don\u2019t know. As children, I\nmean, we were provided for, we had caring parents. I don\u2019t wish any more on any other\nchild. Financially, we didn\u2019t have much. I didn\u2019t know what a doll was, I don\u2019t think they\never bought me a doll. I think the dolls I got was from the schools. The schools, at\nChristmastime used to give -- I remember I had a doll. You have to remember they were\nthe breakable dolls. And I remember I put it on the window sill, and there were some lu --\nleftovers from the sewing my mother did, and the thing pushed the doll away and the doll\nbroke, but they never replaced it. Bicycles we had, because we needed it for\ntransportation. And after my accident -- I had an accident before we went into hiding. I\nwent out to the country with my sister Berta and another friend, and I don\u2019t know what\nhappened, we went ou -- I remember going uphill, and we had to walk and it was a hot\nday, and I wanted to sit down, and I -- I can\u2019t place it this time if my sister said it, or the\nother girl said it, they say, \u201cOh, Frida, now the hill goes down.\u201d And I got on the bicycle,\nand I remember as if yesterday -- I don\u2019t remember if it\u2019s my sister or the other girl,\nyelled, \u201cFrida, you\u2019re losing your pedals.\u201d I fainted and I went down the hill in a fainted\nstate. I guess th-the power of rolling down. And I went into -- I don\u2019t know if it was -- it\nwas a building, I don\u2019t know if it was a castle. And it was somebody of aristocracy, and\nthey brought me back with their chauffeurs, to the house. And I remember they gave my\nmother smelling salts, because one side of my face was damaged, and I must have had a\nslight brain concussion, because if somebody moved a chair or something, I couldn\u2019t take\nthe noise. And my mother didn\u2019t wanted me to ride a bicycle. My father went -- somehow\nor other found a second hand bicycle, so, you know, things were not produced, and I got\nanother bicycle. So I had that accident, and then I had an accident three days before my\nbirthday, my 17\" birthday. But whatever could be provided for us, schooling, we had\nprivate tutors to help us more, but not the arts, or music or anything. First of all, I was not\ninterested. Berta was, but I guess they felt that 1t was not important, so we didn\u2019t have it. I\nremember going to an opera with a neighbor. I went to see Faust. But they did not\nparticipate in the arts in any way. I never questioned it, never knew.",
        "Q: Is that an interest of yours now? Are -- Are you interested 1n --",
        "A: Oh, I -- I like classical music and the person who got me into it is my husband, he\u2019s\nvery musically oriented. He plays the clarinet. And he would put on classical music.\nWhen I went to high school, I went to the extension, because the school was crowded,\nand behind us was the Conservatory of Music, it\u2019s well known in Europe. And then we\nwould hear the students who were just learning. Do you know what it sounds like when\nthey learn? I had no desire, I had no interest, but now I do enjoy classical music, to a\ncertain extent, I don\u2019t like chamber music, I never learned to appreciate it. I haven\u2019t\nlearned to appreciate opera, although I did go to one at the Institute of Music, with\nsomebody who lived in one of the other buildings here. But I ushered at Severence Hall\nwith -- which is the -- you know, the Cleveland orchestra? And I do enjoy classical\nmusic, I go to it. I go to the art museum whenever there is an exhibit, when we had the art\nshows, I love to walk outside. If you have enough time, you should go see the -- the\nmuseums, because Cleveland has a beautiful, beautiful Museum of Art, and Severance\nHall they\u2019re just remodeling. I just signed up to volunteer when they reo -- they\u2019re --\nthey\u2019re going to be playing downtown in one of the halls, but 1 -- they\u2019re moving back in\nJanuary, after the remodeling, and I signed up to volunteer, so I am into classical music.\nMy son played the trumpet, quite musically oriented. He gave it up when he went to\nKent, don\u2019t ask me why. One granddaughter 1s interested in dancing and music, and she\ndoes play the flute. The other ones, no. But me, I have no desire to play an instrument,\nand I enjoy certain types of music, but 1t was not in our education or in our backgrounds\nor anything like that.",
        "Q: Did you go back to Belgium any other time?",
        "A: Yes. When my uncle died in Denver, and two years later, my aunt died. I didn\u2019t know\nat the time, but I was the executor for both wills. One of the heirs, my aunts nephew, was\nin Bratislava in Czechoslovakia, who was Communist at the time, managed to manipulate\nthe money so the money didn\u2019t go into Czechoslovakia, and I was in correspondence with\nhim. And somehow or other, I decided to go to Europe. Dr. Freide was in Switzerland at\nth -- at the time, in a -- in Zurich. And I was in correspondence with him because there\nwere still some strands left behind, and so on. And I wrote to him I was going to go to\nCzechoslovakia, and he said, \u201cIf you go to Czechoslovakia, stop in Zurich, we\u2019ll show\nyou the mountains.\u201d So what I did, I traveled on my own. I went to Zurich. He did offer\nfor me to stay with them and I said no. They got me a little hotel you don\u2019t get through\nthe travel agencies here, and Switzerland is very clean, so I got a room, and you could tell\nthe shower was added on. And I had breakfast and I took a couple trips. So I stayed in\nZurich for two days, took some trips, went to Bratislava.",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: When did my uncle die? Let\u2019s see, 20 -- [indecipherable] died about 20 -- 22 -- about -\n-a good 20 years ago. I don\u2019t have my passport and I don\u2019t remember exactly the year,\nbut it\u2019s t -- about 20 years ago, and I went to Bratislava, which is Communist at the time.\nI had to have 10 dollars per day, couldn\u2019t spend it, the stores were empty. And I stayed\nwith my -- with Eugene and Magda, my aunt\u2019s nephew and niece. Didn\u2019t see much. Spent\na week there. Went from Bratislava to Brussels, which was a waste of time. Willy, my\ncousin, took me to see the city. I had spent three months in Brussels, I had no desire to\nsee it, I didn\u2019t do -- oh, I did take a trip into the Flemish part, on my own. It was -- I have\nno -- I grew up feeling as a Belgian citizen cha -- chain -- sang the national anthem, and\nthen after I came to the States, I realized I really would have never been a citizen,\nalthough my father died shortly before becoming a citizen of Belgium. You don\u2019t become\nautomatically like in the States. And then I went from Brussels, I went to Paris to see\nFrida and spend a week with her. And then I -- And then I came back here. And then,\nlet\u2019s see, did I go back again? No, I was out, I never went back. I have no desire to go\nback. I know Miriam said to me, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go work for the common market.\nYou\u2019re bilingual.\u201d By then I was losing my Fre -- when I say losing my French, I\nexcelled in French, but to speak two languages, and translate, are two different things.\nYou need a training and a background, and I have to stop and think, \u201cHow do you say\nthat in French?\u201d I finally met some people, quite by -- was just a freak, I took the Rapid\nto go downtown and this woman sat next to me and she had a little brochure, and I says,\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know the Americans were interested in Moliere.\u201d\u2019 And she happens -- I\ndon\u2019t know where she learned French, but she introduced me to a group, and they\u2019re\nstrictly women, we get -- they get together twice a month, at Beechwood Place, and from\n10 to 12, and then on Friday they get together at somebody\u2019s home, and everybody brings\nsomething, just for the purpose of speaking French. So I\u2019ve gotten back into speaking\nFrench, and it\u2019s not a word of English, until you turn to somebody who just came back\nfrom France, who has close contact, and you say, \u201cHow do you say such and such in\nFrench?\u201d Nobody could remember how to say flush a toilet in French. And I read French\nbooks. I go down to the library about once a month. Cleveland library downtown, the\nmain library is magnificent. I have -- going to go down next week, I think, because they\nbuilt a new building, and they re-did the old building, which was closed, and I got to\nknow -- they had a -- the foreign literature library, and she just sent me a book. She\nknows the authors I like, or if she sees a book on Belgium, she\u2019Il send it to me. One of\nthem she sent me was all about the percentages of Catholic -- Cath -- Catholicism. Still\nhave some words with trouble. So I do that, and I do have the opportunity of getting\ntogether with people to speak French. And my granddaughters are taking Spanish. But\nthey\u2019re long distance, you know, so it doesn\u2019t make any difference. As a matter of -- th --\nAlicia called me, she said, \u201cI have to take a language, I don\u2019t know what to take, maybe\nGerman.\u201d And I didn\u2019t want to tell her don\u2019t. I did say, \u201cOh, [indecipherable] you don\u2019t\nwant German.\u201d I said, \u201c[indecipherable] to take French,\u201d I said, \u201cbut take Spanish, it\u2019s\nmuch more useful, you know, in the States.\u201d So I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going -- she\u2019s\ngoing to do what she wants to do. She said something about taking Japanese, but she\u2019s\nnot going into something where it would be required, so I don\u2019t know. But I do speak\nFrench. I have very little opportunity to speak Yiddish, and I trip on my words, bring in\nthe English words, because the older generation is dying away, so the young people --\nI\u2019m sure my little sister probably didn\u2019t even speak Yiddish, probably understood it, but\nthe young generations don\u2019t speak Yiddish. We have a lot of Russian emigrants, but the\nRussians are like the Germans, they don\u2019t speak Yiddish. Best of all, they couldn\u2019t. Every\nso often I find them, and I'll say, \u201cDo you speak Yiddish?\u201d So I can communicate with\nthem. And maybe I\u2019Il break down -- I think Workman\u2019s Circle has classes in Yiddish.\nMaybe I should go back to it, maybe it\u2019Il come back. I just remember a couple letters of\nthe alphabet. Don\u2019t know what good it is, but I did read articles that in Israel they\u2019re te --\nteaching Yiddish. In my generation they always said, \u201cA Jew can go anywhere, he\u2019s\nnever lost, as long as he speaks Yiddish.\u201d But it\u2019s not true any more. In my generation,\nwhen I was young, yes. It did come in handy. I went to Israel twice, the first time on my\nown. I was going to take a tour, and some reason or other, I remember my cousin, the one\nwho was in Belgium, as a soldier, I remember his address. They were pioneers on a\nkibbutz. And I wrote to him, and I said, \u201cI want to come to Israel, I want to take a tour,\nbut I\u2019d like to see you again and meet your family.\u201d And he said, \u201cDon\u2019t take a tour,\ncome to the kibbutz.\u201d So I went on my own to the kibbutz, I arrived on a Friday, before\nsundown, and on Saturday, my mother\u2019s side of the family came. My mother had a niece\nin Belgium and she went to Israel. And through the family I got her sister\u2019s address and\nthey all invited me, which I didn\u2019t accept, but they grabbed me off, and I was taken to --\nto visit Israel. I took one tour, that was it. Everybody else took me around, and then I\nwent on the kibbutz and lived on the kibbutz, and got a taste, if you can, on a couple days\nat the kibbutz. Then I went back a number of years later -- oh, that time I traveled by bus\neverywhere. It was marvelous, because you meet more people, you learn more. And I\ntook a bus back from ji -- di -- from Jerusalem to the kibbutz, and they dropped me off\ninto the kibbutz, and my uncle had shown -- my cousin had shown me, \u201cSee Frida, this is\nthe street I live on.\u201d And I said, \u201cSfee, you want me to remember? It\u2019s in Hebrew.\u201d So\nwhen I got off on the kibbutz, there was a man with a bicycle and he was a-a-an older\nman, and I looked at him, and I took a chance, and he was one of the Europeans from that\ngeneration, who had gone to Israel, and I was able to speak with him in Yiddish. So he\ntook me to my cousin\u2019s house. The second time I went, I went as a volunteer for the\narmy. I didn\u2019t like the experience, and the thing that saved me is every weekend we were\noff, so I went to the different -- to the various members of the family. I didn\u2019t tour as --\nthat much, this time.",
        "Q: A volunteer for the Israeli army?",
        "A: Y-Yeah, uh-huh. They needed volunteers. That started during the -- one of the wars or\nsomething, where all their people were fighting, and they needed people, and things like\nthat. And I ended up working -- I ended up being placed on a ca -- on an army camp that\nwas -- packed medical supplies for the soldiers. My cousin from Belgium, her\ngranddaughter happened to be in the army, right on the next camp, next to it, where the\nsoldiers were. Teela. She was an officer. And she came and she found me, because I had\nwritten to them that I would be there. And we got a ride back to her house and then\ncoming back we took a train and we took a bus. Some experience. So I stayed there for\ntwo weeks. I didn\u2019t extend my trip, but I did go to my cousin\u2019s kibbutz. And I just had --\nsomething came up in Denver, and I was in contact with what I call my sabber cousin,\nwho lived in Denver. And he called me twice. I recognized his voice, they have a definite\nang -- you know, they speak English fluently. And he says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to\nIsrael?\u201d I says, \u201cYou know, maybe you make me feel like going, but I want to see areas\nwhere I\u2019ve never visited before.\u201d So I decided to go to Iceland in September. I don\u2019t\nknow wha -- what I -- I understand is very beautiful terrain. Equador was very\nenlightening. People say Equador? What\u2019s in Equador? Well, it\u2019s different cultures. And\nthat\u2019s what I like to do. And whether I\u2019ll go to eastern Europe, I don\u2019t know. One t -- One\n-- One step at a time. First of all, I have to make sure -- I\u2019m getting older. That\u2019s why I\nwalk, to keep my legs active, and make sure --",
        "Q: Very lively.",
        "A: To a certain extent, to a certain extent.",
        "Q: What year was it that you went to Israel, volunteering with the army\u201d?",
        "A: You know, you\u2019re aski -- I would have -- I think maybe my passport shows it. Let\u2019s\nsee, I went to France last year, da --",
        "Q: Ball park figure.",
        "A: Yeah, okay. Maybe five years ago.",
        "Q: And did you -- did you s -- s -- tell me about your visits with Rachelle when you\nreturned.",
        "A: Ah, the first time I went. What happened is, I went to Israel the year after I went back\nto Belgium again. When I went Switzerland, and that. And my aunt in Belgium was the\nsame age as Rachelle. My aunt didn\u2019t like Rachelle either. And she gave me Rachelle\u2019s\nname -- she had remarried, and her address. And I wrote to Rachelle, and some reason or\nother -- trying to remember if I didn\u2019t get an answer, somehow or other, I got the answer\nthree months later. I found the letter after I came back. And everywhere I went, I kept\nsaying, there is somebody I want to see, but I can\u2019t read the Hebrew telephone books.\nAnd I ended up at a cousin\u2019s house that I had not met before. They were brothers and\nsisters from the one who lived in Belgium, and I didn\u2019t know they were brothers and\nsisters. And I was at Leelee -- Leelee\u2019s house, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, as a matter of\nfact, and I says, \u201cLeelee,\u201d I says, \u201cI need -- I want to get in touch with Rachelle, but I\ncan\u2019t read the telephone,\u201d and she says, \u201cOkay.\u2019\u2019 Somehow or other, I don\u2019t know if she\ncalled information, she looked in the phone book, I don\u2019t remember. And I say, \u201cI can\u2019t\ncall on my own, because I don\u2019t speak Hebrew, and the Europeans who had gone, did not\nspeak English.\u201d Now they all -- all -- all the Israelis speak English. And she got on the\nphone one evening, and in Hebrew, and she said, \u201cFrida, it\u2019s the right Rachelle.\u201d And I\ngot on the phone, she was crying. And what I did is I took a bus and I stayed with her. I\ndid not sightsee, I did not do anything. And I remember, had a dress with a little breast\npocket, and I was going to a kibbutz on the outskirts of Jerusalem. These close friends\nthat I have, who live on the west side of Cleveland, had two daughters who were in Israel\nfor several months on kibbutz, and I had told, I says, \u201cSally,\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t care what, I\nwant to see Cindy and Sharon.\u201d And one lived in a remote kibbutz that was just being\nestablished. My cousin Sfee borrowed a car and took me there and just visited for a short\ntime. But Sharon was in a kibbutz where I had access with a bus, and Rachelle put me in\na cab, and I remember she gave me money to pay for the cab, and I says, \u201cRachelle,\u201d I\nsays, \u201cI\u2019m not a child any more, I\u2019m an adult. I have money, I can afford.\u201d She insisted.\nAnd she spoke -- I don\u2019t know if she picked up some Arabic, or 1t was in Hebrew, she put\nme in cab to Tel Aviv, because all the buses leave from Tel Aviv. And I got to Tel Aviv,\nit was -- my son had warned me, it was like letting lions out of a cage. Saturday evening,\nthe Sabbath is broken, and all the buses were lined up right behind the other. I mean, the\nstation has been remodeled since, when I went the second time. And I had the name of\nthe kibbutz written down on a piece of paper, until I learned to say kibbutz malach\nhameeshem, but at the time I couldn\u2019t. And I missed the bus. With all those bus, you\nknow, with the cab driver dropped me off, and I guess I missed my bus. And this soldier\napproached me, it was very interesting event. The soldier saw me, you know, with a little\nsuitcase, and he approached me, and I told him where I was going. It happened to be he\nwas in the -- once they serve in -- they have to back in the reserve once a year, until they\nreach a certain age. He was a young Frenchman who as a -- who had survived a war\nyounger than I wa -- he was younger than -- you know, about my age, I think. And he\nwent to Israel after the war, and it s -- turns out that his wife\u2019s name was also Frida, and\nhe stayed with me in Tel Aviv, until I got on the next bus. Told the bus driver where I\nwas going, and what happened, the kibbutz as a business had a -- a motel. Well, the bus\nwent to the motel and they had a cop --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: So, tape four, side A, and you just -- I have a cramp in my knee. [indecipherable]. Do\nyou want to finish that story?",
        "A: All right, I went -- I went to the -- to the American wi -- common because I had told\nSharon, I says, \u201cGet me a room at the motel.\u201d She says oh, she went and there was a\nroom available for me. Didn\u2019t have a closet, the shower -- the water was cold. And the\nnext day, I went to take a bus to sightsee Jerusalem, because I only had one day, and I\nmissed the bus to take me into Jerusalem. And there was a man there who was from the\noutskirts of Detroit, and he had lived at the kibbutz for about seven years, and I got\ntalking to him, waiting for the next bus. And he said he took groups of students o0-on -- on\n-- sightseeing and things like that. And he had an appointment, and I met him -- he says,\n\u201cT\u2019I]l meet you at the bus station at 11 o\u2019clock, and he walked me for three solid hours, in\nJerusalem. And the one day I didn\u2019t sightsee was when I spend the day with Rachelle.\nWhen I went back the second time, I wrote to her, never got an answer. I told somebody\nher address, couldn\u2019t find it, and I know the let -- I don\u2019t know what happened to\nRachelle. Have no idea, have no idea what happened to her. It breaks my heart, because\nhe husband had died. Her -- You know, the man she -- she married in Israel. So I don\u2019t\nknow what happened, I tried in the worst way. I don\u2019t know if I could have contacted an\nagency or what. I still -- I still have her address and nodob -- nobody seemed to locate the\nstreet or anything. So I\u2019ve lost contact with her. I still have contact with my aunt in\nBrussels. I send her Jewish New Year\u2019s card. I\u2019m in touch with Frida in Paris. And I do --\nI have contact with my mother\u2019s side of the family, the daughter of the cousin who lived\nin Belgium, I send a New Year\u2019s card. As a matter of fact, my granddaughter Alicia, the\noldest one, went to Israel, and she did spend time -- her name is also Rachelle, my dau --\nmy cousin from Belgium, her daughter, she spent some time with her. My cousin Ahoud,\nand Ruth, my sabber cousin, happened to be in England at the time. I wrote to them, and\nthen I got a letter from England that he was stationed there on his job for a couple of\nyears. And I told her I\u2019ll never forgive her for not going to see my cousin Sfee, because\nhe\u2019s elderly, I\u2019m the only relative he has. But it\u2019s not somebody I cou -- have lot of\ncorrespondence, and I can\u2019t get through to -- now that they have telephones in -- in the\nkibbutz, I did call one time, and for some reason or other, I don\u2019t know what has\nchanged, I can\u2019t get -- I can\u2019t get ahold of them on the telephone. And my sabber cousin,\nAhoud, is the same cousin as I am, and I -- I should ask him for his phone number, I\ndon\u2019t know. I have to call him one of these days and see if he can give me a phone\nnumber.",
        "Q: What\u2019s Sfee\u2019s last name?",
        "A: Well, Nishri, N-i-s-h-r-1, and you know, again, we go back ma -- not asking questions\nnow. He is a first cousin to my father. He left at a young age, he married a woman, I think\nshe\u2019s of Polish background. I never asked him about my grandparents. I would assume\nthat his last name, European, was Adler. I mean, he\u2019s on my father\u2019s side of the family,\nbut when I was there, his hearing was going, his eyesight was going. He was still clear\nminded. I haven\u2019t heard anything, his wife was still very active. She was a midwife, and\nhe -- when I went there, he used to go to -- to the fields, and bring food to the people who\nworked t-the fields, a-at the kibbutz, and I went with him. They treated me -- I mean, they\ndidn\u2019t know what to do with me. If I had a -- a -- you know, they have the main meals in -\n- in -- in the common dining room, but Ahoud and Ruth came, and she served some soup,\nand she used to bake. If I as much as picked up the cup to put it to the sink, she would\nslap my hands, she wouldn\u2019t let me do anything. She was so glad that I was in touch -- in\ntouch with them, and that\u2019s the only contact I have. And Miriam I don\u2019t hear from. She\nwas in the States on business, and she was in New York, but she didn\u2019t tell me until the\nlast minute, so I couldn\u2019t go to New York, and I did get a letter from her mother, saying\nshe was due to come to the States, I don\u2019t know if 1t was Chicago or what, and I had told\nher, I says, \u201cMiriam, if you let me know ahead of time, then I\u2019Il come, I\u2019Il stay in a hotel\nand Ill spend time with you.\u201d Well, I don\u2019t know if she didn\u2019t come, she didn\u2019t contact\nme. She did contact me when she was in New York. And I had it to -- a hard ta -- she\nkept changing hotels, so I had a hard time tracking her. My aunt came to the States one\ntime, many years ago, when my son lived in Connecticut, and he and his wife went to\nNew York, they drove and met her, because she went to visit somebody from Belgium,\nand the woman spoke English, and I guess French, and she was a translator. And then she\ncame -- it was interesting, she came a second time, but she didn\u2019t tell me until the last\nminute. She went to Florida, to somebody. And I say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me? I was\ngoing to Florida once a year to visit friends.\u201d But I never saw her. It was too late, and I\nwasn\u2019t going to pay the high fare of the last minute fares to go to -- to -- to flori -- she\nwas in Miami and I was going to Fort Lauderdale. So I have no contact with any of them.\nI had a cousin in Los Angeles, I vi -- my aunt, the one from Denver\u2019s daughter, lived in\nLos Angeles, I spend time with her. I have a cousin too, that I met after the war, who\nlived in eng -- in Cleveland, went to Los Angeles, and I do have contact with one of the\ncousins in Canada. But otherwise -- and one of them here in -- two of them, I -- actually I\nsomehow or other re-made contact with Lana\u2019s daughter, to a certain extent. Louie died\nmany years ago, with a -- of a brain tumor, so -- but from my father\u2019s generation, from --\nyou know, from -- there\u2019s a -- Sfee\u2019s the only one in Israel from that generation, really.\nThere is no one else left, no one else. And on my mother\u2019s side -- on my father\u2019s side,\nthat generation, everyone was gone. On my mother\u2019s side -- oh no, wait a minute, on my\nmother\u2019s side, one uncle had remained, their two girls and my cousin Paul in Cleveland.\nAnd I understand he was one of the oldest survivors of the camp, and he stayed in\nCzechoslovakia, Romania, every time there\u2019s a war, and every time they divide the\ncountry, 1t becomes another country. I was Russian after World War Two, now it\u2019s\nUkraine. And he eventually came to the States, but his mind was not -- he was in his 70\u2019s,\nhe had gone through World War Two, he was in a nursing home.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Izaquavic. What was it? Oh, all of a sudden I can\u2019t think of his name, and I met him,\nand he -- the only way he could know who I was 1s by telling him whose daughter I was.\nYou -- Because he remembered my moth -- you know, that\u2019s the way they said, they said,\nso and so\u2019s daughter, so and so\u2019s son. Oh, all of a sudden --",
        "Q: How -- How was he related?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s father.",
        "Q: He -- Oh.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s -- excuse me, my mother\u2019s brother.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: Yeah, he was the only sa -- survivor on my mother\u2019s side, from that generation.",
        "Q: And when you said he was one of the oldest survivors of the camp --",
        "A: Of the camps, he --",
        "Q: -- which camp -- which camps?",
        "A: Who knows how many camps he was in, I have no idea. I think he ended up in -- I --\nhe might have been in Auschwitz when he was liberated, I -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t know. You\nknow, these are the things we didn\u2019t ask.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, this is going back -- oh, I know what his name was. The Jewish name was\nMoishevolv. Now I remember. And I met him, but he could only relate to me of saying I\nwas Hya\u2019s daughter. And he stayed with the su -- with -- with the -- the son, he stayed\nwith the -- with the daughter. I don\u2019t know, he died, I think of a heart attack. He was ina\n-- on a picnic or something like that, so he didn\u2019t live very long after he came to the\nStates. And that\u2019s about it, I mean, nothing else, really.",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you -- that you want to say in conclusion? I mean, I\u2019m just -\n- I\u2019m thinking of one statement that you said that sticks in my head, is that you said, you\nknow, that you haven\u2019t lived a full life, and I -- I wondered what you mean by that?",
        "A: You mean a full life now? Well I -- You know, my -- my -- my children live out of\ntown, and you know I was raised to -- to -- to be a mu -- to be married, to have a -- a-and\nbe a mother and everything, and so I live alone, so I don\u2019t ha -- well, I don\u2019t have the\nmale companionship. I dated. I -- I went out a lot, I -- I had male companionship for -- for\nquite a number of years. You reach my age, and I\u2019m too active for some of them. I\u2019m still\nfairly active. And I\u2019m thankful that I have the friends that I have, that I can keep busy. I\nvolunteered. I just lost my job volunteering, I have to find another one. I did date entry. I\ngo back to the hospital and talk with Dr. Gambetti. I keep active and I keep busy, what\ncan I tell you? And I started taking classes because I want to keep my mind working, and\nI have to find a niche for my volunteer work, because the woman I work for is fantastic. I\nstill have contact with her, and I go there for the holidays. As a matter of fact, she called\nme this morning and I said, \u201cThe museum?\u201d I says, \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI wanted the\nmuseum, there\u2019s an exhibit.\u201d And I say I want to go down to the library, because I was\nnot available the day they had the grand opening for the old library, they remodeled the\noriginal building. So we\u2019re going to the library with her. So I\u2019m thankful for the -- that\nI\u2019m quote, healthy. That I have the friends that I have and I\u2019m not isolated, and if I don\u2019t\nhave to spend 10 years in a nursing home, I\u2019m fi -- I\u2019m fine financially, too, but I\u2019m tha --\ncan\u2019t worry about it. And my son 1s doing well, and the children are growing up, away\nfrom me. That\u2019s the thing, that I missed it. Not now so much, but when they were little, is\nto see them, you know, grow up, but they were here four times a year, and I went there,\nso -- and I went when Alicia had -- the oldest one had her tonsils out. But I missed a lot\nof the little things, you know, affairs in school. Oh, Whitney was acting in some plays,\nand I went because she had a play, but it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s not as often as I would have liked.\nBut all that is gone, so have to take it from here.",
        "Q: Anything else you want to add?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: All right. Thank you so much. I think we could probably go on all day, but --",
        "A: No.",

        "Q: Did you start going to services?",
        "Q: Was it -- It sounds to me like an interesting kind of role reversal.

I -- I -- Lot of -- There were a lot of\nimmigration into Belgium to work the coal mines and the -- I think my father must have\nended up in a steel factory. Why, exactly, I think -- I really don\u2019t know, I mean, we never\nask, we were never told, so I really don\u2019t know what the reason was. But instead of\ncoming to the States, we just -- we moved to Belgium, I guess. We went to Belgium on --\nwe arrived in Liege, Belgium, on May eight, 1929. I came to the States, landed in New\nYork, on May eight, 1946.",
        "A: I remember May eight, because the war started about that day. The Germans invaded\nBelgium. Yes, I remember May eight, because that\u2019s when I lan -- I always remember\nMay eight, when I landed in the State ands can\u2019t forget it.",

Both my parents came from that\ncity and all the f -- so far as I know, from both sides, mother and father, they both were\nfrom that town. I don\u2019t know where they came from before, my son 1s trying to find\nancestry and so far, on my father\u2019s side, he can\u2019t -- on the Adler, he cannot find anything.\nThere are only four of us left on my father\u2019s side. Two cousins in Belgium, one male, one\nfemale. One in Israel, he was born there, on my father\u2019s youngest brother, and me in the\nStates.

But no one seems to be\nable to tell me where we went back further. I tried to find out what my grandparents died\nof, but by the time it dawned on my to find out, all the people from that age -- from that\nera, were gone, so I have no idea. I think I was told my mother\u2019s father, after World War\nOne, develops wa -- wa -- I don\u2019t know what kind of disease, diphtheria, whatever went\naround. I understand he worked for the railroad, that\u2019s all I know. But we di -- we don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s maiden name was Esaacovic, and she learned man\u2019s tailoring when she\nwas a young girl, that much I know. My father -- they were orphaned, they were both\norphans when they were married. My father, I understand, came from a very poor family.\nThere were seven children left, and they did the best they could, I guess, to support the\nchildren. Once you were poor, you were poor, I guess, there. And maybe that\u2019s what\nbrought them to -- you know, what -- that\u2019s what made them -- wha -- to go to Belgium,\nand I -- he -- I know he lost his -- his job and I think he was in a stee -- in a -- a steel\nfactory, because Belgium had that coal mines and steel factories. And then my -- what\nmy mother did, she picked up the tailoring, but they -- she did it at home, and she did --\nshe worked for several tailors and made the pants. They cut and then we used to roll it up\nand bring it to the house, and -- and then eventually, she brought in somebody to help\nwith the sewing, 1s the way -- and my father slowly did -- you know, yo-you iron with a -\n- with an iron that was heat -- that was heated. And he did the heavy work for her. And he\neventually went into that, because after the war, that\u2019s what he did. My father\u2019s brother,\none of the younger brother, also went to Belgium, and he was a tailor. And I guess he\nwent into business after the war, to manufacture, instead of individual suits, that they\nwent into manu -- quote, manufacturing, not to the -- to the extent that it was in the\nStates, but that\u2019s what they did is, they went into manufacturing men\u2019s clothing, 1s what\nthey did.",
        "A: As far back as I can remember. We didn\u2019t feel it. I had wonderful parents, I -- they\nworked very hard, my mother worked very long hours and I remember wor -- I guess,\nduring the -- what you call season, she worked very, very long hours, is -- 1s what I\nremember. We -- If w -- If they struggled financially, we didn\u2019t get the brunt of it. I\nmean, I can\u2019t place myself missing anything or -- or -- or being in need of anything. My\nfather had a sister who did men\u2019s shirts, you know, individual. All our clothes were made\nby dressmakers. The suits were made by my uncle, and she -- I remember my aunt did\nnightgowns for us. So, we were very well dressed, I don\u2019t remember ever hav -- going\nhungry, so whatever they did, they provided for the children, we didn\u2019t feel any need, or\nany loss, or -- or -- I don't recall anything like that.",
        "A: Yeah, I didn\u2019t want to -- I didn\u2019t want to go to school. We didn\u2019t have to go to high\nschool, and I wanted dressmaking and dress designing, and they insisted that I get a high\nschool diploma. So I was forced in going into high school. And in -- when the Germans\ninvaded in 1940, they -- in Li\u00e9ge, I found out in -- I talked to someone who was from\nAntwerp they started sooner. But in Liege, where we were, they -- I continued going to\nschool until 1942, and I -- just before I was to graduate, get my diploma, that\u2019s when they\nstart -- they didn\u2019t allow Jews to go to school, and -- but when the war started, my parents\nkind -- bent, and I stayed in the same school that I went -- wha -- what do you call it?\nInstead of going at -- academically, I went into a school where I was taking pattern\nmaking and dressmaking. They said --",
        "A: The vocational school, they said it\u2019s all right, as long as I get a high school dipo --\ndiploma, is -- is what happened. And I remember, couldn\u2019t get fabrics, because it was\nwar, and I remember distinctly, my si -- my middle sister had entered high school, and I\ntook a coat that I had, took it completely apart, pressed, laid it flat, and learn -- and I\nmade a -- cut the coat to fit her, to learn to make it. So I did not get my high school\ndiploma, but I was just before graduation, so I was able to go to school. And then -- We\nspoke Yiddish at home, of course, until my parents learned French and even after that.\nWe had a private tutor that came and taught us Yiddish, and I used to write the letters to\nthe rest of the family, I guess, in Czechoslovakia, but I don\u2019t remember how to read, or\nhow to write Yiddish. I speak it, I understand it, but I can\u2019t -- no longer read or write it.",
        "A: No, no, f -- Yiddi -- We -- We spoke Yiddish and French. My parents spoke\nHungarian when they didn\u2019t want us to understand something. Otherwise, they --\nOtherwise they -- what we -- we spoke Yiddish, I mean my -- my parents came from\nOrthodox background, and in Salitva, I guess the way of life was the -- th-the way of\nJewish life in the calendar and everything.",
        "A: Okay, my middle sister is Berta, she was -- we were two and a half years apart. She\nwas -- loved dancing and whatever, but my parents didn\u2019t go for the arts, for some reason\nor other. They felt education, that did not include it. And my little sister, Nellie, I don\u2019t\nknow what was wrong with her, I know she was very fragile at first, and of course, being\nthe youngest, she was spoiled. That\u2019s how I remember, I used to get angry at her, because\neverything I did, she wanted to do. I didn\u2019t like chicken soup, so if I didn\u2019t eat it, she\ndidn\u2019t want to eat it, and I was told that I would get it for both of us, because she did\neverything I did. I was a very finicky person, even in those days. For instance, I had a\nbicycle, and Berta had a bicycle, and then she outgrew that bicycle, it went to Nellie, so\nshe -- Berta and I had to share a bicycle and if it rained on it, I would wipe it and take\ncare of it and she was ma -- much more li -- much more relaxed about it. She was a very\nwarm, very outgoing person. That\u2019s -- That\u2019s about all I can tell you.",
        "A: Well, we do -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s was the rumor.",
        "A: The first thing they did 1s call young people. I looked at -- at -- in an encyclopedia in\nthe library and they did not mention the -- the -- the f -- the young people, because the\ntwo very close friends I had were called. And then later, they called men between certain\nages, I -- I don\u2019t remember. And the rumor was, I don\u2019t know how true it was, that there -\n- we\u2019re going to build fortifications in Dunkirk. Whether that was true or not I don\u2019t\nknow. And my father was called, and I\u2019Il never forget him because it was a Saturday and\nI can see my father coming up the stairway, we lived on a -- above a -- a business, and he\nhad his hair shaved, and my mother said -- asked him where he was going, and he said,\n\u201cI\u2019m going to report, because they say if the men go, they won\u2019t touch the rest of the\nfamily.\u201d And my mother said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe them, I don\u2019t trust them.\u201d And that\u2019s when\nthey decided -- it was a matter that I remember, of either trying to go across to France,\nwhich was very serious, because my cousin -- I -- my father\u2019s sister\u2019s boy, who was eight\nat the time, his mother had died, the father had remarried, and his wife ha -- his -- th-the\nwoman he had remarried brought -- sh -- he\u2019 Il -- he left the woman with two children and\nshe brought my cousin to us, so there were six of us to cross a border. You had to pay\nsomebody to get you across. You didn\u2019t know if you would make it. And then they turned\nto this Catholic family and that\u2019s how we got the house where we went into hiding.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. [inaudible]. Yeah, that, see? According to my notes, it star -- it started -- th-they\ncalled it a labor draft. I didn\u2019t know at the time that\u2019s what it was called, and it was in\nJuly, 1942.",
        "A: And d -- as a matter of fact, the couple who came in to join us in hiding afterwards, he\nwas a friend of the family, he was the same age as my father\u2019s brother, who had also\nmoved to Belgium, and she had worked for my parents in, you know, helping with the\nsewing. He had gone on the train.",

She was five years older\nthan I, and -- and he went on the train and then this is how we knew -- I guess I don\u2019t\nknow to -- at which point we -- we went into hiding and I guess the -- the conductors, the\npeople who worked on the train -- don\u2019t forget these were Belgian citizens, opened the\ndoors and said, \u201cYou\u2019re going into,\u201d -- I think Germany, or Poland, it was before they\nentered Germany -- \u201cwhoever wants to run, run.\u201d And a lot of the young man who had\ngone, got off the train and went into hiding, but my father hadn\u2019t gone.",

        "A: No, it -- the person who got -- who got us the house, okay -- we lived across the street\nfrom a church. Now, that part of Belgium is very, very Catholic, and there was a family --\nit\u2019s a long story -- one part -- one member of the family lived upstairs of us, and they\nwere very close with the church.

I know -- I remember, somehow or other f -- I knew that we\npaid the rent for six months. And after that, I don\u2019t know what happened, I don\u2019t know if\nwe didn\u2019t pay or anything, because I-I really -- I really cannot tell you, it was not brought\nup, so -- I did -- we did not know who -- we never met, we never knew who the people\nwho owned the land, because it was on land that belonged -- is it a -- was it a count or a\nduke?

I used to go\nhome by bicycle. It -- It was hard because it was hilly, but otherwise, I don\u2019t know. I\nreally, really -- I never looked into it, never asked.

You know, it was an open ta -- panel truck. I'll never forget it,\nI had a -- a skirt and blouse on, the -- the skirt, we used to call it jepaison, it was gathered,\nsomething like a trundle skirt and it had a bib, you know. And I -- There were two -- was\nit one or two guys on the back of the truck, and it had like a pole, and I hooked on with\nmy left hand, to the pole, to go up the hill. And the wind was blowing, and my skirt\ncaught on to the truck, and I guess I lost -- I got panicky, I didn\u2019t want to tear the skirt,\ndon\u2019t forget you -- you couldn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t replace clothing, and I fell to my right\nside and broke my right collarbone. And they put me on the truck and I remember saying\nvery distinctly in French, for some reason or other, this sticks very clear in my mind, I\nsaid, \u201cDon\u2019t let me die three days before my birthday.\u201d So I knew I fell September 11,\nthat\u2019s how I remember.

And I did understand when they told me not to go home. And my\nfather was in the hospital, that\u2019s why my father was not deported. And I\u2019m trying to\nthink. I have to remember in French. Hopital de Labarvare, I think it\u2019s called, and he had\nentered the hospital on Friday. He had either an ear infection, an eye infection, I don\u2019t\nknow, and the doctor felt he should go in the hospital. And my sister Berta was supposed\nto bring in shaving cream and soap, you know, they didn\u2019t provide them. And I got ahold\nof Dr. Bastin, of course, and he had my father released from the hospital, and we got ona\nbus to go home, to go back to that -- to the house, and that\u2019s when we found out exactly\nwhat happened, they came at five o\u2019clock in the morning. And the farmers tried to save\nthe children, my mother tried to save the children. From one of the farmers we -- we were\ntold that one of the Gestapo asked my little sister -- and they didn\u2019t ask -- he asked -- they\nask where my father was, and my little sister answered, \u201cHe\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d I\nunderstand he slapped her because she was lying, which was the truth. That\u2019s what we\ngot from the farmers who were there.",

Don\u2019t forget the -- the civilians worked and went back and forth and they were very\nanti-German. And I went there, but at that ti -- I don\u2019t know, I must have stayed a very,\nvery short time, maybe a couple days. Monsieur Libare had been called to go to work to\nGermany, because they were losing on the Russian front at the time, and they called --\nwe're talking Gentiles, Catholic where I was, to go to work the factories. They needed\nmanpower while their man went on the front. And what happened is these -- these men --\nmy father was also called on his false ID with it, and the -- I guess, quote, the mayor,\nfrom the village, who had -- where -- we had ID\u2019s where we were registered 1n the\nregister, so in case they took the ID\u2019s, they could check we were there. He notified them\nthat they made a mistake on my father\u2019s age and made -- they made him 10 years older,\nso he didn\u2019t go. But, what happened with the other people, and in -- like with Monsieur\nLibare, the -- the man would go on the train, hand in their papers, a-an-and get off the\nother side of the train and go home. So you had a lot of the Gentiles, who were, quote,\nhiding, th -- 1 -- were not legitimate -- were -- were hiding at home, so when I went there,\nthey were afraid they would come for him and find me, or they\u2019d come for -- for me, and\nf-f -- and -- and you know, find him, so I stayed there, and then --",
        "A: Liege, yeah, that was in Liege, and then Madame Bastin had a daughter, very, very\nnice, who was married t-to a lawyer and they had a little boy called Jacques, I remember\nhe used to come in the kitchen and I used to help him with my homework -- with his --\nmy home -- with his homework. And I guess it\u2019s through them, that they found a lawyer,\nit was a woman lawyer, and I went to her house and stayed with her for a very short time,\nbecause then they took the Jews from the citadel and shipped them to Marlene, where\nthey gathered the Jews from Belgium, to ship them out.

Why they had different names, I never understood, but they were\nbrothers.

And I went there because I\nwanted to send packages to -- to -- to my family in -- in -- in Marlene. But they didn\u2019t\nstay long enough for me to send any packages.

And what they -- what the underground would do is\ngo to the farmers and get loads of stuff, that found it\u2019s way on the Black Market, found\nit\u2019s way -- you know, you had -- I remember the two amer -- th-the plane that fell, and I\nknow they never caught whoever was in -- in the plane and we were told there was an\nAmerican plane. Then you had the underground, it had to be [indecipherable] and things,\nand then the -- the farmers would call and say they were robbed, and I don\u2019t know if\nthat\u2019s what my father participated in, but they arrested him and they put him in jail.

So, he would come\nup for trial, they would postpone his trial. And then when war was over, I had to get a\nlawyer, because we were foreign citizen, we were not Belgian citizen, and because he had\ncommitted a crime, I guess, they were going to deport him. So it took a lawyer. I turned --\nI think I went to -- to -- to Madame Bastin\u2019s son-in-law, yeah, to have him -- whatever he\ndid, he did.

I don\u2019t\nknow what else, he was trying every which way to -- to -- to -- to free them. As a matter\nof fact, there was somebody -- I think it\u2019s pretty true that he paid to have my mother and\nthe children out of -- out of the citadel and then it never worked out because I think it was\ntrue that there were -- we\u2019re talking German soldiers, we\u2019re not talking Nazi, we\u2019re\ntalking German soldiers, who would take money and be bribed and let -- you know, help\npeople escape from there.

So, I know when I saw Rachelle years later in\nIsrael, she told me that a -- a German soldier pa -- brought her milk and passed it through\nthe bar to give to the baby. So, there was something going on that the detail -- you know,\nnothing was talked about and I left shortly -- a year after the war, when it was still war\ntorn and people were coming back, so I never got details.

He didn\u2019t speak French, he didn\u2019t -- a-and my -- my friend\u2019s\nfather didn\u2019t speak English and they wrote a letter to the embassy and I got a visa much\nsooner than -- than if I would have waited on a regular basis, because after I came to the\nStates, my father told me that I got called to go get my visa. And you couldn\u2019t get\npassage because the GI\u2019s were coming back, the war brides were coming. And I can still\nsee the travel agent. I was at a friend\u2019s house and he says, \u201cI got passage for you.\u201d And I\nfound my father, he had to borrow money to -- to pay for my passage. And I went from\nLiege to Brussels with my father, and this cousin from Israel, and I remember he told my\nfather, \u201cYou go back, I\u2019m a soldier, I\u2019ll be able to get transportation.\u201d And I think it took\nme longer to go through the border of Belgium, France, than it took me to travel, because,\nyou know, it was still after the war. France was still war -- we had everything, food,\neverything, France didn\u2019t. Stayed overnight in Paris. I met a woman on the train, and\nsomebody on the train, a French woman -- there was Black Market going on between\nBelgium and Germany, Belgium and France, and she picked up the Belgian accent, and\nwanted to know if we had Belgian money -- and stayed in Paris overnight. And there was\na young girl who had married a GI, and this woman was very sophisticated, and we went\nto LeHavre. War -- Was in ruins, I remember the debris and everything. And I came on a\nboat, that I used to call a ship, called the SS Uruguay. And we were 10 in a cabin, and we\nlanded in New York on May eight, in 1946.",

I don\u2019t know how, because two years is not a lot. But, what saved me\nwith my aunt is I spoke Yiddish.

        "A: No, no. As a matter of fact, what I had is I found myself, for the first time, in a Jewish\nenvironment. Grew up in a Catholic environment. And I remember distinctly that even\nwith my aunt, that I had to defend the Catholics. I had to tell them that Catholics saved\nmy life. Catholic risked their lives to save my life. Catholics were tormented, especially\nin Liege. I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t know about the other part, I just met somebody from\nAntwerp.

And\nI don\u2019t think they -- they -- they comprehended that. That 1s something I really -- th-that\u2019s\nwhat came up, is Catholic helped me, Catholic risked their lives. Catholic were persecu --\nnot to the extent the Jews were. You know, they didn\u2019t -- they couldn\u2019t take the whole\ncountry and send them to the concentration camps. That\u2019s what I had -- What happened\nto me? I -- I ha -- trying to remember my -- my aunt knew by then that my mother was\ngone, but I don\u2019t think they brought up too much at that time, of -- you know, America\nwas getting over, I guess, depression, the war, the bo -- the boys were coming back from\nthe service. And it\u2019s someth -- it\u2019s not something that was talked about that much. I\nremember, I don\u2019t know if I was setting the table, clearing up the table or what. My\nmother -- My aunt, excuse me, my aunt said something about milladec, faishadec, you\nknow, dairy made, and I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d And my aunt said, \u201cWhat do you mean, you\n-- what\u2019s milladec and faishadec, didn\u2019t your mother keep it?\u201d Oh, sure, my mother kept\nit, four years of war, two years in hiding, how are you going to keep the -- the -- the\nkosher laws, she didn\u2019t even keep them before -- before the war.

I had completely forgotten about candles and blessing the candles,\nand then I remembered when I saw her doing it, and then when girlfriend of mine did it,\nand it just -- I can see my mother lighting this -- you know, and -- and blessing this -- the\nSabbath candles, but I had completely forgotten about it.

I still see them to this day, they had a\nsorority from high school. We just had a reunion because somebody came in from out of\ntown. And I remember going on the high holy days with a girlfriend, and we went from\none synagogue to the other, but as far as religion, religion for me to keep, that\u2019s not what\ndirected me, I did what everybody else did. I will -- do remember distinctly, when came\nYom Kippur, and my aunt wanted me to go to synagogue to say yisker for my mother,\nand I refused. I said, \u201cThat means I\u2019ll bury my mother.\u201d That I remember distinctly. In\nretrospect, I think I did not accept for -- what really happened. First of all, I didn\u2019t know\nthe details. People didn\u2019t talk in those days, right off, and re -- you have to realize I -- I --\nI didn\u2019t associate with the Europeans, with the DP\u2019s who came. Cousins came -- I had\nmade American friends, and I went with them, and these were 18 year old girls who --\nwho I don\u2019t think talked about -- who talked about the Holocaust, outside maybe of the\nDP\u2019s who came, I have no idea because I had no contact with them. I worked the sewing\nfactory and they came there, but nobody talked about it, so religion-wise, no, I had to\nfight and say again with the Catholics, I had -- I had to tell them that I did not face anti-\nSemitism, and I think -- I think that was something that was hard for them to accept until\nI left my aunt, and then inna -- it wa -- it was never talked about. I worked in the sewing\nfactory, there were all American girl -- girls, until the DP\u2019s came, and we had, I think, a\nHungarian forewoman, and I don\u2019t speak Hungarian. I just found myself more in\ncommon with the American girls. Maybe I was anxious to become Americanized, or\nwhatever, whatever, and all the people that affiliated with even the factory, were not\nJewish. Fa -- The friends that I made were Jewish, but the environment where I worked\nwas not Jewish. And even when I changed factories, I think I was the only Jewish girl\nworking there, when I went to Prinz beeterman. I never felt out of place working among -\n- among non-Jews.

        "A: No, no, no, because I worked in the sewing industry, which was Jewish owned, but I\nhad heard at -- over the years, as the girls went out for jobs, I heard about discrimination\nin hiring Jews, some of the companies. But I personally, no, no, never. I was very good\nfriends with -- when I was at Prinz beeterman, pe-people of Catholic-Polish extract, I\nmean di -- didn\u2019t talk religion, religion didn\u2019t come into it.

        "A: Very difficult. I said I was a dressmaker. I have what they call golden hands, meaning\nI\u2019m very, very good with my hands. And Cleveland was a center for the manufacturing of\nclothing. To -- My aunt took me to Lampoles, and of course I was grabbed off, and I was\nin shock, because they had rows of sewing machines. I was not used to it. And I tried to\ntell them that I had gone to school, that I wa -- I was eight -- I was almost -- Just about 20.\nAnd I told them I was a high school graduate. I was -- I wasn\u2019t graduated the high s -- it\nwas easier to say that I was educated. Looked like kid, didn\u2019t speak English but very\nlittle. And for some reason or other -- the only thing years later I could think of 1s, the\nenvironment I found myself, I could take my aunt -- even my parents, how much\nschooling did they have? And I think they put us all in the same package. Now, the DP\u2019s\nwho came, also didn\u2019t have the education, because Germany invited -- invaded, you\nknow, much earlier, and they looked at me, and I guess they thought we were stupid, and\nthey just put us in the same pot of the people who ga -- don\u2019t forget, during World War\nTwo, there was no immigration, and they put me to put piecework.

It was very had to -- t-to\nadjust to the way of life. I had trouble with some of the foods a little bit. I didn\u2019t have the\nbest facilities living with my aunt, because my cousin was still living at home, he wasn\u2019t\nmarried and I slept on the couch. I lived with my aunt for three months. And then I\nmoved in with a couple, she was British, he was a soldier in England, and he had married\na British girl. I eventually no -- moved with them. In those days, girls didn\u2019t rent\napartments. And he was the brother of a very close friend of mine, to this day, I\u2019m very,\nvery close, it\u2019s like family with me.

But I did\nmove in with them, and I found a family, really. I got very close with one of their\ndaughter-in-law, and I lived there. I was dating very heavy and it worked out very nicely,\nbecause I spoke Yiddish fluently. And I went to work on the streetcar, and lived with\nthem until I got married, really. Until I got married in 1948, in November 1948, and I\nlived with them. And I adjusted. First of all, I did try to go back to visit my father, but\nafter the real hard adjustment was over, couldn\u2019t get a passport, cause I was not a Czech\nres -- citizen, I was not a Russian citizen, and I was not an American citizen.

        "A: I married in \u201948. When my son was born in \u201951, we moved to Sandusky, Ohio, which\nis not far from here, Aceder Point, and we lived there for seven years. My husband\nbecame ill. I was working 1n the factory until shortly before my son was born. I had\nfemale trouble, he was born early, I had a difficult pregnancy. We moved to Sandusky,\nand we struggled. Financially, emotionally, but we made very good friends. I made some\nvery, very good friends in Sandusky. It\u2019s much developed since then. And there was no\npla -- we didn\u2019t have money, so we made friends, we babysat for each other. Spend -- We\nhad friends, we went for Christmas dinner, Easter dinner. There was a small Jewish\ncommunity, we were not active with it. We were turned down to go to services because\nwe didn\u2019t have money. That was also a slap in the face. And my hus became quite ill, was\nhospitalized, and I moved back to Cleveland. Tried to get back into the sewing industry,\nwent to Prinz beeterman, but the place had changed, ended up doing alterations in small\nstores. My son was young, went to Jewish Family Service, got no help. I very hurt\nfeelings and very -- not bitter any more, but -- and I went to work in small stores with\nalterations, which paid very, very little. My husband came out of the hospital, went into\npractice. I went to work for him, then he was hospitalized again for a very, very long\ntime. And I worked with a Social Worker, to cope with his illness, to cope with my child.\nI was very, very concerned about my child, and I worked with a Social Worker, and then\neventually with the child psychi -- my son was alright, but 1t was to help me cope, and to\ntry to keep him as even as can be. And it was through the help of a Social Worker, at the\nVA, that I had the guts to go to school, and take classes to become a secretary. I saw the\nwriting on the wall, I didn't know how long my husband would be ill, and I couldn\u2019t stay\nin the sewing industry, I worked for a small store, there were long layoffs, there were\nshort hours. And they didn\u2019t have the Social Security laws where you get Social Security\nfor -- for an ill person, 1t came later. And I went -- I went to Dyke first, and then I went to\nTri-C, because Dyke was expensive, and I finished off there. And I was working half a\nday, going to school, borrowed a tape machine, and I\u2019m talking an old tape, to -- to do my\nshorthand, which I never used eventually, anyway. Was very nervous, was very self-\nconscious, and it was through the help of a Social Worker that gave me enough\nconfidence to say -- you know, I was a foreign background, my accent was much heavier.\nI spoke English fluently, but I had never had real formal English. I went to Tri-C, took an\nEnglish class. Got me more confused than anything. And I ended up applying at\nUniversity Hospitals, couldn\u2019t pass the typing test, I was so nervous. I did pass the\nspelling test, but in those days I used to go -- in French they spell it this way, in English\nit\u2019s this way, I was still, because I hadn\u2019t worked with the English language. And I -- You\nhave to be at the right place at the right time, and they had someone who took care of\nsecretaries. I was coming out of school, I mean, I -- I had -- I had the certificates for\npassing the typing and everything, and I guess I made -- not I guess, I made an\nimpression on the head of personnel at the time. I was a foreign background, I was in the\nsewing industry, and in those days, adults didn\u2019t go back to school, very, very few, and I\nwent to Tri-C, I think I met one or two adults who went to school. And the doctor who\nhired me, he -- they told me later they felt sorry for me, because I guess I was very\nscared, I was very self-conscious. I was self-conscious of my English, and I thought I\nwould go to work. Even though I didn\u2019t pass the typing test, they sent me to three\ninterviews. I never made the third one, and I took this one. And I went -- I worked for\nhim for 10 years, because he left University Hospitals, and I was going to work three\nyears and better myself financially, but the work was so interesting, because there was\nresearch, because of the affiliation with Case West -- well, it was Western Reserve then,\nCase Western Reserve. And he left, and I stayed on for three years, and I julo -- just\nloved my work, the best thing I did was leaving the sewing industry. I was way down\nfinancially when my husband got sick. I -- His brother saved me with a few dollars. I\ndidn\u2019t have money to feed my kid at the time. I -- The sewing industry, I struggled -- I\ndid get some money, was it Social Security at the time, a little bit, and I managed to\nsurvive. And once I went into become a secretary, my su -- I was divorced, my husband\nwanted to -- the divorce, and my son went to live with him, and I got on my feet. And the\nbest thing I did was to leave the sewing industry. My mother used to say, \u201cIt\u2019s much\neasier to work with your brain, than to work with your back,\u201d which I couldn\u2019t see at the\ntime. And I worked in an environment that was intellectual, even though I was not much\nof an intellect, but I learned a lot. We had a lot of people coming and going and I just\nloved my work, because those were the days of the typewriters, we typed and we typed\nand we typed. And it so happened that everybody was foreign. The director was foreign,\nthe associate director was -- he was f -- grew up in Austria, the associate director was\nfrom Yugoslavia. We had a technician from India, with -- one time there was -- the\nsupervising technician was the only one who was an American person. And I ended up,\nfor some reason or other, my English was very, very good, and I started slowly editing\nthe manuscript. We\u2019re talking technical manuscript research. And first with the commas,\nand with the this, and slowly but surely, over the years, I edited from one paragraph to the\nother, from one part to the other, and I didn\u2019t allow him to put my name on as whatever\nhe produced, and produ -- the only place I allowed him to acknowledge me, he wrote a\nbook on babies born with birth defects in the brain, because I was secretary to the\nDivision of Neuropathology. And that\u2019s the only place my -- that I allowed him to\nrecognize m -- I used to tease him, I says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be affiliated with this.\u201d And\nthe work was very, very interesting. He left --",
        "A: Reinhart Friede. It was very interesting, because my name is Frida, but his was F-r-1-e-\nd-e, and only twice was there a mi-mix up, because I didn\u2019t hear the doctor in front of\nFriede, otherwise -- and I spell mine F-r-i-d-a. But, we -- only twice it happened that the\nnames were confused. And he was a very straight faced, he looked very stern, but oh, did\nwe have fun. I mean, we had technicians who were a lot of fun. I never lost a day\u2019s pay. I\nlearned to get on my feet, I learned to invest money, in a small way. And I ret -- And\nthen, they had a new director who came, who was a complete opposite, Dr. Gambetti. P.\nLuigi Gambetti, with such different personality, I thought I would never make it, and for\nthree years, it just didn\u2019t work, and his wife wa -- he\u2019s an MD, his wife is a Ph.D., and\nshe came, she\u2019s from South America, and it took three years to adjust, and to this day, I\ngo and I visit with them, I invite them for dinner. Their daughters came in from out of\ntown, I went. And I was able to say, \u201cDr. Gambetti, I don\u2019t understand Italian.\u201d And I\nwas able to close the door and say, \u201cYou have to hear me,\u201d because his mind was\nsomeplace else, and I was handling a lot, a lot of money on grants. And I retired from\nthere just in time, before -- as the health industry is changing, there\u2019s no more Division of\nNeuropathology, as far as the hospital is concerned. I had hospital work, and bulk of my\nwork was Case Western Reserve University, because of the research, and they eventually\nhired another secretary, she took my place as a matter of fact. And I ended up handling\ngrants, and I kept screaming, \u201cI trained to be a secretary, not a bookkeeper.\u201d Finally got\nthe stuff on the computer, and it was double work, because the computer did not\ncommunicate with the accounting department of Case Western Reserve University. So I\nwas projecting on the computer, and multiplying, but then I still had statements every\nmonth. And I just didn\u2019t like my work any more, because I didn\u2019t do the manuscripts.\nYou know, the word processors came out. I didn\u2019t read them over and over. Today they\nare all type, they are all manuscripts more or less, change them, you know, on the word\nprocessors. So it just wasn\u2019t the same and the set up with the administrators who are\nchanging, and I got out just in time. I don\u2019t think I could have survived it. But I learned a\nlot, my mind was working and he gave me a party when I retired, Dr. Gambetti. No\nsecretary had what I had. He -- Dr. Russman, the ass-associate director, had a daughter\nwho was doing, on the side or second job, or whate -- she did catering on her own, and\nwe went to the conference room in one of the -- in the Bowwell Center. And he gave me\na going away party with beef tenderloin, white wine, flowers, you name it. And I know\nwhat displeased me 1s I had to invite everybody in the -- in the Institute of Pathology,\neven the people I didn\u2019t care. I had to think of people from Case Western Reserve that I\nhad a lot of contact, from the hospital. I think I had about 100 - 110 people. And we had a\nstorm that day. My girlfriend from Beria never made it, they were iced in. And they\npresented me with a gift certificate that just about covered a cruise, because I told -- I was\nso tired, I was trying to wind up everything, not to leave loose ends, be -- by the time I\nleft, and it didn\u2019t work out. Everything changed afterwards, anyway. And that\u2019s the going\naway he gave me. I went shortly after, with a tray of candy and was able to write a note,\n\u201cT know it\u2019s because of you that I had this.\u201d Today they couldn\u2019t do it, because the money\nisn\u2019t there, but that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what I got as a going away for retiring. It was such a\ndifferent environment than the sewing industry, especially in the small shops. I worked in\n-- in the sewing industry I worked with, at the time, many Polish immigr -- DP\u2019s actually,\nwho had gone through anti-Semitism, the camps. And when you sew, your mind is not\noccupied, so they would tr -- you know, they would talk about different things. And they\n-- | was raised whatever I do is good enough, and I was not afraid of anything. I mean, tar\n-- | was a shy girl and everything, I mean, talk about what was left, after that I just\nblossomed out until I wasn\u2019t afraid of anything, and I wasn\u2019t afraid to speak back. And it\n-- the store I worked in, it was the couple who owned it. He was low key, she was -- I\ndon\u2019t know why these people were afraid of her, she used to come down and I don\u2019t\nknow. The bookkeeper was an American born American, and she thought she was\nsomething better than anybody else.",
        "A: The alterations, and the store, she -- I mean, I faced her -- I -- I was not -- I was not\nconcern, I mean I just put her straight. And I used -- I remember one time, I say, \u201cWhat\nare you afraid of?\u201d I says, \u201cWe all leave, they can\u2019t keep the store going, they need us.\u201d\nYou know, there was six or seven of us working there. So, when I left there, my biggest\npleasure was, as I was going to school and working there, and I decided I had to give up\nthe working, ya -- because I couldn\u2019t practice my typing. I did well in shorthand, but not\nin typing, and I just couldn\u2019t keep up. My husband was hospitalized out of town, and I\nwas driving back and forth on the weekend. And my biggest pleasure was when I went in\nand I was hired, through University Hospitals, I bought a used car, and I went in, because\nI had befriended -- her name 1s -- was Litta Ridman, she was 80 years old at the time.\nAnd I came in with the keys, and I said -- not knowing what I was walking into, I said,\n\u201cI\u2019m secretary to the professor of neuropathology at Western Reserve University,\u201d and\nwas it Fran, the bookkeeper or was it the owner Mr. Philips, who say, \u201cWhat\u2019s\nneuropathology?\u201d And as a foreigner, it made me feel so gra, because I don\u2019t know why,\nin the small stores, they just -- they try to -- to make you look down. And the head fitter\nwas a German woman, Jewish woman, who knew less than I did in alterations, I guess,\nfor some reason or other, she had learned, and really was -- at times she was alright. She\nhad a husband who had MS or something. She had problems, but I just put my foot down,\nbecause I said, \u201cShe has problems, so do I.\u201d\u201d And I remember a couple times, I took a\ngown and I threw it at her, because I knew more than she did as far -- nobody could take\naway the sewing from me. Took me a hard time struggling to become a secretary because\nI was confident in sewing, but not as a secretary. B-Yet after working there, it worked out\nall right. I mean, I was confident, I was comfortable, I was respected and I worked in an\nenvironment that, you know, the hospi -- 1t wasn\u2019t even the hospital, it really is\npathology, neuropathol -- you know, you get cornered in one small division -- where I\nwas respected, and there -- there -- there ca -- there th -- you had MD\u2019s, Ph.D.\u2019s, and very\nplay -- you know, nobody put on the air, you were accepted, on -- on -- on -- on a same\nlevel. So I -- I worked myself out, and I started, quote, living. It\u2019s not a full life. My son\nwent off to Kent, married. I have three beautiful granddaughters. One just graduated from\nhigh school. She is off to college in va -- in Virginia, she\u2019s off to college. Alicia just\nturned 18, Whitney will be 16 in September, and Erica, the little one, just was Bats\nMitzvahed in May. And I hoped to go back and forth to Virginia, really. Besides, I\u2019ve\nbeen traveling on a trip, a big trip once a year. And it\u2019s hard to see my grandchildren\ngrow up, because I look at them and think to myself, \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s the age I was\nthat Germans walked in on that time.\u201d And things are surfacing, I guess, that maybe I\npushed back, that I didn\u2019t want to face. I have guilt feelings, when things are very, very\nbad for me. Not lately, so much. When I\u2019ve gone through difficult times, I have felt that I\nwas being punished, that I deserved it, because I didn\u2019t suffer the same as my family did.\nAnd it -- it just happens every so often, and I think what I\u2019m going to do now 1s try to call\nit quote, finalize. I\u2019m going to look into a trip to go [indecipherable] feeling -- and I know\nthere\u2019s nothing there, to go to yadva -- to -- not to Yad Vashem, to Auschwitz, just to get\nit out of my system. And for many years, I thought, oh maybe my sister is floating around\nsomeplace, and doesn\u2019t know where she is. And I think, as I get older, I realize how alone\nI am. I have no sisters, I have no nieces. My husband comes from a ra -- broken family,\nand I have no nieces and nephews. The fe -- cousins that I have -- I have one that I\u2019m\npretty close with. But he\u2019s quite ill now, 1s -- as it is, their children live in the same area\nwhere my son lives, all three of them. But I have, as far as family, family, but I ha -- I\nhave no close ties. But I have -- still have friends from -- I met when I came to the States.\nMy girlfriend Esther, with whom I\u2019m very, very close, died many, many years ago, of\nbreast cancer. Many years ago. And I have two of the -- the girls that I met from the\nsorority that I consider family. I go there -- I -- I\u2019m not invited, I\u2019m expected. But what\nhappens, we\u2019re all getting older, so now the children are doing the holidays and it so\nhappen they\u2019re out of town. So, my life is changing a little bit, you know, as far as that\u2019s\nconcerned. But they\u2019re -- they\u2019re two friends -- I have other ones too, that I can depend\non, and I consider family, but you realize, I don\u2019t know why, it scares me sometimes,\nbecause I don\u2019t want to get depressed, I don\u2019t want to run into -- to the elderly lev -- you\nknow, left alone or something like that. And -- And to feel, you know, I do -- I do get\ndown, but everybody does at one time or other. I seem to overcome it, and I\u2019m very\nthankful for what I have, really. I\u2019m comfortable financially. I take one big trip, at least\nonce a year. Went to the -- a national parts la -- parks last year with a friend. The year\nbefore, I was in France. I have plans to go to Iceland in September. I\u2019ve gone with Elder\nHostel, and I go for short trips to an Elder Hostel with a friend, or I\u2019ve gone by myself. I\nwent to Equador by myself, had a strange room mate, the same thing to France, and that\u2019s\nabout it, really. But the guilt -- the guilt -- the guilt is there, the guilt is. Although I don\u2019t\nface real hard times, like when my husband was ill, and things came up, and it\u2019s a\nterrible, terrible feeling. I used to also shudder when I used to hear the airplanes, when\nthey had the propellers, but now they have the jets. But I -- When the airplanes used to\ngo, I just -- just absolutely shuddered, but now with the prope -- with the jets, you don\u2019t\nget it, so I -- I don\u2019t feel 1t any more. I don\u2019t quite have the nightmares I used to -- to\nhave. I guess I\u2019m settling, I guess. Trying to enjoy my grandchildren. Not one of them\nbelongs to me, they all take after the father\u2019s side of the family, their grandfather, and the\nmiddle one takes after her mother\u2019s side of the family, because one 1s strawberry blonde,\ntwo redheads. And the eyes and the shapes, there isn\u2019t one that belongs to my side of the\nfamily, nothing\u2019s come out. But, make the best of it. So, I\u2019m not unhappy, it\u2019s maybe not\na full life, but I\u2019m contented, make the best of it, you know.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I -- ?'m -- You know, first of all, when I went back to Belgium, 10 years after I came -\n- a year after my father died, my aunt brought up some of the ho-horrors, which I didn\u2019t\nwant to listen to. And then people started talking about the Holocaust. I never -- When I\ntalked about it, I talked about my years in hiding, things like that. I did not talk about\nwhat happened in the concentration camps. When it really, really surfaced is when I was\ninterviewed for the museum, and I had to bring all that up. I had to dig in on -- oh, and I\nsaw -- I saw Rachelle in Israel, spent a -- a night -- a day with her. I dug into a lot of\nthings, and then I worked with a young man, I can\u2019t think -- I have his name written\ndown, and he sent me -- I have the papers that show the number of th -- their records that\nwere kept in Liege, of the numbers of the transport. And I guess -- No, I think I\u2019ve\naccepted it, I just -- I just -- there\u2019s some -- I don\u2019t know if Pll go, but I\u2019m going to look\ninto it, just to -- I don\u2019t know what good it\u2019ll do just to -- I don\u2019t know why, I mean it\u2019s\nnot going to do any good. There\u2019s very little left, I\u2019m aware of it. And maybe go and see\neastern Europe, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know why I have to do it. But I\u2019ve accepted a long\ntime ago, if you can accept some -- something like that, there\u2019s still -- I don\u2019t know, some\nfeelings or something. And now, with the grandchildren sometimes asking questions, it --\nit has -- it has to -- it has to be accepted. I mean, there\u2019s no two ways about it.",
        "A: That\u2019s interesting. Not much, not much, not much.",
        "A: The little one has asked me -- excuse me -- more questions. Sh -- I had her in the car\nwith me, by myself, and she said, \u201cYour mother died,\u201d or something like that, and she\nstarted asking me -- when she just did a -- a project on immigration, and I gave her all the\npapers, and she did ask me why I left my father, which was very hard for me to explain.\nYou know, there\u2019s -- there were such hard feelings, there\u2019s no -- no need to bring it up\nany more, it\u2019s in -- in the past, and I just told her my father thought it was better for me to\nbe with my aunt. She\u2019s asked me more questions. Alicia, I guess through projects in\nschool, I remember I had to tell her something, and I can\u2019t remember what. Whitney, the\nmiddle one, has never asked me any questions, but that doesn\u2019t mean anything. My son\nnever asked questions either. I did hide the pictures, because everybody had died, and yet,\nwhen he le -- heard about -- that\u2019s how I found out about the museum, and he told me\nabout it, he apparently was very well aware of it, and what\u2019s interesting is he named --\nWhitney, the middle one -- I don\u2019t know how you -- they ended up with Whitney after\nmy mother, he said that it should always be remembered. And even when the girls have\nthe Bats Mitzvah, he does bring up that my family perished in the Holocaust. It\u2019s\ninteresting, because I was never very traditional. He was not Bar Mitzahed, but he\nbecame very close with the temple, and the -- the girls are very -- course, well, he became\ninvolved somehow or other, even though I never pushed it. And I did all this for my\nchildren, so lot of things surfaced when I did the interviews, and things. As a matter of\nfact, my son, when he was in Kent -- I didn\u2019t mention it, when he went to Kent, they had\nthe Yom Kippur war, and he raised money for 1 -- for 1 -- for Israel. He and his room\nmate, they lived in the Hillel House, the Hi-Hillel had rented a house and he -- and he\u2019s\nstill friends with this guy, occupied the third floor, the upstairs. And they raised money\nfor Israel. They made the national news as a matter of fact, because they raised money for\n-- he had -- it was a ham operator and when he told me was president of Hillel, I almost\nflipped because, I mean, you know, so I guess even though I was not traditional in\nkeeping the holidays, so to speak, and things like that, there\u2019s some Jewishness in him\nand the girls are -- went through Bats Mitzvah and everything like that, so something is\nprojected on him. And it\u2019s hard to tell with Alicia how much she feels or how much she\ndoes or -- you never know, and first of all, they live long distance. Maybe if they lived in\ntown, it would be different, I don\u2019t know. Whitney\u2019s the only one who never asked, but\nshe\u2019s the quiet one.

That was the very first time, and I really had to dig, and\nyou know, sh -- I remember her saying, \u201cHow did you feel?\u201d I had to stop and think, I\nmean, how did I feel? I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not things that I think about. So you have to dig\nup all these memories and all these feelings. How did you feel? I -- I don\u2019t know how I\nfelt, I had to stop and think. Was I scared? Sure, we were scared at times. What did I feel\nwhen my mother -- when I found out about my mother being deported? I remember\ncrying in Brussels, I remember, and Madame Freidman forced me to go to -- I hated her,\nbut she forced me to go to the shul, she thought it would be better for me. You float\naround, you have no thoughts. Why I came to the States? Who knows? I have no idea -- I\nreally don\u2019t know, you -- you do things, you -- you don\u2019t think. I -- I didn\u2019t have an\naverage teenage life. I mean, I look at my grandchildren and I don\u2019t know what I would\nhave done. Of course, no matter what war, not war, every generation 1-1s different The\nkids are so much more aware than we were. There\u2019s television, there\u2019s e-mail, there\u2019s\ninternet. I mean, they\u2019re -- we didn\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t -- We didn\u2019t question, we didn\u2019t\nask. I mean, children were to be seen and not heard, so I don\u2019t know, don\u2019t remember\nanything. So, I have to dig in, to really stop and think, and remember things. I know -- I\ndon\u2019t even know if we were really cousin, my c -- we refer to her as cousin, her name is\nalso Frida. She lived in Belgium. I came to the States, and I found out years later that she\nwent to Israel. She married -- She married a French Algerian and she lives in Paris, and\nI\u2019ve seen her twice, and then we dig into things and some things she remembers and\nsome things I remember. But the first time this came about -- I don\u2019t think it did the\nsecond time, she -- she had to wake me up during the night because I had nightmares.\nWhen I was in Paris two years ago, and my cousin Miriam came in from Brussels, we\nspend the day together, she had questions about her father and thing. And I had to stop\nand think, because we grew up as -- we didn\u2019t question, you know. Turn it off.",
        "A: I did it originally to -- to -- what made me do it, because my son wanted me to do it. I\nthink until then, I did not appreciate the importance of having testimonies, you know, so\nthat, well, the non-believers will never believe it happened, but that there should be\nsomething that -- from survivors, t-to prove that these things really existed. I never\nthought of it in those terms before, never thought of it until Mark called me. As a matter\nof fa -- I didn\u2019t think they would take my -- my -- my story, because when he first told\nthem, I says, \u201cMark, they won\u2019t be interested, because I was not 1n the concentration\ncamps.\u201d But apparently it was more than just for -- from people in the concentration\ncamps, so -- but I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t see the importance of it until -- until then. And -- And\nnow, with the girls getting older, the grandchildren getting older and asking questions,\nand things like that, I feel it\u2019s important that there\u2019s testimony, what it -- what will\nhappen years later, I don\u2019t know. Look what\u2019s happening in Yugosla -- it still goes on, it\ndoesn\u2019t stop it, but at least there\u2019s proof, whoever wants to believe it, to know that it\nreally happened.

There was no money in it, that\u2019s what made me leave.\nBec -- I didn\u2019t go for the department stores for some reason or other. I went to the small\nshops, and sewing industry is predominantly Jewish, and I worked with, you know, a -- in\n-- in those days, DP\u2019s. I mean, today it\u2019s entirely different. I left because first of all my\nmind -- your -- y-your mind 1s not occupied, so you talk, and you bring up things. I was\nhaving problems because my husband was ill at the time, and -- and y-you have too much\ntime -- y-your mind 1s free. In other words, your hands are busy, but not your mind. And I\nneeded a better income than doing alterations. As a matter of fact, I just bought\nsomething in one of the department stores, and I had a pair of pants shortened, because I\ndon\u2019t have the -- the mach -- my machine is old and it doesn\u2019t have some of the stuff that\nI need. And I -- I don\u2019t sew any more, and I did talk to the -- the woman who fitted me.\nIt\u2019s -- I asked her -- she\u2019s from Greece, I don\u2019t know what her background 1s, and I let her\nknow that I was a fitter, cause the first one I had was terrible, was somebody new, new in\nthe country and I knew she was not a fitter. And I asked for a real fitter. Anyway, she\ncame and she said she was from Greece, and I let her know the training, and you know,\nmy background. And I said I luckily left it, because they didn\u2019t pay. And she did tell me\nthat it pays much better. I says, but not as well, probably, as the tailors, because the\ntailors supported the families, even if they did alteration, and she said yes, it was on the\nsame par. So I guess things have changed. I don\u2019t know which -- at which point in life,\nbut at the time -- at the time I did alterations, I even -- I did well. The dress shop where I\nhad worked before I went to school, I -- they were paying a dollar and a quarter an hour, I\ngot a dollar and a half. I ti -- he asked me to come and help. And I went -- A friend of\nmine, who was a secretary says, \u201cFrida,\u201d she says --I was very nervous, very self-\nconscious about becoming a secretary, I -- my foreign background, and this and that. And\nshe said, \u201cGo on temporaries, that\u2019s a good way to start.\u201d And I got a job for one day at --\nata TV station. And I remember -- What did I make? In -- th -- Mr. Philips called me\nback. Oh, and I said, \u201cUnless you pay me two dollars an,\u201d -- oh yeah, they were paying\nme two dollars an hour, temporary. I didn\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t do anything, I di -- and he --\nhe never -- he never took me, so -- and there were long layoff seasons. They weren\u2019t fair\nin the way they were laying off people. M -- Talking small store, and if I was five\nminutes late, I lost the five minutes. And I went to work for University Hospitals, for\nsome reason or other, I don\u2019t remember what I paid for bread yesterday, but I -- that was\ntwo dollars an hour, even at 40 hours, which I didn\u2019t put in, it would have been 80\ndollars, and I was --what did I earn? Oh, wait a minute. I want -- I wa -- I was earning so\nmuch more it was unbelievable. I mean, there\u2019s no comparison, and like I say, and a -- I\nretired with a pension, which I -- I don\u2019t know if the stores do it, and the small stores are\nslowly disappearing. They can\u2019t survive with all the -- all this -- chain stores, so that\u2019s\nwhat made me leave, I knew I had to support myself in a different way and I said, I don\u2019t\ncare what I do, I never, never want to face what I faced when my son was seven year old,\nwhere I did not have money to go buy food to feed him. And it never happened again, so\nJ -- I -- I had illnesses, I had surgeries, I never lost a day\u2019s work which wouldn\u2019t have\nhappened in those days in the sewing industry. And the factories, th-the sewing factories,\nthe garment far -- factory had slowly, over the years, moved south for -- for lower wages,\nand now, of course, they come from overseas, so I had to get out of -- of that\nenvironment. And whether the department stores pay better, I don\u2019t know. Sometimes I\nthink I should wan -- go back for a little bit part time, just to learn to deal with the new\nfabrics, and the new things. I still -- I still, I think, have a touch for it. I went through a\nperiod where I sewed all my clothes, I\u2019m very had to fit. But you can\u2019t get the fabrics in\nCleveland any more. There\u2019s one fabric shop left, but you da -- can\u2019t get the fine wools,\nand the silks, and the -- I can\u2019t even knit, because there are no knit shops. I can\u2019t get the\nyarns, or anything like that. That\u2019s what I miss. But I have no regret that I went to -- to\nwhere -- to what I did, the environment was entirely different.",
        "A: October 14, 1951.",
        "A: I was married novem -- wait a minute, I was married November nine, 1946.",
        "A: A girlfriend went someplace, and my husband was there and I don\u2019t know, somehow\nor other, something came up about my speaking French, and he had studied French, and\nthat\u2019s how -- he called me, and that\u2019s how I met him. I was going with someone from\nSouth Bend, Indiana at the time. I remember going by train to South Bend, Indiana. I had\na distant cousin there, where I had spent some time, and I had met somebody. That\u2019s how\nI met my husband, to a girlfriend -- through a girlfriend. And he called me because he\nhad studied French, and he remembered. He has a fantastic memory. And that\u2019s how I\nmet him.",
        "A: He was podiatrist. He was in school at the time. He was in school, he had two mo -- it\nwas supposed to be one year, and the year he was there, he -- they extended the class to\ntwo years. And graduated, and he went into podiatry. But in those days they were called\nchiropodists, and they didn\u2019t have -- they were very limited on what they could do, you\nknow. No surgery, they couldn\u2019t even prescribe an aspirin or anything like that. And we\nmoved to Sandusky and then just -- no matter how hard he tried it, 1t never -- 1t never\ntook off. That\u2019s why we came back to Cleveland. His illness, and then whatever. And\nthen I couldn\u2019t go to work in Sandusky because I was married to a doctor and I didn\u2019t\nhave a profession. And it was through somebody I had befriended there, that she\nsuggested I do alterations at home, and I says, \u201cWait a minute, I don\u2019t do alterations, I\u2019m\na dressma -- I know how to make a garment, but I don\u2019t know alternations.\u201d And it was\nthrough her -- I would make hems and things like that, and I made a little bit of money on\nthe side. And that\u2019s how I went into alterations when I came back to Cleveland, because I\ntried the sewing factory, but the sewing industry was not the same, I couldn\u2019t earn money\nor -- or anything like that. And I couldn\u2019t ear-earn enough to support my son. And\neventually, the Social Security laws came out, so I was able to earn, and I got Social\nSecur -- just as I got my job at University Hospitals, I got Social Security for him and for\nmy son, until he reached, you know, age where they didn\u2019t give it. So that helped me,\nbecause I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t survive on what I was making. I was a -- making 80 -- 80\nsomething dollar -- 80 -- was it 86 dollars a week, or something. 87.50, now I remember,\na week. As opposed to a dollar and a quarter, or a dollar and a half an hour. And then I\nhad benefits. I had sick days. And when -- I used to get sick every three weeks, not every\nmonth, I needed a day off. I was, you know, in bed. So, a-all together, it worked out very\nnicely. And it was a different environment. I never thought of going into an intellectual\nbackground, but it was marvelous. I mean, it was very enlightening. We had what they\ncall now Research Associate they call them. People who came from different countries\nfor two years, to do research. So you had a very diversified background, and it was very -\n- it was very good, it was very enlightening, 1t was not backbreaking, you know. If I had\nstayed in the sewing industry, I\u2019m pretty sure I wouldn\u2019t be even living here, even though\nit\u2019s not high rent or anything. I would -- I would be on subsidi -- I would have to be in\nsubsidized apartments. Nothing wrong with it, I know a lot of people in it, but at least \u2019'm\nfree to come and go, and -- as I want, and live where I want, and --",
        "A: Course, yeah, that came out of my tape, I know. I did not feel different at any time for\nbeing Jewish while I grew up in Belgium.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That did come out, because that is very true.",
        "A: Go ahead.",
        "A: Oh. Oh, I -- I knew I was coming to a melting spot. I mean, I didn\u2019t understand the --\nthe -- the real details, or anything like that. I knew, even with the -- with the slavery, but\ndidn\u2019t understand the full extent of it, until I lived with it and was exposed to it. And\nwhen I would go someplace and fill out a -- when I went to Lampole, which is -- was a\nsewing factory, one of the big ones in Cleveland, and I was shocked that they ask what\nmy nationality was. And when I told -- I don\u2019t remember who I told, my family,\nsomebody, I said, \u201cI marked Czechoslovakia.\u201d And they said, \u201cYou should have said\nJewish.\u201d I says, \u201cJewish is a religion, it\u2019s not a nationality.\u201d I had to argue wh-why are\npeople so conscious of what religion somebody is. I will discuss the differences if I have\na-an -- an intelligent conversation. I worked with an Indian girl, you know, from India. I\nworked with a Black -- what they call a-an African American girl, and that was the\nbeginning of -- where the -- the Blacks were, you know, being absorbed, and things like\nthat, and talk openly -- I will talk about it. But, people will say to me about somebody,\n\u201cAre they ja -- is he, or is she Jewish?\u201d I says, \u201cIt never entered my mind to ask.\u201d\nBecause I take a person the way they are an-an-and I -- and I don\u2019t think what are they. I\ncouldn\u2019t understand, also, why they went into ethnic backgrounds, but I\u2019m learning, I\u2019m\nlearning. It\u2019s interesting to find what is their background, you know, where their parents\ncame from, because those are cultures. That I can understand. We\u2019ll discuss the -- I -- I\nwould like to take a class in comparative religion, because I don\u2019t know anything about\nthe Islamic religion, and I think it\u2019s very interesting, they all have their points. And that is\nsomething that really amazed me, w -- and at the time, I did not understand what\u2019s the\ndifference what my nationality is, but now I understand. It\u2019s just -- I just took a class on\nimmigration, through the elder campus at Tri-C, and the professor was very, very\ninteresting. He happened to be Slov-Slovenian? Yeah. And he had taught at Case\nWestern Reserve and everything. And we reached a point about the bilingual, the\nSpanish. And I told him he opened my eyes. I always felt, wait a minute, I spoke French,\nnobody bothered to have things translated in French, explain -- I had to learn English.\nEverybody who came had to learn English. And he pointed out to -- to us that Spanish,\nyou take Mexico, Texas, they were the Spanish people, and the British were stronger, so\nthe -- the English wa -- language prevailed, and everything Anglican took over. And I\nlooked at him, and I says -- he said, \u201cOh, they didn\u2019t emigrate. They were forced into\nbecoming part of the -- you know, of ameri -- part of the United States, and the English\nlanguage was dumped into them, but that\u2019s taking away what is right for them.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cOkay, now I understand, now I\u2019m willing to accept that it should be, if necessary,\nbilingual.\u201d First of all, it wouldn\u2019t hurt, but you think, \u201cWait a minute, I barely spoke any\nEnglish, I had to learn English.\u201d But I can see their point, and I knew that the streets were\nnot paved with gold, that much I knew. How hard it was to work, I don\u2019t know, I was\nnever made to [indecipherable] work, the factory flabbergasted me, because there were\nrows of machines, and it was piecework, and I was used to have one garment at the time,\nhand finished. I remember going with my girlfriend Elaine shopping for clothes and what\nI used to do is turn everything inside out to see if it was finished. And she didn\u2019t want to\ngo shopping, because even in those days, everything, you know, was -- was unfinished on\nthe inside. And I learned to -- to do piecework. And then you had the oil that went around\nconstantly around the machine. They also had -- They didn\u2019t have a lunchroom, per se,\nthey had a room where you brought your lunch, and -- and you ate in that back room. But\nyou have to realize in the sewing factories, in the summertime, you worked on winter\nclothes. Wool, the lint. And we always changed clothes. I had what they call wrap\naround, they don\u2019t see them any more. And I was just flabbergasted that that were the\ncircumstances. I wanted to take up dressmaking and dress designing again, and the\nforeman, Mr. Harris, I remember his name, said to me, \u201cFrida, don\u2019t waste your time in\nCleveland, you have to go to New York.\u201d And then I met my husband and I got married,\nso I never went through with it. But I had learned through somebody about Prinz\nbeeterman. They made suits and coats, and they made a better garment. Some things were\nstill finished by hand. And I had put an application in and I think I had put an application\nfor hand sewing for some reason or other, and they never called me. And somebody -- I\nran into somebody who said they were hired. So I re-contacted Prinz beeterman, and I\nwent to work there where the conditions were much, much better. I made a lot more\nmoney by the hour. I was making a dollar something at Prinz beeterman, I went -- I mean\nat Lampoles. Went to Prinz beeterman, and I went up as high as three dollars something\nan hour piecework. And we had a lunchroom and everything. So the -- the environment\nwas entirely -- entirely different. It was whiter, 1t was cleaner. And you have to realize,\nyou worked in the sewing factory, sometimes it reached a hundred degrees in the work\nroom. I think one of the -- 1t was a si -- a knit factory, I can\u2019t think of the name, they were\nnot far from where we were on Euclid, and they moved in the suburbs, and they had air\nconditioning, but we didn\u2019t. And then I was told at -- how bad it was -- I don\u2019t know what\nyears it was, where they had the fire in New York, in the garment factories, because of\nthe condition and they didn\u2019t care about their people. So these are the things that -- I think\nthat awed me that -- I don\u2019t know. And then I used to think, oh, I reached a point in my\nlife I used to think, wonder what my life would have been if I would have stayed in\nBelgium? I don\u2019t think I would have struggled as hard as I did after I came to the States.\nThe hardest part, financially, was when my husband was ill and hospitalized, first for six\nmonths, then he was all right for three years, went back into practice. I worked for him.\nAn -- B-But the first time with no money -- I mean, no money. Two months behind in the\nrent, utilities, you name it. And I had no one to turn to. I must say that the small Jewish\ncommunity in Sandusky rallied, and somebody came to my -- to the house and ask me if I\nneeded anything. As it is, I didn\u2019t need it, because my husband\u2019s brother gave us 500\ndollars, we -- which helped me overcome the worst of it, and then I sold the house. I\ndidn\u2019t make any money on it, but I salvaged some money and moved to Cleveland, which\na -- I figured, I wonder -- the rent was 90 - 96 dollars, and then they raised it 10 dollars.\nAnd I figured, as long as the money lasts, Pll stay there. And it turned out all right. My\nhusband came out of the hospital, went into practice and we got on our feet, quote,\nfinancially, and managed to survive. And then -- I wasn\u2019t wealthy, but I was -- I had my\nhead above water. And my concern was always, I left an eight year old child at home\nalone while I went to work. He had no way of reaching me at the factory. And luckily, it\nwas through some friends who lived in the same complex, that I knew they kept an eye\non Mark. Like, he came home for lunch, and I would prepare his lunch, and I had a little\nTV tray -- table so he could have it, and years, years later, I -- some people would made\ncomment because he went to Kent State University, and when he\u2019d come home, I would\nhave a glass of milk, and I would have a sandwich wrapped, and people used to make\ncomments about it, and I said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t have what I had, where I had to leave a child\nto come home to an empty house.\u201d I hate when -- I -- I like when people have comments,\nand my daughter-in-law teased for the longest time, because Mark was terrible in the\nmorning, I couldn\u2019t get him out of bed. And the only way I could get him to sit up wa -- I\nused to squeeze fresh orange juice, and I would go and say, \u201cMark,\u201d and I would hand\nhim a glass of orange juice. And that got -- that got him sitting up in bed. But the -- the\nfinancial difficulties were really, really bad. I don\u2019t think I thought of that time of even\ngoing back or anything. I also -- There were some hard feeling that I n -- that I never,\nnever cleared my mind, is my father adored children. He never came to see his grandson.\nI did want to go back, and they offered me the fare for a boat or something, but I never\ntold my father that I didn\u2019t have any money and how badly I was struggling financially.\nWhen I went back a year after he died, my uncle -- my father\u2019s brother Josef was still\nliving, and she said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever tell your father?\u201d And I guess I had too much\npride. I never told him, I never -- and I understand he died, he had established his\nbusiness. My father died a well-to-do man, but I never -- I never asked for anything. I\nguess we were raised --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. It was a Friday, early in the morning, we lived in Sandusky, and I got a\nphone call, it was the telegram office. Didn\u2019t speak French. My uncle was sending me a\ntelegram, and they said in French, \u201cTon pere decee,\u201d and that\u2019s when I screamed, because\nthey were saying my father was deceased, and I screamed, and my husband came to the\nphone. I had no money, I had no passport, and I never went, I never saw him again,\nnever. And I went back a year later. And I went -- I saw his widow. I found out that my\nfather was very unhappily married. He had imported a woman from Czechoslovakia. You\nknow, must say this, when I came to the States, the Americans thought Europeans were\nnot discriminating because, well, we had a couple African from Belgium Congo, but you\ndidn\u2019t have the discrimination against the Black population, like here. But you wonder\nwhy there is a war going on in Yugoslavia? My father wouldn\u2019t have touched a Polish\nwoman. The -- The Czechs didn\u2019t like the Polish, the -- the Polish didn\u2019t like the\nLithuanian, I mean the -- 1-1-1t\u2019s th-the ethnic background, it\u2019s amazing, it does exist. And\nshe told me he never wa -- came. He walked around with my mother\u2019s pictures and my\nsister\u2019s pictures. And I went in to see her because my father had a ring from my mother,\nand I wanted it. And I thought, if she\u2019s wearing it, I was going to take it. She wasn\u2019t\nwearing it. And they had a couple things that were salvaged from -- I guess when my\nmother was taken away. I don\u2019t even know who stored them, never found out, never\nasked. And I guess everything came, and I took the train back to Brussels because my\nUncle Josef had moved to Brussels, and the only family I had was in Brussels. But I had\ngone to Li\u00a2ge because my father, very shortly, maybe two weeks before he died, had\nmade out a will leaving everything to his wife. And I found out that in Belgium you\ncannot disinherit a child. S -- Thr-Through a school friend in Li\u00e9ge, I -- with whom I was\nstill corresponding, she got me a lawyer. I got a few dollars, not much. I did go back to\nBelgium, but I had to go to Brussels, because my uncle was there, but the lawyer was in\nLiege. And of course, I walked in on my father\u2019s widow, and she did not know I was\ncoming. And I guess walking and seeing just a -- a couple personal belongings -- she did\ngive me the linens my mother had made by hand, I still have them, as her trousseau when\nshe was a young girl. And Ill never forget I went back to Belgium and it was dusk, and I\nwas sitting in the living room, and I was crying. And my aunt came in, and she says,\n\u201cWhat are you crying like an imbecile?\u201d And I just could not -- I could not relate to her.\nShe\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know, she raves about her -- she\u2019s crazy about her son, her daughter, I\ndon\u2019t know. And th -- She doesn\u2019t have the warmth. And she went through -- after they\nstarted picking up the Jews, they ended up in southern France. They did have a hard time,\nthey didn\u2019t go out to camps, because -- I remember they said in one camp they deported\nthe Hungarians, so they said they were Czech, and then the other camp they said deported\nthe Czech, so they said they were Hungarian. So they managed to survive. They had two\nchildren. And I don\u2019t know what kind of camps they were, because I never asked. Her --\nMy aunt\u2019s family, she had a mother, a father, two sisters and a brother. When the\nGermans invaded Belgium, they got on a train -- see, we tried to go to -- to France, we\ndidn\u2019t know they were going to invade France, her family got on a train, and the whole\nfamily was killed from the bombing, from the Germans. But yet, when I fell apart at the\nseams and came back to Brussels, and I was crying. I just couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t explain to\nher, I was exposed to -- t-t-to -- to -- to my war years, to -- to -- to -- you know, living in\nthe States, I put everything in the back. I -- I -- I guess maybe I did it intentionally, I\ndidn\u2019t think of those things. You push something out of your way, push things out of your\nmind, didn\u2019t face what really happened in the camps. And here I was, and I went back\nand all this faced me, and everything surfaced, and she just couldn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think she\ncould appreciate it. So that\u2019s the hard time I went through. And I did tell her -- she\nwanted to know why I didn\u2019t come as soon as my father died, because we had a business,\nand his widow emptied th-th-the stocks and things, so she didn\u2019t pay the taxes the way it\nshould, and I -- who even thought of it? As difficult a time as I had with my father after\nthe war, he was a fantastic father as children. During the war he -- he -- we -- we had\neverything. My father did Black Market. We never went hungry. He -- When he used to -\n- to go to the farmers and bring eggs and butter and salt on his bicycle, and -- and sell it.\nWe never -- We never went hungry. So, what happened after, was the effect of whatever\nhappened to him that maybe didn\u2019t appreciate at the time. Now that I have th -- what I\nknow is guilt feelings, because you survived, I think maybe he had guilt feelings of\nhaving survived untouched. Maybe it would have been different if he had gone out to the\ncamps and survived, I don\u2019t know. But as I matured and got older and faced the truth\nwhat happened, maybe he had guilt feelings. I don\u2019t know, he never talked about it. And\nthen, when my Uncle Gesa came, and I used to visit him quite often, I used to go to\nDenver about twice a year. Went with Mark, then went by myself. After surgery I went\nthere. And I used to say to him, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he come to the States to see his grandchild?\u201d\nAnd he just raised his shoulders and never answered, so I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t know\nwhy he came. As a matter of fact, my cousin Miriam told me in Paris that he was very\ngood to her. He was very good to her, and what happened, I don\u2019t know. As children, I\nmean, we were provided for, we had caring parents. I don\u2019t wish any more on any other\nchild. Financially, we didn\u2019t have much. I didn\u2019t know what a doll was, I don\u2019t think they\never bought me a doll. I think the dolls I got was from the schools. The schools, at\nChristmastime used to give -- I remember I had a doll. You have to remember they were\nthe breakable dolls. And I remember I put it on the window sill, and there were some lu --\nleftovers from the sewing my mother did, and the thing pushed the doll away and the doll\nbroke, but they never replaced it. Bicycles we had, because we needed it for\ntransportation. And after my accident -- I had an accident before we went into hiding. I\nwent out to the country with my sister Berta and another friend, and I don\u2019t know what\nhappened, we went ou -- I remember going uphill, and we had to walk and it was a hot\nday, and I wanted to sit down, and I -- I can\u2019t place it this time if my sister said it, or the\nother girl said it, they say, \u201cOh, Frida, now the hill goes down.\u201d And I got on the bicycle,\nand I remember as if yesterday -- I don\u2019t remember if it\u2019s my sister or the other girl,\nyelled, \u201cFrida, you\u2019re losing your pedals.\u201d I fainted and I went down the hill in a fainted\nstate. I guess th-the power of rolling down. And I went into -- I don\u2019t know if it was -- it\nwas a building, I don\u2019t know if it was a castle. And it was somebody of aristocracy, and\nthey brought me back with their chauffeurs, to the house. And I remember they gave my\nmother smelling salts, because one side of my face was damaged, and I must have had a\nslight brain concussion, because if somebody moved a chair or something, I couldn\u2019t take\nthe noise. And my mother didn\u2019t wanted me to ride a bicycle. My father went -- somehow\nor other found a second hand bicycle, so, you know, things were not produced, and I got\nanother bicycle. So I had that accident, and then I had an accident three days before my\nbirthday, my 17\" birthday. But whatever could be provided for us, schooling, we had\nprivate tutors to help us more, but not the arts, or music or anything. First of all, I was not\ninterested. Berta was, but I guess they felt that 1t was not important, so we didn\u2019t have it. I\nremember going to an opera with a neighbor. I went to see Faust. But they did not\nparticipate in the arts in any way. I never questioned it, never knew.",
        "A: Oh, I -- I like classical music and the person who got me into it is my husband, he\u2019s\nvery musically oriented. He plays the clarinet. And he would put on classical music.\nWhen I went to high school, I went to the extension, because the school was crowded,\nand behind us was the Conservatory of Music, it\u2019s well known in Europe. And then we\nwould hear the students who were just learning. Do you know what it sounds like when\nthey learn? I had no desire, I had no interest, but now I do enjoy classical music, to a\ncertain extent, I don\u2019t like chamber music, I never learned to appreciate it. I haven\u2019t\nlearned to appreciate opera, although I did go to one at the Institute of Music, with\nsomebody who lived in one of the other buildings here. But I ushered at Severence Hall\nwith -- which is the -- you know, the Cleveland orchestra? And I do enjoy classical\nmusic, I go to it. I go to the art museum whenever there is an exhibit, when we had the art\nshows, I love to walk outside. If you have enough time, you should go see the -- the\nmuseums, because Cleveland has a beautiful, beautiful Museum of Art, and Severance\nHall they\u2019re just remodeling. I just signed up to volunteer when they reo -- they\u2019re --\nthey\u2019re going to be playing downtown in one of the halls, but 1 -- they\u2019re moving back in\nJanuary, after the remodeling, and I signed up to volunteer, so I am into classical music.\nMy son played the trumpet, quite musically oriented. He gave it up when he went to\nKent, don\u2019t ask me why. One granddaughter 1s interested in dancing and music, and she\ndoes play the flute. The other ones, no. But me, I have no desire to play an instrument,\nand I enjoy certain types of music, but 1t was not in our education or in our backgrounds\nor anything like that.",
        "A: Yes. When my uncle died in Denver, and two years later, my aunt died. I didn\u2019t know\nat the time, but I was the executor for both wills. One of the heirs, my aunts nephew, was\nin Bratislava in Czechoslovakia, who was Communist at the time, managed to manipulate\nthe money so the money didn\u2019t go into Czechoslovakia, and I was in correspondence with\nhim. And somehow or other, I decided to go to Europe. Dr. Freide was in Switzerland at\nth -- at the time, in a -- in Zurich. And I was in correspondence with him because there\nwere still some strands left behind, and so on. And I wrote to him I was going to go to\nCzechoslovakia, and he said, \u201cIf you go to Czechoslovakia, stop in Zurich, we\u2019ll show\nyou the mountains.\u201d So what I did, I traveled on my own. I went to Zurich. He did offer\nfor me to stay with them and I said no. They got me a little hotel you don\u2019t get through\nthe travel agencies here, and Switzerland is very clean, so I got a room, and you could tell\nthe shower was added on. And I had breakfast and I took a couple trips. So I stayed in\nZurich for two days, took some trips, went to Bratislava.",
        "A: When did my uncle die? Let\u2019s see, 20 -- [indecipherable] died about 20 -- 22 -- about -\n-a good 20 years ago. I don\u2019t have my passport and I don\u2019t remember exactly the year,\nbut it\u2019s t -- about 20 years ago, and I went to Bratislava, which is Communist at the time.\nI had to have 10 dollars per day, couldn\u2019t spend it, the stores were empty. And I stayed\nwith my -- with Eugene and Magda, my aunt\u2019s nephew and niece. Didn\u2019t see much. Spent\na week there. Went from Bratislava to Brussels, which was a waste of time. Willy, my\ncousin, took me to see the city. I had spent three months in Brussels, I had no desire to\nsee it, I didn\u2019t do -- oh, I did take a trip into the Flemish part, on my own. It was -- I have\nno -- I grew up feeling as a Belgian citizen cha -- chain -- sang the national anthem, and\nthen after I came to the States, I realized I really would have never been a citizen,\nalthough my father died shortly before becoming a citizen of Belgium. You don\u2019t become\nautomatically like in the States. And then I went from Brussels, I went to Paris to see\nFrida and spend a week with her. And then I -- And then I came back here. And then,\nlet\u2019s see, did I go back again? No, I was out, I never went back. I have no desire to go\nback. I know Miriam said to me, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go work for the common market.\nYou\u2019re bilingual.\u201d By then I was losing my Fre -- when I say losing my French, I\nexcelled in French, but to speak two languages, and translate, are two different things.\nYou need a training and a background, and I have to stop and think, \u201cHow do you say\nthat in French?\u201d I finally met some people, quite by -- was just a freak, I took the Rapid\nto go downtown and this woman sat next to me and she had a little brochure, and I says,\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know the Americans were interested in Moliere.\u201d\u2019 And she happens -- I\ndon\u2019t know where she learned French, but she introduced me to a group, and they\u2019re\nstrictly women, we get -- they get together twice a month, at Beechwood Place, and from\n10 to 12, and then on Friday they get together at somebody\u2019s home, and everybody brings\nsomething, just for the purpose of speaking French. So I\u2019ve gotten back into speaking\nFrench, and it\u2019s not a word of English, until you turn to somebody who just came back\nfrom France, who has close contact, and you say, \u201cHow do you say such and such in\nFrench?\u201d Nobody could remember how to say flush a toilet in French. And I read French\nbooks. I go down to the library about once a month. Cleveland library downtown, the\nmain library is magnificent. I have -- going to go down next week, I think, because they\nbuilt a new building, and they re-did the old building, which was closed, and I got to\nknow -- they had a -- the foreign literature library, and she just sent me a book. She\nknows the authors I like, or if she sees a book on Belgium, she\u2019Il send it to me. One of\nthem she sent me was all about the percentages of Catholic -- Cath -- Catholicism. Still\nhave some words with trouble. So I do that, and I do have the opportunity of getting\ntogether with people to speak French. And my granddaughters are taking Spanish. But\nthey\u2019re long distance, you know, so it doesn\u2019t make any difference. As a matter of -- th --\nAlicia called me, she said, \u201cI have to take a language, I don\u2019t know what to take, maybe\nGerman.\u201d And I didn\u2019t want to tell her don\u2019t. I did say, \u201cOh, [indecipherable] you don\u2019t\nwant German.\u201d I said, \u201c[indecipherable] to take French,\u201d I said, \u201cbut take Spanish, it\u2019s\nmuch more useful, you know, in the States.\u201d So I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going -- she\u2019s\ngoing to do what she wants to do. She said something about taking Japanese, but she\u2019s\nnot going into something where it would be required, so I don\u2019t know. But I do speak\nFrench. I have very little opportunity to speak Yiddish, and I trip on my words, bring in\nthe English words, because the older generation is dying away, so the young people --\nI\u2019m sure my little sister probably didn\u2019t even speak Yiddish, probably understood it, but\nthe young generations don\u2019t speak Yiddish. We have a lot of Russian emigrants, but the\nRussians are like the Germans, they don\u2019t speak Yiddish. Best of all, they couldn\u2019t. Every\nso often I find them, and I'll say, \u201cDo you speak Yiddish?\u201d So I can communicate with\nthem. And maybe I\u2019Il break down -- I think Workman\u2019s Circle has classes in Yiddish.\nMaybe I should go back to it, maybe it\u2019Il come back. I just remember a couple letters of\nthe alphabet. Don\u2019t know what good it is, but I did read articles that in Israel they\u2019re te --\nteaching Yiddish. In my generation they always said, \u201cA Jew can go anywhere, he\u2019s\nnever lost, as long as he speaks Yiddish.\u201d But it\u2019s not true any more. In my generation,\nwhen I was young, yes. It did come in handy. I went to Israel twice, the first time on my\nown. I was going to take a tour, and some reason or other, I remember my cousin, the one\nwho was in Belgium, as a soldier, I remember his address. They were pioneers on a\nkibbutz. And I wrote to him, and I said, \u201cI want to come to Israel, I want to take a tour,\nbut I\u2019d like to see you again and meet your family.\u201d And he said, \u201cDon\u2019t take a tour,\ncome to the kibbutz.\u201d So I went on my own to the kibbutz, I arrived on a Friday, before\nsundown, and on Saturday, my mother\u2019s side of the family came. My mother had a niece\nin Belgium and she went to Israel. And through the family I got her sister\u2019s address and\nthey all invited me, which I didn\u2019t accept, but they grabbed me off, and I was taken to --\nto visit Israel. I took one tour, that was it. Everybody else took me around, and then I\nwent on the kibbutz and lived on the kibbutz, and got a taste, if you can, on a couple days\nat the kibbutz. Then I went back a number of years later -- oh, that time I traveled by bus\neverywhere. It was marvelous, because you meet more people, you learn more. And I\ntook a bus back from ji -- di -- from Jerusalem to the kibbutz, and they dropped me off\ninto the kibbutz, and my uncle had shown -- my cousin had shown me, \u201cSee Frida, this is\nthe street I live on.\u201d And I said, \u201cSfee, you want me to remember? It\u2019s in Hebrew.\u201d So\nwhen I got off on the kibbutz, there was a man with a bicycle and he was a-a-an older\nman, and I looked at him, and I took a chance, and he was one of the Europeans from that\ngeneration, who had gone to Israel, and I was able to speak with him in Yiddish. So he\ntook me to my cousin\u2019s house. The second time I went, I went as a volunteer for the\narmy. I didn\u2019t like the experience, and the thing that saved me is every weekend we were\noff, so I went to the different -- to the various members of the family. I didn\u2019t tour as --\nthat much, this time.",
        "A: Y-Yeah, uh-huh. They needed volunteers. That started during the -- one of the wars or\nsomething, where all their people were fighting, and they needed people, and things like\nthat. And I ended up working -- I ended up being placed on a ca -- on an army camp that\nwas -- packed medical supplies for the soldiers. My cousin from Belgium, her\ngranddaughter happened to be in the army, right on the next camp, next to it, where the\nsoldiers were. Teela. She was an officer. And she came and she found me, because I had\nwritten to them that I would be there. And we got a ride back to her house and then\ncoming back we took a train and we took a bus. Some experience. So I stayed there for\ntwo weeks. I didn\u2019t extend my trip, but I did go to my cousin\u2019s kibbutz. And I just had --\nsomething came up in Denver, and I was in contact with what I call my sabber cousin,\nwho lived in Denver. And he called me twice. I recognized his voice, they have a definite\nang -- you know, they speak English fluently. And he says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to\nIsrael?\u201d I says, \u201cYou know, maybe you make me feel like going, but I want to see areas\nwhere I\u2019ve never visited before.\u201d So I decided to go to Iceland in September. I don\u2019t\nknow wha -- what I -- I understand is very beautiful terrain. Equador was very\nenlightening. People say Equador? What\u2019s in Equador? Well, it\u2019s different cultures. And\nthat\u2019s what I like to do. And whether I\u2019ll go to eastern Europe, I don\u2019t know. One t -- One\n-- One step at a time. First of all, I have to make sure -- I\u2019m getting older. That\u2019s why I\nwalk, to keep my legs active, and make sure --",
        "A: To a certain extent, to a certain extent.",
        "A: You know, you\u2019re aski -- I would have -- I think maybe my passport shows it. Let\u2019s\nsee, I went to France last year, da --",
        "A: Yeah, okay. Maybe five years ago.",
        "A: Ah, the first time I went. What happened is, I went to Israel the year after I went back\nto Belgium again. When I went Switzerland, and that. And my aunt in Belgium was the\nsame age as Rachelle. My aunt didn\u2019t like Rachelle either. And she gave me Rachelle\u2019s\nname -- she had remarried, and her address. And I wrote to Rachelle, and some reason or\nother -- trying to remember if I didn\u2019t get an answer, somehow or other, I got the answer\nthree months later. I found the letter after I came back. And everywhere I went, I kept\nsaying, there is somebody I want to see, but I can\u2019t read the Hebrew telephone books.\nAnd I ended up at a cousin\u2019s house that I had not met before. They were brothers and\nsisters from the one who lived in Belgium, and I didn\u2019t know they were brothers and\nsisters. And I was at Leelee -- Leelee\u2019s house, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, as a matter of\nfact, and I says, \u201cLeelee,\u201d I says, \u201cI need -- I want to get in touch with Rachelle, but I\ncan\u2019t read the telephone,\u201d and she says, \u201cOkay.\u2019\u2019 Somehow or other, I don\u2019t know if she\ncalled information, she looked in the phone book, I don\u2019t remember. And I say, \u201cI can\u2019t\ncall on my own, because I don\u2019t speak Hebrew, and the Europeans who had gone, did not\nspeak English.\u201d Now they all -- all -- all the Israelis speak English. And she got on the\nphone one evening, and in Hebrew, and she said, \u201cFrida, it\u2019s the right Rachelle.\u201d And I\ngot on the phone, she was crying. And what I did is I took a bus and I stayed with her. I\ndid not sightsee, I did not do anything. And I remember, had a dress with a little breast\npocket, and I was going to a kibbutz on the outskirts of Jerusalem. These close friends\nthat I have, who live on the west side of Cleveland, had two daughters who were in Israel\nfor several months on kibbutz, and I had told, I says, \u201cSally,\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t care what, I\nwant to see Cindy and Sharon.\u201d And one lived in a remote kibbutz that was just being\nestablished. My cousin Sfee borrowed a car and took me there and just visited for a short\ntime. But Sharon was in a kibbutz where I had access with a bus, and Rachelle put me in\na cab, and I remember she gave me money to pay for the cab, and I says, \u201cRachelle,\u201d I\nsays, \u201cI\u2019m not a child any more, I\u2019m an adult. I have money, I can afford.\u201d She insisted.\nAnd she spoke -- I don\u2019t know if she picked up some Arabic, or 1t was in Hebrew, she put\nme in cab to Tel Aviv, because all the buses leave from Tel Aviv. And I got to Tel Aviv,\nit was -- my son had warned me, it was like letting lions out of a cage. Saturday evening,\nthe Sabbath is broken, and all the buses were lined up right behind the other. I mean, the\nstation has been remodeled since, when I went the second time. And I had the name of\nthe kibbutz written down on a piece of paper, until I learned to say kibbutz malach\nhameeshem, but at the time I couldn\u2019t. And I missed the bus. With all those bus, you\nknow, with the cab driver dropped me off, and I guess I missed my bus. And this soldier\napproached me, it was very interesting event. The soldier saw me, you know, with a little\nsuitcase, and he approached me, and I told him where I was going. It happened to be he\nwas in the -- once they serve in -- they have to back in the reserve once a year, until they\nreach a certain age. He was a young Frenchman who as a -- who had survived a war\nyounger than I wa -- he was younger than -- you know, about my age, I think. And he\nwent to Israel after the war, and it s -- turns out that his wife\u2019s name was also Frida, and\nhe stayed with me in Tel Aviv, until I got on the next bus. Told the bus driver where I\nwas going, and what happened, the kibbutz as a business had a -- a motel. Well, the bus\nwent to the motel and they had a cop --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: All right, I went -- I went to the -- to the American wi -- common because I had told\nSharon, I says, \u201cGet me a room at the motel.\u201d She says oh, she went and there was a\nroom available for me. Didn\u2019t have a closet, the shower -- the water was cold. And the\nnext day, I went to take a bus to sightsee Jerusalem, because I only had one day, and I\nmissed the bus to take me into Jerusalem. And there was a man there who was from the\noutskirts of Detroit, and he had lived at the kibbutz for about seven years, and I got\ntalking to him, waiting for the next bus. And he said he took groups of students o0-on -- on\n-- sightseeing and things like that. And he had an appointment, and I met him -- he says,\n\u201cT\u2019I]l meet you at the bus station at 11 o\u2019clock, and he walked me for three solid hours, in\nJerusalem. And the one day I didn\u2019t sightsee was when I spend the day with Rachelle.\nWhen I went back the second time, I wrote to her, never got an answer. I told somebody\nher address, couldn\u2019t find it, and I know the let -- I don\u2019t know what happened to\nRachelle. Have no idea, have no idea what happened to her. It breaks my heart, because\nhe husband had died. Her -- You know, the man she -- she married in Israel. So I don\u2019t\nknow what happened, I tried in the worst way. I don\u2019t know if I could have contacted an\nagency or what. I still -- I still have her address and nodob -- nobody seemed to locate the\nstreet or anything. So I\u2019ve lost contact with her. I still have contact with my aunt in\nBrussels. I send her Jewish New Year\u2019s card. I\u2019m in touch with Frida in Paris. And I do --\nI have contact with my mother\u2019s side of the family, the daughter of the cousin who lived\nin Belgium, I send a New Year\u2019s card. As a matter of fact, my granddaughter Alicia, the\noldest one, went to Israel, and she did spend time -- her name is also Rachelle, my dau --\nmy cousin from Belgium, her daughter, she spent some time with her. My cousin Ahoud,\nand Ruth, my sabber cousin, happened to be in England at the time. I wrote to them, and\nthen I got a letter from England that he was stationed there on his job for a couple of\nyears. And I told her I\u2019ll never forgive her for not going to see my cousin Sfee, because\nhe\u2019s elderly, I\u2019m the only relative he has. But it\u2019s not somebody I cou -- have lot of\ncorrespondence, and I can\u2019t get through to -- now that they have telephones in -- in the\nkibbutz, I did call one time, and for some reason or other, I don\u2019t know what has\nchanged, I can\u2019t get -- I can\u2019t get ahold of them on the telephone. And my sabber cousin,\nAhoud, is the same cousin as I am, and I -- I should ask him for his phone number, I\ndon\u2019t know. I have to call him one of these days and see if he can give me a phone\nnumber.",
        "A: Well, Nishri, N-i-s-h-r-1, and you know, again, we go back ma -- not asking questions\nnow. He is a first cousin to my father. He left at a young age, he married a woman, I think\nshe\u2019s of Polish background. I never asked him about my grandparents. I would assume\nthat his last name, European, was Adler. I mean, he\u2019s on my father\u2019s side of the family,\nbut when I was there, his hearing was going, his eyesight was going. He was still clear\nminded. I haven\u2019t heard anything, his wife was still very active. She was a midwife, and\nhe -- when I went there, he used to go to -- to the fields, and bring food to the people who\nworked t-the fields, a-at the kibbutz, and I went with him. They treated me -- I mean, they\ndidn\u2019t know what to do with me. If I had a -- a -- you know, they have the main meals in -\n- in -- in the common dining room, but Ahoud and Ruth came, and she served some soup,\nand she used to bake. If I as much as picked up the cup to put it to the sink, she would\nslap my hands, she wouldn\u2019t let me do anything. She was so glad that I was in touch -- in\ntouch with them, and that\u2019s the only contact I have. And Miriam I don\u2019t hear from. She\nwas in the States on business, and she was in New York, but she didn\u2019t tell me until the\nlast minute, so I couldn\u2019t go to New York, and I did get a letter from her mother, saying\nshe was due to come to the States, I don\u2019t know if 1t was Chicago or what, and I had told\nher, I says, \u201cMiriam, if you let me know ahead of time, then I\u2019Il come, I\u2019Il stay in a hotel\nand Ill spend time with you.\u201d Well, I don\u2019t know if she didn\u2019t come, she didn\u2019t contact\nme. She did contact me when she was in New York. And I had it to -- a hard ta -- she\nkept changing hotels, so I had a hard time tracking her. My aunt came to the States one\ntime, many years ago, when my son lived in Connecticut, and he and his wife went to\nNew York, they drove and met her, because she went to visit somebody from Belgium,\nand the woman spoke English, and I guess French, and she was a translator. And then she\ncame -- it was interesting, she came a second time, but she didn\u2019t tell me until the last\nminute. She went to Florida, to somebody. And I say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me? I was\ngoing to Florida once a year to visit friends.\u201d But I never saw her. It was too late, and I\nwasn\u2019t going to pay the high fare of the last minute fares to go to -- to -- to flori -- she\nwas in Miami and I was going to Fort Lauderdale. So I have no contact with any of them.\nI had a cousin in Los Angeles, I vi -- my aunt, the one from Denver\u2019s daughter, lived in\nLos Angeles, I spend time with her. I have a cousin too, that I met after the war, who\nlived in eng -- in Cleveland, went to Los Angeles, and I do have contact with one of the\ncousins in Canada. But otherwise -- and one of them here in -- two of them, I -- actually I\nsomehow or other re-made contact with Lana\u2019s daughter, to a certain extent. Louie died\nmany years ago, with a -- of a brain tumor, so -- but from my father\u2019s generation, from --\nyou know, from -- there\u2019s a -- Sfee\u2019s the only one in Israel from that generation, really.\nThere is no one else left, no one else. And on my mother\u2019s side -- on my father\u2019s side,\nthat generation, everyone was gone. On my mother\u2019s side -- oh no, wait a minute, on my\nmother\u2019s side, one uncle had remained, their two girls and my cousin Paul in Cleveland.\nAnd I understand he was one of the oldest survivors of the camp, and he stayed in\nCzechoslovakia, Romania, every time there\u2019s a war, and every time they divide the\ncountry, 1t becomes another country. I was Russian after World War Two, now it\u2019s\nUkraine. And he eventually came to the States, but his mind was not -- he was in his 70\u2019s,\nhe had gone through World War Two, he was in a nursing home.",
        "A: Izaquavic. What was it? Oh, all of a sudden I can\u2019t think of his name, and I met him,\nand he -- the only way he could know who I was 1s by telling him whose daughter I was.\nYou -- Because he remembered my moth -- you know, that\u2019s the way they said, they said,\nso and so\u2019s daughter, so and so\u2019s son. Oh, all of a sudden --",
        "A: My mother\u2019s father.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s -- excuse me, my mother\u2019s brother.",
        "A: Yeah, he was the only sa -- survivor on my mother\u2019s side, from that generation.",
        "A: Of the camps, he --",
        "A: Who knows how many camps he was in, I have no idea. I think he ended up in -- I --\nhe might have been in Auschwitz when he was liberated, I -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t know. You\nknow, these are the things we didn\u2019t ask.",
        "A: You know, this is going back -- oh, I know what his name was. The Jewish name was\nMoishevolv. Now I remember. And I met him, but he could only relate to me of saying I\nwas Hya\u2019s daughter. And he stayed with the su -- with -- with the -- the son, he stayed\nwith the -- with the daughter. I don\u2019t know, he died, I think of a heart attack. He was ina\n-- on a picnic or something like that, so he didn\u2019t live very long after he came to the\nStates. And that\u2019s about it, I mean, nothing else, really.",
        "A: You mean a full life now? Well I -- You know, my -- my -- my children live out of\ntown, and you know I was raised to -- to -- to be a mu -- to be married, to have a -- a-and\nbe a mother and everything, and so I live alone, so I don\u2019t ha -- well, I don\u2019t have the\nmale companionship. I dated. I -- I went out a lot, I -- I had male companionship for -- for\nquite a number of years. You reach my age, and I\u2019m too active for some of them. I\u2019m still\nfairly active. And I\u2019m thankful that I have the friends that I have, that I can keep busy. I\nvolunteered. I just lost my job volunteering, I have to find another one. I did date entry. I\ngo back to the hospital and talk with Dr. Gambetti. I keep active and I keep busy, what\ncan I tell you? And I started taking classes because I want to keep my mind working, and\nI have to find a niche for my volunteer work, because the woman I work for is fantastic. I\nstill have contact with her, and I go there for the holidays. As a matter of fact, she called\nme this morning and I said, \u201cThe museum?\u201d I says, \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI wanted the\nmuseum, there\u2019s an exhibit.\u201d And I say I want to go down to the library, because I was\nnot available the day they had the grand opening for the old library, they remodeled the\noriginal building. So we\u2019re going to the library with her. So I\u2019m thankful for the -- that\nI\u2019m quote, healthy. That I have the friends that I have and I\u2019m not isolated, and if I don\u2019t\nhave to spend 10 years in a nursing home, I\u2019m fi -- I\u2019m fine financially, too, but I\u2019m tha --\ncan\u2019t worry about it. And my son 1s doing well, and the children are growing up, away\nfrom me. That\u2019s the thing, that I missed it. Not now so much, but when they were little, is\nto see them, you know, grow up, but they were here four times a year, and I went there,\nso -- and I went when Alicia had -- the oldest one had her tonsils out. But I missed a lot\nof the little things, you know, affairs in school. Oh, Whitney was acting in some plays,\nand I went because she had a play, but it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s not as often as I would have liked.\nBut all that is gone, so have to take it from here.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, well you\u2019re the one who keeps bringing all these things up. I don\u2019t know\nhow you do it. Aren\u2019t you tired?",
