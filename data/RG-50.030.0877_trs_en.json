        "Q: What about the place you lived, your \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s a question mark in my mind. My mother\u2019s letters had an address that she\nwrote letters to me from. But, in later years, we went to that address in Vienna, and\nit did not seem like the same pla \u2014 I \u2014I did not relate to it in any way.",

And it was an immense parade, and all the Nazi banners were \u2014 and\nbunting, were all over the place. And I remember the sound of the boots of theMay 10\", 2016\nsoldiers, and loud music, and a lot of sieg heils. And I didn\u2019t know anything about\nwhat was going on, and my mother just held \u2014 I remember her squeezing my hand,\nand I said, what is this? And she said, it\u2019s going to be very bad. That is the only\nvivid memory that I have.",

        "A: Yes, yes, but not as much as I would \u2014 I would think. Not as much as I would\nthink I\u2014 I would remember of my mother. She did embroidery, and she worked in\nthe store. And I think I was taken care of by another woman when she went to the\nstore. I don\u2019t remember the store. I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m protecting\nmyself, or \u2014 I have no memories of hugging my mother, kissing my mother. I don\u2019t\nhave those memories.",
        "Q: Or of the reverse, of her kissing you and hugging you?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I\u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t have those memories. I don\u2019t have any memories\nof my schooling, of friends. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s been a blank. That\u2019s bi \u2014 the whole \u2014\nthat \u2014 until I came to the United States, and even for about a week or so, until I\nwent into my first foster home, that has all been a blank.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 10\", 2016",
        "Q: And to this day?",
        "A: And to this day, I don\u2019t have a memory of being in my mother\u2019s arms, and there\nis one memory that I do remember. We were sitting in a chair at the end of Shabbat,\nand waiting for the stars to come out. That is a memory. That\u2019s a \u2014 that \u2014 that is a\ngood memory. And, we were waiting for the stars to come out, and my mother said\nthat there\u2019s a moment just after Shabbat ends, and the stars come out, something\nlike that, she said, you can see God.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And I remember being in a chair with her. That \u2014 that \u2014 that\u2019s about the closest\nmemory that I have. Even leaving, I \u2014 I remember that she told me I was coming to\nthe United States, and that another Jewish mother would take care of me, and \u2014 and\nthat I had to be very healthy. And these \u2014 these are the things that I \u2014 I remember\nbeing in a shul. I think it was a shul, and people were crying, and she made me\nleave. My father was holding a Torah, and I just assume now that that must have\nbeen a Yizkor service, because people were crying, and she wanted me to leave.",
        "Q: For those people, and myself included, who don\u2019t know what a Yizkor service\nis, could you tell us?",
        "A: It\u2019s usually on Yom Kippur, and it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a part of the service that remem \u2014\nwhere you remember your parents, and you say a memorial prayer for \u2014 for thoseMay 10\", 2016\nwho\u2019ve \u2014 you\u2019ve left behind. And in the old days, they didn\u2019t want children around.\nAnd I\u2014I remember my mother telling me to go outside. So I \u2014 I \u2014I think those\nthree \u2014 three things. I don\u2019t remember singing with my father, but I\u2014 I know I did. I\nknow I did, but I don\u2019t remember it. The chair, sitting in the chair, watching the\nstars, the me \u2014 the shul, and the parade. The parade is the most vivid \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 thing that I have.",
        "Q: Do you have any memory of their personalities?",
        "A: No. I have a feeling that my father might have been more outgoing than my\nmother. I think my mother was very quiet. I\u2019m really not sure.",
        "Q: So, I have a few questions that probably, if you know the answers they would\nnot be from memory, but from things you found out. But you can let me know. Do\nyou know what happened to your father, and to the grocery store, once there was an\nanschluss of aus \u2014 of Austria to Germany, and the Nazis took control? How your\nfamily was affected.",

        "A: At home, yes. He was not well to begin with, and \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about that?",
        "A: We had a\u2014I guess we had a funeral, we have \u2014 I remember being in the\ncemetery, and I know my father had a grave. It was bigger than I was, and it was \u2014 I\nremember it being green, and I remember my mother putting my \u2014 a hat \u2014 hat on\nme, and she always tried to hide my \u2014 my braids. And I remember that I felt like a\nboy when she did that. Also during the parade, she put a hat on me and stuck my\nbraids \u2014 I don\u2019t know why, but I \u2014 I do remember that we \u2014 that she seemed to be\nprotected of \u2014 protective of my long braids that I had.

        "A: No. No.",
        "Q: Okay. So even when the store was lost, you don\u2019t remember hunger, as a result\nof that?",
        "A: I think \u2014 I think \u2014 I think my mother came home with some sort of a pot. And\nnow that I\u2019m older, I would assume that it was \u2014 could it have been through \u2014 from\na \u2014 some sort of a soup kitchen? I remember her coming home with a \u2014 a pot.",

And having\nemigrated to the United States, they spent many years interviewing survivors from\nVienna who were in the United States. And those survivors, and these interviews\nwere done in the 1970s, so the survivors whom they interviewed were often\nindividuals who had a role within the administration of the Jewish community\nVienna. The research collection includes dozens of these audio cassette tapes,May 10\", 2016\nwhich the museum only recently digitized, and we still have not gone through all of\nthe cassette tapes, but we started to do so just only recently, and we came across one\ninterview that was conducted in December 27\", 1974, in New York, in the office of\nthe American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and it is an interview with\nMargaret Feiler, the name who \u2014 who you will recognize. She is the only adult\nchaperone who was on your transport. And the interview is, all in all, it\u2019s about\nthree hours long, and \u2014 and she recounts everything that she did for the Jewish\ncommunity. And at one point in the interview, she starts to mention an American\ncommittee for children, which arranged for originally 30 children to be brought to\nthe United States, and then in the end, eight or nine children ended up being on the\ntransport.",

The\ncommunity intended to send, I think it was two social workers, who also wanted to\nemigrate, who had the affidavits, sent them with the children to the United States.\nThey all required for visa around August \u2014 September. And of the children, only\nnine got visas, for reasons which we never knew. And none of the two social\nworkers got visa. And nobody else got visa, not in September. Not in August, not in\nSeptember, I don\u2019t know how far back, but not in August, not in September, and not\nbefore I got my visa. Now, I started talking to anybo \u2014 I [indecipherable] when I got\nthe visa, they asked me whether I would take those nine children, and that\u2019s what I\ndid. And that\u2019s how JDC even paid for my fare, because I was the escort. They paid\nfor those nine children\u2019s fare, and my own, and we came here. I went via Berlin,\nwhere I picked up the 10\" child, that also wasn\u2019t [indecipherable] and I brought\nthem to the United States, via Lisbon. It was the first transport via Lisbon, through\noccupied France [indecipherable]. Now, to come back to the visa, I asked the\npeople who had gone to the consulate, two social workers, and everybody else to\nwhom I could talk, because most of them came to the community in order toMay 10\", 2016\ncommunicate to their relatives here that they couldn\u2019t come because they didn\u2019t get\nthe vi \u2014 the visa. I asked them, what were you asked, because they were asked\nquestions. And there was one thing that they all had in common, all of them. There\nmust have been 20 people. They had been asked how they had voted in the last\nelection, in the last free election that Austria had, which was some time in spring \u2014\nI don\u2019t know when it was. The last thing \u2014 I asked that question, how \u2014\nI: Is that before or \u2014 before \u2014\nM: Before Hitler.\nI: 1934?\nM: Right.\nI; There was not election \u2014\nM: No, no, no, no, no, we had elections to \u2014\nI: Was there election between \u201934 and \u201938?\nM: Oh yes, yes, there was. Was [indecipherable] But they have asked them \u2014 I can\u2019t\nre \u2014I can't really tell you what year it was, because I know only the question. But\nthey asked, how did you vote during the last three elections? And all of them, every\none of them had said, either a social democrat or a Christian socialist. Well, there\nwas no other party. Very few said Christian socialist, but I know that the very few\nwho had said that, and one had said social democrat. None of them had gotten aMay 10\", 2016\nvisa. And the other questions, I didn\u2019t find any other question that could be\n[indecipherable]. So I started thinking. And I was asked the same question. Well, I\ndidn\u2019t know what [indecipherable], but there was a so-called democratic\n[indecipherable] which I think [indecipherable] in all of \u2014 of Vienna. Well, it was a\nhopeless affair. It was somebody who really \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t think why anybody\nwould spend money on something like that, but it was idealism. Now don\u2019t ask me\nwhether I quor \u2014 voted for that, because I won\u2019t admit anything. But when I was\nasked, that\u2019s what I said. And all I can tell you is that I got the visa.\nI: [inaudible]\nM: That\u2019s \u2014 that was my [indecipherable]. So anyway, I got the visa, and when I\ncame for the examination, you know, you had a medical examination, this is the\nsecond point for the American consulate [indecipherable] whatever you want to\nsay, they asked me two questions. One said \u2014 one question was, what is your true\nhair color \u2014 implying that it was dyed, which it never was, and the second was, in\nwhat month are you [indecipherable]\nI; It was what?\nM: In what month are you [indecipherable]. These were the two questions. So \u2014I\nmean, you can imagine the atmosphere, this was the atmosphere. So anyway, I got\nthe visa in October, I got the \u2014 I left on November 30\", I brought the children out.May 10\", 2016\nThere are some \u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s here on file, and I don\u2019t think I have it. I had\nwritten a column for that newspaper that the community [indecipherable] was\ncalled in those days, and I wrote about how I brought back the children, and it was\nvery interesting for the people [inaudible]. So that was the story of, in those days, of\nthe immigration. Now, of course, this is what I know myself. Now one other thing.\nMurmelstein had over [indecipherable] was very anxious [indecipherable] but he\nalso [indecipherable]. And so the only hope was that a job offer would come from\nthe United States. And he was afraid \u2014 first of all, he didn\u2019t want to stay.\n[indecipherable] to stay, but I was so optimistic, he didn\u2019t want to stay. Number\ntwo, he was afraid that the more he knew, and the more he was involved with the\nGestapo, they may, in the end, not let him go, not let him even survive. He was\nalways afraid for his life. He said he\u2019s getting deeper and deeper into this, and he is\nnot going to survive. So when I went to the United States, I promised\n[indecipherable] when I come here, that I would see Rabbi Young, and that I would\ntalk to Rabbi Young, and ask him to get him a job offer as a rabbi.\nI: Who is Rabbi Young?\nM: Rabbi Young is \u2014 has a\u2014 a community, a \u2014 a \u2014 a synagogue on the west side. I\ncan get you details from [indecipherable]. He is of German extraction. He\u2019s not a\nrefugee, but he is \u2014 when you talk to him, you can hear he is German. That the firstMay 10\", 2016\nthing I did \u2014 I \u2014I don\u2019t know whether it was the first week or the second week. But\nyou see, as [indecipherable] in New Rochelle in jan \u2014 the end of January. So it\nmust \u2014 all this was the end \u2014 the last few days in December, the first two days in\nJanuary. Before I did anything, I went to Rabbi Young. I was admitted to his study,\nand I started to talk, and he cut me short and he said, not a word about\nMurmelstein. Don\u2019t mention the name to me. I know all about him. I said, now,\nwait a minute. I\u2019ve been working with him. Don\u2019t tell me, I know all about it. There\nis not a thing I\u2019m going to do, he should be happy his name isn\u2019t mentioned in the\nUnited States. And he practically threw me out, I mean it\u2019s \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he was polite\nenough to say goodbye, but you know [indecipherable]. So I wrote it. I wrote to\nMurmelstein about it, and this what I want to tell you, because you see, I don\u2019t\nknow how Murmelstein behaved in Theresienstadt. I can imagine that all sorts of\nthings happened. It could be, because the atmosphere in Theresienstadt was quite\ndifferent from the atmosphere in Vienna, and I don\u2019t know what people do to\nsurvive [indecipherable]. All sorts of things can have happened. But I do know what\nhappened when I was still in Vienna, and I know that there was nothing that he did\n[indecipherable] because I was [indecipherable] all night. I went home to have a\nshower, you know, that was it. And nevertheless, that rumor had reached already\nthe United States, at that time. People there are convinced already ...\u201dMay 10\", 2016",

I wo \u2014 when I walked into the house \u2014 we walked up the steps of this row\nMay 10\", 2016\nhouse, they were just lighting Hanukkah candles, and they asked me if I would like\nto light them too.

I remember\nbeing very lonely at camp, and I missed the family. I missed the family very, very\nmuch, and I really didn\u2019t have a good time.

        "Q: This suitcase that we have here.",
        "A: This suitcase was all packed up. And he told me that I was going to another\nfoster home. What happened was that Mrs. Baer(ph), unbeknownst to anybody, had\nanother baby.

        "Q: It was quite a loss for you, though.",
        "A: It was very sudden, very sudden. And \u2014 and I \u2014 thank you \u2014 I went to a\u2014 my\nsecond foster home. I think that day, I\u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 another Beverly \u2014 came out, and I really felt like, for the first time, I looked\nlike a refugee. I still had my high top shoes, and the clothes m-my mother sent with\nme. None of that had been replaced, and I had my braids. And they really looked at\nme as if I was from outer space. She didn\u2019t know what to make of me.

        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: So, I guess the \u2014 the organization knew about her, and I guess that they thought\nthat it would be a good thing for Beverly to have a sister. I \u2014 I\u2014 I don\u2019t know, and I\nnever found out what motivated them to step forth. So, the next door neighbor came\ndown, Mrs. Fine(ph), my \u2014 and \u2014 and her daughter Phyllis. And they thought I was\nadorable. But I didn\u2019t get that impression from Beverly. And for the first time, I felt\nlike a stranger. It was a bad time for me, very bad time. Everybody seemed to think\nI was so cute, but I didn\u2019t feel that way at home.",

He was very soft spoken. He\nwould come home and \u2014 and have dinner, and go be-behind his newspaper. And\nBeverly and I \u2014 she had to make room for me in her drawers. We ha \u2014 slept in a\nsingle bed, because the bed hadn\u2019t been delivered yet \u2014 a second bed hadn\u2019t\ndelivered yet. So I really, really stepped on her.

        "A: It was very strange, it was \u2014 it was \u2014 seemed like it was so sudden. And there\nwasn\u2019t even a place for me to sleep, we slept together. We slept together in a single\nbed, and shared a room.",

        "A: Sure it changed. I don\u2019t think that \u2014 we were so different. We were so different.\nYeah, well, so-somehow we had to make peace with each other, cause we shared a\nroom all those years. I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2014 looking back I can\u2019t even envision how \u2014 how we\nmanaged, but we did. M \u2014 Aunt Mary, that I call \u2014 I called them Aunt Mary and\nUncle Harry, she took me to get my braids cut, because she couldn\u2019t handle my \u2014\nmy long hair. And I mean, I looked, after a while, with new shoes and new clothes,\nI looked like anybody, and I did not have an accent, and I spoke perfect English,\nbetter than I do now. And so Beverly and I sort of made a \u2014 a peace. We were never\nlike \u2014 we were never close, but we had \u2014 you know, we \u2014 there were lots of times\nwhere Mary was very ill and she was hospitalized, that we had to take care of the\nhouse, and we did.",

        "Q: Mm-hm. You wouldn\u2019t say sisters.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think we really approached that subject. I don\u2019t think we talked about the\nold days, and how we felt about each other. We never did that. We talked about\nwhere we were at at that time. And of course, Mary was very, very sick by then.\nAnd Beverly was diagnosed with lupus. And well, the lupus came a few years after\nthat. When we came back to Baltimore, she wu \u2014 developed luka \u2014 lupus. And we\nwere fren \u2014 we were \u2014 we were tight. We were \u2014 we were girlfriends. It was not like\nit was before.",

And we went to the store, to the grocery\nstore one \u2014 on Saturdays together, in the morning. And I always wanted him to talk\nto me, to tell me something about himself, or to share something. But he was very\nto himself. I really think he was fond of me, he just couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t share, he\ncouldn\u2019t share. I always wanted him \u2014 I needed a conversation with him, and I \u2014 I\nnever got that out of him, even \u2014 even in later years, before he died, I never got that\nout of him.",

        "A: Yes.",

        "Q: Well, what did \u2014 what would you have really wanted her to know\u2019?",
        "A: Maybe it\u2019s something that she knew from the other children that she took care\nof, that I was \u2014 I felt very much alone.

She must have had a \u2014 a learning difficulty of some sort. And my\nreport cards were so much better than hers, it was almost embarrassing to me. When\nshe was 16, she quit school, and ac-actually, when she quit school, she went to work\nin a record store. And that\u2019s when it cha \u2014 things changed between her and me.

        "Q: What about the place you lived, your \u2014",
        "Q: It might have been that she had to move.",
        "Q: Yeah. So \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So again, in your mind\u2019s eye, you \u2014 do you have any image of a particular room\nfrom your childhood, a bedroom, a living room, a kitchen?",
        "Q: Okay. Do \u2014",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "Q: What can you tell me about your mother? Is she someone who is more 1n your\nmemory than your father?",
        "Q: Or of the reverse, of her kissing you and hugging you?",
        "Q: And to this day?",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: For those people, and myself included, who don\u2019t know what a Yizkor service\nis, could you tell us?",
        "Q: Vivid.",
        "Q: Do you have any memory of their personalities?",
        "Q: So, I have a few questions that probably, if you know the answers they would\nnot be from memory, but from things you found out. But you can let me know. Do\nyou know what happened to your father, and to the grocery store, once there was an\nanschluss of aus \u2014 of Austria to Germany, and the Nazis took control? How your\nfamily was affected.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Do you remember seeing a truck\u2019?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: At home?",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about that?",
        "Q: Okay. Any \u2014 are there any feelings that you associate, any emotions? I mean,\nthere are the ones that we would normally think when a child loses a parent.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.",
        "Q: Do you remember ever feeling hungry?",
        "Q: Okay. So even when the store was lost, you don\u2019t remember hunger, as a result\nof that?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Well \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. We often find, you know, when we start an interview, and we start a\nprocess that \u2014 one thought comes up, and it triggers another thought, and it triggers\na third thought \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and so on. And so \u2014",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s not surprising.",
        "Q: So this is very interesting, you just anticipated the next question I was going to\nask. Because it sounds \u2014 the picture I\u2019m getting, first of all, is, from what you tell\nme, is vague. You know, it\u2019s sort of like through a mist.",
        "Q: And there are episodes. One here, one here. But they\u2019re also episodes that\nfeature your mother and your father and yourself, and nobody else by name.",
        "Q: Not even the lady who takes care of you.",
        "Q: And so then I wanted to ask about, how do you know Tante Lotte(ph)? How \u2014\nhow does she figure in the story?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Were \u2014 were there me \u2014 were these men?",
        "Q: Like in a cloth, or something?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Relieved.",
        "Q: Relieved, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of Tante Lotte(ph), what she looked like?",
        "Q: Was she much older than your mother?",
        "Q: And your own parents \u2014 I mean, I know that you have some photographs of\nthem.",
        "Q: But is your knowledge of how they looked, from the photographs, or from\nsomething else in your mind\u2019s eye? Or is it even possible to tell?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. So it\u2019s not like you look at the \u2014 the photographs, and you say, I guess\nthese must have been my parents. You recognize them.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Is there anything that you remember your father ever saying, that was like a\u2014a\nspecial saying he had, like you said your mother did, when you know, you find the\nstars come out, and if you look very carefully, there you might see God. Did you\never remember your father saying something?",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Oh, to China, okay.",
        "Q: Okay. So there was talk of him \u2014 of leaving.",
        "Q: There was talk between your parents of leaving?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and you \u2014 did you attend school?",
        "Q: And it had \u2014 it was different from what you had learned, so obviously you must\nhave been at school to be \u2014 to learn.",
        "Q: So when you\u2019re talking about passport, do you really mean report card?",
        "Q: No, no, there was a passport. And you wrote inside the passport?",
        "Q: Ah, you signed your name.",
        "Q: I see. I see.",
        "Q: And what kind of passport was it? Did you have citizenship of any kind?",
        "Q: Staatlos(ph), mm-hm. So, stateless.",
        "Q: An L.D. card or something?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay. That\u2019s okay. Those are things that we can find out about by looking\nat the document. What is \u2014 what \u2014 what we\u2019re doing now is \u2014 is seeing what \u2014 what\nwas taken from you, basically, and how much of this world that you were born into,\nyou still were able to retain, and how much was lost. And so, that\u2019s part of the story.",
        "Q: Well, the interesting thing is also, when we started talking, you said that the very\nfirst memory is an overall one of fear, of shushing, of you know, some secrets of\nsome kind.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Soon after those, you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 the place where you were living\nwith your Aunt Lotte(ph) and your mother was kind of violated by \u2014 violated by\nthese well-dressed \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. Nazis, I guess. And your mother says okay, now she\u2019s going to look for a\nway for you to get out. What is the next thing that you remember\u2019?",
        "Q: And do you have any feeling from that?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah. You spoke with her in German, or in Yiddish?",
        "Q: Okay, okay. Do you still speak ger \u2014 can you still understand it?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah. And \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s hard to imagine what must have been going through her\nmind.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, what\u2019s the next memory?",
        "Q: Do you remember leaving Vienna? Do you remember leaving Vienna?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: During the examination?",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about that trip to the train station from where you\nlived?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Do you remember how your mother \u2014 what kind of \u2014 was your mother crying,\nwas she \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you \u2014",
        "Q: Had died.",
        "Q: Okay. Right now we\u2019ve been, you know, talking along one line, which is, what\ndo you remember. Let\u2019s stop and pause and fill in the gaps of what was actually\ntaking place, that you found out later. So, do you know the name of the organization\nthat helped you get the paperwork done and what country, you know, gave the visa,\nand where you were going. Things like that. Can you tell me \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 what is behind al \u2014 all this?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So you were one of nine children?",
        "Q: And you don\u2019t remember those children?",
        "Q: Okay, so you \u2014 your mother was not on the train, but you were.",
        "Q: So thi \u2014 this agency, was it based in the United States, or was it based in\nGermany\u201d",
        "Q: Okay, but it was called the German Jewish \u2014",
        "Q: Children\u2019s Aid Society, okay. And why wasn\u2019t your mother able to accompany\nyou?",
        "Q: This is quite late, the war has started.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of a militarized Vienna, aside from the parade that\nyou already told me about, but you know, tanks and soldiers and things like that?",
        "Q: Okay. But nu \u2014 I\u2019m just surprised, because 1940, and November 1940 \u2014",

        "Q: We\u2019ll talk about that \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 a little bit later.",
        "Q: But, for right now, when you \u2014 I take it you never saw your mother again.",
        "Q: Did you know at that time, that you may not see her again?May 10\", 2016",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that she was saying, I may not see you again?",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Now you\u2019re down to three.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "Q: Can we cut for a second? [break] So before lunch, we were talking \u2014 before\nlunch we were talking about many different things, and it \u2014 but we \u2014 I think we\nbrought your story up until the point where you got to Baltimore.",
        "Q: And because we have \u2014 we have, as a museum, many different collections, and\nsometimes we\u2019re able to find pieces of a person\u2019s story through some of the other",
        "Q: And now I want to turn, briefly, this part of our interview over to my colleague\nAnatol Steck, because he has something else that he\u2019d like to share with you, that\nwe think is relevant to your story, that he found just a little while ago.\nQ2: The museum recently acquired the research collection of Leonard and Edith\nEhrlich, two survivors from Vienna, who spend a good 40 years researching the\nhistory of the Jewish community Vienna during the Holocaust. And having\nemigrated to the United States, they spent many years interviewing survivors from\nVienna who were in the United States. And those survivors, and these interviews\nwere done in the 1970s, so the survivors whom they interviewed were often\nindividuals who had a role within the administration of the Jewish community\nVienna. The research collection includes dozens of these audio cassette tapes,May 10\", 2016\nwhich the museum only recently digitized, and we still have not gone through all of\nthe cassette tapes, but we started to do so just only recently, and we came across one\ninterview that was conducted in December 27\", 1974, in New York, in the office of\nthe American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and it is an interview with\nMargaret Feiler, the name who \u2014 who you will recognize. She is the only adult\nchaperone who was on your transport. And the interview is, all in all, it\u2019s about\nthree hours long, and \u2014 and she recounts everything that she did for the Jewish\ncommunity. And at one point in the interview, she starts to mention an American\ncommittee for children, which arranged for originally 30 children to be brought to\nthe United States, and then in the end, eight or nine children ended up being on the\ntransport.",
        "Q: Is this the end? Okay. So this is the end of the clip that we wanted to share with\nyou about Margarita Feiler, who was your adult lady who accompanied you. And\nI am assuming this is the first time you hear her voice in decades.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: On the ship?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Another lady then.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: To another lady.",
        "Q: Do you have any remembrance of how long you were in this temporary home?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And is there something that you learned from this tape, this interview, thinking\nthat again, this took place over 40 years ago, this interview, in 1974. Is there\nsomething that you hear that it\u2019s new, that is, something you weren\u2019t aware of?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: And was Rabbi Murmelstein the head of the Viennese Jewish community? Was",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So he was involved in \u2014 in liberation.",
        "Q: I see. I see. How did it \u2014 when you first heard that we had her voice on tape \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm. It\u2019s interesting that \u2014 first of all, it\u2019s interesting, and it\u2019s not surprising\nthat people have different memories of a same event. Or, as in you have said overMay 10\", 2016\nand over again in your case, you don\u2019t have a memory of it. And that \u2014 that how\nMargaret Feiler, 35 years after she brings these children over, is remembering in\nher own mind what are the things that were salient for her, as she\u2019s telling the\nEhrlichs about how she leaves Vienna, how she answers a question that has\nnothing to do with anything, you know, that is \u2014 deals with who did you vote for in\nthe last free elections, you know. And why that would be significant.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what she is saying, that the social workers \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. I\u2014 I don\u2019t know, but it could be that she was referring to the people who\nwere supposed to accompany the children.",
        "Q: It made \u2014 it sounded like that, that others were supposed to come with more\nchildren, but that they answered in the wrong way, and didn\u2019t get a visa. She is\nleaving it \u2014 this is her supposition.",
        "Q: And she is leaving it up to the Ehrlichs to make of it what they will. The people\nthat she\u2019s talking to.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Stella, okay. Can we cut for a second? [break] So, as my colleague Anatol\nmentioned, we have \u2014 this interview with Margaret Feiler, done in 1974, is\nactually several hours long. And we will make a CD copy of it for you to be able to\nlisten to in quiet, in peace, you know, at your leisure. And there may be more\ninformation on there that you will find of interest and relevance.",
        "Q: This is only a nine minute clip. But was also thought, you know, we get\ninformation from so many sources, and it\u2019s not often that it \u2014 but it\u2019s not rare either,\nwhere they dovetail. And sometimes we\u2019ll find something from one person \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 that is very relevant to another person\u2019s story. And when \u2014 when we\ndiscovered this, we wanted to share it with you.",
        "Q: But her name was familiar to you.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. Well now we\u2019re going to go forward. And what I'd like to do 1s talk a\nlittle bit about your first years here in the United States. The times when you do \u2014\nfrom \u2014 from the times where you do have some memories, and what your\nexperiences were. So the last we really left your story was when you are with your\nsocial worker, Mrs. Beazer(ph), you said?",
        "Q: In New York. And she brings you to Baltimore.",
        "Q: And do you have a first impression of what Baltimore looked like to you? Was\nit very strange, was it very different?",

[technical problem]\n[The following is from the 1974 interview with Margaret Feiler. For the full audio\nrecording, see Oral history interview with Margaret Feiler, RG-50.862.0001, United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum collection]\n\u201cM.: ...for a group of children, I think it was 30-odd children. There must be\nsomething on file on this. Probably not on this file, but she has the file. ChildrenMay 10\", 2016\nwhose fathers had died in some concentration camp, either Buchenwald or\nDachau, and whose mother had a quota which didn\u2019t come up; Hungarian or\nRomanian or Polish. Such children \u2014 they made a group of such children, of 30-odd\nchildren, and they arranged for foster parents, here in the United States. The\ncommunity intended to send, I think it was two social workers, who also wanted to\nemigrate, who had the affidavits, sent them with the children to the United States.\nThey all required for visa around August \u2014 September. And of the children, only\nnine got visas, for reasons which we never knew. And none of the two social\nworkers got visa. And nobody else got visa, not in September. Not in August, not in\nSeptember, I don\u2019t know how far back, but not in August, not in September, and not\nbefore I got my visa. Now, I started talking to anybo \u2014 I [indecipherable] when I got\nthe visa, they asked me whether I would take those nine children, and that\u2019s what I\ndid. And that\u2019s how JDC even paid for my fare, because I was the escort. They paid\nfor those nine children\u2019s fare, and my own, and we came here. I went via Berlin,\nwhere I picked up the 10\" child, that also wasn\u2019t [indecipherable] and I brought\nthem to the United States, via Lisbon. It was the first transport via Lisbon, through\noccupied France [indecipherable]. Now, to come back to the visa, I asked the\npeople who had gone to the consulate, two social workers, and everybody else to\nwhom I could talk, because most of them came to the community in order toMay 10\", 2016\ncommunicate to their relatives here that they couldn\u2019t come because they didn\u2019t get\nthe vi \u2014 the visa. I asked them, what were you asked, because they were asked\nquestions. And there was one thing that they all had in common, all of them. There\nmust have been 20 people. They had been asked how they had voted in the last\nelection, in the last free election that Austria had, which was some time in spring \u2014\nI don\u2019t know when it was. The last thing \u2014 I asked that question, how \u2014\nI: Is that before or \u2014 before \u2014\nM: Before Hitler.\nI: 1934?\nM: Right.\nI; There was not election \u2014\nM: No, no, no, no, no, we had elections to \u2014\nI: Was there election between \u201934 and \u201938?\nM: Oh yes, yes, there was. Was [indecipherable] But they have asked them \u2014 I can\u2019t\nre \u2014I can't really tell you what year it was, because I know only the question. But\nthey asked, how did you vote during the last three elections? And all of them, every\none of them had said, either a social democrat or a Christian socialist. Well, there\nwas no other party. Very few said Christian socialist, but I know that the very few\nwho had said that, and one had said social democrat. None of them had gotten aMay 10\", 2016\nvisa. And the other questions, I didn\u2019t find any other question that could be\n[indecipherable]. So I started thinking. And I was asked the same question. Well, I\ndidn\u2019t know what [indecipherable], but there was a so-called democratic\n[indecipherable] which I think [indecipherable] in all of \u2014 of Vienna. Well, it was a\nhopeless affair. It was somebody who really \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t think why anybody\nwould spend money on something like that, but it was idealism. Now don\u2019t ask me\nwhether I quor \u2014 voted for that, because I won\u2019t admit anything. But when I was\nasked, that\u2019s what I said. And all I can tell you is that I got the visa.\nI: [inaudible]\nM: That\u2019s \u2014 that was my [indecipherable]. So anyway, I got the visa, and when I\ncame for the examination, you know, you had a medical examination, this is the\nsecond point for the American consulate [indecipherable] whatever you want to\nsay, they asked me two questions. One said \u2014 one question was, what is your true\nhair color \u2014 implying that it was dyed, which it never was, and the second was, in\nwhat month are you [indecipherable]\nI; It was what?\nM: In what month are you [indecipherable]. These were the two questions. So \u2014I\nmean, you can imagine the atmosphere, this was the atmosphere. So anyway, I got\nthe visa in October, I got the \u2014 I left on November 30\", I brought the children out.May 10\", 2016\nThere are some \u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s here on file, and I don\u2019t think I have it. I had\nwritten a column for that newspaper that the community [indecipherable] was\ncalled in those days, and I wrote about how I brought back the children, and it was\nvery interesting for the people [inaudible]. So that was the story of, in those days, of\nthe immigration. Now, of course, this is what I know myself. Now one other thing.\nMurmelstein had over [indecipherable] was very anxious [indecipherable] but he\nalso [indecipherable]. And so the only hope was that a job offer would come from\nthe United States. And he was afraid \u2014 first of all, he didn\u2019t want to stay.\n[indecipherable] to stay, but I was so optimistic, he didn\u2019t want to stay. Number\ntwo, he was afraid that the more he knew, and the more he was involved with the\nGestapo, they may, in the end, not let him go, not let him even survive. He was\nalways afraid for his life. He said he\u2019s getting deeper and deeper into this, and he is\nnot going to survive. So when I went to the United States, I promised\n[indecipherable] when I come here, that I would see Rabbi Young, and that I would\ntalk to Rabbi Young, and ask him to get him a job offer as a rabbi.\nI: Who is Rabbi Young?\nM: Rabbi Young is \u2014 has a\u2014 a community, a \u2014 a \u2014 a synagogue on the west side. I\ncan get you details from [indecipherable]. He is of German extraction. He\u2019s not a\nrefugee, but he is \u2014 when you talk to him, you can hear he is German. That the firstMay 10\", 2016\nthing I did \u2014 I \u2014I don\u2019t know whether it was the first week or the second week. But\nyou see, as [indecipherable] in New Rochelle in jan \u2014 the end of January. So it\nmust \u2014 all this was the end \u2014 the last few days in December, the first two days in\nJanuary. Before I did anything, I went to Rabbi Young. I was admitted to his study,\nand I started to talk, and he cut me short and he said, not a word about\nMurmelstein. Don\u2019t mention the name to me. I know all about him. I said, now,\nwait a minute. I\u2019ve been working with him. Don\u2019t tell me, I know all about it. There\nis not a thing I\u2019m going to do, he should be happy his name isn\u2019t mentioned in the\nUnited States. And he practically threw me out, I mean it\u2019s \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he was polite\nenough to say goodbye, but you know [indecipherable]. So I wrote it. I wrote to\nMurmelstein about it, and this what I want to tell you, because you see, I don\u2019t\nknow how Murmelstein behaved in Theresienstadt. I can imagine that all sorts of\nthings happened. It could be, because the atmosphere in Theresienstadt was quite\ndifferent from the atmosphere in Vienna, and I don\u2019t know what people do to\nsurvive [indecipherable]. All sorts of things can have happened. But I do know what\nhappened when I was still in Vienna, and I know that there was nothing that he did\n[indecipherable] because I was [indecipherable] all night. I went home to have a\nshower, you know, that was it. And nevertheless, that rumor had reached already\nthe United States, at that time. People there are convinced already ...\u201dMay 10\", 2016",

And so she decided to put me at the blackboard, and I\ncopied these big let \u2014 these large letters, that she \u2014 she saw my handwriting, and she\nwanted me to change the H and the G, so I practiced the H and the G on the\nblackboard. And there were one or two other children in the class that spoke\nYiddish, and they helped me to understand what to do, and what the different bells\nmeant, and when it was recess, and when it was \u2014",
        "A: Yes, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t really \u2014 it was as if I\u2019d never been in school before, in a\nschool situation before. And I stayed in that school as long as I was with the\nBaer(ph) family.",

        "A: This suitcase was all packed up. And he told me that I was going to another\nfoster home. What happened was that Mrs. Baer(ph), unbeknownst to anybody, had\nanother baby. She was pregnant, and she was rotund, and nobody knew that she was\npregnant, not even her husband or her family. I think she left a note in a milk bottle,\nor something like that. But she went to Sinai Hospital, to have a baby.",
        "A: So that was her fourth child. And the \u2014 Mrs. Beazer(ph) and the agency did not\nthink it was appropriate for me to stay in this home with the new baby, and that it\nwas too much for Mrs. Baer(ph).",

        "A: Not then.",
        "A: Mm-hm. There\u2019s one time that I remember, I \u2014 I \u2014 I was waiting for Mrs.\nBaer(ph) outside the school, and somebody said, who are you waiting for? And I\nsaid my mother. And then Mrs. Baer(ph) came up, and she said, you\u2019re the mother?\nAnd I realized that I had sort of told a \u2014 a fib, I didn\u2019t want to go into the whole\nStory.",

        "A: The next family lived in a more affluent part of the city, and there were lawns\nand gardens and single houses. And Mrs. Baer(ph) took me over there, and I met\nmy foster mother, she was in the garden, pulling weeds or something. And, you\nknow, I met her, and then my new foster sister, Beverly \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 another Beverly \u2014 came out, and I really felt like, for the first time, I looked\nlike a refugee. I still had my high top shoes, and the clothes m-my mother sent with\nme. None of that had been replaced, and I had my braids. And they really looked at\nme as if I was from outer space. She didn\u2019t know what to make of me. First of all,\nshe was not very prepared for \u2014 for me.",
        "A: She was not prepared. It must have been a very fast \u2014 I got the impression that it\nwas a very fast exchange. And Beverly was two and a half years older than me. But\nshe didn\u2019t look like a 11 or 12 year old. She \u2014 I was, by that time, eight and a half.\nShe must have been about 11 and a half. She looked like a woman. She was\ncompletely developed, and she looked much older than her years. And she was not\npleased. She was not pleased that somebody was coming into the house, and\ncertainly not me.",
        "A: She was an only child, but she had been adopted by the Freilanders(ph) from\nthe associated Jewish charities when she was six months old.",
        "A: So, I guess the \u2014 the organization knew about her, and I guess that they thought\nthat it would be a good thing for Beverly to have a sister. I \u2014 I\u2014 I don\u2019t know, and I\nnever found out what motivated them to step forth. So, the next door neighbor came\ndown, Mrs. Fine(ph), my \u2014 and \u2014 and her daughter Phyllis. And they thought I was\nadorable. But I didn\u2019t get that impression from Beverly. And for the first time, I felt\nlike a stranger. It was a bad time for me, very bad time. Everybody seemed to think\nI was so cute, but I didn\u2019t feel that way at home.",

We ha \u2014 slept in a\nsingle bed, because the bed hadn\u2019t been delivered yet \u2014 a second bed hadn\u2019t\ndelivered yet. So I really, really stepped on her.

        "A: Sure it changed. I don\u2019t think that \u2014 we were so different. We were so different.\nYeah, well, so-somehow we had to make peace with each other, cause we shared a\nroom all those years. I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2014 looking back I can\u2019t even envision how \u2014 how we\nmanaged, but we did.

For the first time we had\nmarriage in common. It was different, it was not like being \u2014",

We talked about\nwhere we were at at that time. And of course, Mary was very, very sick by then.\nAnd Beverly was diagnosed with lupus. And well, the lupus came a few years after\nthat.
