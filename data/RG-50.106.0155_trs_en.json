And we all got together and then\ncelebrated the holiday, exchanged gifts like an-anybody else. And I was -- to me it\nwas just normal.

I never joined any -- any group, any special group. I stayed away from\nit. | do remember one time I was in high school and somebody made a statement\nwhich I did not care and we got into a fight right in the classroom, the benches\nwere flying and everything else. But that was the only time, and I -- I knew if\nanybody made any comments about Jews or religion or anything of that sort, I\nfought back, because I was proud to be a Jew and -- and I didn\u2019t hide it either.",

        "Q: Both, and I was also thinking in terms of dating an-and -- just the kinds of\nthings that young adults do.",
        "A: All right. We had always a lot of fun together as students, and we went out\nmostly to the opera and the different theaters. And we also had parties at home,\nmostly at home. We never went out to -- to bars or any of that sort. And it was a\ndifferent life then than it\u2019s today, that -- that I know. We le -- we -- we lived a -- a\nclean and healthier life. We also took a lot of trips, hiking trips and mountain\nclimbing in those -- in my day -- young days. Went skiing away for a few days or a\ncouple of weeks during the wintertime. Yeah, I -- we played all kinds of sports. I\nwas a member of one of the sports clubs, the Vienna football club. And I was very\nactive in tracks -- in -- in track and -- and in soccer, and was active in the junior\nAugust 12, 2002\nleague and even won couple first prizes in the track. So we were always thinking\nabout not just having fun but something substantial, where you accomplish things\nor when you enjoyed things like the theater or the opera.",
        "Q: How much education did you get in Vienna\u2019? How high or how far did you go\nin your education?",

        "Q: We-We\u2019ll get to that in a minute, but you\u2019re -- you\u2019re running just a little ahead\nof me. So when Hitler became chancellor -- you said that\u2019s when you first really\nbecame concerned, what were some of the thoughts that you had and what -- do\nyou remember any of the conversations that your Jewish friends had at -- at the\ntime that he first became chancellor?",
        "A: For some reason we never were -- had any conversation about it, or exchanged\nany views. But -- that -- we always felt that 1t won\u2019t happen to us.\nAugust 12, 2002",
        "Q: Do you remember reading reports of the Reichstag fire and -- and the\nemergency decrees that came after that?",
        "A: Yes, I [indecipherable] excuse me. Yes, I followed the -- the news, of course,\nin the newspapers as well as the radio. And something -- as a matter of fact,\nspeaking of radio, that\u2019s a radio which my father and I put together ourselves. And\nwas quite a big success.",
        "Q: What was going on in Austria, specifically with Dollfus. Can you tell me a\nlittle bit about what was going on with the politics of the country in those days?",
        "A: Well, mostly under Dollfus, things were pretty -- pretty steady and were no\nproblems as far as anti-Semitism is concerned. The administration tried to make it\nas -- as easy as possible for the Jewish population, and they -- they tried not -- tried\nto make the Jewish population feel at peace that nothing would happen to them.\nAnd he did try to protect the Jewish population especially, and fought the -- the\nNazis in the city continuously.",

        "A: Not -- not until Hitler marched into Austria.",
        "Q: Before he came into Austria, though, did you see any of the Nazi propaganda\nthat was anti-Semitic?",
        "A: Oh yes, definitely. You know, there were lots of political pamphlets, pasted\ninformation on lampposts and w-walls and prints and all that. It was very\nuncomfortable too, to see it and to read it.",
        "Q: Can you remember any of the things that you saw or that you heard at that time?",
        "A: Well, as a matter of fact, I was interested in collecting all these stickers,\npolitical stickers. And as a matter of fact, I brought 1t with me to the United States\nand I give it to the Holocaust Museum. And they -- they, as a matter of fact,\ndisplayed it on the third floor.",

        "A: On the radio? Yes, yes, many times.",
        "Q: What was -- what were your reactions when you heard him on the radio?",
        "A: I just -- I think -- I think he sounded to me like a crazy man, that\u2019s all I can say.\nAugust 12, 2002",
        "Q: You mentioned before that the Jewish community was a little concerned. Did\nthe Jewish community do anything, or was there any activity at that time to show\nthat the Jewish community was concerned about what was happening right across\nthe border in Germany?",
        "A: They were concerned, but they always felt safe in the city.",
        "Q: What was happening in your life during the early 30\u2019s?",
        "A: You -- the early 30\u2019s? Well, there was actually no change. As a matter of fact,\nthe only experience I may have had a few times when I went to the college, that\nsome of the anti-Semitic organizations, student organizations tried to start a fight.\nSometimes they were successful, a lot of times they weren\u2019t. But I myself,\npersonally speaking, always tried to keep out of things, just minding my own\nbusiness. And just, as I said before, I never joined any political organizations. But\nthere were a few scraps between the students, whether they were Jewish or -- or\nGentile, but -- but somehow it didn\u2019t affect me in s -- in any way. I was upset about\nit, of course, but nothing I would do about it.",
        "Q: You mentioned before that Dollfus tried to keep things quiet, especially for the\nJewish population, was fighting Nazis in the streets. How much did you know\nabout the Nazi attempt to seize power in Austria in \u201934? Did you know anything\nabout that?\nAugust 12, 2002",
        "A: Oh, in -- that was -- well, that was the time when Dollfus was killed, and -- it\nwas murder, as a matter of fact. No, Id -- I -- I don\u2019t -- I was not too much\ninterested in that.",
        "Q: When Hitler started moving, before he even came to Austria, what were your\nthoughts, if you can remember, when he entered the Rhineland back in \u201936? Do\nyou remember when he entered the Rhineland?",
        "A: Yes, yeah. Well, it was -- it was just another -- another act of his, and we in\nAustria just -- we were more or less like a neutral country. We were hoping and\ntrying to -- to stay quiet and --",
        "Q: Did you have a sense of increasing alarm, or was it still status quo when he --\nwhen Hitler signed with Mussolini, when they signed their Berlin-Rome access.\nWere you -- were you beginning to get concerned, or did you still feel safe?",

        "A: Yeah. City was still normal. No changes.",
        "Q: Did you have any knowledge of what was happening in the United States with\nrespect to the Jewish community and the protest against Hitler? Did any of that\nnews ever filter out to Vienna?",
        "A: No. Was never anything written up in papers or otherwise.\nAugust 12, 2002",
        "Q: Did you follow the 1936 Olympics? You were a big athlete, I was just\nwondering if you -- if you followed the Berlin Olympics.",
        "A: Yes, we did. Yes, yes, we did. I did personally listen to the radio, watching the\nradio.",
        "Q: Any -- any memories of the Olympics that stand out in your mind?",
        "A: Not really, I -- I knew, of course about the -- the black people who -- who\nrepresented United States. There was a lot -- lot of talk about that, and -- and ina\nway we were glad that they won. We were -- were very happy about it.",
        "Q: Were there any newsreels at that time showing the Olympic events?",
        "A: No, not -- not -- not that -- I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay. What was happening in your life right before the anschluss? What\nwere you doing? Were you working, were you still a student? What was happening\nto you?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a good question, because as I graduate the college, I also had to\nhave -- had to serve three months in the military. And it\u2019s like an -- like we\u2019d call\nhere ROTC. And I reported to the -- to an artillery regiment, which was an\nexclusive regiment at that time, and my uncle helped me. And served for three\nmonths, going in in January 1938. And I was out of town on maneuvers, and\nMarch the 14\" we -- there were rumors that the Germans may take over Austria,\nAugust 12, 2002\nand Chancellor chus -- Schuschnigg at that time said that he does not want to see\nany blood flowing in the streets of Vienna, or for Austria, or the entire country.\nAnd he would not issue any -- any orders to fight or anything. Those were the\ninitial orders given, and of course we, as a military unit, we were prepared.\nSuddenly, over -- it was a weekend, Saturday to Sunday, when the invasion started.\nAnd of course my commanding officer knew that the -- I -- a-as a matter of fact, I\nthink I was the only Jew in the whole regiment. And he immediately notified me\nthat I could go take the next train back to Vienna to see my parents. And that he\nwould see me again in the barracks back in Vienna, because they were packing up\nand ready to go back to Vienna. And that was one sight I will never forget. When I\narrived at the railroad station in Vienna, I was in uniform, in the Austrian uniform,\nmilitary uniform. When I arrived in Vienna, got off, got out on the street, I\ncouldn\u2019t believe that I -- I was in -- in a city where I not only was born, but raised\nand went to school. It was a completely strange atmosphere. First of all, there were\npeople on the streets. Everybody had either a flag or an armband, Nazi armband.\nFlags all over the place, which never occurred during my lifetime in Vienna. And I\ntook the streetcar, go home, and I noticed of course at -- at that time, at th -- at this\nparticular moment I didn\u2019t know that they were all Jews who were down on their\nknees scrubbing the sidewalks. And I just couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t believe, couldn\u2019t see\nAugust 12, 2002\nit. And I got home and met my parents. And my father -- that was on a Sunday\nwhen I arrived, my father went to the office the next day on Monday, and when he\ngot -- got there, there were two Gestapo men waiting in front of his office. And\nthey introduced themselves and said that they were here to transfer the business\nover to the German banks. And as a matter of fact 1t was -- I think it was like a\ncontract, that he would be safe under their control until September the first of 1938.\nAnd they were more or less watching every move he made during that period, and\nin the meantime, my -- my mother contacted my family in the -- in the United\nStates and started procedure, getting an affidavit to get me out. At that time we\nalso unfortunately found out that as far as I\u2019m concerned, I could leave Vienna\nwithout any problems as a -- soon as I got my visa. But my parents, unfortunately,\nmy father was under the Russian quota and my mother came under the Polish\nquota. Both of those quotas were -- were closed, and they just could not get a visa\nto get to United States, so naturally -- we had contacts in Yugoslavia and other\nplaces and my parents were able to arrange -- leave here now to go first to\nYugoslavia. But going back to -- to myself, on Monday morning I got back to the\nbarracks, to my barracks, and believe me or not, I got into my room and I couldn\u2019t\nfind any of the -- my personal belongings. And, as a matter of fact, the whole\nregiment couldn\u2019t find anything of their own belongings. And what we found out is\nAugust 12, 2002\nthe German -- Germans moved in. As a matter of fact when I arrived in the\nbarracks, I saw the Germans drilling on -- on -- on the field, just like it was theirs.",
        "Q: I have to interrupt you because --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: -- we have to change tape. Just one moment.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Norbert Hilsberg. This is tape number one,\nside B. And you were telling me about the barracks, coming back to your barracks\nand what you found there. And if you would, please continue.",
        "A: As I said, when I came back into the barracks, I couldn\u2019t find my personal\nbelongings and we later found out that the Germans just took over and threw\neverything down into the cellar of the barracks. So we all had to scramble and find\nour things. I eventually did. I immediately contacted my commanding officer about\nthe situation, that my parents a-are going to get me out as quickly as possible. And\nso he said don\u2019t worry about it. Of course, I also explained to my commanding\nofficer that I couldn\u2019t leave Vienna until I get my mili -- mil -- military passport,\nbecause those are requirements to get the visa. So he said don\u2019t worry about it, I'll\nAugust 12, 2002\ntake care of everything. I was in the Austrian uniform for almost two weeks -- over\ntwo weeks, as a matter of fact, which helped me considerably, moving around the\ncity without any fear. And so the day when the commanding officer had the\nmilitary passport for me, he called me in the office and said, now here\u2019s the\npassport, but I won\u2019t give it to you. I said, why won\u2019t you give it? He said, because\nI want to make sure that you\u2019re gonna deposit th -- in the American embassy,\nwhere it belongs. I said, well then, let -- take it out, I\u2019m going to the embassy right\nnow. He said, no, I\u2019m going to call a taxi for you, put you in the taxi and -- and you\n-- you take it. Which I did, and I went to the embassy directly from the barracks\nand deposited a passport in the embassy and then went home. Of course, after that I\nhad to take off my military uniform because I was not in the military any more, I\nwas discharged; although I was, up until 1956, I was considered a reserve officer in\nthe Austrian army, wa -- at that time of course, in the German army. And as a\nmatter of fact, I still have my military passport with me. And so a -- twice -- we --\nwe lived in a -- an apartment building and [indecipherable] apartment building\nnear the American -- well, wi -- American embassy as a m -- as a matter of fact, a\nnew American embassy after the war is located within a block, walking distance\nfrom where I used to live. And w -- our concierge was very cognizant of the\nsituation and always informed us whenever the Gestapo came by to inquire about\nAugust 12, 2002\nthe Jewish residents, to notify us that they were here. And so whenever that\nhappened, my parents of course were safe because my father had the contract with\nthe Germans to be in his office until September the first, but for me, I had to leave\nthe city twice. And just went to the far -- far suburbs of do -- Vienna, and stayed\nthere for about a week, then I came back again. Well, finally I received my visa in\nJune of 1938 and packed everything up, wh-what I wanted. And of course I could\nnot leave Vienna with more than eight dollars in my pocket to go to United States.\nAnd of course my father, being in a bank, he arranged prior, long prior, my --\nbefore my departure, to have money picked up in -- in twa -- in Paris when I\narrived there from Vienna, which I did, was very lucky. Of course, everything --\nbefore I left Vienna, my passage was completely paid and taken care of from\nFrance to the United States. And of course I was concerned about my parents,\nwhat -- what will happen to them, but luckily they were -- they got the visa to\nYugoslavia. It\u2019s only for about I think six weeks. And then they traveled to Italy\nand from Italy they went to France. And in the meantime, my uncle who had --\nwho lived in Philadelphia, and he had contacts with the State department, and\narrangements were made that my parents take a -- buy a round trip ticket -- of\ncourse sh -- that\u2019s the only thing they could buy, a round trip ticket to the West\nIndies, a cruise to the West Indies and arrive in Cuba. And so naturally my\nAugust 12, 2002\nparents bought s-some cruise tickets in Paris, and they left France on that cruise\nship in 1940. And they cruised and of -- when they arrived in -- in ha -- in\nSantiago de Cuba, the port, the representative of the American embassy in -- in\nHavana that greeted them and took them off the ship. And my parents stayed in\nHavana for -- until April of 1941, when they finally got their visa to enter the\nUnited States, they came. So that is my story.",

        "A: Ma -- my mother was the driving force really, because my father s-said -- I -- I\nhad nothing to say anyway. I was a good boy. But my -- my father just took it easy,\nhe said, well, everything will be go -- will go back to normal, nothing will happen.\nAnd -- but my mother was the driving force, and she -- she really did a fine job to\nget us all out. As a matter of fact, there\u2019s a very interesting -- very interesting story.\nSe-September -- September first came, and of course --",

And\nluckily, he called home to tell my mother something, and my mother said, don\u2019t\ncome home any more. And the reason was is while my father was away, a knock\non the door, and a couple men standing out in front of the door and then my mother\nsays, can I help you? And they said, I would like to -- we would like to talk to Mr.\nHilsberg. So my mother said, well, Mr. Hilsberg is downtown for a -- I don\u2019t\nknow what -- well, when is he coming home? So my mother says, well, I really\ndon\u2019t know how long he\u2019s going to stay downtown. He said, well we -- we\u2019d like\nto talk to him. So my mother replied -- said, well you know that we are leaving\ntoday. So he said yes, we know, but we still like to talk to Mr. Hilsberg before he\nleave. So that was it and luckily my father called in the meantime. My mother said,\ndon\u2019t come home. I\u2019Il just lock the door and I\u2019Il leave the key with my neighbors\nand say goodbye to everything. I\u2019ll meet you at the railroad station. And that\u2019s\nwhat happened and that\u2019s how they got out.",

        "A: I don\u2019t remember the date, or when they received the -- the visa to -- to leave\nVienna for yu-yugos -- for Yugoslavia, but I do know that they were well\nprepared shortly after I left Vienna, where their -- their personal belongs were all -\nAugust 12, 2002\n- already packed, because arrangements were made that they would go to -- to\nUnited States to live there. So we ha -- I had one uncle in -- in California, and so\neverything was sent -- all the crates were sent to California. So --",
        "Q: I -- I\u2019m still trying to figure out when your dad got the money sent to Paris for\nyou, because he di -- did he do it before the anschluss?",
        "A: Yes, yes. As a matter -- that was good question, I\u2019m glad that you asked me.\nWhat happened is when the word came that maybe -- that the Germans may wind\nup and enter the -- the -- Austria, that\u2019s when he felt that he better transfer some of\nthe -- the money, the family money, as a matter of fact, to Paris, to the bank, which\nis -- was the main branch there.",
        "Q: I do have some other questions --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- about what you told me. The -- the biggest question in my mind is why would\nyour parents -- why would anybody take a cruise in 1940? The war started in 1939.\nI must be missing something. Was it -- did people feel 1t was safe to take a -- a\ncruise?",

        "Q: You said you had an uncle in Philadelphia and an uncle in California and the -\n- the crates and everything went to California. Was California your destination\nalso?",
        "A: I assume it was my parent\u2019s destination, but it has changed because they finally\nsettled in New York and everything had to be sent back to New York --\nCalifornia.",
        "Q: But when you came to the United States, what was your destination? Where\ndid you think you were going to end up?",
        "A: I stayed with my great-aunt in New York for a couple weeks and then -- that\nwas in the summer, of course, of \u201938. And my uncle from Philadelphia picked me\nup and took me to his summer home up in New Hampshire and we stayed there all\nsummer, and then went back to -- to Philadelphia.",
        "Q: You told me to ask you about the hurricane of 1938; I did not forget. Can you\ntell me about the hurricane?",
        "A: That was quite an experience for me because I\u2019m -- I was never in my life\nexposed to it, even though it was only 24 years of my life, but I -- I never -- never\nAugust 12, 2002\nexperienced it myself and I certainly did. It was a little -- a home right on a lake,\nand that lake became an ocean. As a matter of fact, when I came over on the ship\nacross the ocean to the United States, I went through a storm. And I just\nremembered that moment when that hurricane came over New Hampshire and\nthat little lake became a -- became an ocean. And it was really very tough to get out\nbecause luckily the summer home was not hit by any trees, but trees were falling\nall over the place. As a matter of fact, the next day, my uncle and I, we had to\nmove tree trunks in order to get out to the main road from the house. So it was\nquite an excitement for me. I -- I -- in a way I enjoyed it, but yet I felt very sorry\nfor all the damage I saw in the way home from New Hampshire to Philadelphia.",

        "Q: What about your expectations of the American citizens? How did the\nAmericans strike you?",
        "A: I liked them from the moment I arrived in the States. I think it -- I was -- I was\nused to that type of life and excitement and variety of life in the United States, and\nI felt very quickly, almost immediately I felt like it -- being at home.",
        "Q: Did you realize at that time just how lucky you were to have gotten out?",
        "A: I certainly was because as a measure f -- as a mat -- as a matter of fact, when I\nfound out recently that I am considered a -- a survivor, I -- I just couldn\u2019t believe it,\nbecause I personally really did not suffer, and for that matter, my -- my parents\ndidn\u2019t suffer. They suffered a little bit more than I did, but at least they made it out\nall right and didn\u2019t have these bad experiences. And -- and -- and kept on living.",

But otherwise no, I -- I\ncouldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t really tell them. I -- ab -- of course I was able to tell them the\nAugust 12, 2002\nstory what I saw while I was there, how they treated the -- the Jewish people, not\nonly that, but the Jewish owners of -- of stores and so on. And life really changed\novernight.",

As a\nmatter of fact, I also concentrated on seeing all the American movies in Vienna\nwhile I was still living there and that -- that helped my English also, naturally.",

And I just -- I\u2019m always\nup for some -- always up -- ready to do something else, something different. And I\nhad a -- a interview with one of the finest voice teachers in Vienna at that time.\nAugust 12, 2002\nAnd he said, my God, I want you to be my student. And he -- I started to take\nsinging lessons. And then he transferred me to his assistant, a Bulgarian man, and I\nstudied voice and ca -- actually continued studying voice when I came to\nPhiladelphia, I went to the Curtis Institute and studied voice there. In the\nmeantime also, naturally, I wanted to be independent so my uncle got me a job in\nPhiladelphia.",
        "Q: What kind of job?",
        "A: Well, he was -- had connections with the city solicitor of -- of Philadelphia,\nand of -- my first job we came -- we came back from the hurricane experience in\nSeptember of -- September of 1938, which was the 27\" of September 1938, and --\nand he -- this man got me an interview with a person in the ci -- in city hall who\nhad something to do with the library. Apparently they needed some translators. So\nI went up there, was -- had an interview at nine o\u2019clock in the morning and we had\na very pleasant meeting. And the last question he asked me, he said to me, are you\na citizen of the United States? I said no, but I -- I already -- already applied for my\n-- for my second papers. I do -- I do have them. So he said to me, I don\u2019t care. And\nhe pounded his fist on his table and said I don\u2019t care if even President Roosevelt is\ngoing to ask me to give you a job, I will not. That was that. That was my\nexperience, my first experience trying for a job in -- in the United States. So I\nAugust 12, 2002\nwent back home and I told my -- my uncle about it. He says well, let me call Mr.\nSharfson, and he called him. So the guy says to him, well, don\u2019t worry about it,\nPll get him an -- a job. And sure enough, two days later I had an interview in the\nLitz department store in Philadelphia in the advertising department. And so I -- I -\n- | worked there until I went to the service in February of \u201941. And thit -- the what I\ndid is, since I was musically inclined and knowledgeable in a way, I -- the\ndepartment store had, every Sunday morning, a two hour classical music -- a -- a\nmusic hour, two hours. And I was in charge to arrange the program every Sunday\nmorning. So that was a nice, interesting job for me to do. And of course I had to be\ncareful, using the -- the time properly with -- with the commercials and so on. And\non the side I have oth-other duties like filing and doing things in the advertising\ndepartment. So I -- I liked that, I -- I enjoyed it very much, and --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nAugust 12, 2002\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",

And I\u2019m sorry, we were talking about your job and the concerts, the\nSunday morning concerts and -- and some of your other duties and responsibilities,\nand you were abo -- you were going to finish with that and about to tell me about\ngoing into the military. And I\u2019d also like you to tell me if you were drafted, or if\nyou volunteered.",
        "A: Well, so as I -- as I was saying, I was proud to make my ow -- have my own\nmoney and do as I pleased. And in the mean -- also, I continued taking my lessons,\nsinging lessons at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. And then in Octob -- was it\nOctober or November of 1940, Congress drafted th-the bill for conscriptions. And\nat that time when -- you had to go to the draft board and report, and -- and they\ngave you a number when you -- when -- the numb -- yeah, the number was a\nnumber -- if you had a low number that means that you -- they would call you for\nduty in a -- in a short time. An-And unfortunately, I -- I had an -- well f -- actually\nfortunately I had a low number. And it was, of course, winter of \u201940 - \u201941, and in\nthose days, of course, you only served for one year. That -- that\u2019s the time period.\nSo I liked having had the experience in the military in Austria. Of course, I was\nAugust 12, 2002\naware that the summertime, especially the summertime in the Amer -- in the\nAmerican camps, I -- I found out were located, most of them in -- in the beginning\nof the -- the war, in -- in the south. So -- and I always hated hot weather. So I\nfigured well, if I can -- since I have a low number, I found out when they\u2019re going\nto call me, which I did and they told me, well, your number would indicate that\nyou probably will -- will be called in April or May. So I said, April or May? I said\n-- so I asked him, would -- could they take me now if I -- if I decide? But of course,\nI have to check with my boss first. He said well, 1f you want -- want to volunteer,\nwe'll take you in right now if you want to. Said no, le-let\u2019s wait. I went back to my\njob and I talked to the boss and he said fine, go. If you feel -- if you want to go\nnow, go ahead and go into the service. We\u2019ll keep the job for you. When you come\nback, I guarantee you, you will have your job back. So with that, I felt good about\nit. | went back to the draft board. That was about -- must have been about January\nand I volunteered for a year, and February 18\" of 1941, I went to the service. I was\ntaken to Fort Dix in New Jersey and I had my physical and I had interviews. I had\nthe intelligence test and during the intelligence test they asked me, do you have any\nspecial -- special unit you would like to join? So I said, well I really -- I really\ndon\u2019t care. So the -- the interviewer says, well, you have engineering background\nand you wa -- do -- what-what else did he say? Don\u2019t -- don\u2019t remember.\nAugust 12, 2002\nEngineering background and what was the other one? Oh, the military service, of\ncourse, in the Austrian Army. So wha-what would you like, engineering? I said, I\nreally don\u2019t care. I\u2019Il just go in and finish my year and that\u2019s all I\u2019m interested. So\nthey sent me to Fort Bell wa -- which is -- which is an engineer camp, and -- and |\nwent there and they put me into mapmaking. And of course, that\u2019s my -- my forte.\nI like geography and of course, in my engineering ground -- background helped me\nto learn quickly how to make maps. My math and -- and geology 1s included in --\nin that. And I -- I started out as a private in 1941, and shortly I became promoted\nand my commanding officer and the executive officer of the battalion which I-I\nwas attached to, came over to the drafting room every morning for inspection. And\nas I was sitting in my drafting table and so my commanding officer and my b --\ncompany officer st-stayed th -- I -- I was the only table, always stopped, talking to\nme. At the other tables they just passed by. He says well, how\u2019s my little refugee\nfeel today? You gained some more weight. And so came -- was in November, or --\nor must have been end of November or early December, that was December\nseventh. Yeah, it was December seventh, of course. Was December seventh, it was\nin a Sunday. A friend of mine, we took off. I got a pass to go into town. We went\nto Washington and the reason was that th-the [indecipherable] choir gave a\nconcert the Constitution Hall at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. Well, in those days,\nAugust 12, 2002\nbefore the war s -- before the United States was involved in the war, of course,\nthey -- they didn\u2019t care too much for the soldiers. And -- so we went to the\nConstitution Hall and it was all sold out, no tickets available. Otherwise in the -- in\nthe later days, after the war started, well they gave you free tickets and everything\nwas available for the -- for the u -- United States soldier. So we wound up in the --\nwent to the Library of Congress to play some chess. But five o\u2019clock was the time\nfor the Library of Congress to close, so we returned the chess set, and the guy\nbehind the counter said, okay, good luck boys, won\u2019t see you any more. I said,\nwhat -- what do you mean, won\u2019t see you any more? That was five o\u2019clock in the\nafternoon, December 7\", 1941. So he said, well don\u2019t you know that Pearl Harbor\nwas -- was bombed? Pearl Harbor was bombed? What? We went out -- well, it\nwas really chaos in -- in the city of Washington. There were army trucks all over,\npicking up all the soldiers from th -- on the streets and taking them back to the\ncamps. Well, we decided we\u2019re not going to get caught. We went through side\nstreets and though alleys and we wound up at Basil\u2019s delicatessen on\nPennsylvania Avenue and E Street, and we figured we\u2019ll have the last good\nJewish meal. And we came back -- we took the bus back to the camp, to Fort\nBelvoir and my God, everybody was packing, everybody was ready to go. But\nAugust 12, 2002\nluckily our outfit was attached to general headquarters in Washington, so -- and of\ncourse we were not involved in that. So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s my story.",
        "Q: After Pearl Harbor, did your duties or responsibilities change?",
        "A: Well, it was s-secrecy all around, especially in -- in my job because we -- we\nstarted to be involved in preparations for -- for war maps and invasion maps and\nthat sort of stuff. So naturally, secrecy was all around us.",
        "Q: When you first joined the military, what was your citizenship status?",
        "A: I was still waiting for my citizenship. As a matter of fact, I did not become a\ncitizen until April of 1943.",
        "Q: I'd -- I\u2019d like you to tell me about some of the changes that you saw unfolding\nin this country right after Pearl Harbor. In those first weeks and months after\nPearl Harbor, what did you see around you, not just in the army, but did you have\nany contact at all with any of the civilian centers, like any of the cities or anything?",
        "A: No, not -- not at all. I do know one thing, that we were very busy in doing our\njob, and there was little time left for other st -- things to do. And we had very little\nconterwi -- of course we -- we wer -- we were told to have as little contact as --\ncontact as possible with the outside.",
        "Q: So tell me what you were doing generally or specifically in 1942. Were you still\n-- you were Stateside? You\u2019re nodding your head, bu --\nAugust 12, 2002",
        "A: Yes, we were -- we were Stateside, and working pretty hard. We -- I myself put\nin anywhere from 10 to 12 hours a day to prepare all the maps necessary for the --\nfor north Africa especially at that -- at that time. And in 1942, when things became\nmore and more involved for the United States, our general headquarters decided to\nsend us overseas to be attached to a general headquarters in Europe. And at that\ntime also there was -- they started to prepare for the European invasion, and that\nwould be a good location to do what we have to do. Unfortunately, or fortunately,\nwhichever, I was still not a citizen, and even though my commanding officer did\nhis utmost to take me along, the war department -- at that time war department\nwould not allow me to go because it was too dangerous if I were captured as a -- I\nwas still, more or less I -- an Austrian, or an enemy, anyway. And so they kept me\nhere and they formed a new cadre for a new battalion for mapmaking, because they\nneeded more than one, so of course I was left back in the United States and we\nformed a new ou-outfit. And -- and we -- we put all these newcomers through basic\ntraining like I used to go through, in the beginning. And -- and we worked. We\u2019 re\nstill attached to general headquarters 1n th -- Washington. And then come 1940 --\n\u201943 -- of course I was a citizen in April, but in November of 1943, our out -- the\nnew outfit was sent to north Africa, and that\u2019s where I left for overseas in\nNovember of 1943. And I stayed in north Africa for about a year. We took over a\nAugust 12, 2002\nlittle French si -- town, little ti -- cher -- Cherchell. And we set up shop there and\ndid a lot of work for the invasion of southern France with the seventh army, and\nalso worked for General Mark Clark in -- in Italy. And started preparing, as a\nmatter of fact, started preparing to work -- make military maps of Austria. And of\ncourse, I was in charge, naturally. But we did not finish 1t because we were asked\nto be sent back to United States and back to the Pacific, and we went to Hawaii.\nWe attached to Pacific Ocean headquarters and started to work on all the invasion\nmaps of the islands and Japan and so on. And as a matter of fact, on -- on V -- not\nso V -- no. Yeah, V-J day, that\u2019s when the -- when Japan finally gave up. On V-J\nday the war didn\u2019t end for our outfit, because it just so happened that we worked\non Tokyo bay and General mar -- MacArthur would not move in with the\nMissouri into the bay, unless he has all the information available to him. He just\ndidn\u2019t trust these guys, naturally. And so we -- for us the war wasn\u2019t over until two\nweeks after V-J day. And we finally were finished and that was in \u201945. And I was\ndischar -- discharged in November of 1945. And when my wife picked me up from\nFort Mead, she told me that there was a letter from the war department waiting for\nme. And of course, I -- at that point I did not have any idea what I\u2019m going to do.\nAnd I -- I would not go back to Philadelphia because my wife is a Washingtonian\nAugust 12, 2002\nand she has all her family and friends here and so I decided we\u2019re going to raise a\nfamily here, in Washington area.",

And th -- we were at the early show and the show was over, I think it was\nnine o\u2019clock in the evening and my friend, he always went to these dances. They\nbrought in girls from the Jewish community center or from other organizations to\ndance with the boys, entertain them. And on that particular day there was some\nJewish org -- something of -- I think it was from the Jewish community center,\nwere sent to Fort Belvoir. And my friend says to me, let\u2019s go. I -- I want to go. He\nusually went to these affairs, I didn\u2019t. And so he said, come on, don\u2019t be a\nspoilsport. I said okay, Pll do you a favor. So we walked into the hall where were -\n- they were dancing and a buddy of mine was working the record player. So he saw\nme and he called me up on the stage and said, come on, let me dance while you --\nif you want to work. I said, sure, sure, I'll ta -- I'll take over, I'll play the records.\nAnd for the rest of the evening, was almost until about 10 o\u2019clock or so, I played\nrecords. And the dancing -- and I -- I just looked and enjoyed watching the people.\nAugust 12, 2002\nAnd -- and all of a sudden -- it was the last dance, all of a sudden I see a girl\ncoming by the stage right -- right below me and sh-she had a do -- red -- red dress\non, or was it a jacket or something, but she just hit my eye. So I said, I want to\ndance with her, and I jumped off the stage. And I asked for the dance and that --\nwhoever [indecipherable] passed it on, and we were dancing. And I said -- I said\nto her, my first words -- words were, where have you been all evening? So one\nword led to another and as a matter of fact I -- I was supposed to, since I was in\ncharge, I was supposed to bring the records back -- back to the barracks. So of\ncourse, was late at night and -- and the records were heavy. So it just so happened\nthat my wife-to-be had a car with all the girls in there. So I said, do you mind to\ndrop me off with the -- those records? So she said, I really don\u2019t have any room. I\nreally have full of -- they had, you know, she had about a half a dozen girls in th --\nin the car. So, in those days they had the standing boards on the cars, on the old\ncars. So she said, if you want to, you can stand on a -- on a -- on a boar -- ona\nbody board, or whatever they called it and I\u2019ll take you back to the barracks. So --\nso she took me back to the barracks and before I -- I left, I said, can I have your\nphone number\u2019? So she says, I\u2019m in the phone book. Just like that.

They -- they seemed to feel that th -- we\u2019re Jewish. They did not go out of\ntheir way to help us or talk to us, give us service and so on. But I also must say that\nI left in \u00b038 and I came back in \u201971, that the city itself has not changed a bit.\nEverything 1s the same. The streetcars are numbered, they go in the same places\nI\u2019m used to, the buses, nothing has changed. And I was glad to see that, although\nAugust 12, 2002\nthe people were a little bit sour. I don\u2019t know why. Just because I was there,\nmaybe, I don\u2019t know. But anyway, the second visit we had is when my\ngranddaughter spent her college semester in -- in Florence, and we all visited then.\nAnd that was really a -- the best time I\u2019ve had with my children and grandchildren,\nwhen we went to Vienna. We met them -- we visited the first -- well, we went to o\n-- Vienna first and then my daughter and her husband and their three daughters\njoined us in Vienna when they came up from Florence. And we spent eight days\nin Vienna and [| took them through the whole city, and I took them to the\nelementary school where I used to go to. But -- this 1s the nice thing about Vienna\nis -- compared to the United States, they\u2019d rather destroy and build new in the\nUnited States, but in Vienna they -- they\u2019re trying to -- to keep it the way it is and\nmaintain it properly. But anyway, [indecipherable] elementary school and my\nyoungest granddaughter was a -- I think about seven or eight years old, and of\ncourse she just enjoyed it. I took her to the classroom where I was sitting for my --\nmy sec -- my second grade. And as a matter of fact 1t was a Saturday afternoon. Of\ncourse, school are still there Saturday -- Saturday morning, half d -- half day school\non Saturday, so we just arrived there when the children left, and I was waiting until\nthey are all out, and then I walked in with my family and took them into the school\nbuilding. And in the classroom, one of the classroom the teacher was still there and\nAugust 12, 2002\nsays, I told her, but she just couldn't believe it. She couldn\u2019t believe it. And I took\nher to the apartment where we used to live and of course that was a really high\nmoment in my life, because I -- I noticed the children in my family were so\ninterested in seeing where I grew up. And -- and the third time was in 1990. We\ntook a talk tour to ma -- eastern Europe and we wound up in Vienna for the third\ntime. And as a matter of fact, I did visit Auschwitz when I was in Poland and it\nwas devastating really, even now. And I was in Krakow and I was in\n[indecipherable] Budapest and then I would up in Vienna. And in those -- as a\nmatter of fact, I didn\u2019t mention that in the second visit to Vienna with my family, I\n-- that was in -- in ninet -- in 1990 and that was a complete turnaround as far as\nbeing a visitor there. People seemed to be very polite, very helpful, very pleasant\nand it was almost like being 1n any other city in the United States, really. But if\ncourse, in the back of -- of our head there was still -- still the past, naturally. And\nbif -- the third time, just a few years ago, and it was the same. I enjoyed it while I\nwas there for about three days. And that\u2019s it.",

        "A: Unfortunately, I lost all my family in Poland. Had family in Warsaw, had\nfamily in L\u00e9dz, I had family in Krakow, I had family in Belgrade, and they were\nall gone. I tried to -- as a matter of fact, 1 -- bef-before -- and let\u2019s see, it was --\nmust have been in the 50\u2019s, yes, it was in the 50\u2019s, my father -- I don\u2019t remember\nhow he found out that the cousin of mine from the family in Warsaw survived.\nAnd he is in -- he was in Paris, he lived in Paris and my father got in touch with\nhim and tried to bring him over to the States. He was married at that time already.\nAnd -- but in turn his wife found out that her father survived -- I don\u2019t -- I think it\nwas Auschwitz, and lived in Tel Aviv. So naturally they decided that they\u2019re going\nto Tel Aviv rather than come to the United States. And so at least found out that\none survivor. Then, a second survivor I found out is -- I -- I -- I -- throughout the\nyears, since that time, up until the -- this moment, I tried to find out what happened\nto them, and I got in touch with the international Red Cross. And through them I\nfound out that my uncle, who lived -- they lived in L\u00e9dz, he died in the ghetto,\nLodz ghetto. But my aunt and their son wound up in Auschwitz, and of course,\nunfortunately my -- my -- my aunt -- my aunt, she just didn\u2019t survive the camp in\nAuschwitz. But my cousin, who was then in his late teens, they sent him to\nDachau. And I found out through the Red Cross that he was liberated in Dachau\nand they gave me all the information available, but they could not find out for me\nAugust 12, 2002\nwhat happened after he was liberated. And I\u2019m still trying to -- to locate and find\nout what happened to him, but no luck so far.",

He came to philadel -- Philadelphia too, shortly after I arrived there.\nAnd once in awhile he -- he goes -- he went back to Vienna more often. Now, he\nwas half Jewish and he was half Catholic. So he had the easier rap -- rapport with\nthe people -- with our school friends, and he saw some of them and -- and he found\nout that some died during the war, were killed during the war and other survived\nand they just make a bare living, which I don\u2019t really care about the ones who\nsurvived, truthfully, as far as I\u2019m concerned, even though I didn't have any bad\nexperiences during our time in school, they were -- they were fine. It\u2019s very\npossible that they -- they felt bad about it, too, but after all, they had to survive, and\nthey had to do whatever they had to do. I do have one experience myself. The first\n-- first visit in Vienna, I noticed that a school friend of mine in high school, he was\nthe -- the son of one of the big precision instrument stores in Vienna. And when he\ncame back, his -- the -- his -- his father\u2019s store was located nearby where I lived,\nwhere I grew up, so we came by and I noticed the name -- same name still on there,\nso I figured must be the son who is in business. And so just of curiosity I walked\nAugust 12, 2002\nin. He was a Gentile. And I walked in and I w -- I recognized him immediately,\nand he was busy with a customer so I stood on the side waiting until he was\nfinished. No sooner the customer walked out, he turns around, he says, Norbert,\nwhere have you been? Where have you been; that -- that hit me. He should have\nknown. But anyway, well he welcomed me and -- back, and let\u2019s get together. And\nI said, I\u2019m sorry, I -- it\u2019s my last day and I wanted to show my wife some other\nthings.

And it\u2019s accentuated what I always thought\nabout the United States, because my original plans is -- of course, Hitler helped\nme -- my original plans was to -- to go to the United States and live there anyway.\nSo I just -- just assimilated immediately, just like I -- I always lived in the United\nStates.",

I -- I do remember for instance that in my\nuncle\u2019s house -- he was a general in the old Austrian army, in the medical corps,\nand I guess he was exposed to the celebration of Christmas throughout his career,\nand he always had a Christmas tree in his home. And we all got together and then\ncelebrated the holiday, exchanged gifts like an-anybody else. And I was -- to me it\nwas just normal. Was not something which was unusual for me to look forward to.\nAugust 12, 2002\nBut of course, as I got older, I understood more about the difference between\nChristianity and -- and Judaism.",

        "A: Well, I always enjoyed history and geography and that was my forte.\nAugust 12, 2002",
        "A: Not really. There was always friendship and there were no -- no arguments. I\nmean, I personally stayed away from any arguments about religion or any of that --\nor politics. I never joined any -- any group, any special group. I stayed away from\nit. | do remember one time I was in high school and somebody made a statement\nwhich I did not care and we got into a fight right in the classroom, the benches\nwere flying and everything else. But that was the only time, and I -- I knew if\nanybody made any comments about Jews or religion or anything of that sort, I\nfought back, because I was proud to be a Jew and -- and I didn\u2019t hide it either.",

        "A: All right. We had always a lot of fun together as students, and we went out\nmostly to the opera and the different theaters. And we also had parties at home,\nmostly at home. We never went out to -- to bars or any of that sort. And it was a\ndifferent life then than it\u2019s today, that -- that I know. We le -- we -- we lived a -- a\nclean and healthier life. We also took a lot of trips, hiking trips and mountain\nclimbing in those -- in my day -- young days. Went skiing away for a few days or a\ncouple of weeks during the wintertime. Yeah, I -- we played all kinds of sports. I\nwas a member of one of the sports clubs, the Vienna football club. And I was very\nactive in tracks -- in -- in track and -- and in soccer, and was active in the junior\nAugust 12, 2002\nleague and even won couple first prizes in the track. So we were always thinking\nabout not just having fun but something substantial, where you accomplish things\nor when you enjoyed things like the theater or the opera.",

        "A: I was a civil engineer, and that qualified me for quite a few ways.",
        "A: Not until Hitler became chancellor in 1933. Then, especially the Jewish people\nwere aware what\u2019s -- things -- what -- what\u2019s going on in Germany. Although,\ntimes really got bad for the Jews when Hitler took over Austria.",

        "A: Well, mostly under Dollfus, things were pretty -- pretty steady and were no\nproblems as far as anti-Semitism is concerned. The administration tried to make it\nas -- as easy as possible for the Jewish population, and they -- they tried not -- tried\nto make the Jewish population feel at peace that nothing would happen to them.\nAnd he did try to protect the Jewish population especially, and fought the -- the\nNazis in the city continuously.",

        "A: You -- the early 30\u2019s? Well, there was actually no change. As a matter of fact,\nthe only experience I may have had a few times when I went to the college, that\nsome of the anti-Semitic organizations, student organizations tried to start a fight.\nSometimes they were successful, a lot of times they weren\u2019t. But I myself,\npersonally speaking, always tried to keep out of things, just minding my own\nbusiness. And just, as I said before, I never joined any political organizations. But\nthere were a few scraps between the students, whether they were Jewish or -- or\nGentile, but -- but somehow it didn\u2019t affect me in s -- in any way. I was upset about\nit, of course, but nothing I would do about it.\nAugust 12, 2002",
        "A: Oh, in -- that was -- well, that was the time when Dollfus was killed, and -- it\nwas murder, as a matter of fact. No, Id -- I -- I don\u2019t -- I was not too much\ninterested in that.",
        "A: Yes, yeah. Well, it was -- it was just another -- another act of his, and we in\nAustria just -- we were more or less like a neutral country. We were hoping and\ntrying to -- to stay quiet and --",

        "A: Not really, I -- I knew, of course about the -- the black people who -- who\nrepresented United States. There was a lot -- lot of talk about that, and -- and ina\nway we were glad that they won. We were -- were very happy about it.",
        "A: No, not -- not -- not that -- I don\u2019t remember.\nwere you doing? Were you working, were you still a student? What was happening\nto you?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a good question, because as I graduate the college, I also had to\nhave -- had to serve three months in the military. And it\u2019s like an -- like we\u2019d call\nhere ROTC. And I reported to the -- to an artillery regiment, which was an\nexclusive regiment at that time, and my uncle helped me. And served for three\nmonths, going in in January 1938. And I was out of town on maneuvers, and\nMarch the 14\" we -- there were rumors that the Germans may take over Austria,\nAugust 12, 2002\nand Chancellor chus -- Schuschnigg at that time said that he does not want to see\nany blood flowing in the streets of Vienna, or for Austria, or the entire country.\nAnd he would not issue any -- any orders to fight or anything. Those were the\ninitial orders given, and of course we, as a military unit, we were prepared.\nSuddenly, over -- it was a weekend, Saturday to Sunday, when the invasion started.\nAnd of course my commanding officer knew that the -- I -- a-as a matter of fact, I\nthink I was the only Jew in the whole regiment. And he immediately notified me\nthat I could go take the next train back to Vienna to see my parents. And that he\nwould see me again in the barracks back in Vienna, because they were packing up\nand ready to go back to Vienna. And that was one sight I will never forget. When I\narrived at the railroad station in Vienna, I was in uniform, in the Austrian uniform,\nmilitary uniform. When I arrived in Vienna, got off, got out on the street, I\ncouldn\u2019t believe that I -- I was in -- in a city where I not only was born, but raised\nand went to school. It was a completely strange atmosphere. First of all, there were\npeople on the streets. Everybody had either a flag or an armband, Nazi armband.\nFlags all over the place, which never occurred during my lifetime in Vienna. And I\ntook the streetcar, go home, and I noticed of course at -- at that time, at th -- at this\nparticular moment I didn\u2019t know that they were all Jews who were down on their\nknees scrubbing the sidewalks. And I just couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t believe, couldn\u2019t see\nAugust 12, 2002\nit. And I got home and met my parents. And my father -- that was on a Sunday\nwhen I arrived, my father went to the office the next day on Monday, and when he\ngot -- got there, there were two Gestapo men waiting in front of his office. And\nthey introduced themselves and said that they were here to transfer the business\nover to the German banks. And as a matter of fact 1t was -- I think it was like a\ncontract, that he would be safe under their control until September the first of 1938.\nAnd they were more or less watching every move he made during that period, and\nin the meantime, my -- my mother contacted my family in the -- in the United\nStates and started procedure, getting an affidavit to get me out. At that time we\nalso unfortunately found out that as far as I\u2019m concerned, I could leave Vienna\nwithout any problems as a -- soon as I got my visa. But my parents, unfortunately,\nmy father was under the Russian quota and my mother came under the Polish\nquota. Both of those quotas were -- were closed, and they just could not get a visa\nto get to United States, so naturally -- we had contacts in Yugoslavia and other\nplaces and my parents were able to arrange -- leave here now to go first to\nYugoslavia. But going back to -- to myself, on Monday morning I got back to the\nbarracks, to my barracks, and believe me or not, I got into my room and I couldn\u2019t\nfind any of the -- my personal belongings. And, as a matter of fact, the whole\nregiment couldn\u2019t find anything of their own belongings. And what we found out is\nAugust 12, 2002\nthe German -- Germans moved in. As a matter of fact when I arrived in the\nbarracks, I saw the Germans drilling on -- on -- on the field, just like it was theirs.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: As I said, when I came back into the barracks, I couldn\u2019t find my personal\nbelongings and we later found out that the Germans just took over and threw\neverything down into the cellar of the barracks. So we all had to scramble and find\nour things. I eventually did. I immediately contacted my commanding officer about\nthe situation, that my parents a-are going to get me out as quickly as possible. And\nso he said don\u2019t worry about it. Of course, I also explained to my commanding\nofficer that I couldn\u2019t leave Vienna until I get my mili -- mil -- military passport,\nbecause those are requirements to get the visa. So he said don\u2019t worry about it, I'll\nAugust 12, 2002\ntake care of everything. I was in the Austrian uniform for almost two weeks -- over\ntwo weeks, as a matter of fact, which helped me considerably, moving around the\ncity without any fear. And so the day when the commanding officer had the\nmilitary passport for me, he called me in the office and said, now here\u2019s the\npassport, but I won\u2019t give it to you. I said, why won\u2019t you give it? He said, because\nI want to make sure that you\u2019re gonna deposit th -- in the American embassy,\nwhere it belongs. I said, well then, let -- take it out, I\u2019m going to the embassy right\nnow. He said, no, I\u2019m going to call a taxi for you, put you in the taxi and -- and you\n-- you take it. Which I did, and I went to the embassy directly from the barracks\nand deposited a passport in the embassy and then went home. Of course, after that I\nhad to take off my military uniform because I was not in the military any more, I\nwas discharged; although I was, up until 1956, I was considered a reserve officer in\nthe Austrian army, wa -- at that time of course, in the German army. And as a\nmatter of fact, I still have my military passport with me. And so a -- twice -- we --\nwe lived in a -- an apartment building and [indecipherable] apartment building\nnear the American -- well, wi -- American embassy as a m -- as a matter of fact, a\nnew American embassy after the war is located within a block, walking distance\nfrom where I used to live. And w -- our concierge was very cognizant of the\nsituation and always informed us whenever the Gestapo came by to inquire about\nAugust 12, 2002\nthe Jewish residents, to notify us that they were here. And so whenever that\nhappened, my parents of course were safe because my father had the contract with\nthe Germans to be in his office until September the first, but for me, I had to leave\nthe city twice. And just went to the far -- far suburbs of do -- Vienna, and stayed\nthere for about a week, then I came back again. Well, finally I received my visa in\nJune of 1938 and packed everything up, wh-what I wanted. And of course I could\nnot leave Vienna with more than eight dollars in my pocket to go to United States.\nAnd of course my father, being in a bank, he arranged prior, long prior, my --\nbefore my departure, to have money picked up in -- in twa -- in Paris when I\narrived there from Vienna, which I did, was very lucky. Of course, everything --\nbefore I left Vienna, my passage was completely paid and taken care of from\nFrance to the United States. And of course I was concerned about my parents,\nwhat -- what will happen to them, but luckily they were -- they got the visa to\nYugoslavia. It\u2019s only for about I think six weeks. And then they traveled to Italy\nand from Italy they went to France. And in the meantime, my uncle who had --\nwho lived in Philadelphia, and he had contacts with the State department, and\narrangements were made that my parents take a -- buy a round trip ticket -- of\ncourse sh -- that\u2019s the only thing they could buy, a round trip ticket to the West\nIndies, a cruise to the West Indies and arrive in Cuba. And so naturally my\nAugust 12, 2002\nparents bought s-some cruise tickets in Paris, and they left France on that cruise\nship in 1940. And they cruised and of -- when they arrived in -- in ha -- in\nSantiago de Cuba, the port, the representative of the American embassy in -- in\nHavana that greeted them and took them off the ship. And my parents stayed in\nHavana for -- until April of 1941, when they finally got their visa to enter the\nUnited States, they came. So that is my story.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Ma -- my mother was the driving force really, because my father s-said -- I -- I\nhad nothing to say anyway. I was a good boy. But my -- my father just took it easy,\nhe said, well, everything will be go -- will go back to normal, nothing will happen.\nAnd -- but my mother was the driving force, and she -- she really did a fine job to\nget us all out. As a matter of fact, there\u2019s a very interesting -- very interesting story.\nSe-September -- September first came, and of course --",
        "A: 1938. And my father left -- on that day, he left for the railro -- for the railroad\nstation. I don\u2019t know what for, he went downtown on something else also. And\nluckily, he called home to tell my mother something, and my mother said, don\u2019t\ncome home any more. And the reason was is while my father was away, a knock\non the door, and a couple men standing out in front of the door and then my mother\nsays, can I help you? And they said, I would like to -- we would like to talk to Mr.\nHilsberg. So my mother said, well, Mr. Hilsberg is downtown for a -- I don\u2019t\nknow what -- well, when is he coming home? So my mother says, well, I really\ndon\u2019t know how long he\u2019s going to stay downtown. He said, well we -- we\u2019d like\nto talk to him. So my mother replied -- said, well you know that we are leaving\ntoday. So he said yes, we know, but we still like to talk to Mr. Hilsberg before he\nleave. So that was it and luckily my father called in the meantime. My mother said,\ndon\u2019t come home. I\u2019Il just lock the door and I\u2019Il leave the key with my neighbors\nand say goodbye to everything. I\u2019ll meet you at the railroad station. And that\u2019s\nwhat happened and that\u2019s how they got out.",

So we ha -- I had one uncle in -- in California, and so\neverything was sent -- all the crates were sent to California. So --",
        "A: Yes, yes. As a matter -- that was good question, I\u2019m glad that you asked me.\nWhat happened is when the word came that maybe -- that the Germans may wind\nup and enter the -- the -- Austria, that\u2019s when he felt that he better transfer some of\nthe -- the money, the family money, as a matter of fact, to Paris, to the bank, which\nis -- was the main branch there.",

It was a little -- a home right on a lake,\nand that lake became an ocean. As a matter of fact, when I came over on the ship\nacross the ocean to the United States, I went through a storm. And I just\nremembered that moment when that hurricane came over New Hampshire and\nthat little lake became a -- became an ocean. And it was really very tough to get out\nbecause luckily the summer home was not hit by any trees, but trees were falling\nall over the place. As a matter of fact, the next day, my uncle and I, we had to\nmove tree trunks in order to get out to the main road from the house. So it was\nquite an excitement for me. I -- I -- in a way I enjoyed it, but yet I felt very sorry\nfor all the damage I saw in the way home from New Hampshire to Philadelphia.",

And I just -- I\u2019m always\nup for some -- always up -- ready to do something else, something different. And I\nhad a -- a interview with one of the finest voice teachers in Vienna at that time.\nAugust 12, 2002\nAnd he said, my God, I want you to be my student. And he -- I started to take\nsinging lessons. And then he transferred me to his assistant, a Bulgarian man, and I\nstudied voice and ca -- actually continued studying voice when I came to\nPhiladelphia, I went to the Curtis Institute and studied voice there. In the\nmeantime also, naturally, I wanted to be independent so my uncle got me a job in\nPhiladelphia.",
        "A: Well, he was -- had connections with the city solicitor of -- of Philadelphia,\nand of -- my first job we came -- we came back from the hurricane experience in\nSeptember of -- September of 1938, which was the 27\" of September 1938, and --\nand he -- this man got me an interview with a person in the ci -- in city hall who\nhad something to do with the library. Apparently they needed some translators. So\nI went up there, was -- had an interview at nine o\u2019clock in the morning and we had\na very pleasant meeting. And the last question he asked me, he said to me, are you\na citizen of the United States? I said no, but I -- I already -- already applied for my\n-- for my second papers. I do -- I do have them. So he said to me, I don\u2019t care. And\nhe pounded his fist on his table and said I don\u2019t care if even President Roosevelt is\ngoing to ask me to give you a job, I will not. That was that. That was my\nexperience, my first experience trying for a job in -- in the United States. So I\nAugust 12, 2002\nwent back home and I told my -- my uncle about it. He says well, let me call Mr.\nSharfson, and he called him. So the guy says to him, well, don\u2019t worry about it,\nPll get him an -- a job. And sure enough, two days later I had an interview in the\nLitz department store in Philadelphia in the advertising department. And so I -- I -\n- | worked there until I went to the service in February of \u201941. And thit -- the what I\ndid is, since I was musically inclined and knowledgeable in a way, I -- the\ndepartment store had, every Sunday morning, a two hour classical music -- a -- a\nmusic hour, two hours. And I was in charge to arrange the program every Sunday\nmorning. So that was a nice, interesting job for me to do. And of course I had to be\ncareful, using the -- the time properly with -- with the commercials and so on. And\non the side I have oth-other duties like filing and doing things in the advertising\ndepartment. So I -- I liked that, I -- I enjoyed it very much, and --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nAugust 12, 2002\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Well, so as I -- as I was saying, I was proud to make my ow -- have my own\nmoney and do as I pleased. And in the mean -- also, I continued taking my lessons,\nsinging lessons at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. And then in Octob -- was it\nOctober or November of 1940, Congress drafted th-the bill for conscriptions. And\nat that time when -- you had to go to the draft board and report, and -- and they\ngave you a number when you -- when -- the numb -- yeah, the number was a\nnumber -- if you had a low number that means that you -- they would call you for\nduty in a -- in a short time. An-And unfortunately, I -- I had an -- well f -- actually\nfortunately I had a low number. And it was, of course, winter of \u201940 - \u201941, and in\nthose days, of course, you only served for one year. That -- that\u2019s the time period.\nSo I liked having had the experience in the military in Austria. Of course, I was\nAugust 12, 2002\naware that the summertime, especially the summertime in the Amer -- in the\nAmerican camps, I -- I found out were located, most of them in -- in the beginning\nof the -- the war, in -- in the south. So -- and I always hated hot weather. So I\nfigured well, if I can -- since I have a low number, I found out when they\u2019re going\nto call me, which I did and they told me, well, your number would indicate that\nyou probably will -- will be called in April or May. So I said, April or May? I said\n-- so I asked him, would -- could they take me now if I -- if I decide? But of course,\nI have to check with my boss first. He said well, 1f you want -- want to volunteer,\nwe'll take you in right now if you want to. Said no, le-let\u2019s wait. I went back to my\njob and I talked to the boss and he said fine, go. If you feel -- if you want to go\nnow, go ahead and go into the service. We\u2019ll keep the job for you. When you come\nback, I guarantee you, you will have your job back. So with that, I felt good about\nit. | went back to the draft board. That was about -- must have been about January\nand I volunteered for a year, and February 18\" of 1941, I went to the service. I was\ntaken to Fort Dix in New Jersey and I had my physical and I had interviews. I had\nthe intelligence test and during the intelligence test they asked me, do you have any\nspecial -- special unit you would like to join? So I said, well I really -- I really\ndon\u2019t care. So the -- the interviewer says, well, you have engineering background\nand you wa -- do -- what-what else did he say? Don\u2019t -- don\u2019t remember.\nAugust 12, 2002\nEngineering background and what was the other one? Oh, the military service, of\ncourse, in the Austrian Army. So wha-what would you like, engineering? I said, I\nreally don\u2019t care. I\u2019Il just go in and finish my year and that\u2019s all I\u2019m interested. So\nthey sent me to Fort Bell wa -- which is -- which is an engineer camp, and -- and |\nwent there and they put me into mapmaking. And of course, that\u2019s my -- my forte.\nI like geography and of course, in my engineering ground -- background helped me\nto learn quickly how to make maps. My math and -- and geology 1s included in --\nin that. And I -- I started out as a private in 1941, and shortly I became promoted\nand my commanding officer and the executive officer of the battalion which I-I\nwas attached to, came over to the drafting room every morning for inspection. And\nas I was sitting in my drafting table and so my commanding officer and my b --\ncompany officer st-stayed th -- I -- I was the only table, always stopped, talking to\nme. At the other tables they just passed by. He says well, how\u2019s my little refugee\nfeel today? You gained some more weight. And so came -- was in November, or --\nor must have been end of November or early December, that was December\nseventh. Yeah, it was December seventh, of course. Was December seventh, it was\nin a Sunday. A friend of mine, we took off. I got a pass to go into town. We went\nto Washington and the reason was that th-the [indecipherable] choir gave a\nconcert the Constitution Hall at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. Well, in those days,\nAugust 12, 2002\nbefore the war s -- before the United States was involved in the war, of course,\nthey -- they didn\u2019t care too much for the soldiers. And -- so we went to the\nConstitution Hall and it was all sold out, no tickets available. Otherwise in the -- in\nthe later days, after the war started, well they gave you free tickets and everything\nwas available for the -- for the u -- United States soldier. So we wound up in the --\nwent to the Library of Congress to play some chess. But five o\u2019clock was the time\nfor the Library of Congress to close, so we returned the chess set, and the guy\nbehind the counter said, okay, good luck boys, won\u2019t see you any more. I said,\nwhat -- what do you mean, won\u2019t see you any more? That was five o\u2019clock in the\nafternoon, December 7\", 1941. So he said, well don\u2019t you know that Pearl Harbor\nwas -- was bombed? Pearl Harbor was bombed? What? We went out -- well, it\nwas really chaos in -- in the city of Washington. There were army trucks all over,\npicking up all the soldiers from th -- on the streets and taking them back to the\ncamps. Well, we decided we\u2019re not going to get caught. We went through side\nstreets and though alleys and we wound up at Basil\u2019s delicatessen on\nPennsylvania Avenue and E Street, and we figured we\u2019ll have the last good\nJewish meal. And we came back -- we took the bus back to the camp, to Fort\nBelvoir and my God, everybody was packing, everybody was ready to go. But\nAugust 12, 2002\nluckily our outfit was attached to general headquarters in Washington, so -- and of\ncourse we were not involved in that. So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s my story.",
        "A: Well, it was s-secrecy all around, especially in -- in my job because we -- we\nstarted to be involved in preparations for -- for war maps and invasion maps and\nthat sort of stuff. So naturally, secrecy was all around us.",
        "A: I was still waiting for my citizenship. As a matter of fact, I did not become a\ncitizen until April of 1943.",
        "A: No, not -- not at all. I do know one thing, that we were very busy in doing our\njob, and there was little time left for other st -- things to do. And we had very little\nconterwi -- of course we -- we wer -- we were told to have as little contact as --\ncontact as possible with the outside.\nAugust 12, 2002",
        "A: Yes, we were -- we were Stateside, and working pretty hard. We -- I myself put\nin anywhere from 10 to 12 hours a day to prepare all the maps necessary for the --\nfor north Africa especially at that -- at that time. And in 1942, when things became\nmore and more involved for the United States, our general headquarters decided to\nsend us overseas to be attached to a general headquarters in Europe. And at that\ntime also there was -- they started to prepare for the European invasion, and that\nwould be a good location to do what we have to do. Unfortunately, or fortunately,\nwhichever, I was still not a citizen, and even though my commanding officer did\nhis utmost to take me along, the war department -- at that time war department\nwould not allow me to go because it was too dangerous if I were captured as a -- I\nwas still, more or less I -- an Austrian, or an enemy, anyway. And so they kept me\nhere and they formed a new cadre for a new battalion for mapmaking, because they\nneeded more than one, so of course I was left back in the United States and we\nformed a new ou-outfit. And -- and we -- we put all these newcomers through basic\ntraining like I used to go through, in the beginning. And -- and we worked. We\u2019 re\nstill attached to general headquarters 1n th -- Washington. And then come 1940 --\n\u201943 -- of course I was a citizen in April, but in November of 1943, our out -- the\nnew outfit was sent to north Africa, and that\u2019s where I left for overseas in\nNovember of 1943. And I stayed in north Africa for about a year. We took over a\nAugust 12, 2002\nlittle French si -- town, little ti -- cher -- Cherchell. And we set up shop there and\ndid a lot of work for the invasion of southern France with the seventh army, and\nalso worked for General Mark Clark in -- in Italy. And started preparing, as a\nmatter of fact, started preparing to work -- make military maps of Austria. And of\ncourse, I was in charge, naturally. But we did not finish 1t because we were asked\nto be sent back to United States and back to the Pacific, and we went to Hawaii.\nWe attached to Pacific Ocean headquarters and started to work on all the invasion\nmaps of the islands and Japan and so on. And as a matter of fact, on -- on V -- not\nso V -- no. Yeah, V-J day, that\u2019s when the -- when Japan finally gave up. On V-J\nday the war didn\u2019t end for our outfit, because it just so happened that we worked\non Tokyo bay and General mar -- MacArthur would not move in with the\nMissouri into the bay, unless he has all the information available to him. He just\ndidn\u2019t trust these guys, naturally. And so we -- for us the war wasn\u2019t over until two\nweeks after V-J day. And we finally were finished and that was in \u201945. And I was\ndischar -- discharged in November of 1945. And when my wife picked me up from\nFort Mead, she told me that there was a letter from the war department waiting for\nme. And of course, I -- at that point I did not have any idea what I\u2019m going to do.\nAnd I -- I would not go back to Philadelphia because my wife is a Washingtonian\nAugust 12, 2002\nand she has all her family and friends here and so I decided we\u2019re going to raise a\nfamily here, in Washington area.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: The rank? Master sergeant.",
        "A: Just what I heard on -- on radio broadcasts, that\u2019s all we had at that time.",
        "A: Not on the camps, no. We knew -- we knew that there were camps, but we\ndidn\u2019t know more about it.",
        "A: Yes, yes, we knew that, yes.\nAugust 12, 2002",
        "A: Yes. But that\u2019s -- that\u2019s just about all the -- they were just short reports, there\nwere no details.",
        "A: It was -- I believe -- I think 1t was in April of 1942. I -- friend of mine and I, we\nhad the early evening off, and we went to the movies in a ge -- in a -- 1n Fort\nBelvoir. And th -- we were at the early show and the show was over, I think it was\nnine o\u2019clock in the evening and my friend, he always went to these dances. They\nbrought in girls from the Jewish community center or from other organizations to\ndance with the boys, entertain them. And on that particular day there was some\nJewish org -- something of -- I think it was from the Jewish community center,\nwere sent to Fort Belvoir. And my friend says to me, let\u2019s go. I -- I want to go. He\nusually went to these affairs, I didn\u2019t. And so he said, come on, don\u2019t be a\nspoilsport. I said okay, Pll do you a favor. So we walked into the hall where were -\n- they were dancing and a buddy of mine was working the record player. So he saw\nme and he called me up on the stage and said, come on, let me dance while you --\nif you want to work. I said, sure, sure, I'll ta -- I'll take over, I'll play the records.\nAnd for the rest of the evening, was almost until about 10 o\u2019clock or so, I played\nrecords. And the dancing -- and I -- I just looked and enjoyed watching the people.\nAugust 12, 2002\nAnd -- and all of a sudden -- it was the last dance, all of a sudden I see a girl\ncoming by the stage right -- right below me and sh-she had a do -- red -- red dress\non, or was it a jacket or something, but she just hit my eye. So I said, I want to\ndance with her, and I jumped off the stage. And I asked for the dance and that --\nwhoever [indecipherable] passed it on, and we were dancing. And I said -- I said\nto her, my first words -- words were, where have you been all evening? So one\nword led to another and as a matter of fact I -- I was supposed to, since I was in\ncharge, I was supposed to bring the records back -- back to the barracks. So of\ncourse, was late at night and -- and the records were heavy. So it just so happened\nthat my wife-to-be had a car with all the girls in there. So I said, do you mind to\ndrop me off with the -- those records? So she said, I really don\u2019t have any room. I\nreally have full of -- they had, you know, she had about a half a dozen girls in th --\nin the car. So, in those days they had the standing boards on the cars, on the old\ncars. So she said, if you want to, you can stand on a -- on a -- on a boar -- ona\nbody board, or whatever they called it and I\u2019ll take you back to the barracks. So --\nso she took me back to the barracks and before I -- I left, I said, can I have your\nphone number\u2019? So she says, I\u2019m in the phone book. Just like that. And that\u2019s the --\nthat\u2019s the beginning of the story and here we are almost 60 years later.\nAugust 12, 2002",

And kept us busy, it was very interesting work, very\nchallenging work, tiring at times. And of course with the revoluti -- revolution of\nthe computers, things became easier to handle, but yet, they were even more\ncomplicated than before. I personally was very pleased with -- with my life during\nthat period. I feel that I accomplished a lot and I was also re-rewarded with nice\nreports.

They -- they seemed to feel that th -- we\u2019re Jewish. They did not go out of\ntheir way to help us or talk to us, give us service and so on. But I also must say that\nI left in \u00b038 and I came back in \u201971, that the city itself has not changed a bit.\nEverything 1s the same. The streetcars are numbered, they go in the same places\nI\u2019m used to, the buses, nothing has changed. And I was glad to see that, although\nAugust 12, 2002\nthe people were a little bit sour. I don\u2019t know why. Just because I was there,\nmaybe, I don\u2019t know. But anyway, the second visit we had is when my\ngranddaughter spent her college semester in -- in Florence, and we all visited then.\nAnd that was really a -- the best time I\u2019ve had with my children and grandchildren,\nwhen we went to Vienna. We met them -- we visited the first -- well, we went to o\n-- Vienna first and then my daughter and her husband and their three daughters\njoined us in Vienna when they came up from Florence. And we spent eight days\nin Vienna and [| took them through the whole city, and I took them to the\nelementary school where I used to go to. But -- this 1s the nice thing about Vienna\nis -- compared to the United States, they\u2019d rather destroy and build new in the\nUnited States, but in Vienna they -- they\u2019re trying to -- to keep it the way it is and\nmaintain it properly. But anyway, [indecipherable] elementary school and my\nyoungest granddaughter was a -- I think about seven or eight years old, and of\ncourse she just enjoyed it. I took her to the classroom where I was sitting for my --\nmy sec -- my second grade. And as a matter of fact 1t was a Saturday afternoon. Of\ncourse, school are still there Saturday -- Saturday morning, half d -- half day school\non Saturday, so we just arrived there when the children left, and I was waiting until\nthey are all out, and then I walked in with my family and took them into the school\nbuilding. And in the classroom, one of the classroom the teacher was still there and\nAugust 12, 2002\nsays, I told her, but she just couldn't believe it. She couldn\u2019t believe it. And I took\nher to the apartment where we used to live and of course that was a really high\nmoment in my life, because I -- I noticed the children in my family were so\ninterested in seeing where I grew up. And -- and the third time was in 1990. We\ntook a talk tour to ma -- eastern Europe and we wound up in Vienna for the third\ntime. And as a matter of fact, I did visit Auschwitz when I was in Poland and it\nwas devastating really, even now. And I was in Krakow and I was in\n[indecipherable] Budapest and then I would up in Vienna. And in those -- as a\nmatter of fact, I didn\u2019t mention that in the second visit to Vienna with my family, I\n-- that was in -- in ninet -- in 1990 and that was a complete turnaround as far as\nbeing a visitor there. People seemed to be very polite, very helpful, very pleasant\nand it was almost like being 1n any other city in the United States, really. But if\ncourse, in the back of -- of our head there was still -- still the past, naturally. And\nbif -- the third time, just a few years ago, and it was the same. I enjoyed it while I\nwas there for about three days. And that\u2019s it.\nAugust 12, 2002",
        "A: Unfortunately, I lost all my family in Poland. Had family in Warsaw, had\nfamily in L\u00e9dz, I had family in Krakow, I had family in Belgrade, and they were\nall gone.

He was married at that time already.\nAnd -- but in turn his wife found out that her father survived -- I don\u2019t -- I think it\nwas Auschwitz, and lived in Tel Aviv. So naturally they decided that they\u2019re going\nto Tel Aviv rather than come to the United States. And so at least found out that\none survivor. Then, a second survivor I found out is -- I -- I -- I -- throughout the\nyears, since that time, up until the -- this moment, I tried to find out what happened\nto them, and I got in touch with the international Red Cross. And through them I\nfound out that my uncle, who lived -- they lived in L\u00e9dz, he died in the ghetto,\nLodz ghetto. But my aunt and their son wound up in Auschwitz, and of course,\nunfortunately my -- my -- my aunt -- my aunt, she just didn\u2019t survive the camp in\nAuschwitz. But my cousin, who was then in his late teens, they sent him to\nDachau. And I found out through the Red Cross that he was liberated in Dachau\nand they gave me all the information available, but they could not find out for me\nAugust 12, 2002\nwhat happened after he was liberated.

So he had the easier rap -- rapport with\nthe people -- with our school friends, and he saw some of them and -- and he found\nout that some died during the war, were killed during the war and other survived\nand they just make a bare living, which I don\u2019t really care about the ones who\nsurvived, truthfully, as far as I\u2019m concerned, even though I didn't have any bad\nexperiences during our time in school, they were -- they were fine. It\u2019s very\npossible that they -- they felt bad about it, too, but after all, they had to survive, and\nthey had to do whatever they had to do. I do have one experience myself. The first\n-- first visit in Vienna, I noticed that a school friend of mine in high school, he was\nthe -- the son of one of the big precision instrument stores in Vienna. And when he\ncame back, his -- the -- his -- his father\u2019s store was located nearby where I lived,\nwhere I grew up, so we came by and I noticed the name -- same name still on there,\nso I figured must be the son who is in business. And so just of curiosity I walked\nAugust 12, 2002\nin. He was a Gentile. And I walked in and I w -- I recognized him immediately,\nand he was busy with a customer so I stood on the side waiting until he was\nfinished. No sooner the customer walked out, he turns around, he says, Norbert,\nwhere have you been? Where have you been; that -- that hit me. He should have\nknown. But anyway, well he welcomed me and -- back, and let\u2019s get together. And\nI said, I\u2019m sorry, I -- it\u2019s my last day and I wanted to show my wife some other\nthings. So that -- that -- that was my personal experience going back to Vienna.",
        "A: I really -- I hope they did, but I have no -- no contact.",
        "A: We have no disappointment really. And it\u2019s accentuated what I always thought\nabout the United States, because my original plans is -- of course, Hitler helped\nme -- my original plans was to -- to go to the United States and live there anyway.\nSo I just -- just assimilated immediately, just like I -- I always lived in the United\nStates.",
        "A: Well, Americans unfortunately, that\u2019s one thing I -- oh, anyway, I was going to\nsay, Americans forget too easily, and I feel that we are -- little by little we -- we\nforget about September 11\", 2001. And I was very, very disturbed about what\nhappened that day, and I just -- I still can\u2019t believe that we have people in this\nworld who -- who do such things in a civilized society. I -- as far as I\u2019m concerned\nthey\u2019re the scum of the earth",
        "A: All right. My parents settled in Manhattan. My father tried to get into -- back\ninto the banking business, but he was not very successful at that time, I don\u2019t know\nwhy, but at that time I guess, they just said they didn\u2019t hire anybody and maybe --\nmaybe his English was not too good, I have no idea, or the -- they both spoke\npretty well. So -- but he was always a very handy man. He made furniture and I\nbuilt radios with him. And so he found himself a position in a -- during the war, he\nfound himself a position in a naval ordinance factory in Brooklyn. And he worked\nhimself up to an inspector. And he worked hard. He had to get up early to get the\nsubway to Brooklyn, and came home and he was tired. But he made a nice living.\nAugust 12, 2002\nAnd of course my mother started to give piano lessons and she was very successful\nin that, throughout the years.",
        "A: No. I -- I do remember during our stay in north Africa, in that little town of\nCherchell -- no, no, I\u2019m sorry, not to Cherchell, it was Affrevielle. During the --\nwe -- we became very friendly there, mostly Jewish -- Jewish families living in that\nlittle town who escaped from the mainland. And we have quite -- we had a few\nJewish fellows in our outfit and we became friendly with these people. They --\nthey invited us for Friday night Shabbas and Saturday and went to the synagogue,\nand -- but we also helped the people, the local people celebrate Easter. And so one\nof my close buddies, he played the piano, so he played the organ in the church,\nthey didn't have any organist there. And I sang the Ave Maria. And well, we made\nthe local people very happy, and I enjoyed that.",
        "A: Now, yes, yeah.",
        "A: Well, first of all, celebrate my 80\" -- 88\" birthday and secondly and most\nimportant, cel-celebrate my 60\" anniversary, which is only a few -- couple -- two\nor three weeks away from now. And hopefully, hopefully I -- I will enjoy to see my\nAugust 12, 2002\ngreat-grandchildren grow up. Maybe I\u2019Il see them in school yet. I -- I hope so. I do\nmy best. They -- they keep me alive, they keep me going.",
