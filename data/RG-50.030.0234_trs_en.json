        "Q: Avi, you...you've said that after the Nazi invasion in June of 1941, that you went from the\nfrying pan to the fire. What do you mean by that?",
        "A: No, no. I was a Zionist. At the outbreak of the war between Germany and Poland, I\nattended the Zionist World Congress, the Ist Zionist World Congress in Geneva,\nSwitzerland, which was the last Congress before the Holocaust. This Congress came to\namend on the outbreak of the war between Germany and Poland and then Professor Heim\nWeizman (ph), then president of the Zionist organization, his last moving words as a\nconverse I remember till today...we have to...we have to bring it, the Congress to an end.\nWho knows when we'll met, where we'll meet and who we'll meet, and these was very,\nvery meaningful, especially to me and not only to me, so I went back to Lithuania at that\ntime and uh when I came to Lithuania, it was 1939. The Congress in August and the next\nJune 1940, the Soviets occupied Lithuania and when the Soviets occupied Lithuania, so I\nwas arrested. Not only myself. I was a member of the Zionist Central Committee. At\nthe Congress I was the youngest delegate, the youngest delegate, and nevertheless we\nwere the the general Zionist Youth Movement and I was the chairman of the...so we\ninsisted we were fighters. All the time we were fighters. To have a seat on the Central\nCommittee of the General Zionist in Lithuania, so I became a member of the Central\nZionist Committee in Lithuania and when the Ger...when the Communists, when the\nSoviets occupied Lithuania, they took under arrest the the leaders of the Zionist\norganization, but they took also even arrest myself and what...what I cannot understand to\nthis very day, they interrogated me and they questioned me. You were at the World\nGathering...they didn't say Congress...World Gathering, Zionist. Disclose to us what\na...whata __....1t means what a...uh what...they say what I am...did you make...what a\nuh secret...secret plan did you make with Professor Weizman, did I make with Professor\nWeizman against the Soviet Union? And they didn't believe my innocence and I laughed\nwhen...when I laughed I got immediately smacked in the face. While I'm laughing...you\nshould answer when you're being questioned, so I said I don't even know Professor\nWeizman, so he says you are lying like a dog. That is an expression... expression in\nRussian, . You are lying like a dog. You were...you were at the at the\nWorld Gathering of Zionists. Professor Weizman was the president of the Gathering and\nyou say that you don't know Weizman. __\u2014,_\u2014,_\u2014_\u2014si\u00abjw.-: So I Said everybody knows\nWeizman, Professor Weizman, but Professor Weizman to this very day doesn't know that\nthere exists such aman by the name of Avraham __... But it it didn't help. I should\ndisclose to them what plans of destruction did I have with Professor Weizman against the\nSoviet Union. Well this is to show you only one second. I as a Zionist and\nprofessor...my my patron, my famous and beloved patron, Professor Sigmung Belaski\n(ph) who was a famous professor at the University of , which 1s now\n, after the first revolution, he run away from from ___ and he came to\nKovno, Lithuania and there he was admitted as a professor of civil law although he was a\nJew, although he didn't speak Lithuanian at all, but he was world famous and he wrote\nseveral monumental books on the civil war in uh in copyright and so on, and I was lucky\nenough to write my thesis, my...you know...what you call it in other languages, the\ndoctorate, I wrote with Professor Belaski, and when I...when I passed all the exams and\nuh I was waiting for the evaluation of my thesis that they submitted to Professor Belaski\nand then I was invited at his...at his law offices and then he asks me what do you want to\ndo with yourself when you graduate law? I said Professor, I want to be a lawyer. You\nknow what does it mean to be a lawyer. It means...a lawyer means to be twenty-four\nhours a day a lawyer. So said Professor, how could it be? Even a lawyer has to sleep a\nlittle. Yes. This is exactly what I wanted to tell you, that in your dreams, you dream\nabout the mistakes you've done this day and don't repeat it the next day. This 1s a lawyer,\nand when I...several times he asked me and you know and it is very difficult. It's\nvery...So he said are you sure you want to be lawyer. I said yes, Professor. But I wanted\nto know what is the result of my...of my thesis. I didn't know it yet. So then he takes out\nfrom his drawer my thesis, and he hands it over and I see there was written excellent and\nI daughing) remember the thesis was \u2014\u2014s and_~\u2014_\u2014_sin the Roman and Russian War.\n(Laughter) It was in 1933. So then he says are you sure you want to be lawyer.\nTomorrow come to my office and you'll work with me, and this was in 19...by the end of\n1933 because in order to work as a lawyer, you had to to have six months preparatory in\nthe court, but then in '39, the Lithuanian minister of justice, he was not...let's say Nazis\nand the Nazis themselves, and he picked out my professor and myself and they didn't\nallow any Jews to be uh to be accepted in court even like practitioners, but I was lucky. I\nwas a member of the , amember of the movement and there was in\nrelations, permanent relations with the Lithuanian National Sports Club , and\nthe manof _ was a...also at the faculty of law, , and he graduated the very\nsame month like I.

Would you engage me as your practitioner at your court? We graduated the\nsame month, so he...he couldn't... he couldn't refuse. He said well, it's against all\ninstructions I have, but simply I cannot refuse you. We were so many years in the sports\nfield. We were four years at the same law school, and I just can't refuse. I take the risk.\nSo I I worked with him for a half a year in the...1n the...in this...in the civil court and only\nthen it was I could start practicing at Professor Belaski's office. You understand. And\nhere again Professor Belaski was a great, a great Jewess. In addition, he was a man of\nesprit, of talent, of of spirit.

Don't...don't...and he was the best lawyer in Lithuania. He used to\nappear mostly in the Supreme Court of Lithuania and in the Supreme Military Court and\nwhat is important for my beloved patron, he himself escaped from the revolution, from\nthe Communist, escaped to Lithuania, but here in Lithuania, he appeared in the military\ncourts as counsel for the Communists who were were were 1n...brought to trial for\nbelonging to the Communist Party, leave alone if they would have done some sabotage or\nsomething like that, but the very fact that they belonged to the Communist Party, it was\nenough to give them twelve years in jail. And he defended them. He defended them and\nhe explained it clearly. He he...what he told me a lawyer must be twenty-four hours a\nlawyer. If somebody goes wrong...have done injustice to somebody, you have to defend.\nEvery...a murderer has a right to get defense. A lawyer should defend him, for the for the\ncourt is to decide whether he is guilt or not guilty, but he has the right to defense, and the\nsame goes for the Communists.",
        "Q: Avraham, tell me...we were talking about writing and how he wrote. When did you start\nto write your diary?",
        "A: Yes. Well, on the 22nd of June, the war break out. Early in the morning we hear the\nbombardment and over the radio it was war. The very simple word of war took me and I\nwas all the time attached to the radio and then the Kovno was bombarded and all...first of\nall the air...the airport and then the military and then all the town was in flames, so we\ntried to escape and the the Russians, the Soviets were taken by surprise and they rushed\nout of Kovno. They left the prison closed without any guards, and the prisoners went at\nnight, found that there were no no guards and so from inside they break through and they\nwent to to freedom, but the...I and everybody tried to get any vehicle to run away from\nthe bombardment and I was at that time with my sister at my sister's home and my sister\nand my my brother-in-law were waiting for a relative of my brother-in-law to take them\nafter midnight with a wagon with horses because when when...if you would go in in\ndaytime, they would take them away, uh these these horses and save them for the\nmilitary and while waiting there, twelve o'clock, one o'clock, I was so much impressed\nand overwhelmed of the of the of the Germans. It was just terrible, so I found a\na sheet of paper on the table of my brother-in-law and I started to write, and I have it with\nme here, for two pages on both sides I have written from twelve to two thirty after\nmidnight when the man came with his wagon to take us out of town and this is the first\nentry in in my diary and I have it here with me. And then I tried to escape and I did not\nsucceed. On the way what I...I took a bicycle and I almost let's say uh seventy miles I\nmade by bicycle towards the frontier with with Russia but in the meantime the Germans\ncaught us up and I had to go back. The story of going back to Kovno 1s a story that is\nradiate with me for another book, that is not include in this diary.",
        "Q: Why? What happened?",
        "A: Because immediately on each and every corner, from each and every , Lithuanian\npartisans, so-called partisans, they attacked Jews. They took off from them every\nvaluable. They took the money. The Lithuanians didn't give...didn't sell bread for those\nretreating and so I saw that it is dangerous to go on the highway, so we...I left the\nhighway and I went through the fields, you know, through gardens, forests, all around. It\ntook me three days to go back to Kovno. Three days and three nights and this is a story.\nI could be ten times killed because the bombardments were without end. On the way to\nthe frontier and back, and back. It was every time in the , used to live\nthe... with the Red Army soldiers were taking with families, with vehicles, with\nwagons, with pushcarts, by foot and myself, I am bicylying.",
        "Q: And you were by yourself?",
        "A: By myself, yes. I will tell you why by myself. I was married then, but to be where of the\nopinion that the only in danger are the men that the Germans might take them to work for\nthe army, and therefore the men used to run away. Others who had to _ full families,\nso I went and I had left my first wife at home because her parents and so on, but I didn't\nsucceed. And so it took me three days to come back to Kovno and these three days, I\nwrote fifty-four pages how...what happened to me because I went...everyplace I could\nencounter a a Lithuanian extremist, fascist would kill on the spot. I didn't have the\nmoney to pay them for a piece of bread. Before they used to give bread and milk, the\nLithuanian, you know. It's no problem...bread...eat. Everybody would offer you bread\nand milk. But then they paid and then they didn't take the rubles. They asked for\ncoins...uh golden coins and so on. It was aterrible _, so finally I...to cut a long story\nshort...I finally came to the outskirts of Kovno and it was in...1n Kovno there was a\nfamous...a a famous and most neglected suburb of Slobodka (ph). The Slobodka is a\ncenter...world center of scholars of . But it was a very much\nneglected suburb and I was supposed to pass this suburb and come to my place. I lived\non the hill, so when I came in, I was entirely exhausted. I was full of dust. I didn't wash\nfor three days, leave alone to shave, so I went...I wheeled a uh...I saw a well so I asked\nfrom from a distance the Lithuanian woman and she allowed me to wash myself in the\nwell, so she uh tell me that they should come near to her and then she disclosed to me that\nher son is a partisan, and if he will see me he will kill me, so she let me in somewhere in\naina hiding place andI wash myself \u2014_\u2014s and I say now tell which way 1s now to go to\nto Slobodka, a suburb of Kovno, you know, . She said don't go. Don't dare to go\nto Kovno, to Slobodka. A night before they massacred a thousand Jews in in Slobodka,\nyes, from 25th to the 26th of June, 1941.",
        "Q: When she told you that, could you believe what she said?",
        "A: I didn't believe but she told me don't go because you will be killed, so it was enough for\nme. So she said the best thing what you can do, you cross the River Yemen (ph). There\nis a boat. You will...you are on a boat and it will take you over there and then you go up\nto the...to...and this is what I've done, and this is the way I rescued my life. And when I\ncame...came back home and uh it was entirely a different Kovno. The Jews were closed\nthemselves up behind the...behind the curtains and closed doors. They didn't go to\nthe...to the shops and to their businesses because the Lithuanians already started to to\nattack Jews whenever they could met them in the...in the street. They dragged them from\ntheir coattails, dumped them from buildings, from their apartments. They used to rape\nwomen and it was a terrible situation that that was absolutely...they used to go...the\nstreets of Kovno were full of groups of uh partisans leading groups of Jews in a circle\nand either to prison and when the prison was full, they them to certain uh\ncenters and their fortress...the fortresses. Kovno was around with nine fortresses.",
        "Q: Did you see this? Did you see them rounding the different...?",
        "A: Of course I've seen it, because I am not a man to close myself behind...behind the shelter.\nSo I went out in the street and I wanted to know what's going on, what is the community,\nwhat is this, what is that? So I...so I was told that the chief rabbi's home, not at his office\nbecause the Bolsheviks (ph) annulled all the Jewish institutions at the time of the\noccupation of the...so I went to the chief rabbi's office and there I could learn that some\ncommunity leaders are uh are are get together and are consulting, exchanging\ninformation, seeing what can be done, and then I I used to come almost everyday to that\nplace and when the the they organized...when the...when the the...when the order came\nthat Jews have to...the expulsion of Jews from Kovno to the ghetto, latest until 15th of\nOctober...of uh August 1941. That means within a month's time, all Jews from Kovno,\napproximately thirty-five thousand but you know, five thousand was killed in the in the\nunrest before that, so they should be...should be in the ghetto, and on this 15th of August,\n1930...1941, Kovno should be Judenrad (ph)...clean of Jews.",
        "Q: How did you hear of that order?",
        "A: This was on all...1t was publicized on all the walls, by radio, in the paper, in the daily\npaper. It was not a secret, but you see I am always have read and read. I took one or two\nor three with me in the pocket, and this is why I could submit it uh present it to the to the\nfellow who called him ,a Lithuanian mayor who was nominated by the\nNazis as mayor of Kovno and when he was brought to trial and he said I laughed so about\nJews, and he...what they talking about...so I presented to the uh to the Federal Court\njudge this publication, expulsion...uh uh all the number one from the 10th of July, 1941,\nsaying that the Jews must leave Kovno, old and young, men and women, Lithuanian\ncitizens or Lithuanian citizens, whatever Jew, must go to the ghetto, signed by\nand by the the Lithuanian commandant of Kovno.",
        "Q: How did people react to this? How did you react?",
        "A: Wait a minute. So this is what...at the at the rabbi's...l was a young man. I only full\nof curiosity because of being, you know, maybe being the Russians public.\nYou know, they say that there are two kinds of men. People are divided in two, in two\nsorts, two kinds...whatever you say. One who have . It means they have\nan appetite to live, to live in this society. You see, being active in the society means\nthey...in Latin . This is one group of people. And the other group of people who\nare , amen...a man is a wolf, to to...who don't love people, you see. I belong\nto the first category. And how, as I could prove with what I have done before, many\nyears before and uh especially in the war time.",
        "Q: So when you heard that order...",
        "A: So when I heard that order, I uh I uh...we we went uh as I said three lawyers, young\nlawyers, and when it was organized a commission...wait a minute...then one day, on the\n7th of August, 1941...no, on the 7th of July, 1941...that's more precise in my book...a\nGestapo officer came to the to the chief rabbi's home to take him to the Gestapo, but he\nwas very ill. He had a stomach uh trouble and there wasa___\u2014_\u2014_\u2014___ going inside this uh\nhis body to digest, you see, so he showed them that he cannot move, so they told him\ngive us names of uh of public community leaders, so he gave them three names. One was\nthe Garfunkle (ph) who was a member of the parliament. His underworld was Jacob\nGoldberg, a also a lawyer who was the head of the volunteers for the Lithuanian\nindependence for a officer, and the third one was Dr. Rabinovitch (ph) who was a...he\nstudied in Germany and and he was well-acquainted. He was a physician. So they went\nand took all three of them separately and brought them to...they didn't tell them where\nthey're taking them, what they take them, what for...nothing. They just brought them to\nthe Gestapo and there where were they summoned before going into the chief of the\nGestapo. The chief asked either anyone among these three are rabbis and they say no, so\nordered they should bring a rabbi or two so they went and brought two rabbis. One rabbi\nwas the chap...chaplain, the chief chaplain in the Lithuanian army and the other was\nSchumuckler (ph), Rabbi Schumuckler from who was...became very famous\nlater and uh the Rabbi Schumuckler was quiet. The chaplain all the time say uh you\nknow, the prayer before death, yousee. ===, ~~\u2014__._ Because he was sure that they\nare taking him to death, and when they brought in they they they took them in into the\noffice, there were two gentlemen. One was a General Pole who was the commander of\nthe of the German forces in in Lithuania. The second one was uh _\u2014_\u2014__s who was the\nfurher of the Gestapo, chief of the Gestapo. And uh the general told them,\nlook. You know what's going on in the city. People are being killed. Jews are being\narrested and these...we came here to bring order and we cannot let this this situation go\non. The Lithuanians say they don't want to dwell with you, so you must go to the ghetto.\nSo uh Garfunkle who was a member of the Parliament and he was...said let us talk to the\nLithuanians. He says with which Lithuanians do you want to talk? They don't want to\ntalk to you. They don't want to live, to dwell with you. And uh but if...you have to go to\nthe ghetto and the ghetto is near_\u2014_ Slobodka and he had a map calling that all of the\narea of Slobodka should be earmarked for the ghetto so the Jews said, the commission...in\nSlobodka lived in the old times eight thousand people while in in Kovno there are thirty\nthousand Jews. How do you want to squeeze in? So he says alright. Uh you can take\nanother place. Anyhow uh uh so he says we are not authorized to give announcement\nwith regard to to being expelled from the city. We have to think and to explain to to...so\nhe says I give you time until tomorrow at ten o'clock. Bring us...1f your reply will be\npositive, I'll order that this should immediately stop, these killings and and robbing of\nfoods and raping of women...it should stop immediately and in addition, I will order to\nrelease three thousand women and children who are in in the prisons and in the fort under\narrest and this was a very great incentive to the to the to the thoughts of the Jews, and\nthen they met again at the at the rabbi's office. I was there all the time and they\ndecided...uh said that there's no way out other ways. There was no way. Not they will\nnot go. Said they will expel us, and this is...they gave...order gave that it was from the\n10th...formally the 10th of July was published the order in all in all the papers and the\nradio, on the walls. You know, there are so I took...what did I take, several, and\nwhat will maybe . And then later they gave an order that the Jews\nshould elect...should nominate an overjuder (ph). It means aa chief Jew. A chief Jew.\nAnd all these nominations Altestenrat (ph). Altestenrat means a council of elders, to\nremind you the elders of Zion. You understand? All these aimed to one, to dehumanize,\nto to degrade, to hurt the feelings of Jews and . And this was the most dramatic\nand the most historic last meeting of the Jewish community in Kovno.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: On the 4th of August, 1941, at a school, there set the most prominent leaders of the\ncommunity were still alive, because many were already killed. Approximately five\nthousand Jews were killed on the roads, in the city and so on and then they...it was\nopened...the assembly was opened by Dr. who one was very veteran leaders of\nthe Jewish community in Kovno...",
        "Q: And you were there?",
        "A: I couldn't be in the assembly with those . Because I I...you know, I I am\ntelling you I was sitting in the the rabbi's uh apartment and I listened. There was an elder\nreport the first . When they came back from...",
        "Q: The meeting...",
        "A: When they came back from the committee, I will not enlarge what happened to them.\nThey were arrested on the way from the from the Gestapo to their homes by Lithuanians\nand they were...and among these uh...there...Goldberg was a mili...a military officer, a\nhigh officer in the Lithuanian army. He tried to speak to the military commandant of\nKovno who he knew. He was in the same military school and this the night... - we\nhave to make it short, so this Goldberg went to one of his fellows who was well-known.\nThere was established a big new ministry, as 1f they would gain their independence, the\nLithuanians. They sent cables of gratitude to Hitler signed by the Archbishop _, by\nthe Bishop. __, thanking him for liberating uh Lithuania from the Soviets, you see,\nand uh so the Lithuanians were...and they immediately established a cabinet of ministers\nof Lithuania as if they would gain independence, but the Germans, they never thought of\nof giving them their independence so...",
        "Q: Right. So Avraham, tell me about the assembly, about the....",
        "A: Yes. So the assembly, the the...can we __, the chairman, and he and he spoke in very,\nvery cloudy expressions and cloudy...cloudy, false pictures of the situation\noutside...outside the school where the where the meeting took place, and he said that the\nchildren are being killed, the women are being raped, all men are being taken to slavery,\narrested and so on. There was not in the history of Jews a situation like that, but\nnevertheless there were situations, hard situations, and the Jewish people always...the\n__,the \u2014\u2014_\u2014sinthe past, the \u2014\u2014_ end was so that we survived them and he hoped that\nomens of this type Hitler will also...his end willbe the \u2014_\u2014_\u2014sin the history of Jewish\npeople, but nevertheless in describing the terrible situation of the Jews, the desperate\nsituation, he collapsed and he couldn't continue to talk. Then came the problem the order\nof the Germans 1s that the Jews have to nominate a chief Jew and if the Jews themselves\nwill not nominate a chief Jew, they will nominate themselves, and we had already the\nterrible experience of other places where they nominated, you know, a man who has no\nresponsibility, with no background, no way...so there was also among the candidates was\nDr. Elkes. The first candidate was, of course, Garfunkle who was a member of the\nParliament, the head of the Jewish faction in the Parliament, for instance that Goldberg\nwho haduh wasaaafront __, a fighter for Lithuanian independence. They had __\nbut they they absolutely refused to take over the office because they knew this is going to\nbeaservant _ and into the of the of the Germans or the Nazis, and nobody wanted to\nbe to betray his his his community, the Jewish people. More so that at that time we knew\nalready that the the chief Jew from Vilna (ph), Dr. , very famous Jewish leader,\ncommunity leader, he \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014=, so nobody wanted to take over and there was a stalemate.\nIn a way...no way out and nobody would take any office, so then stood up Schumuckler,\nRabbi Schumuckler, who was a absolutely unknown rabbi from a suburb of \u2014\u2014\u2014_s and he\nstood up but yet who was in main kind of way...everybody agreed and everybody wanted\nthat Dr. Elkes. Why Dr. Elkes, Elchanan ELkes. Because he was one of the best\nphysicians in Lithuania. He was the private physician of the German ambassador and of\nthe Soviet ambassador and of all ambassadors, so they thought that he might because of\nhis relationship being a private doctor for the German ambassador, he might have have\nsome influence and maybe do some good or avoid some hardships and so on, but of\ncourse this had nothing to with that.",
        "Q: How did he respond to the nomination?",
        "A: He...I will tell you before I answer. He said no because the...according to the Germans,\nwho have to go to the ghetto, there we will have a municipality for ourselves. We will\nhave our own community, a closed community. No Lithuanians will be will be allowed.\nNo no German will be allowed to go inside. You will be free to manage your life as well\nyou can, so each was supposed to be a municipal...a a chairman of a municipal council,\nso Dr. Elkes says I have no experience at all in municipality, in municipality...municipal\nwork. I never have done anything but physician. He was the head of the interior\ndepartment of the Jewish big hospital in Lithuania, Bikkur Holim, and he was...I said I\nwas all my life a doctor and I have no any whatsoever experience in in municipal work.",
        "Q: So what persuaded him?",
        "A: So then...so then it was a stalemate. Nobody...and the Germans said if we will not\nnominate, they will nominate and this was the worst thing that could happen to us and\nbefore long in despair, then stood up the the rabbi, Rabbi Schumuckler and he said,\n. I appeal to Dr. Elkes. Everybody...since you are the most...are the most\nsuitable to be a head of whole community in this unusual, unique time of rest...risks and\ndespair.

I was the speaker.",
        "Q: Why did you that? Did you know him?",
        "A: Because...because I knew...",
        "Q: Why did you have such faith in him?",
        "A: I'll tell you. There was not a person in Lithuania that didn't know the best...the the doctor\nbut in addition I knew Dr. Elkes because the only thing that he was...he was never a\nmem...member of any Zionist party, was never any committees. He was a doctor one\nhundred percent, but he was one of the three trustees of the found in Lithuania.\nWe both in Lithuania lent and for , before, prior to making their _ to _Israel,\nthey were trained in agricultural in order to prepare them to the life in agriculture.",
        "Q: But tell me why did you have so much faith in him? What kind of person was he?",
        "A: Just a minute. Just a minute. First of all, if you know well the three trustees of\nthe , this is like pioneer, he was also their doctor and because\nwe as a Zionist...as a chairman of the Zionist youth movement, I knew him from that\n, and meeting with him, and most of the people knew in Israel...in in Lithuania of\nDr. Elkes as a very...very broad-minded uh physician. He was the physician of the\npresident, of the prime minister and of the poorest people who gave medical help without\nwithout any pay.",
        "Q: How would you describe him as a person?",
        "A: He...let me tell you. First of all, you should know Elkes was born not far away from my\ntown like Kalvarija (ph) and there he got a very strong religious education. There were\nno schools in...at that time...he was born in '70...in 1870 more or less. At that time there\nwere no schools. There were only yeshivas for the bigger ones and there were only a\nrabbi and a hadder, you know, where they they taught the children to learn A - B - C and\nto pray, you see, and this is...he got a very strong religious...religious education from the\nvery youth and then in his own way he he uh he made, you know, his doctor degree and\nnobody knows how he...how he managed it, how he went to and he and he and he\nstudied medicine without even prior graduating _ so he had to make exams special and\nso on, but this is what he was. He was...he was a very well-known and he was well-\nknown because of his great understanding for the needy and for the poor, for the\n, for...and and not only for the Jewish needy. For others. You see, he was a\ngreat man and at the same time, he didn't turn his nose up.",
        "Q: He was a generous man?",
        "A: He was a most generous man and known like that. He was a very rich man. He was a\nvery rich man and mind you, I want to jump now...in his...in his last will, in the ghetto he\nwrote in the ghetto in 1943 in Hebrew language, which he gave...handed over to me\nbefore I escaped from the ghetto, he he didn't mention not a single word of his of his\nrichness. It was a very big property in this in this most fashionable part of the city of\nKovno. His children he sent, because of being a rich man, he sent his two children, his\nson and his daughter, to London and this is Professor ____ Elkes who you met in there,\nhe was then in London, and this is the last will that they allowed to him and to his sister,\nand this is will that to be passed to him (laughter) before I escaped from the ghetto.\nNobody knew will I at all succeed in to pass through and so on, so he was a great Zionist,\na great Jew, a great devoted Jew with a very deep feeling of Jewish heritage. He had a\nresponsibility and when he took over, he was known only as a physician, only as a great\nphysician and we gave trust in him because of his special relationship with the German\nambassador, but then he had shown himself by his day-to-day daily steps, dealing with\nthe Russians. For instance...I'l give you an instance...",
        "Q: Alright. Tell me.",
        "A: In 1940...the very beginning of the ghetto, came to me a Mr. Bronson (ph) who was a\ndirector of a Hebrew school and a lawyer who was nota Zionist, _, and they came to\nme as secretary of the of the Jewish committee and they told me, look, there is a\npossibility to buy a gun. Can you speak to to to the Jewish committee that they should\ngive money to pay, to buy the gun? So I went to Garfunkle, the Deputy. He says good, a\ngun. What they talking? It is dangerous. It will be dangerous for all the ghetto.\nDon't...don't mention it. So I went to Dr. Elkes. So Dr. Elkes said go to the treasurer and\ntell him that I order that you give to Bronson the money to buy the gun. Both very...L...I\nmost Jews devoted but here is a man of the season, of daring ===, most very. \u2014__,\nyou see. Then the first days when you came in into the ghetto...",
        "Q: Tell me about those. Tell me about the ghetto and the creation of the ghetto.",
        "A: So you see, so when it sees the the the Lithuanians attacks on the Jews in the cities, in\ntheir dwellings, in in the stores, in in the streets. They attacked terribly. It was\nimpossible to pass the street for a Jew, and they said...uh we were three lawyers. The\nsecond lawyer...one of the three was killed two days after he was elected. On the 6th of\nAugust, there was...they killed a thousand Jews on the street, and among them prominent\nleaders like , SO SO We remained two, two of us. Dr. __ was the elder one\nso he was the secretary, and I was the deputy secretary. On the 15th of August was the\nlast day to close up the Jews in the ghetto, but because of the riots, day in, day out, in the\ncity Jews left the city already by the end of July because there in this area they run out,\nthe local Jews steps in. You understand. This was the situation. Jews themselves went\nand then when it came nearer to the ghetto, the Lithuanian municipality ordered that the\nJews themselves should build the barbed wire fence around the ghetto, the Jews\nthemselves, and I have a letter in my collection from the from the municipality of...you\nare ordered to bring fifty Jews for the building of the of the gate around the...not the gate\nbut the barbed wire around the ghetto, and they should bring material, their own material.\nThe next day you should bring a hundred people, a hundred Jews, and I have a photo\nwhere the Jews were building the fence around the ghetto, and this reminds me a very\nRussian song. I told you I know Russian, so there is a song...brick layer, brick layer...is\nthat one passes by and sees brick layers are laying brick on the buildings that they are\nbuilding. ___ all the buildings, so it says brick layer, brick layer, for whom do you\nbuild these...these buildings. For whom are you laying the bricks? So he said you don't\ndisturb me. _\u2014\u2014_\u2014swwe are very busy in building...they are building...building a prison for\nthemselves. And this what I had in mind when I saw these men building around the...but\nthese were the Lithuanians, not the Germans.",
        "Q: Describe to me what were the living conditions like in the ghetto?",
        "A: What...we are not in the ghetto yet. Wait a minute. So you see, the...already from before\nthe ghetto, they were rationed...Jews were not allowed to appear before ten on the\nmarkets, open markets, because let the Lithuanians buy whatever it is and whatever the\nrest, __ were taken to Jews, but then we were now forbidden at all and this order of the\n10th of July, 1941, Jews were forbidden to appear in the open markets to buy from non-\nJews, to hire vehicles from non-Jews, to use help of non-Jews...absolutely. And they\nwere rationed hundred grams bread a day...hundred grams bread a day. Hundred and\ntwenty-five gram meat a week, fifty grams salt a month so it's clear that on this no one\ncould could live. Even to starve was nothing left, but what was most important, when the\nghetto was closed, there were many Jewish institutions in in social, medical, cultural,\nyeshiva and all kinds, so but they were all kinder...uh house for orphans, so they brought\non the on the 15th of August when it was the the last day of entering the ghetto, the\nLithuanians brought in a truck, two trucks load of children from orphans, from Jewish\nchildren's home that remained there and they pulled them out on the entrance of the\nghetto on the on the on the pavement and they left them.",
        "Q: Did you see this?",
        "A: I was there. First of all you should know what I was not present and what I did not see\nand what I did not see, you'll not hear from me, because it was...I went back and forth,\nback and forth, so and then we were all in ghetto.",
        "Q: How did you respond, Avraham, when you saw that? I mean, what did you think? What\nwere some of your...?",
        "A: ...the first thing to do was to allow....\nEND OF TAPE 1 - SIDE 1",
        "A: ...we had a fire brigade, and the fire brigade came immediately, you know, and to take\nthese children and bring them into where...we didn't have an orphan's home in the ghetto.\nWe didn't have a children's home in the ghetto. Where to bring them? So we brought\nthem in a certain place what was formerly a school just to be able temporarily that they\nbe under a roof. This was how the Lithuanians behaved to to orphans, and this\nwas...I...1f there is a God, I don't believe, but if there is a God, they should be punished\nfor this. They should never gain their independence. Never...never...never. And then,\nthree days after we were incarcerated in the ghetto, they finished the the the barbed wire\nfence around the ghetto and the gate and then three days...and they every day they gave\nJewish committee head to mobilize Jewish workers for the various German places to to\nclean the barracks, military barracks and the Gestapo uh building, to clean the pavement,\nto...tailors, uh pressers and all kinds of things.",
        "Q: Hold up on...are we out of tape? OK.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION.\nEND OF TAPE 1 - SIDE 2",
        "A: ..and then they commence to know what I've said.",
        "Q: Oh, that it's wonderful. They're hearing exactly everything they need to. OK? So what\nI'd like to start back is on those first days of the ghetto. Tell me about those first days of\nthe ghetto, would you? What was it like?",
        "A: Yes. So first of all, the first terrible blow that we got to to burst out of the children,\norphans, on the the Lithuanians, but on the third day of the ghetto on the 18th\nof August...15th of August the ghetto was closed...nobody comes in, nobody goes\nout...and the 18th of Aug...and they used everyday used to send workers to to town, to\nvarious places outside of the ghetto. This was hard work, very hard work that Jews were\nnot used to do, for instance in building...brick... laying bricks or in the barracks to to the\nthe the men's rooms and the the other cleaning dirty things, so they said they need five\nhundred workers of academic (ph) professions for archives work, so people were so\nenthusiastic about this opportunity. Instead of going and cleaning the lavatories and and\nand to build the roads and so on, so there appears five hundred thirty-four, and they took\nthem out from the ghetto and they killed them in the very same day. And when\nLithuanians who could see from around the fort...fortress, they there were...the next day\ncame Jewish workers nearby and had to walk to the and they showed\nthem...they the Jews. We didn't believe. We couldn't believe how can...how\ncan five hundred thirty-four innocent men, reputable then...lawyers, engineers,\nchemistries, uh physicians...why should they be killed without trial, without interrogation.\nWe couldn't believe it because this was on the third of the ghetto. And then Dr. Elkes\ntried to go from one to the other, from one to the other, the dignitaries and not the\ndignitaries, and the civil...and the civil uh authority and then in the in the in the police...",
        "Q: What was he doing? Was he trying to find out what happened or why?",
        "A: Yes. He said I'm the chairman of the Jewish committee and the overjuden. He spoke in\ntheir language and I am responsible for these Jews. I have to give areply. II I...please\ntell me why didn't they come. When will they come? Where are they now? What are\nthey doing, you see? He didn't speak in this tone like I'm talking now, but he...he found\nalways the right expression...first of all not to to hurt their Nazi dignity, and second to\nforce them to to to to answer him first of all, to answer him, and to answer him in a way\nlike a human being, because a Jew is not a human being. You understand? So they...first\nof all a Jew doesn't deserve that he he should get an answer at all. But Dr. Elkes put it in\na way and the...he just told them of his uh relationship with the German ambassador.\n. It worked some...sometimes. Much...not much...uh but nevertheless, but he\niS a Very...1S a...was a most courageous man and he always said nothing can happen to\nme. My sixty-four...five years are behind me and he always kept 1n his small pocket a\npoison and he said if worse comes to worse, he will...he will not fall in their hands alive\nand uh and he...and he asked which was very dangerous. Nobody, no insurance company\nin the world would give insurance for the life of Dr. Elkes. Yes. Because every\nsmall...not don't speak about the the commisar or the deputy sd commiisar\nwho was responsible for the ghetto was himself a murderer, so a murderer...the the first\nruler of the ghetto from the civil authority was the deputy ~\u2014s commisar of Kovno by\nthe name of Jordan (ph), and why the ...he write his name Jordan, but he was\njust a terrible guy.",
        "Q: Terrible person?",
        "A: Terrible...a mass murderer. He...for instance, he used to come in into the Jewish\ncommittee office. He never opened the door. He didn't take the handle of the door and\nopen it. No. Because the handle of the door kept Jews and he cannot make...put his\nhands on a on a on a handle that the Jews have kept . It would be dirty, his\nhands, you see, so he used to open with his boots, push the door...open the door with a\nwith a crash and the very appearance of him was already thunder of _\u2014___ and and and\nunrest and of and of God knows what it brings. And he would be so so uh harsh and that\neven the superiors in Berlin thought he doesn't know how to behave before his superiors\nbe...because ...not because he was too harsh towards Jews. Towards Jews you cannot be\nharsh enough because the the final solution is the final solution of every Jew, but he took\nover certain functions that wasn't in in the in the priority...in the in the authority of his\nsuperiors... , So they sent him to the to the front and he was killed there, you see,\nand so it turned out that these five hundred and thirty-four, they had to admit to Dr. Elkes\nfinally that they were killed by the thirty-four that sabotaged the Jews too. They were\nsupposed to...1n in a in a store of sugar, they poured in gas...gasoline, and so this was why\nthey were killed. Of course, this was the Nazi ___\u2014_\u2014___ but this is what they said, so in the\nfirst three...after the third day of the ghetto, this is what we learned and what 1s ghetto all\nabout, because we didn't know what it was about. And these, of course, such things\ndidn't let me rest for several days, and I wrote about it at night. I wanted to start actually\nour interview with mentioning the famous Jewish historian, . He wrote\nmonumental books on history of the Jewish people. He livedin _ at the time of the\noutbreak of the war with Russia, with Germany and when the Nazis came to take him\nfrom his home, uh he...the only word that he could spell out before he was taken by\nsurprise, recorded and this I kept in mind all the years, recorded...the Germans never\nwanted to that the outer world to know what's going on inside the ghetto. They never\nwanted to know what activities the mass murderers had enforced. It was my inner\nimpulse, a driving...inner driving force to put it in writing because I was myself\noverwhelmed. I couldn't talk to anybody about this. There was not a possibility to talk\nbecause there was so taken the day to day and hour to hour with work in the Jewish\ncommunity and I I uh I had a secretary and I had to go to the to the German offices uh to\nin town to ask, for instance, let's say the the least. We had an office. We needed pencils.\nWe needed a typewriter. We needed uh paper for typing and so so I I and the secretary\nused to go to the stock rooms of ______ single authority and ask for this. I have here a\nform letter order, so we, when you were out of the ghetto with an escort, you know, the\nfirst year. The second year was only you had to get a certificate in order to...but we didn't\nneed. You...every every every uh day when I went from the ghetto to the stock\ncommisar, to the government authority, it was approximately for eight kilometers, five\nmiles, six miles. On the way each one could spit you in the face or kill you or or damage\nyou or whatever it is...you...1n German there is a wonderful saying... . You are\nfree as a bird. Everybody can kill the birds. Nobody will arrest you and so on...you\nunderstand? And this is what I felt and to go in aa let's say not leave alone the Gestapo, I\ndidn't go much to the Gestapo. In very very rare cases, but mostly I went to the stock\ncommissar or to the general commisar. What is the stock commissar? The commissar\nfor Kovno, the city of Kovno. And the commissar 1s the general for all of all of\nLithuanian. If I couldn't get something from from the thing, from the city commissioner,\nI tried to go in and ask from the from the general commissary and uh and uh there either\nyou meet Lithuanians who look at you like you're...you're run away from a prison, even\nthey spite you or they beat you or they will kick you or whatever it is. Seldom I used to\nmeet a colleague, a former colleague from the law school, a Lithuanian that used to to\nthrow me . Very very seldom. Very seldom.",
        "Q: What did you if they spit at you?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: What...what could you do or did you do if they spit at you or kicked you or...?",
        "A: Not at all. I'll give you...for instance, 1t was a certain period of time that we didn't get\neven the the hundred grams of bread. We didn't get it for two months and instead they\nused to send us , . Terrible. It was stinking, and when we need bread,\nagain they did not have a , SO went to the to the commander of the ghetto. There\nwas a ghetto commander. He lived inside the ghetto. Was a ghetto commander, German,\nand he had his sentries to look around that nobody should run away from the ghetto at the\nmain gate, but he was the the commandants mostly were people, elderly people from the\npolice, from the old police that uh I couldn't say that they were...they loved Jews.\nCertainly not, but they...they could perhaps try to be...not to be as harsh as the others so\nwhen uh they they came to the commander, said the people cannot go to work because\nfor two months they have no bread. The people were poor. And it was that from the\nghetto each day left the ghetto gates eight thousand to nine thousand people in various\nplaces of work. This was the only employment source for the German military offices\nand installations and the only place alone of the building a military airport. They\nmobilized from the ghetto five thousand workers, seven days a week, twenty-four hours a\nday. It was a terrible slave work in the very beginning of the war.",
        "Q: Avraham, you told me that when you had to move into the ghetto that there were\nthousands that had to move into a very small area where only seven thousand before\nlived. Was it crowded? Was it...what did it look like?",
        "A: People remained on the on the on the open air. There was...I used to have several\npaintings that would show people...first of all, there was a housing committee, but the\nhousing committee couldn't make more buildings than it was. You understand? So uh\nwe first of all everyone...whatever I say I have documentary. We waited until the 31st of\nDecember of '42. I have a list of all the streets of the ghetto, in each street how many\nbuildings, in each building, how many apartments. In each apartment how many people\nand then you made the average of living space...living...the area per person, per\ncapita...the average 2.95 meters. It means...1t means approximately uh...how should I say\nin...a meter and this is what...inches...1inches... approximately six inches, five inches per\ncapita, so this was not a living space so it was absolutely impossible, but we didn't have\njust the space and we...and we asked them that they should allow us to use...there was\na...let's say aa cinema. They should allow us to take the cinema. No. No cinemas.",
        "Q: And people lived in the street?",
        "A: People lived in the street and these thousands...in the first half year of the ghetto, and\nthen little by little...what _ little, they killed five hundred and forty. Then they killed\nthousand two hundred, and then they killed another thousand, and then they killed ten\nthousand, so then became space.",
        "Q: It was massacre after massacre?",
        "A: Yes. It was...1t was just the the most...for instance, my wife. My wife was always at the\nentrance of the prison gate looking for her husband for...maybe maybe among\nthose who they used to take out from prison for work, and she thought maybe she will see\nhim . But while so waiting and looking for her husband near the prison and then\nthe 9th fortress, so she didn't take her time to go to the housing committee of the ghetto\nand get an order for a dwelling, and when she came it was already the last days of the\nghetto and there was no dwelling available at all. You understand? So it was only by by\nby chance or by incident, by accident...I don't know...whatever you want to call...that she\nmade some very good friends, they gave her a corner in their dwelling for her and for her\nlittle daughter, and all our minds were absorbed to look to to rescue her husband. You\ncan understand it.",
        "Q: So if you were to walk down a street in that ghetto, 1t was full of people?",
        "A: We... ... there were two two things. Those homeless, we took for instance a a\nsynagogue, and they parade them in hundred, hundred, three hundred, four hundred, five\nhundred people, old and young and we called it a , to reserve, to reserve for for\nhomeless, for roofless, and such was the ____s were approximately five, six in the\nghetto. And then the others plainly were in the courtyards and andinthe  _\u2014__. II\nhave here an excellent drawing by Joseph ; . So uh it was a most\nterrible time. It was a time of starvation. In order to to to make it more more visible for\nyou, we had in the ghetto vegetable gardens, free, open space so we built the potatoes so\nthat in the harvest, we worked potatoes, but the people were starving so they couldn't wait\nuntil the potatoes would be ripe so they were...they all jumped on the on the vegetable uh\ngardens and they took all the unripe potatoes and they ate them. And I have a...such a\npainting of Esther _\u2014 of those people grabbing, you know, the the vegetables, garden,\nthe potatoes and and this is where they caught...the Jewish caught in the ghetto\nand they said , one of the bright spots of the ghetto, because Dr. Elkes tried to keep\nthe ghetto not to turn into animals and not to eat one another so he tried Jews ,\nfor instance, those who grabbed the potatoes, they brought them to court. We knew that\nthey they are innocent but nevertheless, all of them must be and they were brought\nto court. Who was brought to court? One of one of the pharmacy, one doctor, and five\nplain, plain families that they had nothing , but nevertheless they were brought to\ncourt and they were...and they were let's say punished by first uh if it would happen\nanother time something else, so and so.",
        "Q: How difficult that must have been for him.",
        "A: They they had a a whole detention, arrest house. People who didn't go...show up to to the\nwork. We call it arbeit (ph) , and...",
        "Q: And so...I'm sorry.",
        "A: Go ahead.",
        "Q: No. I was saying...I was going to ask you so Elkes did this to maintain order regardless of\nhow difficult, knowing these people were starving?",
        "A: Yes, but so Dr. Elkes, his court was uh was established so there were the...my my patron\nwhom I talk about, Professor Sigmund Belaski, he was nominated president of the court,\nof the Jewish court and other prominent lawyers were members of the court, so there was\naavery _ as far as you can talk about this, __ in the ghetto you see, that it was a\nvery serious joint meeting of the Jewish committee and the members of the Jewish court\nand then Dr. Elkes told them, he...it was his prerogative to nominate and he was\nand he was order...there was regulations and based on Lithuanian was the\n______ and he said we are in the ghetto in the most terrible time for Jews, least of all\nLithuanian Jews. There are all the possibilities that the court of the because of\nthe lack of...terrible lack of food, because the terrible pain of loss of wife and children\nand mothers, people may loose their , their divine vision in which we all were\nborn alike. It is the...it is the...1t is our joint responsibility entirely in especially in this\nlow... low...in this very terrible conditions in which we live to keep the human minimum\ndignity in the very base sense of Jewish heritage and this is the joint responsibility and\nthe joint task of the Jewish committee and of the Jewish court. And what I I expect from\nyou, the president of the court and judges of the court, members of the court...there is a\n___ saying, == ~~... You should pursue right...justice. Justice pursue. And this\nis your main task, more so under these horrible times which we are living.

When they\nappear before court, should be given the feeling that is free to talk out to speak of what is\nin his heart, to explain why he did it what he did, and to explain him what could be the\nconsequences of his deed and that he shouldn't repeat it. This...it was...I want to tell\nyou...it was a a session of the , of the high spirit in the very best sense of the\nJewish tradition and heritage and this was Dr. Elkes who spoke to the court. He was\n____ when a Spanish man on the Jewish court was rude Dr. Elkes can\nappeal to Dr. Elkes and he can change it or annul it for \u2014_, but he would never, never\ndid he did he did he did he take advantage of his rights. He respected every judgment of\nthe court and the...my professor Belaski, president of the court.

        "Q: OK. Let's talk about the ghetto.",
        "A: ... Should not repeat, you see. There...there was as I said in the very same day when\namong the \u2014_\u2014_\u2014s assembly of the Jewish community in Kovno when when\n. There was also in the very same...after...right after...two hours later, we\nconvened a meeting of four Zionist leaders from the labor Zionists - one, fromthe |\nleft-wing Zionists, from the \u2014___ right-wing and from the general Zionists. I was one of\nthe four, and we instituted the Zionist underground which was called Kovno.\nis Slobodka in Lithuanianis \u2014\u2014_\u2014s and why we decided...because\n1S . as you know...1t's... is when you are in stress, when you are\nin despair. See? And we were a community in despair and this was...and we wanted two\nthings, to achieve we were very very clandestine and very very uh away from sunshine,\naway away from anything outside \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00ab.:~XWe wanted first of all to keep the Zionist\nyouth on a certain more, that they were not left alone, that their leadership is with them\nand that there was a hope, even the mere hope that the time will come and we will...the\nthe liberation will come then then \u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014_ and we'll proceed with the Zionist work and go\nto Palestine to make a life there. It shows...the ghetto shows that thereisno _\u2014 Jews\nbut _ Israel. And this was very important and we kept such meetings on uh on let's\nsay on Hannuaka oron _\u2014\u2014_\u2014.~ We used to make the third seider (ph), seider, _, see,\nin the clandestine, of course, but this encouraged the youth. We trained them in 1n how to\nhandle ammunition.",
        "Q: Is this what gave you and others the will to continue to fight and to struggle?",
        "A: Absolutely. First of all, we...the Jewish...the leaders...the Zionist leaders felt a\nresponsibility because, you see, you can see here youhavea___ that you were the\nleader of them yesterday, a year ago, two years ago, and they look at you and I shouldn't\nbe ashamed when we we we are face to face, sol have totell you. __...this is...we are\nfighting and you have to join. You are a real part of the...you are part of this fight and\nyou have to share in this uh extraordinary conditions. Don't give in. Don't forget if you\nhave no sufficient bread, tomorrow we will get more. If you can find a loaf of bread,\nbring it and share it with you committee and so on. We we we had uh\n... how did they come to Pnina? How did they come to Pnina? Pnina was\na...her husband was aaa Zionist student fraternity. Not on the same of mine. I was the\npresident of my fraternity, but in the ghetto it was not important whether you are a\n____ or you are a general Zionist or you are a Labor Zionist or whatever you\nhave...you are a Jew. So we melded together and we worked together and we wouldn't\nuh collect money for __ Israel for . But we did take care of the widows and\nthe orphans of ___. You understand? Pnina was not the the only one whom I\nsupported and who came. There was a woman who . The second\nsecretary who was killed. He left a wife and a child. She...the first thing, she came to\nme. What shall I do? Do you...cemember you, whatever you need sometimes what I can\ndo and there's not very much that I can do. What I can do...here's address and they came.\nPnina didn't come to me. She didn't come to me, but knew her. Iknewher  _\u2014_s. I\nknew her husband from the student fraternities and one day... worked in the Jewish\ncommittee, but as I told you, in order to give it a possibility for the hard works at the\nairport especially, to take them a day off and we went to work in their stead on the on the\nconstruction of the airport, military airport. It was terrible work but this gave them the\npossibility to take a day off, so and another day was in another working place, so at that\nplace comes a Lithuanian woman and she comes close __. She she wouldn't dare to\ncome inside, but from from across the street she goes...do youknow _\u2014_\u2014_\u2014_\u2014_\u2014s? \u2018I said yes,\nI know. Will you take a parcel forher? I ==. Iwasthenurseof _, you see, and\nbecause her her close connections with __...she she loved her. Tell you the\nstory...must go back. So will you take the parcel she says so she throws a parcel and they\ngrab it, you know, and they hide it and at night when I come back to the to to the ghetto, I\ngo straight to Pnina and I bring her the parcel that I have. Pnina, I have regards from\nyou...for you fromthe \u2014=\u2014. ~~\u2014\u2014._ Says yes, I spoke to her and here's the parcel.\nAnd she told me that she has sent you several parcels, but she never got any...any\nresponse from you. Did you ever get these parcels? She says no, this is the first parcel\nthat I get, you see, and there were also people like that in the ghetto. They took it or\npeople were taken uh that they couldn't go to to town so they used to trade in a pair of\ntrousers or a or a or a Suit or dresses to give people who go___\u2014__ and they would trade in\nand bring the bread. Others used to take the the the clothing and never bring back not not\nthe clothing, not the bread, and this ___\u2014 were brought to the to the Jewish court, you see,\nSO So So people took parcels for Pnina and they never gave it to her.",
        "Q: Avraham, tell me...I know no day was typical.",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "Q: I know that no day was typical in the ghetto, but how would you describe for us what a\nday was like? I mean what did people do in the evening? What were the streets like\nduring the day?",
        "A: First of all...let me...let me finish with Pnina because this is a very very . So when\nI went in and then I saw the conditions. The dwelling...it was winter. It was cold and in\nthe wall between the between the uh...you know, between between the the the woods,\nthere was ice, so I told her, Pnina, don't you have any...we used to give portions of fire\nwood, very small portions, very small portions, but nevertheless...to go...why didn't you\ngo to ask for for for for fire wood, for a portion of firewood, and since you have a child,\nyou are entitled to another half portion for the child. You understand? And so I started\nand I helped her. I was instrumental in bringing this and bringing that and one day Pnina\nwent to work and she tried to trade in her...her evening gown for bread and she was\ncaught by the police and she was taken to the Gestapo, to the Lithuanian criminal police\nand when they they made...the the workers of the brigade where Pnina worked uh came\nback to the ghetto so they came to me and told me Pnina is under arrest and I tried\nimmediately what can I do. There was a man by the name of who was the\nforeman of the group of inmates that worked in the building of the Gestapo, so he used to\nhave some contacts, you know. He used to bribe one Gestapo so I ran immediately to his\nhouse in the ghetto so he looked. You have __\u2014\u00ab. -Youhave to help. Here is a widow.\nShe left a child. She...the child remains alone. Her father was killed, her mother in jail\nand you must do everything you can in order to...to cut the long short, long story short, I\nhad some connections with that is a special story for himself, so he was...he was\ninstrumental and we didn't disclose to ____ that her mother was under arrest so we told\nher that her mother remained to work the night shift and she will come tomorrow\nmorning and she come only tomorrow a day after tomorrow late. She was two and a half\ndays in jail, and I was instrumental to to to take care of ____ and this and that and then\nand so and that's why we...I dared to ask her whether she would be willing to hide my\nentries in the diary. I couldn't keep it with myself because in the...it was the office of\nthe...they would...used to come everyday, Germans, Lithuanians. I couldn't keep it at my\nprivate home because they would come anyhow to to to look at my private home, and I\ncouldn't give it to anybody else and when I asked Pnina just by chance, I was sure she\nwill say no. Why should she take such a one terrible risk? Find a a entry of diary...this\nmeans death. Hundreds percent...no mercy. But she said . So I said Pnina,\nthink over again. This is a very dangerous thing. I'll hide it. Alright...alright. To cut a\nlong story short, she was hiding it and this messenger that I...we were in the ghetto...he\nworked with me in the secretariat of the ghetto, he used to bring this every morning under\nhis shirt, you know, the the entry of that day and bring it to her. This young thirty years\nold... = ishisname, _\u2014.~ He's now in New York, in thatuh\nThree years he used to bring from me to Pnina...not one word did he spill out. ;\nNot one word and never did he fail and you know, you...of course, from the Germans,\neven even Jews in the ghetto...so I have all the respect and admiration for this and\nyou must not...you will understand whatever I could I have done. (laughter)\nYou see, and this 1s...I I could see how Pnina with whom he spared, starving for bread.\nShe was a daughter of the richest family in Lithuania. She graduated the university in\nVienna before the war. She had a wonderful home, house...luxury home in town.",
        "Q: I know. I will talk to Pnina tomorrow.",
        "A: ,",
        "Q: I think Pnina...we'll talk to Pnina tomorrow.",
        "A: Yes...yes...so I don't want to tell you her background. I knew her from the you\nsee but nevertheless, this her hiding and often I used to come there in the evening and I\nwas entirely exhausted. Sometimes I had terrible experience with the Germans in town\nand I just couldn't take more and I said tonight I am...I cannot write the diary. She said\nyou can not. Dictate to me and she took the pencil and paper and she wrote with me entry\nfor that day, and that's why you'll find in my...in the original, her handwriting. You\nunderstand? So this is...so we did not make love so much as one can think, but we made\nso very much human...human contact, human devotion to each other that that cannot...I\nhave no words to express it. I had...I must now tell you in my youth...I...1t was very\ndangerous thing for me to meet a girl or go out with out a girl or more than that, but this\nwas not the case with Pnina. Pnina was pure...pure love, devotion and sacrifice, sacrifice.\nThis is what was. And I was lucky that this was . She returned. Now we\nhad...you asked about the day to day life. It was..1t was \u2014\u2014\u2014.:~ People...what would\nthe the the the agenda of the day. You get up at five o'clock when , not sunshine,\nbefore sunshine. Most of the people in the ghetto have to report to the main ghetto gate\nand go out to the to work in in town. All the roads and the workshops in the ghetto is\n____ eight hundred people, and you immediately go in the machinery of slavery, or\norder, of beating up, of of calling all kinds of names and you you you forget that you are\na human being. The only thing is how to get a loaf of bread or Pnina, how to getaa\nsome little bit of milk for for __, and and how come back safe, pass through the ghetto,\nand when the day is through, you come back. It's already night and until you pass the\ngate and then they take you away from the gate. They take you to prison or they take you\nto commandant and when you come home, you are already so exhausted that you fell in\nbed. This... and so on, but also waiting were the police and the and the office\nand institutions. We were in the very same atmosphere of danger. How many times did I\ngot to town to work? Just because to have a better feeling for myself. You understand?\nAnd and there were all kinds of songs. You know and uh of course those in the\ncommittee, there was a song...you ask me why I'm not ___ the committee. If I wouldn't\nbe in the committee, I wouldn't have this and I wouldn't have that and ...(laughter).",
        "Q: Tell me about the songs. Do you remember some of them?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Do you remember some of them?",
        "A: I have it in my head. I I have it...I have it in the...I asked...I suggested that they should\nput in and they didn't put it in, but this wonderful song. For instance, there is a\nJewish book of songs, folk songs, . You know, on it\nmeans on a small uh...1n in kitchen there is a stove and a small stove it is called in this\nlittle it's more fire is burning. And the house is hot and around the the rabbi\nwith the children teaches them , but this is, you know, in in Yiddish it's in the song,\nand on this...on this very song, they do take in in from the ghetto. .\nAround the gate, __ burns a fire and around his hut Jews are coming with their parcels\nand the dawn and the Jews are burning, burning, because they take away from them the\nparcels. I cannot translate it, but this is just one of them, and of course...",
        "Q: Was there humor, Avraham?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Were there jokes?",
        "A: Oh and how...and how. This was the great thing. For instance, I'll tell you...where\nto...this was...you asked me about life...this was the daily life in the ghetto, but in in\naddition, we had for instance Pnina, the same Pnina, but from this Pnina would not...there\nwas not another one. As I told you, she had a very tiny place. Then she got a little bigger\nplace and we had a circle, cultural circle, eight to ten people. There was a poet and there\nwere two...two writers and then there was a Jewish writer, a Polish Jewish writer\nwho wrote a very great novel and there was a...the head of the cultural department of the\nghetto, Dr. , and uh there were Garfunkle who 1s a...was a member of the\nparliament and myself, so we used to meet once in two weeks for two hours. Where? In\nPnina's dwelling. Where did we sit there? You cannot imagine. But there we sit two\nhours, each one...one used to read all of his poems and we had a journalist, Dr. \u2014\u2014_, who\nlistened to the...to understand radio and he used to report on what's going on the front.\nAnd he...he was called around the the the intelligence...military intelligence report. And\nthere was one that was reading from what he had written and sometimes I used to read\none of my entries. These were two hours of inspiration, that not everything is lost, that\nnot everything is bread, that not everything is tears, that there is life in in . In\nthe depths of hopelessness, there is a strife of light and this strife of light in my case it\nwas Pnina, of course, but everyone hada _\u2014\u2014_\u2014.~ Such two hours intellectual, cultural.\nThis was entirely contra to what the ghetto stands for, entirely __\u2014 to what is\nsurrounding, but we felt a need in this. You understand. Or for instance, I wa,s as I told\nyou, one of the founders and leaders of the Zionist underground, so one day I get a call\nfrom the from the ghetto, main ghetto gate. There...there is one woman that speaks...she\nis...she wants to speak to you. She asked for and when we said that \u00a9\ncannot be reached, she asked for . I didn't know who who was it, so give it to\nme. Soshetellsme _\u2014\u00ab. ~- Yes. Ibringregardsto youfrom __.. was a\nZionist underground in Vilna that we heard from our correspondence. So I told her, tell\nhim take care and bring her straight to me. Who was it? It was Irena Adamowicz, who is\nin the book. She was a Polish that was very much close to the \u2014 =| movement in\nPoland and she was going from ghetto to ghetto, bringing reports to each other and it was\nfor the first time after a year that we heard \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014sccame. She said I want to talk to you,\nso I said please talk. She says no, I want to talk you in private. So I went in one of the\nrooms. She says I come now from Vilna. Iam...I bring regards from ___or from this\nor from this...so of course we cannot talk here. She says alright, so I arranged\nimmediately a meeting of... meeting of the committee of the _\u2014_\u2014__iof the\nunderground at my private dwelling and I...there were two from the underground |\nthat said alarm if somebody comes in and all went to to work in my...because they were\nin my dining room where all the members of the executive of the Zionist underground\nand in addition Dr. Elkes and Garfunkle, yes, and uh and uh Dr. uh Dr. Shapiro was\nthere. There was a who was also a member of the underground. For a half a\nday long, she reported to us on what's going on in the ghettos. For the first time that it\ntold what could be...you know, something was going on behind the barbed wires. We\nnever had a slightest idea and here comes a woman. She spoke fluently Yiddish, and\nthat's why the gate...they couldn't...they couldn't be suspicious because if she would speak\nPolish or something, they wouldn't let her in at all. You understand? And this woman\ndisclosed to us for the first time so open, a little little = say in Hebrew, in English,\n____, a little window, a small window to the outer world, what goes on in Warsaw, what\ngoes on in Vilna, what goes on in Lodz. And then we reported to her on what's going on\nin the ghetto and she was amazed, so this encounter with such a Polish Catholic woman\nwho is exceptional. By the way, she came to Palestine the \u2014_\u2014_\u2014_Israel, in '56, and she\nwas . You cannot imagine what...to tell you...unfortunately none of my sisters\nuh survived. They all were perished in the war, but even if my sister would come I\nwouldn't be so happy she was there, and they took her around and everything. I___ out\nof my way and I look to please her and so on, but she was a Communist. Ofcourse _,\nand this is where we...where we differed. But this very meeting inside the ghetto with an\noutsider was in itself a breakthrough, not exactly what the Germans intended...their\nintention to to close us behind barbed wires, that nothing should be known to us what's\ngoing on and nothing should be going out what's going on inside and when the 28th of\nOctober...this terrible day, the most terrible day in the ghetto, the selection of 28,000\npeople, inmates of the ghetto, and they told it...I don't want to repeat because they spoke\nabout it with regard to Dr. Elkes this morning before, so this selection of eight, ten\nthousand were in one day...all of a sudden we felt that we are...1f it can happen in one day\nthat the men their own finger in their, ___...",
        "Q: Pointing.",
        "A: Pointing, since ten thousand today, so we would have been __.",
        "Q: How did this...that happen? Did they call people to the square or...?",
        "A: I beg you pardon? First of all, the the Gestapo said that in ghetto are people who are\nworking hard and there are people who are working less, and people who don't work at\nall, so we'll know that the portions of food for those who are working is not enough. We\nknow that hundred grams of bread per day per person who works is not enough, so we\nwant to enlarge this portion for those who are working and to leave the portions that are\nnow only for those who don't work in order to make sure who i1s...these who are working,\nso we want that you should...all...all the inmates of the ghetto, thirty thousand, should\nreport on the 28th of October on the big square democratic, families-wise and groups of\nworking-wise, you see, and then when they make they make uh divide separately in one\nplace those who are working hard and those get double rations and those who are don't\nwork will get the same rations as now. So Dr. Elkes said if this should be done, he said,\nwe can do it ourselves. We take...give you the list of the people __ ourselves out of\ndepartment of supply, we'll give double rations to those who are working and give less\nrations, the same rations to those who are not. For that purpose, you don't need all of the\n30,000 inmates of the ghetto to report on on on the democratic square. We we we do not\nbelieve that this is the true reason for for that order and Elkes worked very hard and he\nmet twice with Roka (ph). As I told you...and what did they tell Elkes to .\nMr. Roka, Mr. Commander, may I talk to you as man to man? It is not....",
        "Q: Avraham, let's stop here because we have less than a minute of tape. And I want them to\nswitch the tapes...\nEND OF TAPE 2",
        "Q: OK, Avraham, you were telling me about the massive selection on that day. You were\ntelling me about the selection.",
        "A: Yes. So uh Dr. Elkes tried to squeeze out from Roka what is the real reason for ordering\nthirty thousand people, old and young, sick and healthy, uh babies in in in the arms of\ntheir...children...why do they have to go to the court? Will..if it's a matter of food\nrationing, we'll arrange it. So he says no, the Jews are too much uh close to each other\nand they have...and they aren't very...they aren't very...for each other, they they\nwouldn't...they they cannot trust others will do it. They'll give to one and they'll share\nwith the others and...to cut a long story short, we did not believe that this is the real\nreason for for ordering all on the square and a certain...certain members of the of the\nJewish community...Jewish committee said that we should not uh give the instructions or\nwe should not make public the order. Why should the Gestapo itself not make public? It\nshould write in public...why would they want us. They wanted because if it would more\ninformation and an announcement of the Jewish committee, there would seem that if the\nJewish committee is ordering that, and this under no circumstances wanted to do, so\nfinally they decided that we should ask the...to consult the chief rabbi Shapiro (ph) who\nwas aa Scholar of world fame. He was at one time a candidate to be the chief rabbi of\n_____ Israel, and uh we we went to him and he he said that it's a very hard question and he\nhas to check with the...and when we come...he told us to come at eleven...at eleven\no'clock night and then he told us to come at five o'clock in the morning and he was not\nready, and then to cut a long story short, he came very along and finally he said...he\nphoned...in in certain conditions that the Jewish community was placed intoaaaa\nsituation, that if there is a possibility to rescue part of the community and not the whole\ncommunity, the Jewish leadership has to do everything in order to rescue the this what is\npossible. I'll tell you later about the the very famous story about the two went in the\ndesert and had also left one cup of water and it was sufficient only for one of them. If one\nof them will drink the water, the other will die. If both of them will drink, nobody\nwill...and this is...so after having heard this this uh consultation of the chief rabbi, it was\nthe wording of the of the of the formation of the ..the announcement was in a\nsay that the Gestapo ordered the Jewish population of the ghetto to appear, not that the\nJewish committee but the Gestapo ordered the Jewish community...so and those who will\nnot appear at the...at six o'clock in the morning, and those who will not appear at six\no'clock in the morning and they will be found in their house, each one which will be\nfound in his house will be killed on the spot. They shall leave open the houses, the doors,\nthe the shutters, everything, and finally uh there were several...uh and where there is a\nsick man, they should put in writing, they should put in writing that there is a sick man\nthat is immovable, that cannot be transported, and of course all those who were left and\nkilled...they killed them and at six o'clock in the morning, there was thirty thousand went\nwith \u2014_\u2014_\u2014sain their hands, to...from various parts of the ghetto to this square and I\n____ it as the funeral of the victims themselves. The inmates themselves went to their\nown funeral, because nobody knew what will happen and who will go and who will not\ngo, and at eight o'clock in the morning, Roka stood up on the top of...",
        "Q: Was the square just packed?",
        "A: Over-crowded...and it was family-wise and work groups-wise. Those...all those who\nworked at the airport should be all together in one group. Those who worked in cleaning\nand and in the Gestapo building, they should all in their places of work and the name of\nthe place of work. And the Jewish police separate _ the Jewish uh committee\nseparate with the Jewish and so on, and then Roka started...at eight o'clock, he started...he\nstood up on the upper hill in order to have a a a overlook all this group and he started\n___...._ to march forward and they used to pass by him and then he used to say\nss right. And usually the people see that right is the better...better.\nLeft is not good and at this time exactly the opposite to the right and it happened so that\npeople were very lucky that they were sent to the to the right, but the...to the right they\nsent the old people, the children, those who are not capable of working, who cannot be\nthe..of real...any assistance to the to the to the effort of war, of the German effort of war,\nand this took place all the day long.",
        "Q: Was there panic?",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Was there panic?",
        "A: Not panic at all, but but but uh let's say uh they waited and nobody know...knew what is\ngoing...nobody knew that it's want to be dead, so maybe it's harder work. We\nare...anyhow, and uh he stood and in one end he said , , left, right...and\nwith the other hand he kept a sandwich, and he kept handkerchiefs and they ate very\ntasteful but they kept also that his finger should not get uh from the fat from the\nsandwich he had, . It was just terrible to see a man without any human feelings\nat all. He eats with one hand the sandwich and other says left, right, left, right, and Dr.\nElkes stood not far away from him and tried to get out somebody from the left to the right\nside. He said this is a very important carpenter and this 1s a brick layer and this is a\nvery...a very machinist, artisan and so on. He tried to help but in the end of the day...and\nand this took all the day long and people, the old men fell on the spot in on the on the\ndemocratic square. Old people or sick people, they fainted. They were left there. They\ndidn't even reach the the selection point. They just left where they were, you see. And\nuh and the uh it it ended approximately that six in the evening when it's already\nsun...sunshine is down, sunset, and then then thousands of people went straight...they\nwent over to the smaller ghetto that was...which was vacant before from the 4th of\nOctober where they put on fire the hospital with the with the patients, with the doctors\nand the medical personnel on the 4th of October and they liquidated the small part of the\nghetto and this and this vacated part that they killed approximately the thousand people\non the 4th of October...they left in the ten thousand people were and Elkes tried and when\nhe...Elkes stood all the day long and didn't want to sip...he didn't want to take a\nsip...water, nothing. He says oh why should I live up to this day and why...what have I\ndone wrong that destiny just goes...and he stood all day and he didn't move.",
        "Q: What were some of your thoughts?",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "Q: What were some of your emotions that you were...?",
        "A: I was close to him.",
        "Q: And what were you thinking?",
        "A: [...I'll tell you why. He was closing and when somebody of the police and there was a\nvery veteran Zionist man over the age of seventy. He was the owner of the Hebrew\nlibrary , SO he was alone so I told Dr. Elkes, when passes by, try to rescue him,\nyou know, so we...we just told him. We were busy all the day. I at least you see, but, of\ncourse, he he he rescued that this was a very small part, and in the evening came to Dr.\nElkes at his home those who were separated, husband from men and then from children\nfrom parents and so on, and they asked him...and then Dr. Elkes uh asked the _\u2014_, the\ncommander of the police, of the Jewish police, to ask from Roka that they should take\nhome from those 10,000, hundred men who were in to to...in his language these were\nvery important artisan (ph)...this is a very important physician, and this is a very\nimportant this...and the next morning when they were all from the small ghetto on their\nmarch to the 9th Fortress to the to the , the the Germans called the 9th Fortress\nAnhilation (ph) Point Number 2, and of course in their secret uh but I got it, you see, and\nso Dr. Elkes was permitted to go in and take out the hundred but then they fell upon...all\nof them, Dr. Elkes rescue us. One took him by his sleeves. Another took him by his foot.\nAnother took him by his head and they take him by by his coat, and then there was a\ngreat tumult, you see, and they march them to the 9th Fortress ___all the all the the the\nten thousand were mixed up and the Lithuanian partisans entered and they beat up Elkes\nterribly on his head and he fell and he fainted and then we rushed from the other side of\nthe ghetto uh several people and myself and we we took him on our arms and brought\nhim entirely...he was two days in that place. He was terribly wounded and this is what he\nhe could he could always...they told him if we don't go away from you, we take you to\nthe 9th Fortress. This was a terrible...the most terrible day that there was in ghetto, and\nanother day that I think I should mention...",
        "Q: We have to uh end the interview.",
        "A: End?",
        "Q: Yeah. Your wife is in a car waiting for you outside and we'll have to pick up maybe\ntomorrow.",
        "A: I am not quarreling with my wife.",
        "Q: Not after forty years. I'll walk down with you.",

        "Q: Avraham, what I would like to start with is for you to tell us what were some of the the\nprivate ways that people decide the Nazi regulations and the Nazi laws in the ghetto?",
        "A: Well, we usually read and hear about the heroic uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, of the\nLodz ghetto and so on. Also in Kovno, the uh the escape from the 9th Fortress, the\nlegendary escape from the 9th Fortress that you read later , SO I uh but the main...I\nalways am trying to stress and this is what I've done in my diary I think, to stress the fight\nof the each individual, of the inmate, the plain man or woman in the ghetto, even the the\nboy...child...for survival of one day. Sometimes survival of another hour in the hope that\nsomething might happen.",
        "Q: And what did they do when you...?",
        "A: So first of all, the rations that the Germans gave to feed the inmates was a ration for\nstarvation. No one could live on a hundred grams, but also this hundred grams of bread,\nthe uh the inmates didn't...the the the individual inmate didn't get because we had kept\nsecret two thousand souls in the ghetto. Babies that had been born despite the the strict\norder to cut off pregnancies. Second there were old men or sick men that if you would\nput them on the register of the in...inmates of the ghetto, they would have been killed, so\nthis two thousand...approximately two thousand had to be...to get food, so we cut off\nfrom the general portion that we got uh so everyone got only approximately eighty grams\nor eighty-five grams of bread so that the others can get also. So each one in his own way\ntried to get additional food. You couldn't go in in the supermarket and buy it. You\ncouldn't go in because in the ghetto there was nothing, so people used to go to the...to\nwork outside town and there try to get out for ten or fifteen minutes and buy and buy...not\nbuy because nobody sold. It's war time and it were sanctions also in the city but the\nLithuanians had enough food but they wanted always to trade in. They would give you a\nloaf of bread or half a loaf of bread for a pair of trousers or stockings or a jacket or\nwhatever. I...for reason I remember it was the 31st of December, 1942. My present wife\nsold out...already sold out everything she got, but she...there was left a gown, you know,\nfor the ball, for very festivity...made big festivities. She was a rich woman, so...but\nnobody bought a gown in in in time of war, so we had in the opera house in 1n in Kovno,\nthere were a group of Jewish workers who worked then in the opera house as\ndressmakers, as uh as to make the haircuts and uh you know, __, and they were also\nworking and cleaning the the opera house so I took Pnina and went as workers in that\nbrigade and she took along with her the gown. It was a wonderful gown, you know, and\nwith the...accordingly also a pair of shoes, you know...elegant, and there on the 31st of\nthe...before...the eve of the New Year, the actresses there jumped on this merchandise,\nyou see, and so she she got some bread and and a little bit of uh of uh sugar, you see, for\nthe gown, which costed hundreds and hundreds. Just in one of the examples of one\nfought for the survival of another day, more so when she had a small child and she\nneeded...badly needed milk that you couldn't get in the ghetto, leave alone an egg, you\nsee, so this was an opportunity for her to bring milk and then when she got it all and she\ngot rid of her gown and this, it was a problem how to pass the control at the ghetto gate.\nWhen...at the ghetto gate there always sentries of the ghetto commandant, the German\nghetto commandant, then all the Lithuanians on one side. From inside there were the uh\nemployees of the Jewish labor exchange who used to to arrange the exit of the laborers in\nthe groups from the ghetto out to outside to their places of work and they were...had ways\nand means to bribe certain sent...sentry or the Lithuanian or the German, and so they keep\nuh close... close an eye and and they pass by, take part of 1t and give them as bribe you\nsee, but nevertheless something left, and in this way people tried...tried not to starve, just\nplainly...very plain words...not to starve. And uh some some others used to to get\na...make this deal of trade in above or through the ghetto fence. There was a barbed wire\nfence, two meters high. The Lithuanians knew that there is a shortage of food inside the\nghetto, so they used to come and from a from a distance show a loaf of bread or show a a\nsugar or show five eggs, you see, and the and the...from inside the ghetto they used to\nshow a pair of trousers or a jacket or something like that, and when they...when they nod\nof the of the of the head, they came to to an agreement or they trade in, so when\nthe...along...along the barbed wire always twenty-four hours a day, the sentry used to go\nback and forth, back and forth, so the moment when the sentry used to go, let's say to the\nleft, they used to throw above...above the the uh fence to the Lithuanians and they used to\nto send...to throw above the the food, and we used tocallit =. A . You\nknow whatisa__\u2014s inthe war,a_ ss, andthiswasa \u2014____ merchandise.",
        "Q: Avra...Avraham, tell me, you mentioned the opera house. Is that where the orchestra in\nthe ghetto played or...?",
        "A: No. In Kovno they had a wonderful opera house. It was in the center of the city and they\nhad excellent, excellent Lithuanian...Lithuanian uh singers. Also one Jew was...a\nJew...one of the main singers was a Jew, but the orchestra, the musicians mostly were\nJews and part of them, those who were not killed before entering the ghetto, they were in\nthe ghetto. First-class musicians. For instance, this soloist of the of the musicians,\nyes...he was in the ghetto. A soloist, violinist. And several others. The doorman at the\nuh Jewish committee offices were a first-class pianist. We didn't send them to work\nbecause we wanted to to to save their hands, their fingers, you see, but he was a doorman\nand was very happy to be a doorman. You understand? Others were policemen, you see.\nThey were such policemen like you were but they...this was the way to keep to keep uh\ntheir fingers, you know, that not be entirely...and in addition they were certainly not used\nto hard labor, you see, and some use... can switch over...whenI talk about the _\u2014_ I\nwant to finish with regard to the to the fight and then small children were in danger\nof being killed in the first place because they don't...so what did we do? We arranged a\nso-called vegetable garden guard of young children of the age of eight to twelve. From\nthe age of twelve they could already get a work and be laborers and and a a card, a labor\ncard which was absolutely vital in the ghetto, but what would we do with the children\nfrom eight to twelve, so we organized this. They were a group that was called ss,\n... the the guards of the gardens. We had only vegetable gardens, and the\nvery about about a hundred and yet they had a uniform, you see, and they had\nan arm band and so in this way we could...and these young...youngsters also wanted to\neat, so they used to try, you see, first of all uh when they were in the gardens and the\ngardens were along the ghetto...the ghetto fence, so they also sometimes...being small\nchildren, they used to squeeze through the ope...raise a fence. One keeps the fence...two\npeople comes from both sides. He is a small child so he came through, dig a little bit in\nthe earth, you see, and he went out and brings, sneaks in some bread or something and\nand he makes in the ghetto, you see, so even small children were cautious of the danger\nof starvation and they have knowingly lent into danger of life in order to get some food.",
        "Q: How about the kids that were under eight and twelve, the the children...what did they do\nduring the day? You know, the six year olds or five year olds or four year olds?",
        "A: Oh yes...well, you see, so uh fortunately... unfortunately from the beginning we were\nnot...we were not conscious of the great danger of these children because we never\nthought that they can take children and kill them, but when the the aktion of the 4th of\nOctober, 1941, when they put on fire the contagious hospital in the small ghetto with the\npatients inside, with the uh doctors and with the personnel, medical personnel, all of the\nthem, they were put on fire and they lead...but before they put on fire this building, the\nadjacent building was a children's home, an orphan's home, and there were approximately\nfive, six hundred children so they took them out from the building in the broad...in the\ncourtyard of the...of the contagious diseases hospital and were just plain put them...I can\nnever forget the picture. There were small children and babies, just babies, in the in the\norphan's homes so the Germans when they put them on the on the on the ground, on the\nground, and they just kicked them from one side to the other side with their with their\nboots, the Gestapo men. People like beasts. They behaved just like beef...beasts. They\nused to kick them...when the children laid, for instance, with their faces up to to heaven,\nyes, so they kicked them, then turned down, and then again. This was a just terrible,\nterrible, terrible sight to see it and then they took them from that courtyard straight to the\n9th Fortress and they killed them in the very same day together with another thousand uh\ninmates of the small ghetto, after they put on fire the the the hospital. They did not\nlet...our firemen were very...were the fire brigade in the ghetto...excellent fire...firemen\nwere trained years and they were ready to to to...but they didn't let them come near to the\nplace, you see. There were Lithuanian fire brigades who came close to the close to the uh\nghetto fence, but they came just to safeguard that the fire shouldn't come over to the other\nside of the of the fence. You understand? And this is...so you see they were just not to to\nto fight the fire but to see that the fire shouldn't grow to the other side and uh this was one\nof the most tragic days and what...it is worthwhile mentioning, in that very contagious\ndiseases hospital, you see, we were...we didn't have so much space and so many\nhospitals, so part of this contagious diseases hospital served as a maternity where\nchildren...women gave birth to to children. This, of course, was absolutely\nagainst...contrary to the to the restrictions of of pregnancy and so on, so when they took\nout the uh the uh the uh the uh...they took out from their beds many sick people and they\nbrought them in one place where they couldn't __ for sure. They shouldn't remain\nsometimes in _. _There was left some part of the building, left after the \u2014_, so in\none...they they left...they didn't...they just pass by one room where two women were\nlaying after giving birth to the child, to the babies, and the two babies were on, you know,\non the window there 1s a...big window there is such a...you know, like let's say this is the\nwindow and here is such a small...a small wooden...wooden...",
        "Q: Like a ledge...",
        "A: Yes. So at this two...there are the two children, so when they came to control if\nsomebody was left in the room, so they saw the two women and they were about to take\nthem out, but then one of them saw the children, so he...he came near to the babies and\nthey looked and they looked and they and they...all of a sudden, some human...human\nfeeling came perhaps in in in his in his heart, you see, so he said to the other one, what do\nyou think? Shall we leave these two babies? You see...and in silent they went out and\nthey left the two women with the two children. I...] am telling this to stress that even\namong the murderers were single, very rare, very rare...but there were sometimes people\nwith human feelings and they behaved sd human beings and not like beasts like all their\ntheir comrades. Being with the swastika and over the Nazi, you know, the grey...the grey\nuniform with the with the swastika with all this...to look at them was...one got frightened,\nyou see, but these men, that they came back and they looked at the faces of the baby, he\ncouldn't withheld from being...they they commit...and these two women and these two\nbabies were the only one that left from from from that hospital, you see, and this 1s...this\nis...we always remember it.",
        "Q: Avraham, you brought Esther, the artist...",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "Q: You brought Esther, the artist, to draw scenes from that hospital?",
        "A: Well...so so at that time...at that time, when they liquidated the ghetto, the small ghetto,\nthey took thousand men from the ghetto and they liquidated to the 9th Fortress, so I didn't\nhave any \u2014\u2014_\u2014smorre in '42...1t was...in '41 in the beginning I have to say prior to the\naktions on on human beings, on life, they took...confiscated all the belongings and they\nwere...when the ghetto inmates were ordered under threat of death to give all their gold,\ntheir belongings, their silver, furs, __, post stamps, collections...whatever valuables,\nand there were two stations in the in the...near the Jewish committee where the Jews had\nto bring bring all their belongings and wherever they...while making the searches inside\nthe houses, each other, and sometimes on the spot killing them and and this brought about\nthe people to run and get rid of their gold, to get rid of their silver, to get rid of their of\ntheir of their furs, you see, so we didn't have any cameras anymore. If...1n...on the\n__...1t was in August. The the big...the big confiscation, the total confiscation of\nwhatever people had had with them. Others digged it in the earth or somewhere and they\ndidn't...like Mack (ph)...I'll think about them later, but the the overwhelming majority,\nthey were left without a penny and without any valuable, clothing or or furs or whatever\nit was, so I didn't have a camera anymore, and I thought it is absolutely\npossible...impossible that this event, that this side should not be somehow eternalized for\nposterity, but this already...the ghetto, small ghetto was out of bounds. It was cut off\nfrom from the ghetto. I'm sorry I didn't take along with me my documents. I would have\nshown you. Sol went toto Esther \u2014\u2014_\u2014s, and I told her, Esther, you must draw what\nremained from the burned hospital, so she said how can we come in. It is it is out of\nbounds, so I I went to the commandant of the ghetto and I told him that since it was it\nwas October...in in Lithuania in October it is already cold and very cold and we had no\nfirewood in the ghetto and what they used to give us, just like the hundred grams of\nbread, this was the same story with the with the firewood, so I told them in the small\nghetto, some families left some firewood. Would he allow us to take out from this from\nthese dwellings inside the small ghetto, to take out the firewood? So he he...and I don't\nremember that I mentioned it yesterday that the commandant of the ghetto, mostly they\nwere elderly men and they were not so, you know, fanatic like this, so they had\nunderstanding...he had understanding for this and he tells me alright, I give you two\nhours, two hours to go in into the into the...so I said I need a uh a wagon, you know, but I\ndidn't need a wagon. I wanted that Esther, so he he gave a wagon and I took Esther and I\nwent in inside there and we stood and we looked where would be the best position\ngeographically for Esther __, to the painter, to stand and to paint it, but to paint from\noutside would be would be very dangerous because they could have killed us on the spot\nbecause all the time the sentries go around the gate...the the fence, so I decided that we\nshould go inside a building and the adjacent building from the left side of the burned\nhospital was a two-story house so we went into this story...two-story and we arrived on\nthe second floor and Esther from the the window from which she could have a good look\non the remain...what remained from the hospital and she painted and she drawed and she\ndraw and this is what she have made it, but all of a sudden when...as she paints she...and I\nam on the outlook...all of a sudden I hear somebody went in in the first floor so I got\nfrightened to death because if they would found us, Esther... probably it would have been\nthe finish for her, and I was responsible. I'm the bad guy that brought her about her about\nit, you see, and I felt terrible, frightened to death, so I went closer to the staircase in order\nto see who is there, so that when they heard the...my footsteps so they run out. What\nhappened? These were Lithuanians who had...who came in just to to to to steal and to\ntake away what the Jews have left, so you see this was also...and this __\u2014_\u2014scibut to to\nlearn the moment of danger to death was always there and uh she has done it and, of\ncourse, I took her some firewood from the house, from another house and be...behind the\nfirewood I put the the drawings of Esther \u2014\u2014_\u2014s and we safe came back to the to the\nghetto. There was another place where Itook Esther \u2014_\u2014_._I don't know. I think I\nmentioned to you that the...were the _ of the Lithuanians in the...in Slobodka. This is\nthe very suburb where later was the ghetto, that on on the very beginning, on the...at the\nnight of June 25th to the 26th, the Lithuanians massacred thousand Jews in the\nSlobodka...in the Slobodka suburb. They just went from street to street and one of the\nhouses...I I...then I I'm always after to see what it looks like, but they closed up the area\nand nobody could go in and and the and the houses after they have been looted, they\nclosed up with uh wooden blocks and uh and uh and plywood so you couldn't go in inside\nthe the the houses because it was locked from __. Anyhow, I I went in with Esther\n_____ and one house that I knew was a a Zionist leader. He was the director of the\ninin Lithuania. ____s~was his name, a famous veteran Zionist. His wife was a\ndentist, and I wanted to know what happened to him, sol took Esther _ again and,\nyou know, I am a sportsman so for me to to, you know, toto _, that was not sucha\nbig problem, but for Esther _, it was not easy. So first of all I had to to take off\nsome wooden...how do you call it...the such uh they closed the the doors...",
        "Q: The panels.",
        "A: Panels. Yes. Panels. Board (ph) of panels...but they were only only with nails, not\nvery...not very steady, not very strong so I could easily take it off, you see, and we\nscurried (ph). First of all I went in and then I made it broader so Esther could\ngo in and then I took it again, so from the outside it was as as it was before before we\nclimbed in and we climbed in in the house. What we have seen was a terrible, terrible\nthing. There were three rooms. In one room was the head of ______ and his body was\nonthe onthe \u2014_. _ There was blood on the on the walls. Uh you know, all the feathers\nfrom the from the from the from the beds and from...it was full in in...and also with with\nwith blood...the feathers from the __ and from the couches and so on. It was just\nterrible to look at it, and that the second room was the uh dentist's...his wife was a dentist\nand there was the the, you know, the dentist's special equipment and this stool and\nshe...the wife was slain on the on the on the on the stool of the dentist and dead. II\ncan't...when she painted it, she painted the the the one room of of the \u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014s*house and we\nhave it in her in her album.",
        "Q: What was your reaction when you saw this?",
        "A: It was terrible. It was just terrible but but but you you had no way out. You had to...so so\nuntil until until Esther _...you know, I had to calm her down and to calm myself down\nfirst of all, but I brought her in. I'm responsible for her and she's there and she painted\nit...and she painted it. And she cried and she cried and then she painted and cried again\nand this was a terrible thing. Look, there wasinthe == where _\u2014_\u2014swwere, [havea\nphoto, one of my photos, of a yeshivamanonhis __,onhis__\u2014_\u2014_\u2014_,on the\nand with his talis (ph) on himself. He \u2014\u2014__ so killed, so he he\nremained on it, so this was one of the paintings and there were many other paintings like\nthat that I went on in order to produce visual evidence to what I have writ...I have written,\nbecause nobody would would...I said to myself and I told it to myself...who would\nbelieve what I am writing. It is out of human understanding and it is out of what any\ncommunity in the world could think of. A barb...barbarism is not the right word for it.\nAnd...but I was lucky enough that Esther sand Joseph Schleslinger (ph), and then\nthere was another...another uh...on the 11th of January, 1942, the German Gestapo\nordered to the one area of the ghetto, the _\u2014_ area, to...they should vacate their their\ndwellings within four hours and whoever will be found in the in their dwelling in this\narea after the expires the four hours, you will be shot on the spot without any\nclarifications and whatever will be remain of their belongings will be confiscated. They\nsaid, the Gestapo said that they need the area and these dwellings to settle the Jews who\nare to come at this very day from Germany and from Austria, five thousand Jews. That\narea lived only three thousand, but they squeezed...so when we heard, we took it for\ngranted that first of all five thousand Jews are coming to the ghetto and Dr. Elkes, the\nhead of the Jewish Council, said we have to meet them as brothers, give them the feeling\nthey are coming to brothers, so he ordered that the women should prepare hot coffee for\nthem because the terrible cold...in January was the thirty...thirty centigrades\nbelow...below uh below uh below...thirty below...the most hard winter in the ghetto was\nin 1942. Dr. Elkes himself stood all the day from the beginning whenever we we got\nword of that five thousand are to come in the ghetto, he stood at the main gate with\nseveral people, and with women who were ready to give them...offer them coffee. He felt\nvery much...and he he says I can understand the feeling that these people were taken out\nfrom the houses, from the from the countries, and they don't know where they're being\nbrought. At least give them a greeting for...when they will have to cross the gate behind\nbarbed wires, they should...barbed wires they should know that they're coming with\nbrothers. So we...those inmates from this area to be vacated in four hours didn't have any\ntransportation. They were not allowed to to use transportation, horses or wagons, so they\ndragged, you know, in their hands, bundles on their on their shoulders. They uh...some\nuh some uh home uh utensils like uh like uh for children to bath, you know, the...it was\nused to drag it and on the snow. You understand? I I saw the the the the picture of all the\npeople frightened to death to be in time not to remain there after the...1t was just...I said\nthis scene I must put on a drawing, and then I didn't find Esther \u2014\u2014_\u2014s, so I run to...there\nwas one young...the youngest painter in the ghetto. He was Schmidt. Schmidt, Joseph\nSchmidt, but we called him , aanickname as , and when I came to\n____'s home, I found him. I was the happiest man. Isaid _ come quick and take\nsome paint, some pencils with you and paper. We have to to to paint this...we have to\nrush to the _ area, paint the exile, the exile of...the expulsion. And when he didn't...he\nhe he was not conscious of the of the urgency. Every minute counts...I would say not\nminute...but every hour counts, and he slowly...[ said _\u2014_\u2014, quick. Have no time...I\ndidn't...nothing. So he he took another coat, of course, as it was very cold, and took some\npaper and and and some pen. In addition to the pen and pencil, he took color paints. I\nsaid what for does he need these color paints, but he didn't listen to me at all and he took\neverything, put under his under his overcoat and bring just running. It was far away from\nhis...1t was on the other side of the ghetto. Running we came to the site and there I had to\nfind a place where he could stand and make his paintings that should not be seen by the\nGermans, not even before Jews. You understand? And he stood in a certain place which\nhe found...he found a place we thought for him \u2014_ and I stood on the outlook and then\nI called for two of our underground...there were...everybody went to this area to help\nthem take out...to help them. Everybody tried to help them, so Esther took two of my\nknown members of the underground and said you, you just cover that his body it __ that\nnobody should see him, you see, and I stood onthe _ and he painted and he painted\nand he painted andI toldhim, __, quick, finish, . Every minute can come a\nGestapo and then it it will finish not only for your painting but it finish then to you and to\nme, but he didn't give in and he painted and he painted and this is now one of the most\ncharacteristic paintings of the of the Holocaust in Lithuania. It is in my book, with\ncolors, oil painting, so this was and this was the the the liquidation of that\nquarter. The Jews came from Germany, but they were sent straight to the 9th Fortress\nand were killed the very same day and the part, the area was cut off from the ghetto.",
        "Q: And the three...",
        "A: I beg your pardon.",
        "Q: ...and the three thousand that were moved...where did they go?",
        "A: No. They didn't...they cut off from the ghetto. They had to to squeeze in in in the\nremaining part of the ghetto. You understand? And the tension was even higher and\npainful, more painful than it was because three thousand had to squeeze in in anyway\nof the ghetto.",
        "Q: How did you learn that the five thousand were taken to the fort and just killed?",
        "A: We have seen them. You see, Dr. Elkes at the gate was waiting for their coming, and all\nday Dr. Elkes didn't drink even not cold water. He was in such shape, tense, waiting,\nexpecting, and they didn't come and they didn't come. In the afternoon, they were\nbrought and you know, the way to the 9th Fortress comes along...it's a half a kilometer,\nhalf a mile, from the ghetto fence, up on the hill it goes, and you can see. Everybody in\nthe ghetto could see and we saw them. They came...these five thousand men, and then\nhow did I...we know? As I told you, in the Gestapo building worked a group of Jewish\ninmates from the ghetto in cleaning, in in , In in in in the cleaning the the the\nlavatories, in in uh and all kinds of...so they, when they came back, they came\nthe next morning to work, they could see many many suitcases and bundles with names\nof from Berlin, from Frankfurt, the name of the Jew...you know, the the Gestapo\ntook...they looted their their belongings and they brought...you see, and they threw away\nthe uh the suitcases and the bundles and you could see the names and addresses of the\npeople who were brought in, so we were...there was no lot of doubt that this were the five\nthousand who were killed in the very same day on the 9th Fortress.",
        "Q: So what the Gestapo did is they took their things? They took things that they wanted?",
        "A: Always they take. First of all, they take off the rings, the gold and then they take they\ncount the valuables, and they put them in their hip pockets. They don't bring it to the\nGestapo. You understand? From the board where the suitcases, on the trucks...so we had\nalways several size that are workers in that building uh used to work and uh this was also\none day in the ghetto unexpected. You never knew what the next day will bring you.\nThere is a very nice poetry, Russian language...what does you today or tomorrow bring\nupon us. . What expect us...what brings to us the next day? Will it be\nday of sorrow, of pain, or will it bring to us a new hope, a new joy? It is a very, very nice\npoet from a very famous uh Russian poet. We don't like the Soviets, but we like very\nmuch the poetry and their language and their literature. I am telling you I I I was uh I\nwas...] lived...Lithuania was under under these Russian czars and I studied law, the\nRussian law, not the Bolshevik law. Come back to the ghetto.",
        "Q: So with that, I mean you never knew what the next day would bring. How did people\nkeep their spirits to go on?",
        "A: So so...you know, there were...there were...there were...there were various kinds of\nreactions. There were people in the ghetto that didn't...they they thought maybe this is\nthe last day so why not eat? Why not drink, that people will manage to bring in, to\nsmuggle in...we calledthem __...the smugglers of the gate or the smugglers of the\nfence. You see, ,in Yiddish, \u2014_\u2014_\u2014s\u00ab, and smugglers, when they used to\nmake...they turned it into a trade and they used to make big money. They even got to eat\nmeat and and butter and eggs. Said let's eat. Tomorrow we will not...we will not...even\non the eve of the of the 28th of October, people were...most of the people were in tension\nand and didn't know what is going to happen tomorrow. Others thought this is the last\nday, so they used to concentrate in their thoughts, in their minds. Others took out\neverything that they had and said they will eat up everything, not to leave for the\nGermans the next day anything. You see? It...look...1t's thirty thousand people. It is not\naa...you don't think by order. You don't act as somebody would expect you to act.\nEveryone in his own way. You understand? And so there was a very very thin...a very\nthin group of people who ate in meat, in butter, in eggs, a very thin few...those were the\nsmugglers, but they, of course, uh uh rescued their...risked their life. Some of them were\nkilled. You know, youcanuhmakea___ once, twice, but the third time you...a bullet\ncomes and finish...finishes you. You understand? For instance, Dr. Elkes and all\nthose...he was close to starvation. Although he was very...again and again offered by the\nsmugglers, we'll bring you butter. We'll bring you this. He never accepted not a piece of\nbread. He used to share with me my my piece of bread, you see, or offer me his piece of\nbread, but he would never never have any connections with smugglers which we thought\nit's...the underground...it's the...what we are trying to fight, just to keep the standard of of\nhuman of human behavior, of Jewish heritage, to keep alive even under these terrible\ncircumstances of the ghetto, and this is only thanks to Dr. Elkes and to those leaders who\nwere known as community leaders before the war and they were elected by...elected, and\nthis was the difference, the big difference between the ghetto of Kovno leadership and the\nleadership in other...1n other ghettos.",
        "Q: Avraham, let me ask you quickly...we had gone over to another story and I wanted to ask\nyou, what was done with the children who were under eight years old? What did they\ndo? Were they educated? Were there schools in the ghetto they kept underground?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. A very good question. From the very beginning we didn't have to\neat. We didn't have a hospital, but we started immediately with schools. We had\nwonderful educators, teachers, everything in Hebrew of course. Not only did we have\nschools, Hebrew schools. We taught reading and and writing, mathematics, geography,\nbut we had also a a special school artisans...artisans and in the ghetto was a...one...an\nengineer, who was the head of _____ schools in Lithuania which is a famous\nworld-wide artisan, Jewish artisan schools, and he was the...heading the artisan schools in\nthe ghetto, and also...but we had to close up the schools in the winter because of lack of\nfirewood, because the lack of firewood. The next time we had to close by order of the\nGestapo because it is ...Jews...in their mind the final solution was what do we\nneed schools to learn. What we... work as teachers, let them go to work and the\neducators, are they going to work. But even after the restricted to half and then\nliquidated, ordered to liquidate the schools, we had it in clandestine. Had it in\nclandestine.",
        "Q: How did you...how did...how did you do that?",
        "A: Yes. So first of all, we we said we need to train youngsters to for as artisans that is so\nmuch needed for the German war effort, so this they understood, so it was that the school\nit was a course for preparing of artisans, but it wasn't...for all things and purposes it\nwas...1t was a school. Yes. Second, we did it just in in in the underground. You see, in\nthe evenings and so and private groups, they just volunteered. You understand? It was a\nvery hard task, but we had a...the head of the of the cultural department in the ghetto was\nDr. Shapiro (ph), Shapiro, who was a a lecturer, senior lecturer at the University on\nSemitic languages and Semitic literature, you see. When all Jews were go into the ghetto\ntook along with them their bundles, whatever they were allowed...they weren't allowed to\ntake everything, but they had...but some belonged...he came to the committee for the\ntransfer of Jews and asked to transfer to the ghetto his...a newly edited published book,\nthe Hebrew...the history of Hebrew literature in two thousand two hundred pages. A\nbook...you can imagine...where did we have this place to to to keep them in the ghetto or\nto or to store them, but this is what he was very excited about that he should...1t was one\nof the outstanding monumental work...the history of the modern Hebrew literature and uh\nhe was the head of the of the cultural department and he...you know, we had also from\nthe children, you see, we tried to keep for them the holidays children should know.",
        "Q: Hold on a second. Do we have tape? Are we...OK...tell me about the holidays?",
        "A: So first of all there was kindergarten. One day comes to me...there was a uh a teacher of\nthe kindergarten, a very well-known Mrs. _____. She was in the kindergarten\nbefore...before the war and in the ghetto she volunteered to to held the kindergarten, of\ncourse in clandestine. Very very clandestine. So , the daughter of my wife, my\npresent wife, she went also to the kindergarten and one day Mrs. ___\u2014_\u2014s comes to me,\n____, and says we must arrange for the children, for the poor children, some joy. It's\n__, wantstobe \u2014_\u2014_, and we have to make some festivity of the poem, and for that\npurpose I need colored paper (laughter)...colored paper because, you know, they have to\nhave colored paper. So I...the way she asked me, I couldn't say no, but where can you\nget it. I hardly got the paper for...needed for the secretariat, for the for the Jewish office,\ncommunity offices and the departments, so I used to go to the city and make an order\nwith the with the civil authorities, German civilian authorities, the stock commissar.\nThere was a form that uh you filled out, and I put in there colored paper...red, yellow, so\nwhen I came and presented this _\u2014___...itcalls_\u2014\u2014\u2014._:\u2018It 1s...you order...an order...a\nformal order, and the quantities. Said what do you need the colored papers for. So I told\nthem, what do you mean? We need for the...to put the brigades when they go out to cities\nthey should know this is the yellow people, other people...other people said they are in\nalphabetical. They don't know, so you have to put a yellow...yellow here and a red one\nthere and green there. To cut a long story short, he gave me half of the portion that I\nneeded, but I was the happiest man to come back in the ghetto (laughter) and she teased\nme when I gave her the the paper, you see, and then they played...you know, the famous\nplayof = ~\u2014=andEsther =\u2014=and =~=\u2014s was waselectedtobethe \u2014__... She\nplayed Esther _\u2014_.._ The...the only hall where we could have the the _ festivities, a\nhall was from a yeshiva that was empty you see, so in that former yeshiva, there was the\nfestivities and the mothers, mostly widows, mostly widows, could see their children on\nthe stage, you know, dressed in the pretty clothes they had. Everyone could find a little\n_____, you know, to to have their child, and they wept in tears and they listened to these\nsongs and to the play and uh nevertheless the the Dr. Elkes and the mainly Dr. Shapiro,\nthe head of the cultural department introduced what does itmean ___ for the for\nthe...and what did the symbol...the symbolic meaning of poem for nowadays the situation\nin the ghetto and that it was an__ and Hitler is nothing...Hitler is nothing else but a\nnew _and from...we have to know that his end will be as the end of ____ and those\ndays, so Hitler was a symbol. This was a very very moving...we\nwe we were full of joy of the children, but the tears was in more moving things, you see, and this\nwas the festivalof",
        "Q: The tears of the mothers?",
        "A: Of the mothers...and not only of the mothers. Not only of the mothers. I was very much\nclose to to because of of Pnina. We started then the and I tried to help her\nto get some firewood for her. I told her yesterday that I brought her the first package\nfrom the nurse, you see, so and then and then we had also for the adults, for instance,\nHannuaka or . We arranged, for instance, a third , a third seider (ph). Usually\nyou have two seiders for the , for the passover, but we arranged a third seider for the\nZionist underground, that mainly for the youth, of course, and then Dr. Shapiro...I can\nremember...\nEND OF TAPE 4, SIDE 1",
        "A: ..circle that we used to hear what news what's going on 1n the...",
        "A: ...SO Many progroms and so many hardships in various inquisition in Spain and then\nin Russia and so on. Uh this no problem about it, but this was not only the ghetto in\nthe\npublic gatherings that we tried to arrange, but in private talk day in, day out, the widows used to\ncome to me...",
        "Q: Hold on one second, Avraham. I'm sorry. We're just changing tapes now. We'll pick up\nfrom where you are.\nEND OF TAPE 4, SIDE 2",
        "Q: OK, Avraham, we're going to start with the underground and the Zionist movement, the\nZionist resistance movement. Tell me how that was established, what some of your\nactivities were, and who some of the leaders were.",
        "A: Yes. Now uh the the situation prior to our being incarcerated in the ghetto behind barbed\nwires, the uh terrible attacks and killings of uh Jews in the streets of Kovno, right after\nthe outbreak of the war until the the incarceration in the ghetto, called for immediate\nresistance because we had a...also even under the Soviet occupation, 1940, June 1940 to\nJune 1941, we had also a clandestine Zionist...Zionist uh movement or leadership let's say\nit was, but this is entirely different character. While under the Bolsheviks it was our\nmain aim to assist the families economically. Of the leaders we were being arrested right\non the first days of occupation, they were arrested. They were taken to Siberia. Second,\nto try and ourselves try and avoid our own exile to Siberia. It was very clear that uh\nthe...under the Soviet occupation, not only were we were able to to to maintain our\nHebrew schools, Hebrew education. They closed up immediately. They closed\nup...liquidated all the Jewish institutions leave alone the Zionist parties and movement\nand so on, but what we had is a really in the very sense of the wor...of the word, to try\nand to keep away from arrest and to keep out hiding. We were hiding. I, for instance,\nwere were hiding from the moment when I was told my brother-in-law was not a Zionist.\nMy sister, means my sister, she was religious and Zionist-minded woman and she was the\noldest sister, . She didn't allow me to live in a pri...in a in a...somewhere\nelse but with her, to stay with her all the years that I studied at the University of Kovno\nlaw. Yes. She was very much devoted. She was Zionist and she was religious. To the\ncontrary, my my brother-in-law, her husband Benjamin, a very decent, very honest and\nvery fine person, he wasn't...he was uh in the so-called...there was a movement of Jewish\nleft, Bundists (ph)...",
        "Q: Bundists...",
        "A: Bundists. And he was a Bundist. He...there was a Jewish Bundist paper in Lithuania, the\nthe . was the name of the Jewish paper which were the organ of the\nBundists in in Lithuania.",
        "Q: So how was the Zionist resistance different than that ? You said they...they\nsupported people economically. Then how...?",
        "A: I I'll come immediately. And then we were assisting one another. He told me...my\nbrother know this what I've told you but remember, it was...he told me, look Avraham,\nyou're on the list to be exiled to Siberia, so just try to to to...from the surface...disappear.\nSo I told him wait a minute. I will sleep with you. He says what? You'll sleep with\nme...if they want to find you, you will...they will come to me. They know that I am your\nbrother-in-law and they know that...your sister. So I finally tried hiding in various places\nin the outskirts. I run away to Vilna (ph), to Vilna. Yes...which was then the capital of\nLithuania, and in Vilna I found out who...with whom could I make contact, also Zionist\nleaders, but they themselves were hiding, so we are hiding together in a park, ina ina\nlane, you know, uh somewhere out...in the outskirts of the city, and it was an absolutely\nimpossible situation. You understand? And to the end, you know, I couldn't...couldn't\nsee any other way out but to come back to Kovno, and when I came back to Kovno, two\ndays later...",
        "Q: The invasion...",
        "A: The invasion...German...German war break out and so as I said yesterday, I went from\nthe from the pot to the to the fire. The the resistance in the ghetto or even before we were\nincarcerated in the ghetto, was entirely of different character and entirely of different\ndimensions and entirely different aims so uh when the historic and dramatic meeting or\nassembly of the Jewish...of the Jews...Jewish leadership of Kovno to elect a over-Juder\n(ph), a chief Jew, and this...and the committee, in the very same place, in the very same\nschool, former school, two hours later we we held a meeting in another room of this very\nsame school for leaders of the various Zionist groups. Uh there was the...a member of the\nleft-wing | movement, pioneer movement, who I recall ; and then\nthere was the labor movement. You had the labor movement, and then was the \u00a9\nand then were the general Zionists.",
        "Q: Do you remember their names?",
        "A: Oh of course. They were my best friends, so to start with =~ Goldschmidt. He is now\nSam Goldsmith, Saul Goldsmith in Chicago. Yes. Uhthe second one was\u2018 Kohn\nfrom the labor. By the way, this Saul Goldsmith was from the very left, uh .\nAnd is now quite a millionaire, you see, and uh the second one was____\u2014_.. Belkahn\n(ph). Belkahn...he lives in New York. He from the labor movement. The...from the\nwere the head, the chairman of the movement in Lithuania,\norasIcallhim, _, who passed away in Israel two years ago, and uh myself\nrepresenting the Zionists, general Zionist movement. Three or four. Right after joined us\na fifth one, very active. This was , Issac . He was most uh instrumental\nbecause he was a pharmacy and the...was the head of the oldest pharmacy in the ghetto,\nand since we considered that the pharmacy is the most place that nobody will think of\nthat there is any hidings or some contra...contrary Nazi activities, so we below the...below\nthe the pharmacy where there was a cellar and in this cellar we arranged uh to have\none...to listen to a radio from abroad. The...it was the only... . This is what you\nhave from the...to to listen, you see. we used to go down the the the pharmacy\nin the cellar and listen to radio. Mostly himself would listen but because each one was\nbusy in certain tasks and then we used to come frequently...once a week, even sometimes\nmore...but this was really top secret. Also for all various groups. Inevertoldmy |\nfrom general Zionists that we have a leadership of the uh of the for...of the underground\nin the ghetto resistance. What I told them is that we have first of all, to be organized\nourselves, keep together, be ready to oppose the Nazis. For instance, after the 28th of\nOctober, we had a decision of the underground, of the all the the the underground, the\nZionist underground was called Kovno. ____ the the letters, the initials as\n. as you know, the Hebrew...in English to translate it is, in in in distress, in\nin in uh...not sulk. You are in a very hard position. You cannot move. You are\nsurrounded and you are 1n in 1n in in a uh in a very bad situation, let's say...and uh the\n__, wecalled \u2014\u2014_\u2014_\u2014_ always to be on the alert, to tell us, to signal us whatever they\nknow in their dwellings or in their working places, what they have heard and what they\nknow, to bring us the news, so we used to concentrate after the day of work when they\nused to come back from the works from the places, they used to to report to us on what\nthey have heard that day.",
        "Q: Where would you meet, Avraham? Would you meet...be hidden someplace...? How\nmany of you would be...?",
        "A: We...we...first of all, there was only small, very small _, four, five. Not more. Six\nwas the maximum, so we used to...we meet either in a a in a in one's dwelling or\nsomewhere on the vegetable gardens as if we are working those vegetables. Sometimes\nwe meet in the center of the village because...or or in the or in the cellar of the of the uh\npharmacy. Because for us was...we were cut off of the outer world. This was exactly the\nvery meaning of the Germans by setting up the ghettos. First of all to keep us behind\nbarbed wire. We cannot go out. We cannot have any contact. We didn't have\ntelephones, and later when we had telephones, it was also for the...only for the\ninner...1nner communication between the pol...Jewish police and the and the and the\nGerman commando of the ghetto for even...for his convenience, not for the convenience\nof the Jews. Or there was a a telephone in the Jewish committee, in the labor department,\nand so on, for the convenience of the Germans, not for us. But we knew to exploit also\nthese. For instance, the telephone...there was at the gate, there was a service police\nstation at the at the ghetto gate, Jewish police station. For the other side, outer side, there\nwas a German's and the Lithuanian's police. Inside there was the Jewish police, so\nwhatever...if...whenever some top official of the Gestapo or of the Wermacht or the stock\ncommissar, entered the ghetto immediately they signal by phone to us. In the Jewish\ncommittee it was myself. In the labor, we had another man. In the police, we had\nanother man and this used to come . Immediately...if there...for instance,\nwhen Roka came into the ghetto, we were...the the streets were cleaned up. Everybody\nrun away and then so we used first of all together use or information on what is\ntranspiring in the various places of work in the ghetto and what they have heard and there\nwere rumors more than than facts, you see, but even the rumors for us...we...not having\nany kind of communication with another city. There were three ghettos in Lithuania.\nThe Kovno ghetto, the Vilna ghetto andthe _ ghetto, but there was no communication\nso the first work what the Zionist underground have done, to establish a communication\nbetween the Kovno ghetto underground and the Vilna ghetto underground.",
        "Q: How did you do that? What did you do?",
        "A: Oh, this is a good question. You are a very intelligent interviewer, I will tell you. So you\nsee, there was a Jewish...Jewish worker group...worker...who worked at the railway\nstation in Kovno, and we the the head of this group, usually a group of workers...in in the\nterminology of the ghetto it was a brigade...a brigade, and the head of the brigade was\nSilverman (ph), who was a member of the underground, so we called him and told\nhim to listen. You are working at the railway station. There are going trains day in, day\nout from Kovno to Vilna. Try to bribe one of the workers of the of the railway...of\nthe...of the...who are working on the train, yes, so as to get that you could send some\nletters from Kovno ghetto to the leaders of the underground in the in the Vilna ghetto,\nwhom we knew. And this Silverman succeeded in bribing the man who drive...the driver\nof the train...how do you call it...the driver of the train...the loco...",
        "Q: Conductor...",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Conductor of the locomotive. You see? And first I remember he came, right, give\nme...So we gave him ten letters. Each one of us knew one or two from the Zionist,\nprevious Zionist leaders in the in the in Vilna. For instance, I knew ___ was from\nthe youth Zionist general youth movement, so I sent to him a letter. The others sent to\ntheir...to their respective __ in Vilna and we and the same Silverman gave these ten\nletters. Of course, it's not easy to take out ten letters from the ghetto because if they\nwould find...if they would check him on the date when he goes out as head of the brigade\nand finds the letters, it was the end of him and of all the brigade, so you you you had to\nbe very, very careful. But he succeeded and he and he he bribed this conductor of the\nlocomotive, of the train, and uh he was supposed to give these to one of the underground\ninthe or = \u2014\u2014._~\u2014_sSwas from the, you know, the name. He was one of the\nleaders of the Vilna ghetto and the Glaserman (ph) was the leader of the \u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014, so each\none sent to his man in Vilna, and luckily the next day, he brought letters from them. This\nwas something that opened our eyes and our minds and you couldn't know but of course\nthis was...the the letters were restricted to several lines only because...",
        "Q: What did they say?",
        "A: Yes. So first of all, we are telling them in a in a in a very...1n our own language to make\nthem understand that we are trying with them...saying that we are organized, that we are\ntrying tokeep _ together, and from time to time we meet, and we are trying...we are\ntrying to keep the the mood of ____ and give them the feeling they are...they are not\nalone. They...its give them to renew the sense of belonging so that gives them also more\nsecurity, more defense, that in case something happens, they know they have to...they...as\never a man to whom they can go and open their arms and their pains and and their\nproblems and so on, and there were, believe me, everyone had a full heart and pains\nhimself or his family or his parents, or his friends, and that we want to geta_  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014s./ We\ndidn't say it like that. We want to get from you a . You understand? And we\ndidn't have to put the more words in the in the few lines that we wrote because we\nwere...had to be ready that it will be detained and then go and explain. And so it was that\nwe got first...the first contact with the with the Zionist underground in the ghetto of\nVilna, and we developed later on also to send letters from families from the ghetto of\nKovno to families in the ghetto of Vilna.",
        "Q: Avraham, tell me what those first letters from Vilna that came to you...you told us what\nyour letters were to them. What were those first letters to you...?",
        "A: First of all, he tells me, for instance, this 1s what he said. First of all I am very pleased to\nhear that you survived, that you live, that you are among the living. Second, I am the\nsame...I am pleased to tell you that I and my wife and my brother-in-law and my sister-\nin-law and _ and this, this and this is already...this is in Siberia and this is there and\nthis was killed. The names of the leaders, the former leaders, you see...this is what _,\nandeven _ of who is and who 1s not, and believe me, this was most important. You\nsee? And then uh in the next letters...already we started always your problem...food or is\nthe problem of labor, what are the the possibilities of uh of uh fight... __... we didn't say\nfight... ...yousee. We knew...we want to know...again I must say a...quote a Russian\nsaying. They say a man...a aa bird that is in distress knows exactly how to keep a most\neither shout or cry very aloud the form out express ourselves and tell what...what...what\nis...what is their interfering or what is their desire, you see, so the situation brought about\nto bring our news that we wanted to to transfer to the...to the \u2014\u2014_\u2014sain Vilna, was ina\nvery, very masked vocabulary, and we used to say the next time, or _\u2014_, whatever\nit is, you see, and we used then the slang or just uh new words that wouldn't mean to\nanything...to any...nothing to anybody but for us it was understood \u2014\u2014_\u2014_\u2014s Gestapo we\ndidn't mention the name Gestapo would be in another form __ of this.",
        "Q: Did you share information about the deportations or the liquidation of the ghettos?",
        "A: Of course. Of course. This was the first thing which we have done, and we wanted for\nthem to _. Then we wanted to know...certain family when they started to write, they\nwanted to know about their members...there were certain families that part of them were\nin the Vilna ghetto and part of them were in the Kovno ghetto. For instance, my wife, her\nbrother, two brothers were in Vilna, and this was the first time that she learned that that\nhe is alive while the other brother was killed, and this was the first time, and the very first\nuh communications. So when more more letters were sent and we had to distribute the\nletters to to the to the inmates of the ghetto, we used the...we had an office of statistics in\nthe ghetto, administration. We didn't speak about it but uh statistics. We...they wrote\nevery birth and every passing away from the ghetto, every marriage. We had marriage in\nthe ghetto. Life went on. Of course, a good...there was a bar mitzvah in the ghetto and\nuh and and I want to tell you...I must tell it. Once I was sitting in my office in the Jewish\ncommittee and all of a sudden I got a call from the workshop, big workshops in the\nghetto. We had big workshops that worked eighteen hundred, mostly women who could\nnot go out of work from outside the ghetto, and there were a carpentry and tailorship and\nand plumbers and uh and uh and uh washing, cleaning...all for the German army, but\nwe...and so so uh the German supervisor of the ghetto used to come to the Jewish\ncommittee or he used to come straight to the workshop. There for...he liked very much to\ngo to the workshop because he could order a suit for himself, a pair of boots, from his\nwife he ordered dresses. It didn't cost him money, you know, sent, so all of a sudden I\nget... get a call from the workshop, big workshops uh that I should immediately come.\nMiller is there. Miller was the deputy commissar who were at the supervision of\nthe ghetto and when Miller says I should come immediately, I have to come immediately.\nSo on my way from the Jewish Committee to the ghetto workshops, I passed by a small\nlane, a street... it's not a street...1t 1s a a...",
        "Q: An alley?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: An alley?",

In Lithuania, mostly...ninety-nine percent were not Haisidic...opposing, but\nthis were several Haisidic.

This is, my friend, part of the\nresistance. It's nothing but revolt against the German order, strict order to press us, to\ndehumanize us. We shouldn't think of bar mitzvah and we shouldn't think of holy days,\nand we should think only only slavery, work, on the very hard work that we should think\nonly how to get another piece of bread and not think of \u2014 and not think of holy days\nand not think of bar mitzvah and so forth and so on. This is the day in, day out resistance\nof the common man, the inmates inside the ghetto, and this is what kept them alive,\nbecause _\u2014s isa great meaning. \u2014___1s when the...the Jews were in the desert and\nthey had no place to live and they built tents and they were lived forty years but they live\nin tents where they lived.

        "Q: We can stop now. Do you want some more water? (Pause)",
        "A: But of course we had much more serious things to do. We...the four of us or more\nprecisely the five of us, the leaders of the underground, before they found us,\nleadership, we made a final decision...after the 28th of October, no\nmore respond to orders of concentrating on one place of all the...of the all the ghetto or\nnot even part of it. No more. And to resist, to oppose and really it happened so that I\nthink a month or six weeks afterwards, there was the order to report on the very same\nsquare. They need five hundred workers to be sent to Riga (ph), from the Kovno ghetto\nto the Riga ghetto. We believed no more what they say because they said the five\nhundred, they were to to the archive and they were killed. They said they need to to to\nmake order to divide between those who get more bread and those who get less bread,\nand they killed ten thousand so this __ that we had no confidence whatsoever and we\nmade up our minds no more response to...and then they tried...they started to grab people\nfrom the street, and they could grab three hundred because most of the people from the\nghetto were at work outside the ghetto and when they didn't succeed in getting the\npeople, so they took these three hundred and brought them to the place, to the democratic\nsquare. I went there and saw the sight. At that time there was __ and the supervisor\nof the ghettoin =~. He was a mass murderer, and he...all of a sudden I hear that he\nsays maybe those will want to volunteer to walk to walk to Riga should make five steps\nahead, and I was sure nobody will will go, but there were five who stepped ahead, and\nfinally I disclosed that these five were insane or very...not insane but crazy people. For\ninstance, I...one of them was a former high officer of the Lithuanian army and I thought\nwhat what... was his name...soI said \u2014\u2014_\u2014s, why did you volunteer? Do you\nknow...are you sure that you want to to work in Riga? Don't you know what happened\nwith the five hundred. He says he's _. Kovno alone must know that I am a crazy\nman. _.. LetalsoRigaknowthatI am __and this only showed you who you are\ntalking with, and also this type of people were in the ghetto. Now this was one thing.\nFir...second, for...when Elkes was going in town to meet the chief of the Gestapo, I\nalways tried to escort him...from a distance, of course, Just in case something happens.\nNow we...we...our clandestine uh uh ___ that lasted for five months and then they were\ncaught andthe man, _\u2014\u2014_\u2014S was put in the Gestapo. He was always almost killed. They\narrested the the the main clerks in the Jewish Committee...first of all the secretary of the\nJewish Committee, Berenstein (ph). He had not the slightest idea because I have done\nnothing. They arrested the chief of the statistic bureau although he had no idea but his\nassistant deputy. They arrested the main uh the mainuh clerk __ of the of the office\nof the altestenrat. They had not the slightest idea but Elkes turned heaven to earth and\nearth to heaven until he got them free. You see, and this was...but he was not allowed to\nbe any more the secretary of the of the Jewish committee and so I became the secretary in\nMay '42. Then when we had in course of our correspondence we were told that they have\npartisan groups in the forests around Vilna and this was far behind...from Kovno more\nthan a hundred kilometers, and that they will be ready to assist if we send a group to\nthose forests so they should come to Vilna and from Vilna they...so we had a contact and\nthen we started very seriously in training our movement, our Zionist underground\nmovement, in in uh weapons and we had among our ___ two officers who were\nofficers in the Lithuanian army and were very well-trained in in in ammunition, and they\nwere the instructors that instructed these small groups, of course, in two, in three...not in\nalways in the same place. Always in some other place. You understand? And they...I\nthink I told you yesterday that the first gun that we bought was in 1941 in the beginning\nwhen whenthe __, the teacher...master of the Hebrew schooland _, a lawyer\nfrom Charlotte (ph), that I knew them very well before...they came to me and said\nwe'll...we have a possibility to buy a gun. Could you provide the money for it? And I\nwent to Garfunkle, the Deputy and he said what are you talking about. It will be a\nterrible risk for all the ghetto. So I didn't give in. I went to Dr. Elkes. Dr. Elkes didn't\nsay another word. He says go...go to the treasurer and tell him that I ordered to give the\nmoney uhtototo \u2014\u2014\u2014sryes,and_ ~\u2014_ and this was the first gun we had in the ghetto,\nbut this really was the first but not the last one. And then, little by little, we used to try\nand how can we bring in weapons to the ghetto. So first of all, == worked in many\nplaces, workshops where they had...especially those who...to repair German weapons in\nthe in German units, to repair weapons, so he is planning to steal and and how did they\nsteal? For instance, they were about thirty or forty people working in that place where\nthey...you know, where the ammunition stores and the Germans, for them it was a uh a\njust a lost uh let the Jews try to repair it, so each one of them used to take a part of a gun\nin the pocket, and when they used to come to the ghetto, they...",
        "Q: Put it together.",
        "A: But to pass with a part of it is also...it was not so...believe me, it was not so easy.\nUnfortunately, one of our best men was caught with a weapon. He...he dared to take a\nweapon himself home, and they thrash (ph) him and they killed him on the spot. So we\npaid very high price, very, very high price, but uh when the...yes...and now I want...when\nthe first group of the Zionist underground was ready to go to the woods, and we knew\nthat there will be the...yes...and we knew that there wasa____ from the Soviet Union in\nthe woods, a top uh officer of the Red Army who trained them and who supervised them,\nso we knew that they are going in a place where there will be a communist surrounding\nand there will be also many non-Jews. It was very important for me that they in their\nleisure time could have talks about Zionism, about __ Israel, about the events in\nJewish history, sing Palestine songs, so I came to some let's say understanding...we didn't\nsign any contract... with the the communist leader in the ghetto who later as I said they\nhad also their own underground. I said look Heim (ph)...he was a very...he he was an\nidealist. He was a communist, but he was also one of the circle, of the cultural circle that\nwe met once in two weeks, you see. He was also a writer, so I tell him, Heim, I am\nsending...we are sending the Zionists, first Zionist group to the partisan woods. I want\nyou to to see to it that in their leisure time they could sit together and hold conversations.\nWhen there is a real Jewish holiday, they could just mark it. They would sing Hebrew\nsongs and they could tell each another, so he says Avraham, of course, of course. We are\nwant to convert them to communism. This is what he said. He was a very honest man\nand I believed every word that he told me because he was a very, very honest man. But\nfortunately they came to the to the Vilna ghetto. From there they brought them to the\nforest, but then a month later I got word that they...not they were to mention Hebrew and\nnotasongof _ Israel, andnot mention __Israel, leave alone prayers and so on.\nYou understand? And I was very much uh disappointed. Yes. We...when the...when in\n1943 when the the communists raised also and and organized their their resistance in the\nghetto, aided by Heim \u2014\u2014_\u2014_\u2014=s+O_ so we made an agreement among us to join forces. For the\nGermans a Jew is a Jew, whether he is a communist or whether it is religious or whether\nit is combat or whether...whatever it is, so uh we had a uh joint command. Two from the\nZionist underground and two from the communist underground. I together with three\n______ represented the Zionist underground in the joint command, but after this incident,\nI said I'm...I know it's not you but we'll... know you cannot do anything about it but I\njoined a communist...a command joint with communists. II I resign. I cannot...it's\nagainst my my concept of life. Iam a Zionist from early years, and then came in...instead\nofmecamein __ from the the pharmacist. See. There were problems. There were\nproblems. They _ their own problems. There were the problem of __ to to... when\nthey when they went a group of thirty, forty, yet to a woods, they had to have clothes.\nThey had to have overcoats. They had to have everything. And how did we do it? We\nhad the Jewish workshops in the ghetto, the big workshops in the ghetto, so we used to\nsend them to work there. Those who were the first to go to the woods, they should go\nand work in the place where they repair the German uniforms, see, and then they used to\nadjust to . Also, we needed German uniforms just to...you know, as a mask so there\nthey used to take, to measure (laughter) and not plainly fabricated but to measure.\nEveryone was equipped with everything. We just stole from the German stores and from\nthe German repair and it worked very good. The...unfortunately, the the main man who\nled the groups from the Kovno ghetto to the Vilna ghetto to the forest was the leader of\nthe communist and uh he used to to dress himself as a as a Wermacht officer,\nyou see, with the all equipment and he came to take a group out of the ghetto, all the\npartisans, and we hired...was a truck and the and the driver was also dressed in German\nuniform, so that they came into the ghetto. There was at the ghetto gate there was",
        "Q: How did you get a truck?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: How did you get a truck?",
        "A: Oh, for money you get everything. You see? So we we had the money. I want to tell\nyou...in the ghetto I perhaps the only Jewish committee that worked together with\nthe underground. They helped them. They didn't work together but they helped them.\nAnd they...for reasons once so he he was...I want to finish with him. So he used to take\nthe lead and bring them to the forest and come back. It took him, of course, a week, two\nweeks, so he used to were a German officer. The driver is a German and here were the\nJews, workers, so they take...went through clearly through the gate, mounted the uh the\ntruck and went to to the for...to the woods. Some...one day in a such movements, I was\ngoing to the city with a permit because as the secretary of the Jewish committee, but\nHeim ___, the head of the all the communists, he used to go in clandestine. He had\nwith him a gun always in in the pocket and one day he was caught by the Germans, and\nhe run away from them. Inone \u2014\u2014_\u2014_\u2014sziAhe yump _ from one place to the other one and\nfinally they caught him and they brought him to the to the Gestapo. He did not disclose\nhis identity. He never said that he was from the ghetto even. You understand? Caught.\nAnd nothing came out of all =. He was killed and this is...he he died as a hero,\nfighting with his gun against the Germans, in town. So this is...gives you...I can...I can\nspeak about the underground as much as you want but one...one thing I want to say about\nthe part of the Jewish committee in the underground. One...we didn't have the money to\nto to rent a truck. We didn't find the...the guy...so we came to the _ to send a group to\nthe woods, so I came to to the...Dr. Elkes and I told him, look we need to send out a\ngroup of twenty-five and would you permit us to use the wagons...there were wagons in\nthe ghetto...to bring firewood, to bring uh all kinds of supplies from outside to the ghetto.\nThey will go in the morning and they'll come in the evening, the wagons, so we took five\nwagons...three wagons...excuse me. Three wa...five...five, of course, and they went out\nand they didn't come back in the evening and they didn't come back the next morning and\nthey didn't come the next evening. It was a terrible...because where are the wagons?\nWhy don't they fulfill...why don't they come to to town to take the bread, the flour, the\nfirewood. It was a mess, so Elkes said that they uh the something happened after\napparently the the wagons after the horses are not well, all kinds of ___, and then only at\nthe...well, well, look...1f 1t would be disclosed they all, the altestenrat would be killed but\nnow no excuse whatsoever, no pardon and we didn't sleep the nights. _\u2014\u2014_\u2014s from the\n_____, from the leadership of the partisans and myself especially because we were in close\ncontact with the with the Jewish committee and because of the relationship between me\nand Dr. Elkes and he agreed to do it, so I had sleepless nights. Don't...don't envy me. In\nwhat a position I was these three days. Terrible. And we were on the outlook...they were\non the outlook and far away we sent outside the ghetto at the bridge that\ncontact...connects with the Kovno and the and the Slobodka uh and the Slobodka suburb\njust to see may...if they they are there or something happened to them. We didn't know\nwhat happened. Maybe they were caught. And only after we felt...they...after midnight\nthey came back worn out, torn out terribly because they...1t was not a journey to go...you\nhave to...you have to stop certain places when you see a German uh...let's say on the road\na German squad is going or a Lithuanian partisan or whatever, so that's why it took them\nvery much...because they were succeeded in hiding on on crucial moments on the on the\nroad, and that's why it took three days that took us out the the all all inside...what went\ninside went outside and you know, there were two rabbis in the in the...1 mentioned Rabbi\nSchumuckler and Rabbi _\u2014_\u2014__... They really went and prayed in the synagogue\nespecially for . You see? So this was avery...nothing _atall. Not...\nAnd I I must in two words also to mention, we had the confiscation of books which was a\nterrible...it was aktion not of men but of books, but books. We arethe _..",
        "Q: When did that happen?",
        "A: It happened in February 1942. There came a special envoy from Rosenberg .\nRosenberg was the minister for the occupied territories and he was the man that ordered\nthat all books, all printed material that are in the ghetto should be confiscated and taken\nout and sent to Germany, so uh when they came uh to from the Rosenberg __,, Dr.\nBehnker (ph)...it was in '42. I remember it until today. I'll remember it to the rest of my\nlife. This Dr. Behnker who came to the ghetto and he came to the Jewish committee and\nsaid all books should be...and we should write announcement all over the ghetto that they\nshould bring in certain places, concentrate...concentration places to bring the books to be\ndelivered to the to the Germans, and all the wagons of the ghetto were mobilized to bring\nthe books from the various parts of the ghetto to the to be handed over to the Germans, so\ninthe underground, \u2014_, we decided the very...most valuable books we want to to to\nrescue, so we mobilized the teachers which will accompany the wagons and take out\nfrom the wagons valuable books that they consider of historic value _\u2014\u2014_\u2014s and putitina\nseparate wagon which was accompanied and they would...little children...the..you know,\nthe _, the messengers, so they were not...and you see, and they...and this the wagon\nwhere they stood, took these wagons and they used to send it to...bring it to some hiding\nplace for us. I knew that the the yeshiva __\u2014_\u2014sihad a verry big library and needless to\nsay for hundreds of years, so I went to the to the to the head of the yeshiva, Rabbi\nand I told him, Rabbi __, you know that there is an order for the Germans to deliver\nall the books and uh we are trying to rescue the most important books so may I ask you\nplease, pick up to take out from your library...there were about thirty thousand\nvolumes...thirty thousand volumes of the Yeshiva library for ages...take out the books,\nvaluable books...\nEND OF TAPE 5",
        "A: ...SO he says brother, what are you talking about? All the books of the yeshiva are very\nimportant, the most important. So I said, I was myself in the yeshiva in my young days\nand I know that even in the yeshiva there are books more valuable and less valuable. We\nhave to rescue what we can. We cannot ask the thirty thousand, but we can rescue\nperhaps five hundred or six hundred. . Sohe says...he says ss We will\nhide ourselves. We know how to hide. If you hide them, they will get our books. I\ndidn't succeed to persuade him...his stubbornness, you know, and the religious Jews, the\nmore they are religious, the more they are stubborn, and you cannot fight in the common\nlanguage. There is no sense. Common sense. Sol told him, Rabbi _, I am very sorry\nthat you don't take advantage of the opportunity of rescuing at least the most important\nbooks we have. Go home. Go home. Don't worry about our books. We will worry\nourselves. We will rescue all our books, not the part of it. The next day was the was the\nuh the books had to be delivered and from all parts of the ghetto the wagons took books\nand there is...one of the pictures of the children with the wagon they are go, you see, and\nwhile we are , I'm...I was... was the liaison officer between the Jewish Committee\nand Dr. Behnker from the Rosenberg and before, the day before, he wanted me\nto show him the the from the ghetto, the most important thing what is can be seen\nin the ghetto, the sights...(laughter). So in the ghetto there was a synagogue that one day\nthe Germans ordered...",
        "Q: OK. Hold on Avraham. We're going to pick up. They have to change tapes again.",
        "A: Good.",
        "Q: OK. Uh let's pick up with the story where we left off on the books and the...",
        "A: Yes. So uh the Germans ordered that all...to bring all cats and hounds in from the ghetto\ninto one Jewish ancient synagogue, the most ancient synagogue in Slobodka, and bring\nall the cats so people brought every cat . What did the Germans do? When all the\ncats and and hounds were there in the synagogue, they killed them, but they didn't allow\nto take out the the corpses of the of the of the killed cats and hounds, just to make\nmiserable the holy place of Jews, the holy...holy sanctuary of the of the Jews. And one\nof...just to to to cause terrible pain, because for us a synagogue is a holy place and to\nbring in in itself cats and...1s already a a crime but to kill the cats, the cats and hounds and\nleave them around them stinking for months and months...this was a thing that we\ncouldn't...for for miles you hear the stink so he...when he told me that he wants me to\nbring him, to show him the most valuable and sighting of the ghetto, I took him to the\nsynagogue and I and when I came to the entrance of the synagogue, he orders me that I\nshould go in front. So I said no, uh Mr...Dr. Behnker. I cannot go in. The entrance is\nfree. You can go and see what for yourself, and I didn't go in and regardless of his\ncommand and you know, this is...1t's a mess. He he could kill me on the spot but I said\nno, here I stay. The doors are open. Everything is open and you can see for yourself and\nwhen we...when he went out, and this is a man of culture...this is a man of of of German\nculture from Berlin which is...it's the capital of world culture, so he understood. He says\nyeah. \u2014\u2014\u2014._- Yes, I understand you. I am...he understands me. He told...Dr. Behnker\ntold...said to me when he went out from the synagogue, he says he understands me why I\ndidn't...why I couldn't go in. So then the next day we...I was sitting with Dr. Elkes in the\nJewish Committee. Only Dr. Elkes was...it was in the morning. It was ten o'clock, and\nwe sat both on the sofa. He didn't sit at his desk. Only the two of us. I didn't want to\nshow up because I had to stay and get reports...only the books had been rescued and...you\nsee and give orders from there go in. I even ordered that we should go and try to talk to\n______. Maybe in the last minute...no. But while we are sitting in the room with Dr.\nElkes, all of a sudden the door cranks out with the boots...with the boots and the body of\nof...and comes inaa high fat German, redasaasa__\u2014\u2014,abeer__\u2014_\u2014_.~ Those who drink\nmuch beer...this is how red their faces, and not saying anything jumps in...\nwe were seeing him for the first time and the second one was was Dr. Behnker whom I\nknew and announce him and he says, ., yourheadisin.__.. It\nmeans that you take off my head, and in this moment comes into the room ;\nescorted by the commander of the ghetto, the German commander of the ghetto, not not a\nplain sentry. was pale like you know, and then I immediately understood what\nhappened. WhenI saw __ escorted by the commander, disclosed\ntheir...the the library of the yeshiva. What did they do? They hid hidded the the...all\nthirty thousand books in their horse stable. They thought the Germans are so, you know,\nclean they will not go to the stable, just ===. -~ They looked...the underground has also\nto have brains. You have to plan. You have to think and to understand the the Nazis who\nhad time enough to learn their mentality, so they disclosed the whole thirty thousand\nbooks of the library of the...of the ancient library of of the ghetto and they take, of course,\nimmediately Rabbi __\u2014_\u2014_\u2014___ so Dr. Elkes stood up and he said, excuse me, gentlemen. I\nam here the the the chairman of the Jewish Committee. I am the overjuden in their\nlanguage. I am responsible. I personally am responsible for all what's going on in the\nghetto, so if there is something, talk to me. You see? So he says you don't know me.\nYou will know me. He was.... am the new Deputy of the =~ who came instead of\nJordan (ph), the former Jordan was the supervisor of the ghetto. _ | Weidman (ph) his\nname, and you will learn to know me, you dirty Jews, uh crooks, thieves. What _,\nand you...points out at my finger, and this your heads shaking. It means that they want to\nkill us, so what happened if I would be a religious Jew, I would say it was something\nincredible. Dr. Elkes is a doctor. In first place he's a physician and he's a first-class\nphysician, and as soon as Dr. Elkes saw that Dr. Behnker 1s getting so excited,\nand escorted I am responsible for this for this for the\nlibrary of the of the... . You are responsible for this for this hiding the books. I'm\nresponsible for hiding the books, but this was no joke. It was no joke. So uh and when\nhe got so hot and crying, crying, crying so Dr. Elkes sees in his eyes, in the eyes of Dr.\nBehnker that there is something symptoms of a of before an attack...attack of epilepsy,\nepilepsy. He looked at him and he says...so he gets up and says, _\u2014s\u2014_\u2014_\u2014sy I... am... am\nthe head of the comm...of the Jewish community but I am also a doctor and it is my duty\nas a doctor to tell you, please calm down, sit down on the sofa, take off your belt. I\ncan...I can see symptoms in your eyes, some symptoms, warning symptoms. He says,\nwhat warning symptoms? What they talking about...? You know. He said, I am a doctor\nand what I can see is in your eyes are signals of a immediate attack of epilepsy, so please\nlet's...first of all. He says what they talking about...epilepsy. I have nothing to with\nepilepsy but I have a friend of mine who was a...suffering of this illness, so tell me, tell\nme, tell what you have to do. So Dr. says before I tell you, order that and Rabbi\n____ be out of the room. I cannot talk to you in their presence. You see? So he says,\nout you go. (Laughter) He goes out of the room and Rabbi _\u2014_\u2014__ and the commandant\nof the ghetto didn't go out with us. He he he remained here because he's ordered that you\nshould stay here. Behnker ordered. So first of all, Dr. Elkes \u2014\u2014_\u2014souta little bit aside\nof the danger, you see, and he says to him, and I can hear every word when Dr. Elkes\nspeaks to him. He says, a doctor...take off your belt. Free your your your collar. Take\noff your your boots. Lay down. I'll open the window, so you have more fresh air. And\nthen he starts and he tells him, he said and then in minutes...he ordered the commandant\nof the ghetto...that's why he didn't let him go out with us____ and then ordered\nimmediately from the from the headquarters of the Gestapo brought a car, an ambulance.\nThe ambulance pulled inside the ghetto and they took away Behnker and and _\u2014__ and\nthe commander and all went away. Therestof _\u2014__..._ I'm telling you...so Dr. Elkes\ngoes out and he tells me, ==\u2014\u2014_\u2014.:~YBehnker has now...his own worry is to worry about his\nhealth, not about you and will not think about you and he was taken straight to Berlin.\nHe wasn't left here. And then because it's true I I...a...a...and so we got this uh Rabbi\n. He couldn't meet me at my eyes.

        "Q: You couldn't see from...short-sighted?",
        "A: Short-sided, yes. So he caught...cut the barbed wire and they went out. He just jumped\non the commander of the ghetto, Fleishman. And he...even that and this 1s not\nenough...he took out a gun from his...from his pocket and says, commandant, get away\nfrom here. Otherwise I will... will shoot. He didn't finish the word and the and the and\nthe commander had already his hand on his gun and everything and it was a mess in all\nthe ghetto. Immediately all the ghetto was surrounded by machine, you know, from the\nGestapo and military and police and whatever you say. The Germans brought him to the\nto the commander of the ghetto and they wanted him to disclose...the other one who was\nwith him, he retreated inside the ghetto, disappeared. And they wanted from Mack...the\nname of the man was Mack...and they wanted from Mack that he should disclose who\nwas the second man that uh that retreated, that disappeared. They beat him up.

We had an iron rule in the ghetto...not\none Jew be handed over to the Germans by us. So we keep quiet. When I saw Mack in\nthe...in the commander's... commandant's office, you couldn't recognize a person because\nall his head was a piece of of flesh.

        "Q: Avraham, tell me, if you would, about your escape from Kovno, yours and Pnina's, and\nthe last testament of of Elkes, of Dr. Elkes.",
        "A: That's right. Well, I'm talking...we are talking about the escape from the ghetto and not\nfrom Kovno. It is two different things. Well, as I already mentioned before, I was one of\nthe four founders of the Zionist underground movement which was a resistance, and we\nwe...there prepared in the very end when the when the ghetto is...before liquidating the\nghetto, the leaders will escape to the woods, to the partisan groups, and this was the\nplanning. It was a matter of timing when should we escape from the ghetto and this was\na very important question...which one of the four leaders of the Zionist uh resistance\nmovement were all the positions in the ghetto life, so it wasn't just a matter of once a\ndecision. It had to be a decision with the consent of the chairman of the Jewish\ncommittee and so on. But it happened so as I also told you that I was very much engaged\nin this looking and finding a place of hiding for _____ which was then seven years. When\nI found such a place and the legendary escape of ______ from the ghetto, she fell very ill\nand when she came into the farm of hiding, it was absolutely necessary that Pnina should\ngo there at least for a week because we couldn't bring a doctor.",
        "Q: OK. Let me...let me back up and if you could tell us on tape that was Pnina's\ndaughter, just so we have it and and how she got to the farm.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Well...well, \u2014_... Pnina's first husband was killed, was murdered by the\nLithuanians...they already in the first days of the outbreak of the war and Pnina went \u2014__\nto the ghetto with a small child of five years, hername _\u2014_...___ less than five years,\nand she could bring nothing with her from home because her apartment in...a Jewish\napartment, a most elegant apartment in Kovno, was taken over by German generals and\nthey didn't let her in when she was taken to prison. AIl...the all the family was taken to\nprison. There they were separated. Her husband separated...",
        "Q: We have all that. We have all that from...we have all that from Pnina.",
        "Q: Anyhow, so she remained in the ghetto alone with and uh we uh she's...Pnina was\nuh hiding my uh my entries in the diary and my collection of documents. I felt I must\nhelp uh _, Pnina in hiding...finding a address for _, to cut a long story short. Uhit\nwas very difficult butin I I I succeeded in finding a contact with a priest who found\na place for her hiding and when I took her out from the ghetto, three times I tried and I\ndidn't succeed. It was...it failed. There always were a a Gestapo officer or somebody\nelse that we we...our plans failed. On the third time I succeeded in taking her out of the\nghetto, but in the two first times of trying, it was winter. It was cold so she got a cold.\nShe got a cold and when she finally reached the farm, forty-four kilometers away from\nKovno...it's about eighty miles...excuse me, about forty miles...she was entirely sick,\n___. And only by accident I...1t's not here in the places...by accident got to know that\nshe is ill in the farm, and I immediately went to the priest and I told him we must uh...we\nmust give medical help . No doctor can be...can be brought to _\u2014_ to cure\nher. At least Pnina would go, take along with her medicine. We had excellent doctors in\nthe ghetto and she took along and the priest was very opposing it because it was the\ndanger. Anyhow, I said it would have meant nothing if she would die, _, from from\nillness. It's the same we didn't do nothing, so she was there but instead of being there a\nweek, Pnina stayed there four montheses. And she worked there in the farm in all works\nas was she was considered as a as a relative, far relative from town that she run away\nfrom Kovno from bombardments and from the war, but she was for all things and\npurposes worked with the with the family and she got very well acquainted with them\nand uh it was a woman, a widow whose husband, the boss of the farm, fell from a from a\nthunder...from a thunderstorm and he was buried in in in this farm, and the widow was a\nvery good-hearted, that was very religious, and that's why the priest could talk her in that\nshe should take the child for hiding and uh and uh then she was really happy that Pnina\ncame because she didn't know what to... \u2014\u2014\u2014_s was crying all the time... Momma,\nMomma...and uh I...as I said she lived there instead of a week, she stood there for about\nfour, five months and then she was acquainted there...one...one...the the woman, the\nwidow had three daughters and one son. The son was about eighteen years, but because\nhis father was dead so he was the head of the family and around the farm and he couldn't\nattend school. He was illiterate and he very much wanted to learn to write and to ready,\nso Pnina told him, look... == was hisname... =, [have aman. He is a lawyer and\nhe is a educated man and he will edu...educate you in writing Lithuanian and uh...",
        "Q: Did this man...did this young man...you helped him. We...we do have to cut it a bit. Did\nyou help him? Did he help you escape?",
        "A: And then he was the one who who agreed that to to...that I should be brought and he\nhimself prepared a special hiding place for me inside the the farm, faraway from\neveryone, and so I came to the farm. So one day I was surprised by from the priest for\nme that a wagon will be waiting for for me on the 23rd of February, 1944, for the farm. I\nwas, as I said, prepared to go for the woods but not for the farm, but since I got such a a\nword from Pnina so it was nothing doing, so I had to escape from the ghetto. The night\nbefore...so I told...of course, I told Dr. Elkes about my plans, that I have to escape from\nthe ghetto, and the the last night I spent in the house, in the tiny dwelling of Dr. Elkes, the\nhead of the community, and his deputy Garfunkle and Mrs. Elkes which was a lady in the\nvery full sense of the word. Just a lady, and the two people, I disclosed to them and I told\nthem that my...the hiding place of the five crates of my diary and collection and they\nshould know where it is but Garfunkle, the deputy, said \u2014_\u2014\u00ab, youcannot do it. It is\nalready no ghetto. It's already a concentration camp. And you are going to commit\nsuicide. Who can escape now from the ghetto? And how will you make the fifty-four\nkilometers? I beg of you, don't do it. It is terrible. It's dangerous. Don't you know the\ncase of Mack. Mack was the one who was caught...they caught at the at the... when he\ntried to to escape through the barbed wire. He was hanged publicly. Don't you know it?\nYou were there at night, the whole night in the Gestapo together with him in the cell. But\nDr. Elkes said go. If you would be my son, I would tell you go because you are the only\none who know best what expired in the ghetto. You kept a diary and you have a\ncollection and documentation and it 1s...you have a mission to go and bring the\nknowledge to the world, to the outer world that it shall remain to the future\ngenerations...the Germans digged out the corpses of the sixty thousand that were killed in\nthe 9th Fortress, so that there remain no sign of it. That's why...that's why I think...I'm\nsure you have courage. You have knowledge. You have the persistence and you will\nsucceed I'm sure about it, so uh in order to encourage me more, he took out from his\ndrawer his last will. His two children...a son, Prof...now Professor Elkes, and a daughter\nSarah, were studying in London and he says here is my last will. Give it to my children.\nI rely upon you. You...your...your wisdom and your courage and I...what you have done\nin the ghetto for the three years, you have shown that you have enough power will and\nyou'll...you'll make it, and this is what gave me the courage really to escape and it was\nvery, very exciting for us and we embraced and we kissed each other and then I left his\nhome, two...after midnight, two-thirty after midnight. Two hours later I was already at\nthe main ghetto gate and there were my two friends, the...one of the most activists of the\nunderground, Zionist resistance movement. was an officer in the Lithuanian\narmy. He trained in in in the underground and he and the second one was\n. He's now in New York. He...we called him the savior at the gate. He knew\nhow to bribe the sentries at the gate and when one gate...one sentry will be and what\nsentry is good, so he fixed it all. At five o'clock in the morning when only one sentry is\nat the gate...they start only at six o'clock they start move from the ghetto, so you come at\nfive o'clock in the morning and he bribed the the the sentry. He...he sd they were on\nthe on the...we had...at the ghetto gate there was a station of the ghetto Jewish police and\nof the legal department, so they were officially the ghetto, so they let me through the the\ngate and and then and this way I escaped from the from the from the ghetto with the\nwagon of another four people, allegedly to bring from the wagon uh bread for the ghetto.\nThey returned, of course, without me, but this is how I succeeded...succeeded to pass\nthrough the gate and then the very dangerous time when Geck was the liquidator of the\nghetto, he would not spare a minute just to put a bullet himself in the , but when\nI escaped, I got known later that the Gestapo and the ghetto commander uh announced\nthat they'll...five thousand marks they give the one who disclose where...the whereabouts\nAvraham ___ or his dead body. Dead or alive we need him. You see? And this will\nshow you how important it was, the great help of my very close friend. _, the\npoliceman was was questioned at the 9th Fortress. He was the one who knew, who saw\nme last. Where did I go and how did I go? And they beat him to death, but he didn't say\na word. Even they took one of his eyes out and then they killed him, but he didn't\ndisclose a word. I want to tell you and when I came...when I escaped from the ghetto, I\ncame to the priest and the priest told me the the the widow, the the the...from the farm,\nshe is here with a wagon and two horses and I should take the wagon and the horses and I\nshould cross the bridge that between Kovno and the and the other and the other suburb,\n, which leads to the farm where the where the...they had the farm with the\nwidow, but the the the priest said he wouldn't want to rescue the life of the of the widow,\nthe very good Christian woman in case they are be caught at the at the at the bridge,\nbecause on both sides of the bridge were stationed military gendarmes, and they checked\neach and every one, the documents and everything, so it was not very easy. I had no\nother choice, so and he said that we will meet two miles after the bridge, after the second\npart of the bridge, and when we...I came to the horses you know, and they had a very big\ncoatasaa__ and they came to the bridge. There wasaJewof _\u2014_\u2014s and because\nthey checked and double-checked, each one will take..so I had false documents as a as a\n,_, you see. Anyhow, so all of asuddenI see thatone \u2014\u2014s Jew with his\nwagon and he passes by the the the sentry, the gendarme and he says heil Hitler, and he\npasses by and they let him go. So I say, well, wait a minute. I can also say heil Hitler.\nYou see? So...but it was a a...to to decide in a second...this is your life or you live or you\npossibly don't, but I had nothing to to loose, only to win, so I take out my horse...with the\nhorse my wagon aside and I pass by and I say heil Hitler and with the with the...what\nweapon I had in my sack then, I showed them below that the wagon is entirely empty.\nThere is nothing, only straw, you see,so _\u2014_\u2014, and I said heil Hitler, and without _, I\nshowed them there is an empty wagon. The wagonis ___, in German, and I passed\nby (laughter) with the greatest of my surprise, you see, and then on the...it's a long bridge\nand when you come to the second part of the bridge, again the same...the same story.\nAnother sentry and he 1s checking again, you know, checking again and again I say heil\nHitler. The wagonis _\u2014\u00ab, the wagonis___, and they let me go, and this way I\ncouldn't believe what had happened. If one would be a religious man, he would say it is\nheaven. It is...1t is a miracle, but I don't believe in miracles. I believe in persistence, in\nhard work, in making up your mind and know what you do and know where you go, and\ndon't give in and don't take no as an answer. And they...nothing like that not permitted.\nWhat was permitted for us? The German was really...in the ghetto he came in and they\nsaw in in in a dwelling and they saw a woman lying in her bed, so he said why don't you\nwork. What are you so lazy in the bed, so she said, , I'mill. I have thirty-nine\ngrade of uh temperature. It was a very high temperature. I must stay in bed, so he tells\nher, I knew that . A Jew must die. All others he must not. All others he must\nnot. He must not lie in bed even if he is ill. So uh this is what I knew exactly and uh but\nI didn't want to die, so at three miles after the bridge it was...I was... I was beating\nthe horses and I was saying and when the woman stood there, she didn't believe\nher eyes. She was...",
        "Q: Which woman?",
        "A: The the widow...the peasant, the owner of the farm. She didn't...the priest didn't want that\nshe should risk her life passing by the control at the both sides of the bridge, so she went\nby foot and waited there until I come and then she...she mounted the wagon and she took\nover the horses and we ride. And and and what happened unfortunately happened\nunhappy... the...there were wonderful good woman, good hearted woman but she was a\ndrunk so she...at every...wherever it was only a a saloon, she stopped and went in and\ndrink and she drank not a regular vodka but homemade which 1s a terrible thing, so I told\nher ...her name was , Maria...Maria, I beg of you, I beg of you.\nI'm...every...every moment when you go in to a saloon they can...they can...they can\narrest us, both you and me.",
        "Q: She was drinking on this journey to the farm?",
        "A: Stopped at the side of the...of the...of the road, went into a saloon and to drink, and I...and\nit was a matter that continues instead of going it should take us from the morning at mid-\nday until one or two o'clock we should be already at the farm, but see she stood in every\ncorner and in one place she found relatives, so she took me in into her house with the\nrela...to the relatives and she said who...please meet...it is a relative of the of the priest\nfrom Kovno, so I was a priest so they offered me eat and and and a whole meal, so I said\nwe are ina hurry. We cannot stay here. To cut a long story short, she was...in the end of\nthe day we came...it was night. It was evening. It it was night and she and she was\nentirely drunk and she went not the the wrong way and I had to go and to knock on the\ndoor of the peasants 1n order to find out which way we have to goto _\u2014__.._ This 1s the\nname of the farm, and and we came and when we came only at three after midnight, at\nthree after midnight, and when we came into the farm, Pnina was...she was sure that the\nGestapo took us and that's why we didn't come in time. Andit was sin such cases.\nWell, to tell you...my meeting with Pnina at three o'clock in the midnight...I\nwanted...from from afar there was some little light. You know, a candle was...and I trust\nto listen to her. I can see light there. Is this your farm? So she said oh yes, yes, yes, yes.\nYou see she was...but she was drunk and this how we met in the in the farm, of course.\nThe son, Joseph, eight years. He was prepared already for me a hiding in...not in the\nhouse where the farmers lived, but where where the storage for winter...for winter uh\n__,insummer forsummer _, the winter __ to summer, and | had to go in to\nsqueeze in, you know, like not...less than this space, you see, and I could not stay there\nin__ hiding. You had to either to seat or to lay down and uh they had in the farm a\nworker, a hired worker, and he was an anit-Semite terribly and all the time he questioned\n______ whether she's Jewess and when does she pray and when does she go to church and\nso on and so on, so he shouldn't...needn't have an idea that I'm hiding in the...",
        "Q: How long were you hiding on the farm?",
        "A: Four consecutive monthses. Six days in the week I didn't go out from the hiding places.\nOnly on Sunday when the hiding...the the man...the the hired laborer went to church. On\nSundays I used to go out and breath the air, so when I breathed the fresh air, I was\nentirely, you know, my my head was...you know, from this...but this is how we were and\nthen one night the the Red Army came closer to the farm and uh all around was\nbombardments and fire so I couldn't stay in that place, in that hiding, because every\nmoment also this hiding should be...could be on fire, but they had a most strategic uh uh\ncanal in the in...around the whole farm. The farm was, let's say like this...uh longer and\nthen...and around this two rows of high woods, __ trees, and between the trees very\nclose was a canal, so I went out from this hiding place and I laid down in the canal at\nnight and I fell asleep. All of a sudden I feel that on my belly a boot presses me very\nhard, and a and a strong light flash on my eyes.

So I said...I could see that they're very top\nup top officer of the army, but he looked to me like a Jew but he didn't disclose a word\nabout his Jewishness, so he said, why didn't you go back to Kovno. So I said, how would\nI know? I'm hiding here. So he said if you'll give me...1f you will be kind of enough to\ngive me the the name of the places where I can move because he said there are\nnineteen German tanks are trying to cross to to close the way for the Red Army and are\ngoing to break in, so he said come exact on the on the German tanks, and\ncould you give me...show the map, your maps, so I'll know which way to go.

        "A: Yes. Well, on the 22nd of June, the war break out. Early in the morning we hear the\nbombardment and over the radio it was war. The very simple word of war took me and I\nwas all the time attached to the radio and then the Kovno was bombarded and all...first of\nall the air...the airport and then the military and then all the town was in flames, so we\ntried to escape and the the Russians, the Soviets were taken by surprise and they rushed\nout of Kovno. They left the prison closed without any guards, and the prisoners went at\nnight, found that there were no no guards and so from inside they break through and they\nwent to to freedom, but the...I and everybody tried to get any vehicle to run away from\nthe bombardment and I was at that time with my sister at my sister's home and my sister\nand my my brother-in-law were waiting for a relative of my brother-in-law to take them\nafter midnight with a wagon with horses because when when...if you would go in in\ndaytime, they would take them away, uh these these horses and save them for the\nmilitary and while waiting there, twelve o'clock, one o'clock, I was so much impressed\nand overwhelmed of the of the of the Germans.

And then I tried to escape and I did not\nsucceed. On the way what I...I took a bicycle and I almost let's say uh seventy miles I\nmade by bicycle towards the frontier with with Russia but in the meantime the Germans\ncaught us up and I had to go back.

It\ntook me three days to go back to Kovno. Three days and three nights and this is a story.\nI could be ten times killed because the bombardments were without end.

        "A: By myself, yes. I will tell you why by myself. I was married then, but to be where of the\nopinion that the only in danger are the men that the Germans might take them to work for\nthe army, and therefore the men used to run away. Others who had to _ full families,\nso I went and I had left my first wife at home because her parents and so on, but I didn't\nsucceed. And so it took me three days to come back to Kovno and these three days, I\nwrote fifty-four pages how...what happened to me because I went...everyplace I could\nencounter a a Lithuanian extremist, fascist would kill on the spot.

Everybody would offer you bread\nand milk. But then they paid and then they didn't take the rubles. They asked for\ncoins...uh golden coins and so on. It was aterrible _, so finally I...to cut a long story\nshort...I finally came to the outskirts of Kovno and it was in...1n Kovno there was a\nfamous...a a famous and most neglected suburb of Slobodka (ph). The Slobodka is a\ncenter...world center of scholars of . But it was a very much\nneglected suburb and I was supposed to pass this suburb and come to my place. I lived\non the hill, so when I came in, I was entirely exhausted. I was full of dust. I didn't wash\nfor three days, leave alone to shave, so I went...I wheeled a uh...I saw a well so I asked\nfrom from a distance the Lithuanian woman and she allowed me to wash myself in the\nwell, so she uh tell me that they should come near to her and then she disclosed to me that\nher son is a partisan, and if he will see me he will kill me, so she let me in somewhere in\naina hiding place andI wash myself \u2014_\u2014s and I say now tell which way 1s now to go to\nto Slobodka, a suburb of Kovno, you know, .

        "A: I didn't believe but she told me don't go because you will be killed, so it was enough for\nme. So she said the best thing what you can do, you cross the River Yemen (ph).

Kovno was around with nine fortresses.",
        "A: Of course I've seen it, because I am not a man to close myself behind...behind the shelter.\nSo I went out in the street and I wanted to know what's going on, what is the community,\nwhat is this, what is that? So I...so I was told that the chief rabbi's home, not at his office\nbecause the Bolsheviks (ph) annulled all the Jewish institutions at the time of the\noccupation of the...so I went to the chief rabbi's office and there I could learn that some\ncommunity leaders are uh are are get together and are consulting, exchanging\ninformation, seeing what can be done, and then I I used to come almost everyday to that\nplace and when the the they organized...when the...when the the...when the order came\nthat Jews have to...the expulsion of Jews from Kovno to the ghetto, latest until 15th of\nOctober...of uh August 1941.

        "A: This was on all...1t was publicized on all the walls, by radio, in the paper, in the daily\npaper. It was not a secret, but you see I am always have read and read. I took one or two\nor three with me in the pocket, and this is why I could submit it uh present it to the to the\nfellow who called him ,a Lithuanian mayor who was nominated by the\nNazis as mayor of Kovno and when he was brought to trial and he said I laughed so about\nJews, and he...what they talking about...so I presented to the uh to the Federal Court\njudge this publication, expulsion...uh uh all the number one from the 10th of July, 1941,\nsaying that the Jews must leave Kovno, old and young, men and women, Lithuanian\ncitizens or Lithuanian citizens, whatever Jew, must go to the ghetto, signed by\nand by the the Lithuanian commandant of Kovno.",
        "A: Wait a minute. So this is what...at the at the rabbi's...l was a young man.

I belong\nto the first category. And how, as I could prove with what I have done before, many\nyears before and uh especially in the war time.",
        "A: So when I heard that order, I uh I uh...we we went uh as I said three lawyers, young\nlawyers, and when it was organized a commission...wait a minute...then one day, on the\n7th of August, 1941...no, on the 7th of July, 1941...that's more precise in my book...a\nGestapo officer came to the to the chief rabbi's home to take him to the Gestapo, but he\nwas very ill. He had a stomach uh trouble and there wasa___\u2014_\u2014_\u2014___ going inside this uh\nhis body to digest, you see, so he showed them that he cannot move, so they told him\ngive us names of uh of public community leaders, so he gave them three names. One was\nthe Garfunkle (ph) who was a member of the parliament. His underworld was Jacob\nGoldberg, a also a lawyer who was the head of the volunteers for the Lithuanian\nindependence for a officer, and the third one was Dr. Rabinovitch (ph) who was a...he\nstudied in Germany and and he was well-acquainted. He was a physician. So they went\nand took all three of them separately and brought them to...they didn't tell them where\nthey're taking them, what they take them, what for...nothing. They just brought them to\nthe Gestapo and there where were they summoned before going into the chief of the\nGestapo. The chief asked either anyone among these three are rabbis and they say no, so\nordered they should bring a rabbi or two so they went and brought two rabbis. One rabbi\nwas the chap...chaplain, the chief chaplain in the Lithuanian army and the other was\nSchumuckler (ph), Rabbi Schumuckler from who was...became very famous\nlater and uh the Rabbi Schumuckler was quiet. The chaplain all the time say uh you\nknow, the prayer before death, yousee. ===, ~~\u2014__._ Because he was sure that they\nare taking him to death, and when they brought in they they they took them in into the\noffice, there were two gentlemen. One was a General Pole who was the commander of\nthe of the German forces in in Lithuania. The second one was uh _\u2014_\u2014__s who was the\nfurher of the Gestapo, chief of the Gestapo. And uh the general told them,\nlook. You know what's going on in the city. People are being killed. Jews are being\narrested and these...we came here to bring order and we cannot let this this situation go\non. The Lithuanians say they don't want to dwell with you, so you must go to the ghetto.\nSo uh Garfunkle who was a member of the Parliament and he was...said let us talk to the\nLithuanians. He says with which Lithuanians do you want to talk? They don't want to\ntalk to you. They don't want to live, to dwell with you. And uh but if...you have to go to\nthe ghetto and the ghetto is near_\u2014_ Slobodka and he had a map calling that all of the\narea of Slobodka should be earmarked for the ghetto so the Jews said, the commission...in\nSlobodka lived in the old times eight thousand people while in in Kovno there are thirty\nthousand Jews. How do you want to squeeze in? So he says alright. Uh you can take\nanother place. Anyhow uh uh so he says we are not authorized to give announcement\nwith regard to to being expelled from the city. We have to think and to explain to to...so\nhe says I give you time until tomorrow at ten o'clock. Bring us...1f your reply will be\npositive, I'll order that this should immediately stop, these killings and and robbing of\nfoods and raping of women...it should stop immediately and in addition, I will order to\nrelease three thousand women and children who are in in the prisons and in the fort under\narrest and this was a very great incentive to the to the to the thoughts of the Jews, and\nthen they met again at the at the rabbi's office. I was there all the time and they\ndecided...uh said that there's no way out other ways. There was no way. Not they will\nnot go. Said they will expel us, and this is...they gave...order gave that it was from the\n10th...formally the 10th of July was published the order in all in all the papers and the\nradio, on the walls. You know, there are so I took...what did I take, several, and\nwhat will maybe . And then later they gave an order that the Jews\nshould elect...should nominate an overjuder (ph). It means aa chief Jew. A chief Jew.\nAnd all these nominations Altestenrat (ph). Altestenrat means a council of elders, to\nremind you the elders of Zion. You understand? All these aimed to one, to dehumanize,\nto to degrade, to hurt the feelings of Jews and . And this was the most dramatic\nand the most historic last meeting of the Jewish community in Kovno.",
        "A: On the 4th of August, 1941, at a school, there set the most prominent leaders of the\ncommunity were still alive, because many were already killed. Approximately five\nthousand Jews were killed on the roads, in the city and so on and then they...it was\nopened...the assembly was opened by Dr. who one was very veteran leaders of\nthe Jewish community in Kovno...",
        "A: I couldn't be in the assembly with those . Because I I...you know, I I am\ntelling you I was sitting in the the rabbi's uh apartment and I listened. There was an elder\nreport the first . When they came back from...",
        "A: When they came back from the committee, I will not enlarge what happened to them.\nThey were arrested on the way from the from the Gestapo to their homes by Lithuanians\nand they were...and among these uh...there...Goldberg was a mili...a military officer, a\nhigh officer in the Lithuanian army. He tried to speak to the military commandant of\nKovno who he knew. He was in the same military school and this the night... - we\nhave to make it short, so this Goldberg went to one of his fellows who was well-known.\nThere was established a big new ministry, as 1f they would gain their independence, the\nLithuanians. They sent cables of gratitude to Hitler signed by the Archbishop _, by\nthe Bishop. __, thanking him for liberating uh Lithuania from the Soviets, you see,\nand uh so the Lithuanians were...and they immediately established a cabinet of ministers\nof Lithuania as if they would gain independence, but the Germans, they never thought of\nof giving them their independence so...",
        "A: Yes. So the assembly, the the...can we __, the chairman, and he and he spoke in very,\nvery cloudy expressions and cloudy...cloudy, false pictures of the situation\noutside...outside the school where the where the meeting took place, and he said that the\nchildren are being killed, the women are being raped, all men are being taken to slavery,\narrested and so on. There was not in the history of Jews a situation like that, but\nnevertheless there were situations, hard situations, and the Jewish people always...the\n__,the \u2014\u2014_\u2014sinthe past, the \u2014\u2014_ end was so that we survived them and he hoped that\nomens of this type Hitler will also...his end willbe the \u2014_\u2014_\u2014sin the history of Jewish\npeople, but nevertheless in describing the terrible situation of the Jews, the desperate\nsituation, he collapsed and he couldn't continue to talk. Then came the problem the order\nof the Germans 1s that the Jews have to nominate a chief Jew and if the Jews themselves\nwill not nominate a chief Jew, they will nominate themselves, and we had already the\nterrible experience of other places where they nominated, you know, a man who has no\nresponsibility, with no background, no way...so there was also among the candidates was\nDr. Elkes. The first candidate was, of course, Garfunkle who was a member of the\nParliament, the head of the Jewish faction in the Parliament, for instance that Goldberg\nwho haduh wasaaafront __, a fighter for Lithuanian independence. They had __\nbut they they absolutely refused to take over the office because they knew this is going to\nbeaservant _ and into the of the of the Germans or the Nazis, and nobody wanted to\nbe to betray his his his community, the Jewish people. More so that at that time we knew\nalready that the the chief Jew from Vilna (ph), Dr. , very famous Jewish leader,\ncommunity leader, he \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014=, so nobody wanted to take over and there was a stalemate.\nIn a way...no way out and nobody would take any office, so then stood up Schumuckler,\nRabbi Schumuckler, who was a absolutely unknown rabbi from a suburb of \u2014\u2014\u2014_s and he\nstood up but yet who was in main kind of way...everybody agreed and everybody wanted\nthat Dr. Elkes. Why Dr. Elkes, Elchanan ELkes. Because he was one of the best\nphysicians in Lithuania. He was the private physician of the German ambassador and of\nthe Soviet ambassador and of all ambassadors, so they thought that he might because of\nhis relationship being a private doctor for the German ambassador, he might have have\nsome influence and maybe do some good or avoid some hardships and so on, but of\ncourse this had nothing to with that.",
        "A: He...I will tell you before I answer. He said no because the...according to the Germans,\nwho have to go to the ghetto, there we will have a municipality for ourselves. We will\nhave our own community, a closed community. No Lithuanians will be will be allowed.\nNo no German will be allowed to go inside.

        "A: So then...so then it was a stalemate. Nobody...and the Germans said if we will not\nnominate, they will nominate and this was the worst thing that could happen to us and\nbefore long in despair, then stood up the the rabbi, Rabbi Schumuckler and he said,\n. I appeal to Dr. Elkes. Everybody...since you are the most...are the most\nsuitable to be a head of whole community in this unusual, unique time of rest...risks and\ndespair.

There was not a person in Lithuania that didn't know the best...the the doctor\nbut in addition I knew Dr. Elkes because the only thing that he was...he was never a\nmem...member of any Zionist party, was never any committees. He was a doctor one\nhundred percent, but he was one of the three trustees of the found in Lithuania.\nWe both in Lithuania lent and for , before, prior to making their _ to _Israel,\nthey were trained in agricultural in order to prepare them to the life in agriculture.",
        "A: Just a minute. Just a minute. First of all, if you know well the three trustees of\nthe , this is like pioneer, he was also their doctor and because\nwe as a Zionist...as a chairman of the Zionist youth movement, I knew him from that\n, and meeting with him, and most of the people knew in Israel...in in Lithuania of\nDr. Elkes as a very...very broad-minded uh physician. He was the physician of the\npresident, of the prime minister and of the poorest people who gave medical help without\nwithout any pay.",
        "A: He...let me tell you. First of all, you should know Elkes was born not far away from my\ntown like Kalvarija (ph) and there he got a very strong religious education. There were\nno schools in...at that time...he was born in '70...in 1870 more or less. At that time there\nwere no schools. There were only yeshivas for the bigger ones and there were only a\nrabbi and a hadder, you know, where they they taught the children to learn A - B - C and\nto pray, you see, and this is...he got a very strong religious...religious education from the\nvery youth and then in his own way he he uh he made, you know, his doctor degree and\nnobody knows how he...how he managed it, how he went to and he and he and he\nstudied medicine without even prior graduating _ so he had to make exams special and\nso on, but this is what he was. He was...he was a very well-known and he was well-\nknown because of his great understanding for the needy and for the poor, for the\n, for...and and not only for the Jewish needy. For others. You see, he was a\ngreat man and at the same time, he didn't turn his nose up.",
        "A: He was a most generous man and known like that. He was a very rich man. He was a\nvery rich man and mind you, I want to jump now...in his...in his last will, in the ghetto he\nwrote in the ghetto in 1943 in Hebrew language, which he gave...handed over to me\nbefore I escaped from the ghetto, he he didn't mention not a single word of his of his\nrichness. It was a very big property in this in this most fashionable part of the city of\nKovno. His children he sent, because of being a rich man, he sent his two children, his\nson and his daughter, to London and this is Professor ____ Elkes who you met in there,\nhe was then in London, and this is the last will that they allowed to him and to his sister,\nand this is will that to be passed to him (laughter) before I escaped from the ghetto.\nNobody knew will I at all succeed in to pass through and so on, so he was a great Zionist,\na great Jew, a great devoted Jew with a very deep feeling of Jewish heritage. He had a\nresponsibility and when he took over, he was known only as a physician, only as a great\nphysician and we gave trust in him because of his special relationship with the German\nambassador, but then he had shown himself by his day-to-day daily steps, dealing with\nthe Russians. For instance...I'l give you an instance...",
        "A: In 1940...the very beginning of the ghetto, came to me a Mr. Bronson (ph) who was a\ndirector of a Hebrew school and a lawyer who was nota Zionist, _, and they came to\nme as secretary of the of the Jewish committee and they told me, look, there is a\npossibility to buy a gun. Can you speak to to to the Jewish committee that they should\ngive money to pay, to buy the gun? So I went to Garfunkle, the Deputy. He says good, a\ngun. What they talking? It is dangerous. It will be dangerous for all the ghetto.\nDon't...don't mention it. So I went to Dr. Elkes. So Dr. Elkes said go to the treasurer and\ntell him that I order that you give to Bronson the money to buy the gun. Both very...L...I\nmost Jews devoted but here is a man of the season, of daring ===, most very. \u2014__,\nyou see. Then the first days when you came in into the ghetto...",
        "A: So you see, so when it sees the the the Lithuanians attacks on the Jews in the cities, in\ntheir dwellings, in in the stores, in in the streets. They attacked terribly. It was\nimpossible to pass the street for a Jew, and they said...uh we were three lawyers. The\nsecond lawyer...one of the three was killed two days after he was elected. On the 6th of\nAugust, there was...they killed a thousand Jews on the street, and among them prominent\nleaders like , SO SO We remained two, two of us. Dr. __ was the elder one\nso he was the secretary, and I was the deputy secretary. On the 15th of August was the\nlast day to close up the Jews in the ghetto, but because of the riots, day in, day out, in the\ncity Jews left the city already by the end of July because there in this area they run out,\nthe local Jews steps in. You understand. This was the situation. Jews themselves went\nand then when it came nearer to the ghetto, the Lithuanian municipality ordered that the\nJews themselves should build the barbed wire fence around the ghetto, the Jews\nthemselves, and I have a letter in my collection from the from the municipality of...you\nare ordered to bring fifty Jews for the building of the of the gate around the...not the gate\nbut the barbed wire around the ghetto, and they should bring material, their own material.\nThe next day you should bring a hundred people, a hundred Jews, and I have a photo\nwhere the Jews were building the fence around the ghetto, and this reminds me a very\nRussian song. I told you I know Russian, so there is a song...brick layer, brick layer...is\nthat one passes by and sees brick layers are laying brick on the buildings that they are\nbuilding. ___ all the buildings, so it says brick layer, brick layer, for whom do you\nbuild these...these buildings. For whom are you laying the bricks? So he said you don't\ndisturb me. _\u2014\u2014_\u2014swwe are very busy in building...they are building...building a prison for\nthemselves. And this what I had in mind when I saw these men building around the...but\nthese were the Lithuanians, not the Germans.",
        "A: What...we are not in the ghetto yet. Wait a minute. So you see, the...already from before\nthe ghetto, they were rationed...Jews were not allowed to appear before ten on the\nmarkets, open markets, because let the Lithuanians buy whatever it is and whatever the\nrest, __ were taken to Jews, but then we were now forbidden at all and this order of the\n10th of July, 1941, Jews were forbidden to appear in the open markets to buy from non-\nJews, to hire vehicles from non-Jews, to use help of non-Jews...absolutely. And they\nwere rationed hundred grams bread a day...hundred grams bread a day. Hundred and\ntwenty-five gram meat a week, fifty grams salt a month so it's clear that on this no one\ncould could live. Even to starve was nothing left, but what was most important, when the\nghetto was closed, there were many Jewish institutions in in social, medical, cultural,\nyeshiva and all kinds, so but they were all kinder...uh house for orphans, so they brought\non the on the 15th of August when it was the the last day of entering the ghetto, the\nLithuanians brought in a truck, two trucks load of children from orphans, from Jewish\nchildren's home that remained there and they pulled them out on the entrance of the\nghetto on the on the on the pavement and they left them.",
        "A: I was there. First of all you should know what I was not present and what I did not see\nand what I did not see, you'll not hear from me, because it was...I went back and forth,\nback and forth, so and then we were all in ghetto.",
        "A: ...the first thing to do was to allow....\nEND OF TAPE 1 - SIDE 1",
        "A: ...we had a fire brigade, and the fire brigade came immediately, you know, and to take\nthese children and bring them into where...we didn't have an orphan's home in the ghetto.\nWe didn't have a children's home in the ghetto. Where to bring them? So we brought\nthem in a certain place what was formerly a school just to be able temporarily that they\nbe under a roof. This was how the Lithuanians behaved to to orphans, and this\nwas...I...1f there is a God, I don't believe, but if there is a God, they should be punished\nfor this. They should never gain their independence. Never...never...never. And then,\nthree days after we were incarcerated in the ghetto, they finished the the the barbed wire\nfence around the ghetto and the gate and then three days...and they every day they gave\nJewish committee head to mobilize Jewish workers for the various German places to to\nclean the barracks, military barracks and the Gestapo uh building, to clean the pavement,\nto...tailors, uh pressers and all kinds of things.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION.\nEND OF TAPE 1 - SIDE 2",
        "A: ..and then they commence to know what I've said.",
        "A: Yes. So first of all, the first terrible blow that we got to to burst out of the children,\norphans, on the the Lithuanians, but on the third day of the ghetto on the 18th\nof August...15th of August the ghetto was closed...nobody comes in, nobody goes\nout...and the 18th of Aug...and they used everyday used to send workers to to town, to\nvarious places outside of the ghetto. This was hard work, very hard work that Jews were\nnot used to do, for instance in building...brick... laying bricks or in the barracks to to the\nthe the men's rooms and the the other cleaning dirty things, so they said they need five\nhundred workers of academic (ph) professions for archives work, so people were so\nenthusiastic about this opportunity. Instead of going and cleaning the lavatories and and\nand to build the roads and so on, so there appears five hundred thirty-four, and they took\nthem out from the ghetto and they killed them in the very same day. And when\nLithuanians who could see from around the fort...fortress, they there were...the next day\ncame Jewish workers nearby and had to walk to the and they showed\nthem...they the Jews. We didn't believe. We couldn't believe how can...how\ncan five hundred thirty-four innocent men, reputable then...lawyers, engineers,\nchemistries, uh physicians...why should they be killed without trial, without interrogation.\nWe couldn't believe it because this was on the third of the ghetto. And then Dr. Elkes\ntried to go from one to the other, from one to the other, the dignitaries and not the\ndignitaries, and the civil...and the civil uh authority and then in the in the in the police...",
        "A: Yes. He said I'm the chairman of the Jewish committee and the overjuden. He spoke in\ntheir language and I am responsible for these Jews. I have to give areply. II I...please\ntell me why didn't they come. When will they come? Where are they now? What are\nthey doing, you see? He didn't speak in this tone like I'm talking now, but he...he found\nalways the right expression...first of all not to to hurt their Nazi dignity, and second to\nforce them to to to to answer him first of all, to answer him, and to answer him in a way\nlike a human being, because a Jew is not a human being. You understand? So they...first\nof all a Jew doesn't deserve that he he should get an answer at all. But Dr. Elkes put it in\na way and the...he just told them of his uh relationship with the German ambassador.\n. It worked some...sometimes. Much...not much...uh but nevertheless, but he\niS a Very...1S a...was a most courageous man and he always said nothing can happen to\nme. My sixty-four...five years are behind me and he always kept 1n his small pocket a\npoison and he said if worse comes to worse, he will...he will not fall in their hands alive\nand uh and he...and he asked which was very dangerous. Nobody, no insurance company\nin the world would give insurance for the life of Dr. Elkes. Yes. Because every\nsmall...not don't speak about the the commisar or the deputy sd commiisar\nwho was responsible for the ghetto was himself a murderer, so a murderer...the the first\nruler of the ghetto from the civil authority was the deputy ~\u2014s commisar of Kovno by\nthe name of Jordan (ph), and why the ...he write his name Jordan, but he was\njust a terrible guy.",
        "A: Terrible...a mass murderer. He...for instance, he used to come in into the Jewish\ncommittee office. He never opened the door. He didn't take the handle of the door and\nopen it. No. Because the handle of the door kept Jews and he cannot make...put his\nhands on a on a on a handle that the Jews have kept . It would be dirty, his\nhands, you see, so he used to open with his boots, push the door...open the door with a\nwith a crash and the very appearance of him was already thunder of _\u2014___ and and and\nunrest and of and of God knows what it brings. And he would be so so uh harsh and that\neven the superiors in Berlin thought he doesn't know how to behave before his superiors\nbe...because ...not because he was too harsh towards Jews. Towards Jews you cannot be\nharsh enough because the the final solution is the final solution of every Jew, but he took\nover certain functions that wasn't in in the in the priority...in the in the authority of his\nsuperiors... , So they sent him to the to the front and he was killed there, you see,\nand so it turned out that these five hundred and thirty-four, they had to admit to Dr. Elkes\nfinally that they were killed by the thirty-four that sabotaged the Jews too. They were\nsupposed to...1n in a in a store of sugar, they poured in gas...gasoline, and so this was why\nthey were killed. Of course, this was the Nazi ___\u2014_\u2014___ but this is what they said, so in the\nfirst three...after the third day of the ghetto, this is what we learned and what 1s ghetto all\nabout, because we didn't know what it was about. And these, of course, such things\ndidn't let me rest for several days, and I wrote about it at night. I wanted to start actually\nour interview with mentioning the famous Jewish historian, . He wrote\nmonumental books on history of the Jewish people. He livedin _ at the time of the\noutbreak of the war with Russia, with Germany and when the Nazis came to take him\nfrom his home, uh he...the only word that he could spell out before he was taken by\nsurprise, recorded and this I kept in mind all the years, recorded...the Germans never\nwanted to that the outer world to know what's going on inside the ghetto. They never\nwanted to know what activities the mass murderers had enforced. It was my inner\nimpulse, a driving...inner driving force to put it in writing because I was myself\noverwhelmed. I couldn't talk to anybody about this. There was not a possibility to talk\nbecause there was so taken the day to day and hour to hour with work in the Jewish\ncommunity and I I uh I had a secretary and I had to go to the to the German offices uh to\nin town to ask, for instance, let's say the the least. We had an office. We needed pencils.\nWe needed a typewriter. We needed uh paper for typing and so so I I and the secretary\nused to go to the stock rooms of ______ single authority and ask for this. I have here a\nform letter order, so we, when you were out of the ghetto with an escort, you know, the\nfirst year. The second year was only you had to get a certificate in order to...but we didn't\nneed. You...every every every uh day when I went from the ghetto to the stock\ncommisar, to the government authority, it was approximately for eight kilometers, five\nmiles, six miles. On the way each one could spit you in the face or kill you or or damage\nyou or whatever it is...you...1n German there is a wonderful saying... . You are\nfree as a bird. Everybody can kill the birds. Nobody will arrest you and so on...you\nunderstand? And this is what I felt and to go in aa let's say not leave alone the Gestapo, I\ndidn't go much to the Gestapo. In very very rare cases, but mostly I went to the stock\ncommissar or to the general commisar. What is the stock commissar? The commissar\nfor Kovno, the city of Kovno. And the commissar 1s the general for all of all of\nLithuanian. If I couldn't get something from from the thing, from the city commissioner,\nI tried to go in and ask from the from the general commissary and uh and uh there either\nyou meet Lithuanians who look at you like you're...you're run away from a prison, even\nthey spite you or they beat you or they will kick you or whatever it is. Seldom I used to\nmeet a colleague, a former colleague from the law school, a Lithuanian that used to to\nthrow me . Very very seldom. Very seldom.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Not at all. I'll give you...for instance, 1t was a certain period of time that we didn't get\neven the the hundred grams of bread. We didn't get it for two months and instead they\nused to send us , . Terrible. It was stinking, and when we need bread,\nagain they did not have a , SO went to the to the commander of the ghetto. There\nwas a ghetto commander. He lived inside the ghetto. Was a ghetto commander, German,\nand he had his sentries to look around that nobody should run away from the ghetto at the\nmain gate, but he was the the commandants mostly were people, elderly people from the\npolice, from the old police that uh I couldn't say that they were...they loved Jews.\nCertainly not, but they...they could perhaps try to be...not to be as harsh as the others so\nwhen uh they they came to the commander, said the people cannot go to work because\nfor two months they have no bread. The people were poor. And it was that from the\nghetto each day left the ghetto gates eight thousand to nine thousand people in various\nplaces of work. This was the only employment source for the German military offices\nand installations and the only place alone of the building a military airport. They\nmobilized from the ghetto five thousand workers, seven days a week, twenty-four hours a\nday. It was a terrible slave work in the very beginning of the war.",
        "A: People remained on the on the on the open air. There was...I used to have several\npaintings that would show people...first of all, there was a housing committee, but the\nhousing committee couldn't make more buildings than it was. You understand? So uh\nwe first of all everyone...whatever I say I have documentary. We waited until the 31st of\nDecember of '42. I have a list of all the streets of the ghetto, in each street how many\nbuildings, in each building, how many apartments. In each apartment how many people\nand then you made the average of living space...living...the area per person, per\ncapita...the average 2.95 meters. It means...1t means approximately uh...how should I say\nin...a meter and this is what...inches...1inches... approximately six inches, five inches per\ncapita, so this was not a living space so it was absolutely impossible, but we didn't have\njust the space and we...and we asked them that they should allow us to use...there was\na...let's say aa cinema. They should allow us to take the cinema. No. No cinemas.",
        "A: People lived in the street and these thousands...in the first half year of the ghetto, and\nthen little by little...what _ little, they killed five hundred and forty. Then they killed\nthousand two hundred, and then they killed another thousand, and then they killed ten\nthousand, so then became space.",
        "A: Yes. It was...1t was just the the most...for instance, my wife. My wife was always at the\nentrance of the prison gate looking for her husband for...maybe maybe among\nthose who they used to take out from prison for work, and she thought maybe she will see\nhim . But while so waiting and looking for her husband near the prison and then\nthe 9th fortress, so she didn't take her time to go to the housing committee of the ghetto\nand get an order for a dwelling, and when she came it was already the last days of the\nghetto and there was no dwelling available at all. You understand? So it was only by by\nby chance or by incident, by accident...I don't know...whatever you want to call...that she\nmade some very good friends, they gave her a corner in their dwelling for her and for her\nlittle daughter, and all our minds were absorbed to look to to rescue her husband. You\ncan understand it.",
        "A: We... ... there were two two things. Those homeless, we took for instance a a\nsynagogue, and they parade them in hundred, hundred, three hundred, four hundred, five\nhundred people, old and young and we called it a , to reserve, to reserve for for\nhomeless, for roofless, and such was the ____s were approximately five, six in the\nghetto. And then the others plainly were in the courtyards and andinthe  _\u2014__. II\nhave here an excellent drawing by Joseph ; . So uh it was a most\nterrible time. It was a time of starvation. In order to to to make it more more visible for\nyou, we had in the ghetto vegetable gardens, free, open space so we built the potatoes so\nthat in the harvest, we worked potatoes, but the people were starving so they couldn't wait\nuntil the potatoes would be ripe so they were...they all jumped on the on the vegetable uh\ngardens and they took all the unripe potatoes and they ate them. And I have a...such a\npainting of Esther _\u2014 of those people grabbing, you know, the the vegetables, garden,\nthe potatoes and and this is where they caught...the Jewish caught in the ghetto\nand they said , one of the bright spots of the ghetto, because Dr. Elkes tried to keep\nthe ghetto not to turn into animals and not to eat one another so he tried Jews ,\nfor instance, those who grabbed the potatoes, they brought them to court. We knew that\nthey they are innocent but nevertheless, all of them must be and they were brought\nto court. Who was brought to court? One of one of the pharmacy, one doctor, and five\nplain, plain families that they had nothing , but nevertheless they were brought to\ncourt and they were...and they were let's say punished by first uh if it would happen\nanother time something else, so and so.",

So will you take the parcel she says so she throws a parcel and they\ngrab it, you know, and they hide it and at night when I come back to the to to the ghetto, I\ngo straight to Pnina and I bring her the parcel that I have. Pnina, I have regards from\nyou...for you fromthe \u2014=\u2014. ~~\u2014\u2014._ Says yes, I spoke to her and here's the parcel.\nAnd she told me that she has sent you several parcels, but she never got any...any\nresponse from you. Did you ever get these parcels? She says no, this is the first parcel\nthat I get, you see, and there were also people like that in the ghetto. They took it or\npeople were taken uh that they couldn't go to to town so they used to trade in a pair of\ntrousers or a or a or a Suit or dresses to give people who go___\u2014__ and they would trade in\nand bring the bread. Others used to take the the the clothing and never bring back not not\nthe clothing, not the bread, and this ___\u2014 were brought to the to the Jewish court, you see,\nSO So So people took parcels for Pnina and they never gave it to her.",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "A: First of all...let me...let me finish with Pnina because this is a very very . So when\nI went in and then I saw the conditions. The dwelling...it was winter. It was cold and in\nthe wall between the between the uh...you know, between between the the the woods,\nthere was ice, so I told her, Pnina, don't you have any...we used to give portions of fire\nwood, very small portions, very small portions, but nevertheless...to go...why didn't you\ngo to ask for for for for fire wood, for a portion of firewood, and since you have a child,\nyou are entitled to another half portion for the child. You understand? And so I started\nand I helped her. I was instrumental in bringing this and bringing that and one day Pnina\nwent to work and she tried to trade in her...her evening gown for bread and she was\ncaught by the police and she was taken to the Gestapo, to the Lithuanian criminal police\nand when they they made...the the workers of the brigade where Pnina worked uh came\nback to the ghetto so they came to me and told me Pnina is under arrest and I tried\nimmediately what can I do. There was a man by the name of who was the\nforeman of the group of inmates that worked in the building of the Gestapo, so he used to\nhave some contacts, you know. He used to bribe one Gestapo so I ran immediately to his\nhouse in the ghetto so he looked. You have __\u2014\u00ab. -Youhave to help. Here is a widow.\nShe left a child. She...the child remains alone. Her father was killed, her mother in jail\nand you must do everything you can in order to...to cut the long short, long story short, I\nhad some connections with that is a special story for himself, so he was...he was\ninstrumental and we didn't disclose to ____ that her mother was under arrest so we told\nher that her mother remained to work the night shift and she will come tomorrow\nmorning and she come only tomorrow a day after tomorrow late. She was two and a half\ndays in jail, and I was instrumental to to to take care of ____ and this and that and then\nand so and that's why we...I dared to ask her whether she would be willing to hide my\nentries in the diary. I couldn't keep it with myself because in the...it was the office of\nthe...they would...used to come everyday, Germans, Lithuanians. I couldn't keep it at my\nprivate home because they would come anyhow to to to look at my private home, and I\ncouldn't give it to anybody else and when I asked Pnina just by chance, I was sure she\nwill say no. Why should she take such a one terrible risk? Find a a entry of diary...this\nmeans death. Hundreds percent...no mercy. But she said . So I said Pnina,\nthink over again. This is a very dangerous thing. I'll hide it. Alright...alright. To cut a\nlong story short, she was hiding it and this messenger that I...we were in the ghetto...he\nworked with me in the secretariat of the ghetto, he used to bring this every morning under\nhis shirt, you know, the the entry of that day and bring it to her. This young thirty years\nold... = ishisname, _\u2014.~ He's now in New York, in thatuh\nThree years he used to bring from me to Pnina...not one word did he spill out. ;\nNot one word and never did he fail and you know, you...of course, from the Germans,\neven even Jews in the ghetto...so I have all the respect and admiration for this and\nyou must not...you will understand whatever I could I have done. (laughter)\nYou see, and this 1s...I I could see how Pnina with whom he spared, starving for bread.\nShe was a daughter of the richest family in Lithuania. She graduated the university in\nVienna before the war. She had a wonderful home, house...luxury home in town.",
        "A: ,",
        "A: Yes...yes...so I don't want to tell you her background. I knew her from the you\nsee but nevertheless, this her hiding and often I used to come there in the evening and I\nwas entirely exhausted. Sometimes I had terrible experience with the Germans in town\nand I just couldn't take more and I said tonight I am...I cannot write the diary. She said\nyou can not. Dictate to me and she took the pencil and paper and she wrote with me entry\nfor that day, and that's why you'll find in my...in the original, her handwriting. You\nunderstand? So this is...so we did not make love so much as one can think, but we made\nso very much human...human contact, human devotion to each other that that cannot...I\nhave no words to express it. I had...I must now tell you in my youth...I...1t was very\ndangerous thing for me to meet a girl or go out with out a girl or more than that, but this\nwas not the case with Pnina. Pnina was pure...pure love, devotion and sacrifice, sacrifice.\nThis is what was. And I was lucky that this was . She returned. Now we\nhad...you asked about the day to day life. It was..1t was \u2014\u2014\u2014.:~ People...what would\nthe the the the agenda of the day. You get up at five o'clock when , not sunshine,\nbefore sunshine. Most of the people in the ghetto have to report to the main ghetto gate\nand go out to the to work in in town. All the roads and the workshops in the ghetto is\n____ eight hundred people, and you immediately go in the machinery of slavery, or\norder, of beating up, of of calling all kinds of names and you you you forget that you are\na human being. The only thing is how to get a loaf of bread or Pnina, how to getaa\nsome little bit of milk for for __, and and how come back safe, pass through the ghetto,\nand when the day is through, you come back. It's already night and until you pass the\ngate and then they take you away from the gate. They take you to prison or they take you\nto commandant and when you come home, you are already so exhausted that you fell in\nbed. This... and so on, but also waiting were the police and the and the office\nand institutions. We were in the very same atmosphere of danger. How many times did I\ngot to town to work? Just because to have a better feeling for myself. You understand?\nAnd and there were all kinds of songs. You know and uh of course those in the\ncommittee, there was a song...you ask me why I'm not ___ the committee. If I wouldn't\nbe in the committee, I wouldn't have this and I wouldn't have that and ...(laughter).",

        "A: I have it in my head. I I have it...I have it in the...I asked...I suggested that they should\nput in and they didn't put it in, but this wonderful song.

I cannot translate it, but this is just one of them, and of course...",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Oh and how...and how. This was the great thing. For instance, I'll tell you...where\nto...this was...you asked me about life...this was the daily life in the ghetto, but in in\naddition, we had for instance Pnina, the same Pnina, but from this Pnina would not...there\nwas not another one. As I told you, she had a very tiny place. Then she got a little bigger\nplace and we had a circle, cultural circle, eight to ten people. There was a poet and there\nwere two...two writers and then there was a Jewish writer, a Polish Jewish writer\nwho wrote a very great novel and there was a...the head of the cultural department of the\nghetto, Dr. , and uh there were Garfunkle who 1s a...was a member of the\nparliament and myself, so we used to meet once in two weeks for two hours. Where? In\nPnina's dwelling. Where did we sit there? You cannot imagine. But there we sit two\nhours, each one...one used to read all of his poems and we had a journalist, Dr. \u2014\u2014_, who\nlistened to the...to understand radio and he used to report on what's going on the front.\nAnd he...he was called around the the the intelligence...military intelligence report. And\nthere was one that was reading from what he had written and sometimes I used to read\none of my entries. These were two hours of inspiration, that not everything is lost, that\nnot everything is bread, that not everything is tears, that there is life in in . In\nthe depths of hopelessness, there is a strife of light and this strife of light in my case it\nwas Pnina, of course, but everyone hada _\u2014\u2014_\u2014.~ Such two hours intellectual, cultural.\nThis was entirely contra to what the ghetto stands for, entirely __\u2014 to what is\nsurrounding, but we felt a need in this. You understand. Or for instance, I wa,s as I told\nyou, one of the founders and leaders of the Zionist underground, so one day I get a call\nfrom the from the ghetto, main ghetto gate. There...there is one woman that speaks...she\nis...she wants to speak to you. She asked for and when we said that \u00a9\ncannot be reached, she asked for . I didn't know who who was it, so give it to\nme. Soshetellsme _\u2014\u00ab. ~- Yes. Ibringregardsto youfrom __.. was a\nZionist underground in Vilna that we heard from our correspondence. So I told her, tell\nhim take care and bring her straight to me. Who was it? It was Irena Adamowicz, who is\nin the book. She was a Polish that was very much close to the \u2014 =| movement in\nPoland and she was going from ghetto to ghetto, bringing reports to each other and it was\nfor the first time after a year that we heard \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014sccame. She said I want to talk to you,\nso I said please talk. She says no, I want to talk you in private. So I went in one of the\nrooms. She says I come now from Vilna. Iam...I bring regards from ___or from this\nor from this...so of course we cannot talk here. She says alright, so I arranged\nimmediately a meeting of... meeting of the committee of the _\u2014_\u2014__iof the\nunderground at my private dwelling and I...there were two from the underground |\nthat said alarm if somebody comes in and all went to to work in my...because they were\nin my dining room where all the members of the executive of the Zionist underground\nand in addition Dr. Elkes and Garfunkle, yes, and uh and uh Dr. uh Dr. Shapiro was\nthere. There was a who was also a member of the underground. For a half a\nday long, she reported to us on what's going on in the ghettos. For the first time that it\ntold what could be...you know, something was going on behind the barbed wires. We\nnever had a slightest idea and here comes a woman. She spoke fluently Yiddish, and\nthat's why the gate...they couldn't...they couldn't be suspicious because if she would speak\nPolish or something, they wouldn't let her in at all. You understand? And this woman\ndisclosed to us for the first time so open, a little little = say in Hebrew, in English,\n____, a little window, a small window to the outer world, what goes on in Warsaw, what\ngoes on in Vilna, what goes on in Lodz. And then we reported to her on what's going on\nin the ghetto and she was amazed, so this encounter with such a Polish Catholic woman\nwho is exceptional. By the way, she came to Palestine the \u2014_\u2014_\u2014_Israel, in '56, and she\nwas . You cannot imagine what...to tell you...unfortunately none of my sisters\nuh survived. They all were perished in the war, but even if my sister would come I\nwouldn't be so happy she was there, and they took her around and everything. I___ out\nof my way and I look to please her and so on, but she was a Communist. Ofcourse _,\nand this is where we...where we differed. But this very meeting inside the ghetto with an\noutsider was in itself a breakthrough, not exactly what the Germans intended...their\nintention to to close us behind barbed wires, that nothing should be known to us what's\ngoing on and nothing should be going out what's going on inside and when the 28th of\nOctober...this terrible day, the most terrible day in the ghetto, the selection of 28,000\npeople, inmates of the ghetto, and they told it...I don't want to repeat because they spoke\nabout it with regard to Dr. Elkes this morning before, so this selection of eight, ten\nthousand were in one day...all of a sudden we felt that we are...1f it can happen in one day\nthat the men their own finger in their, ___...",
        "A: Pointing, since ten thousand today, so we would have been __.",
        "A: I beg you pardon? First of all, the the Gestapo said that in ghetto are people who are\nworking hard and there are people who are working less, and people who don't work at\nall, so we'll know that the portions of food for those who are working is not enough. We\nknow that hundred grams of bread per day per person who works is not enough, so we\nwant to enlarge this portion for those who are working and to leave the portions that are\nnow only for those who don't work in order to make sure who i1s...these who are working,\nso we want that you should...all...all the inmates of the ghetto, thirty thousand, should\nreport on the 28th of October on the big square democratic, families-wise and groups of\nworking-wise, you see, and then when they make they make uh divide separately in one\nplace those who are working hard and those get double rations and those who are don't\nwork will get the same rations as now. So Dr. Elkes said if this should be done, he said,\nwe can do it ourselves. We take...give you the list of the people __ ourselves out of\ndepartment of supply, we'll give double rations to those who are working and give less\nrations, the same rations to those who are not. For that purpose, you don't need all of the\n30,000 inmates of the ghetto to report on on on the democratic square. We we we do not\nbelieve that this is the true reason for for that order and Elkes worked very hard and he\nmet twice with Roka (ph). As I told you...and what did they tell Elkes to .\nMr. Roka, Mr. Commander, may I talk to you as man to man? It is not....\nEND OF TAPE 2",
        "A: Yes. So uh Dr. Elkes tried to squeeze out from Roka what is the real reason for ordering\nthirty thousand people, old and young, sick and healthy, uh babies in in in the arms of\ntheir...children...why do they have to go to the court? Will..if it's a matter of food\nrationing, we'll arrange it. So he says no, the Jews are too much uh close to each other\nand they have...and they aren't very...they aren't very...for each other, they they\nwouldn't...they they cannot trust others will do it. They'll give to one and they'll share\nwith the others and...to cut a long story short, we did not believe that this is the real\nreason for for ordering all on the square and a certain...certain members of the of the\nJewish community...Jewish committee said that we should not uh give the instructions or\nwe should not make public the order. Why should the Gestapo itself not make public? It\nshould write in public...why would they want us. They wanted because if it would more\ninformation and an announcement of the Jewish committee, there would seem that if the\nJewish committee is ordering that, and this under no circumstances wanted to do, so\nfinally they decided that we should ask the...to consult the chief rabbi Shapiro (ph) who\nwas aa Scholar of world fame. He was at one time a candidate to be the chief rabbi of\n_____ Israel, and uh we we went to him and he he said that it's a very hard question and he\nhas to check with the...and when we come...he told us to come at eleven...at eleven\no'clock night and then he told us to come at five o'clock in the morning and he was not\nready, and then to cut a long story short, he came very along and finally he said...he\nphoned...in in certain conditions that the Jewish community was placed intoaaaa\nsituation, that if there is a possibility to rescue part of the community and not the whole\ncommunity, the Jewish leadership has to do everything in order to rescue the this what is\npossible. I'll tell you later about the the very famous story about the two went in the\ndesert and had also left one cup of water and it was sufficient only for one of them. If one\nof them will drink the water, the other will die. If both of them will drink, nobody\nwill...and this is...so after having heard this this uh consultation of the chief rabbi, it was\nthe wording of the of the of the formation of the ..the announcement was in a\nsay that the Gestapo ordered the Jewish population of the ghetto to appear, not that the\nJewish committee but the Gestapo ordered the Jewish community...so and those who will\nnot appear at the...at six o'clock in the morning, and those who will not appear at six\no'clock in the morning and they will be found in their house, each one which will be\nfound in his house will be killed on the spot.

No one could live on a hundred grams, but also this hundred grams of bread,\nthe uh the inmates didn't...the the the individual inmate didn't get because we had kept\nsecret two thousand souls in the ghetto. Babies that had been born despite the the strict\norder to cut off pregnancies. Second there were old men or sick men that if you would\nput them on the register of the in...inmates of the ghetto, they would have been killed, so\nthis two thousand...approximately two thousand had to be...to get food, so we cut off\nfrom the general portion that we got uh so everyone got only approximately eighty grams\nor eighty-five grams of bread so that the others can get also. So each one in his own way\ntried to get additional food. You couldn't go in in the supermarket and buy it. You\ncouldn't go in because in the ghetto there was nothing, so people used to go to the...to\nwork outside town and there try to get out for ten or fifteen minutes and buy and buy...not\nbuy because nobody sold. It's war time and it were sanctions also in the city but the\nLithuanians had enough food but they wanted always to trade in. They would give you a\nloaf of bread or half a loaf of bread for a pair of trousers or stockings or a jacket or\nwhatever. I...for reason I remember it was the 31st of December, 1942. My present wife\nsold out...already sold out everything she got, but she...there was left a gown, you know,\nfor the ball, for very festivity...made big festivities. She was a rich woman, so...but\nnobody bought a gown in in in time of war, so we had in the opera house in 1n in Kovno,\nthere were a group of Jewish workers who worked then in the opera house as\ndressmakers, as uh as to make the haircuts and uh you know, __, and they were also\nworking and cleaning the the opera house so I took Pnina and went as workers in that\nbrigade and she took along with her the gown. It was a wonderful gown, you know, and\nwith the...accordingly also a pair of shoes, you know...elegant, and there on the 31st of\nthe...before...the eve of the New Year, the actresses there jumped on this merchandise,\nyou see, and so she she got some bread and and a little bit of uh of uh sugar, you see, for\nthe gown, which costed hundreds and hundreds. Just in one of the examples of one\nfought for the survival of another day, more so when she had a small child and she\nneeded...badly needed milk that you couldn't get in the ghetto, leave alone an egg, you\nsee, so this was an opportunity for her to bring milk and then when she got it all and she\ngot rid of her gown and this, it was a problem how to pass the control at the ghetto gate.\nWhen...at the ghetto gate there always sentries of the ghetto commandant, the German\nghetto commandant, then all the Lithuanians on one side. From inside there were the uh\nemployees of the Jewish labor exchange who used to to arrange the exit of the laborers in\nthe groups from the ghetto out to outside to their places of work and they were...had ways\nand means to bribe certain sent...sentry or the Lithuanian or the German, and so they keep\nuh close... close an eye and and they pass by, take part of 1t and give them as bribe you\nsee, but nevertheless something left, and in this way people tried...tried not to starve, just\nplainly...very plain words...not to starve. And uh some some others used to to get\na...make this deal of trade in above or through the ghetto fence. There was a barbed wire\nfence, two meters high. The Lithuanians knew that there is a shortage of food inside the\nghetto, so they used to come and from a from a distance show a loaf of bread or show a a\nsugar or show five eggs, you see, and the and the...from inside the ghetto they used to\nshow a pair of trousers or a jacket or something like that, and when they...when they nod\nof the of the of the head, they came to to an agreement or they trade in, so when\nthe...along...along the barbed wire always twenty-four hours a day, the sentry used to go\nback and forth, back and forth, so the moment when the sentry used to go, let's say to the\nleft, they used to throw above...above the the uh fence to the Lithuanians and they used to\nto send...to throw above the the food, and we used tocallit =.

        "A: No. In Kovno they had a wonderful opera house. It was in the center of the city and they\nhad excellent, excellent Lithuanian...Lithuanian uh singers. Also one Jew was...a\nJew...one of the main singers was a Jew, but the orchestra, the musicians mostly were\nJews and part of them, those who were not killed before entering the ghetto, they were in\nthe ghetto. First-class musicians. For instance, this soloist of the of the musicians,\nyes...he was in the ghetto. A soloist, violinist. And several others. The doorman at the\nuh Jewish committee offices were a first-class pianist. We didn't send them to work\nbecause we wanted to to to save their hands, their fingers, you see, but he was a doorman\nand was very happy to be a doorman. You understand? Others were policemen, you see.\nThey were such policemen like you were but they...this was the way to keep to keep uh\ntheir fingers, you know, that not be entirely...and in addition they were certainly not used\nto hard labor, you see, and some use... can switch over...whenI talk about the _\u2014_ I\nwant to finish with regard to the to the fight and then small children were in danger\nof being killed in the first place because they don't...so what did we do? We arranged a\nso-called vegetable garden guard of young children of the age of eight to twelve. From\nthe age of twelve they could already get a work and be laborers and and a a card, a labor\ncard which was absolutely vital in the ghetto, but what would we do with the children\nfrom eight to twelve, so we organized this. They were a group that was called ss,\n... the the guards of the gardens. We had only vegetable gardens, and the\nvery about about a hundred and yet they had a uniform, you see, and they had\nan arm band and so in this way we could...and these young...youngsters also wanted to\neat, so they used to try, you see, first of all uh when they were in the gardens and the\ngardens were along the ghetto...the ghetto fence, so they also sometimes...being small\nchildren, they used to squeeze through the ope...raise a fence. One keeps the fence...two\npeople comes from both sides. He is a small child so he came through, dig a little bit in\nthe earth, you see, and he went out and brings, sneaks in some bread or something and\nand he makes in the ghetto, you see, so even small children were cautious of the danger\nof starvation and they have knowingly lent into danger of life in order to get some food.",
        "A: Oh yes...well, you see, so uh fortunately... unfortunately from the beginning we were\nnot...we were not conscious of the great danger of these children because we never\nthought that they can take children and kill them, but when the the aktion of the 4th of\nOctober, 1941, when they put on fire the contagious hospital in the small ghetto with the\npatients inside, with the uh doctors and with the personnel, medical personnel, all of the\nthem, they were put on fire and they lead...but before they put on fire this building, the\nadjacent building was a children's home, an orphan's home, and there were approximately\nfive, six hundred children so they took them out from the building in the broad...in the\ncourtyard of the...of the contagious diseases hospital and were just plain put them...I can\nnever forget the picture. There were small children and babies, just babies, in the in the\norphan's homes so the Germans when they put them on the on the on the ground, on the\nground, and they just kicked them from one side to the other side with their with their\nboots, the Gestapo men. People like beasts. They behaved just like beef...beasts. They\nused to kick them...when the children laid, for instance, with their faces up to to heaven,\nyes, so they kicked them, then turned down, and then again. This was a just terrible,\nterrible, terrible sight to see it and then they took them from that courtyard straight to the\n9th Fortress and they killed them in the very same day together with another thousand uh\ninmates of the small ghetto, after they put on fire the the the hospital. They did not\nlet...our firemen were very...were the fire brigade in the ghetto...excellent fire...firemen\nwere trained years and they were ready to to to...but they didn't let them come near to the\nplace, you see. There were Lithuanian fire brigades who came close to the close to the uh\nghetto fence, but they came just to safeguard that the fire shouldn't come over to the other\nside of the of the fence. You understand? And this is...so you see they were just not to to\nto fight the fire but to see that the fire shouldn't grow to the other side and uh this was one\nof the most tragic days and what...it is worthwhile mentioning, in that very contagious\ndiseases hospital, you see, we were...we didn't have so much space and so many\nhospitals, so part of this contagious diseases hospital served as a maternity where\nchildren...women gave birth to to children. This, of course, was absolutely\nagainst...contrary to the to the restrictions of of pregnancy and so on, so when they took\nout the uh the uh the uh the uh...they took out from their beds many sick people and they\nbrought them in one place where they couldn't __ for sure. They shouldn't remain\nsometimes in _. _There was left some part of the building, left after the \u2014_, so in\none...they they left...they didn't...they just pass by one room where two women were\nlaying after giving birth to the child, to the babies, and the two babies were on, you know,\non the window there 1s a...big window there is such a...you know, like let's say this is the\nwindow and here is such a small...a small wooden...wooden...",
        "A: Yes. So at this two...there are the two children, so when they came to control if\nsomebody was left in the room, so they saw the two women and they were about to take\nthem out, but then one of them saw the children, so he...he came near to the babies and\nthey looked and they looked and they and they...all of a sudden, some human...human\nfeeling came perhaps in in in his in his heart, you see, so he said to the other one, what do\nyou think? Shall we leave these two babies? You see...and in silent they went out and\nthey left the two women with the two children. I...] am telling this to stress that even\namong the murderers were single, very rare, very rare...but there were sometimes people\nwith human feelings and they behaved sd human beings and not like beasts like all their\ntheir comrades. Being with the swastika and over the Nazi, you know, the grey...the grey\nuniform with the with the swastika with all this...to look at them was...one got frightened,\nyou see, but these men, that they came back and they looked at the faces of the baby, he\ncouldn't withheld from being...they they commit...and these two women and these two\nbabies were the only one that left from from from that hospital, you see, and this 1s...this\nis...we always remember it.",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "A: Well...so so at that time...at that time, when they liquidated the ghetto, the small ghetto,\nthey took thousand men from the ghetto and they liquidated to the 9th Fortress, so I didn't\nhave any \u2014\u2014_\u2014smorre in '42...1t was...in '41 in the beginning I have to say prior to the\naktions on on human beings, on life, they took...confiscated all the belongings and they\nwere...when the ghetto inmates were ordered under threat of death to give all their gold,\ntheir belongings, their silver, furs, __, post stamps, collections...whatever valuables,\nand there were two stations in the in the...near the Jewish committee where the Jews had\nto bring bring all their belongings and wherever they...while making the searches inside\nthe houses, each other, and sometimes on the spot killing them and and this brought about\nthe people to run and get rid of their gold, to get rid of their silver, to get rid of their of\ntheir of their furs, you see, so we didn't have any cameras anymore. If...1n...on the\n__...1t was in August. The the big...the big confiscation, the total confiscation of\nwhatever people had had with them. Others digged it in the earth or somewhere and they\ndidn't...like Mack (ph)...I'll think about them later, but the the overwhelming majority,\nthey were left without a penny and without any valuable, clothing or or furs or whatever\nit was, so I didn't have a camera anymore, and I thought it is absolutely\npossible...impossible that this event, that this side should not be somehow eternalized for\nposterity, but this already...the ghetto, small ghetto was out of bounds. It was cut off\nfrom from the ghetto. I'm sorry I didn't take along with me my documents. I would have\nshown you. Sol went toto Esther \u2014\u2014_\u2014s, and I told her, Esther, you must draw what\nremained from the burned hospital, so she said how can we come in. It is it is out of\nbounds, so I I went to the commandant of the ghetto and I told him that since it was it\nwas October...in in Lithuania in October it is already cold and very cold and we had no\nfirewood in the ghetto and what they used to give us, just like the hundred grams of\nbread, this was the same story with the with the firewood, so I told them in the small\nghetto, some families left some firewood. Would he allow us to take out from this from\nthese dwellings inside the small ghetto, to take out the firewood? So he he...and I don't\nremember that I mentioned it yesterday that the commandant of the ghetto, mostly they\nwere elderly men and they were not so, you know, fanatic like this, so they had\nunderstanding...he had understanding for this and he tells me alright, I give you two\nhours, two hours to go in into the into the...so I said I need a uh a wagon, you know, but I\ndidn't need a wagon. I wanted that Esther, so he he gave a wagon and I took Esther and I\nwent in inside there and we stood and we looked where would be the best position\ngeographically for Esther __, to the painter, to stand and to paint it, but to paint from\noutside would be would be very dangerous because they could have killed us on the spot\nbecause all the time the sentries go around the gate...the the fence, so I decided that we\nshould go inside a building and the adjacent building from the left side of the burned\nhospital was a two-story house so we went into this story...two-story and we arrived on\nthe second floor and Esther from the the window from which she could have a good look\non the remain...what remained from the hospital and she painted and she drawed and she\ndraw and this is what she have made it, but all of a sudden when...as she paints she...and I\nam on the outlook...all of a sudden I hear somebody went in in the first floor so I got\nfrightened to death because if they would found us, Esther... probably it would have been\nthe finish for her, and I was responsible. I'm the bad guy that brought her about her about\nit, you see, and I felt terrible, frightened to death, so I went closer to the staircase in order\nto see who is there, so that when they heard the...my footsteps so they run out. What\nhappened? These were Lithuanians who had...who came in just to to to to steal and to\ntake away what the Jews have left, so you see this was also...and this __\u2014_\u2014scibut to to\nlearn the moment of danger to death was always there and uh she has done it and, of\ncourse, I took her some firewood from the house, from another house and be...behind the\nfirewood I put the the drawings of Esther \u2014\u2014_\u2014s and we safe came back to the to the\nghetto. There was another place where Itook Esther \u2014_\u2014_._I don't know. I think I\nmentioned to you that the...were the _ of the Lithuanians in the...in Slobodka. This is\nthe very suburb where later was the ghetto, that on on the very beginning, on the...at the\nnight of June 25th to the 26th, the Lithuanians massacred thousand Jews in the\nSlobodka...in the Slobodka suburb. They just went from street to street and one of the\nhouses...I I...then I I'm always after to see what it looks like, but they closed up the area\nand nobody could go in and and the and the houses after they have been looted, they\nclosed up with uh wooden blocks and uh and uh and plywood so you couldn't go in inside\nthe the the houses because it was locked from __. Anyhow, I I went in with Esther\n_____ and one house that I knew was a a Zionist leader. He was the director of the\ninin Lithuania. ____s~was his name, a famous veteran Zionist. His wife was a\ndentist, and I wanted to know what happened to him, sol took Esther _ again and,\nyou know, I am a sportsman so for me to to, you know, toto _, that was not sucha\nbig problem, but for Esther _, it was not easy. So first of all I had to to take off\nsome wooden...how do you call it...the such uh they closed the the doors...",
        "A: Panels. Yes. Panels. Board (ph) of panels...but they were only only with nails, not\nvery...not very steady, not very strong so I could easily take it off, you see, and we\nscurried (ph). First of all I went in and then I made it broader so Esther could\ngo in and then I took it again, so from the outside it was as as it was before before we\nclimbed in and we climbed in in the house. What we have seen was a terrible, terrible\nthing. There were three rooms. In one room was the head of ______ and his body was\nonthe onthe \u2014_. _ There was blood on the on the walls. Uh you know, all the feathers\nfrom the from the from the from the beds and from...it was full in in...and also with with\nwith blood...the feathers from the __ and from the couches and so on. It was just\nterrible to look at it, and that the second room was the uh dentist's...his wife was a dentist\nand there was the the, you know, the dentist's special equipment and this stool and\nshe...the wife was slain on the on the on the on the stool of the dentist and dead. II\ncan't...when she painted it, she painted the the the one room of of the \u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014s*house and we\nhave it in her in her album.",
        "A: It was terrible. It was just terrible but but but you you had no way out. You had to...so so\nuntil until until Esther _...you know, I had to calm her down and to calm myself down\nfirst of all, but I brought her in. I'm responsible for her and she's there and she painted\nit...and she painted it. And she cried and she cried and then she painted and cried again\nand this was a terrible thing. Look, there wasinthe == where _\u2014_\u2014swwere, [havea\nphoto, one of my photos, of a yeshivamanonhis __,onhis__\u2014_\u2014_\u2014_,on the\nand with his talis (ph) on himself. He \u2014\u2014__ so killed, so he he\nremained on it, so this was one of the paintings and there were many other paintings like\nthat that I went on in order to produce visual evidence to what I have writ...I have written,\nbecause nobody would would...I said to myself and I told it to myself...who would\nbelieve what I am writing. It is out of human understanding and it is out of what any\ncommunity in the world could think of. A barb...barbarism is not the right word for it.\nAnd...but I was lucky enough that Esther sand Joseph Schleslinger (ph), and then\nthere was another...another uh...on the 11th of January, 1942, the German Gestapo\nordered to the one area of the ghetto, the _\u2014_ area, to...they should vacate their their\ndwellings within four hours and whoever will be found in the in their dwelling in this\narea after the expires the four hours, you will be shot on the spot without any\nclarifications and whatever will be remain of their belongings will be confiscated. They\nsaid, the Gestapo said that they need the area and these dwellings to settle the Jews who\nare to come at this very day from Germany and from Austria, five thousand Jews. That\narea lived only three thousand, but they squeezed...so when we heard, we took it for\ngranted that first of all five thousand Jews are coming to the ghetto and Dr. Elkes, the\nhead of the Jewish Council, said we have to meet them as brothers, give them the feeling\nthey are coming to brothers, so he ordered that the women should prepare hot coffee for\nthem because the terrible cold...in January was the thirty...thirty centigrades\nbelow...below uh below uh below...thirty below...the most hard winter in the ghetto was\nin 1942. Dr. Elkes himself stood all the day from the beginning whenever we we got\nword of that five thousand are to come in the ghetto, he stood at the main gate with\nseveral people, and with women who were ready to give them...offer them coffee. He felt\nvery much...and he he says I can understand the feeling that these people were taken out\nfrom the houses, from the from the countries, and they don't know where they're being\nbrought. At least give them a greeting for...when they will have to cross the gate behind\nbarbed wires, they should...barbed wires they should know that they're coming with\nbrothers. So we...those inmates from this area to be vacated in four hours didn't have any\ntransportation. They were not allowed to to use transportation, horses or wagons, so they\ndragged, you know, in their hands, bundles on their on their shoulders. They uh...some\nuh some uh home uh utensils like uh like uh for children to bath, you know, the...it was\nused to drag it and on the snow. You understand? I I saw the the the the picture of all the\npeople frightened to death to be in time not to remain there after the...1t was just...I said\nthis scene I must put on a drawing, and then I didn't find Esther \u2014\u2014_\u2014s, so I run to...there\nwas one young...the youngest painter in the ghetto. He was Schmidt. Schmidt, Joseph\nSchmidt, but we called him , aanickname as , and when I came to\n____'s home, I found him. I was the happiest man. Isaid _ come quick and take\nsome paint, some pencils with you and paper. We have to to to paint this...we have to\nrush to the _ area, paint the exile, the exile of...the expulsion. And when he didn't...he\nhe he was not conscious of the of the urgency. Every minute counts...I would say not\nminute...but every hour counts, and he slowly...[ said _\u2014_\u2014, quick. Have no time...I\ndidn't...nothing. So he he took another coat, of course, as it was very cold, and took some\npaper and and and some pen. In addition to the pen and pencil, he took color paints. I\nsaid what for does he need these color paints, but he didn't listen to me at all and he took\neverything, put under his under his overcoat and bring just running. It was far away from\nhis...1t was on the other side of the ghetto. Running we came to the site and there I had to\nfind a place where he could stand and make his paintings that should not be seen by the\nGermans, not even before Jews. You understand? And he stood in a certain place which\nhe found...he found a place we thought for him \u2014_ and I stood on the outlook and then\nI called for two of our underground...there were...everybody went to this area to help\nthem take out...to help them. Everybody tried to help them, so Esther took two of my\nknown members of the underground and said you, you just cover that his body it __ that\nnobody should see him, you see, and I stood onthe _ and he painted and he painted\nand he painted andI toldhim, __, quick, finish, . Every minute can come a\nGestapo and then it it will finish not only for your painting but it finish then to you and to\nme, but he didn't give in and he painted and he painted and this is now one of the most\ncharacteristic paintings of the of the Holocaust in Lithuania. It is in my book, with\ncolors, oil painting, so this was and this was the the the liquidation of that\nquarter. The Jews came from Germany, but they were sent straight to the 9th Fortress\nand were killed the very same day and the part, the area was cut off from the ghetto.",
        "A: I beg your pardon.",
        "A: No. They didn't...they cut off from the ghetto. They had to to squeeze in in in the\nremaining part of the ghetto. You understand? And the tension was even higher and\npainful, more painful than it was because three thousand had to squeeze in in anyway\nof the ghetto.",
        "A: We have seen them. You see, Dr. Elkes at the gate was waiting for their coming, and all\nday Dr. Elkes didn't drink even not cold water. He was in such shape, tense, waiting,\nexpecting, and they didn't come and they didn't come. In the afternoon, they were\nbrought and you know, the way to the 9th Fortress comes along...it's a half a kilometer,\nhalf a mile, from the ghetto fence, up on the hill it goes, and you can see. Everybody in\nthe ghetto could see and we saw them. They came...these five thousand men, and then\nhow did I...we know? As I told you, in the Gestapo building worked a group of Jewish\ninmates from the ghetto in cleaning, in in , In in in in the cleaning the the the\nlavatories, in in uh and all kinds of...so they, when they came back, they came\nthe next morning to work, they could see many many suitcases and bundles with names\nof from Berlin, from Frankfurt, the name of the Jew...you know, the the Gestapo\ntook...they looted their their belongings and they brought...you see, and they threw away\nthe uh the suitcases and the bundles and you could see the names and addresses of the\npeople who were brought in, so we were...there was no lot of doubt that this were the five\nthousand who were killed in the very same day on the 9th Fortress.",
        "A: Always they take. First of all, they take off the rings, the gold and then they take they\ncount the valuables, and they put them in their hip pockets. They don't bring it to the\nGestapo. You understand? From the board where the suitcases, on the trucks...so we had\nalways several size that are workers in that building uh used to work and uh this was also\none day in the ghetto unexpected. You never knew what the next day will bring you.\nThere is a very nice poetry, Russian language...what does you today or tomorrow bring\nupon us. . What expect us...what brings to us the next day? Will it be\nday of sorrow, of pain, or will it bring to us a new hope, a new joy? It is a very, very nice\npoet from a very famous uh Russian poet. We don't like the Soviets, but we like very\nmuch the poetry and their language and their literature. I am telling you I I I was uh I\nwas...] lived...Lithuania was under under these Russian czars and I studied law, the\nRussian law, not the Bolshevik law. Come back to the ghetto.",
        "A: So so...you know, there were...there were...there were...there were various kinds of\nreactions. There were people in the ghetto that didn't...they they thought maybe this is\nthe last day so why not eat? Why not drink, that people will manage to bring in, to\nsmuggle in...we calledthem __...the smugglers of the gate or the smugglers of the\nfence. You see, ,in Yiddish, \u2014_\u2014_\u2014s\u00ab, and smugglers, when they used to\nmake...they turned it into a trade and they used to make big money. They even got to eat\nmeat and and butter and eggs. Said let's eat. Tomorrow we will not...we will not...even\non the eve of the of the 28th of October, people were...most of the people were in tension\nand and didn't know what is going to happen tomorrow. Others thought this is the last\nday, so they used to concentrate in their thoughts, in their minds. Others took out\neverything that they had and said they will eat up everything, not to leave for the\nGermans the next day anything. You see? It...look...1t's thirty thousand people. It is not\naa...you don't think by order. You don't act as somebody would expect you to act.\nEveryone in his own way. You understand? And so there was a very very thin...a very\nthin group of people who ate in meat, in butter, in eggs, a very thin few...those were the\nsmugglers, but they, of course, uh uh rescued their...risked their life. Some of them were\nkilled. You know, youcanuhmakea___ once, twice, but the third time you...a bullet\ncomes and finish...finishes you. You understand? For instance, Dr. Elkes and all\nthose...he was close to starvation. Although he was very...again and again offered by the\nsmugglers, we'll bring you butter. We'll bring you this. He never accepted not a piece of\nbread. He used to share with me my my piece of bread, you see, or offer me his piece of\nbread, but he would never never have any connections with smugglers which we thought\nit's...the underground...it's the...what we are trying to fight, just to keep the standard of of\nhuman of human behavior, of Jewish heritage, to keep alive even under these terrible\ncircumstances of the ghetto, and this is only thanks to Dr. Elkes and to those leaders who\nwere known as community leaders before the war and they were elected by...elected, and\nthis was the difference, the big difference between the ghetto of Kovno leadership and the\nleadership in other...1n other ghettos.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. A very good question. From the very beginning we didn't have to\neat. We didn't have a hospital, but we started immediately with schools. We had\nwonderful educators, teachers, everything in Hebrew of course. Not only did we have\nschools, Hebrew schools. We taught reading and and writing, mathematics, geography,\nbut we had also a a special school artisans...artisans and in the ghetto was a...one...an\nengineer, who was the head of _____ schools in Lithuania which is a famous\nworld-wide artisan, Jewish artisan schools, and he was the...heading the artisan schools in\nthe ghetto, and also...but we had to close up the schools in the winter because of lack of\nfirewood, because the lack of firewood. The next time we had to close by order of the\nGestapo because it is ...Jews...in their mind the final solution was what do we\nneed schools to learn. What we... work as teachers, let them go to work and the\neducators, are they going to work. But even after the restricted to half and then\nliquidated, ordered to liquidate the schools, we had it in clandestine. Had it in\nclandestine.",
        "A: Yes. So first of all, we we said we need to train youngsters to for as artisans that is so\nmuch needed for the German war effort, so this they understood, so it was that the school\nit was a course for preparing of artisans, but it wasn't...for all things and purposes it\nwas...1t was a school. Yes. Second, we did it just in in in the underground. You see, in\nthe evenings and so and private groups, they just volunteered. You understand? It was a\nvery hard task, but we had a...the head of the of the cultural department in the ghetto was\nDr. Shapiro (ph), Shapiro, who was a a lecturer, senior lecturer at the University on\nSemitic languages and Semitic literature, you see. When all Jews were go into the ghetto\ntook along with them their bundles, whatever they were allowed...they weren't allowed to\ntake everything, but they had...but some belonged...he came to the committee for the\ntransfer of Jews and asked to transfer to the ghetto his...a newly edited published book,\nthe Hebrew...the history of Hebrew literature in two thousand two hundred pages. A\nbook...you can imagine...where did we have this place to to to keep them in the ghetto or\nto or to store them, but this is what he was very excited about that he should...1t was one\nof the outstanding monumental work...the history of the modern Hebrew literature and uh\nhe was the head of the of the cultural department and he...you know, we had also from\nthe children, you see, we tried to keep for them the holidays children should know.",
        "A: So first of all there was kindergarten. One day comes to me...there was a uh a teacher of\nthe kindergarten, a very well-known Mrs. _____. She was in the kindergarten\nbefore...before the war and in the ghetto she volunteered to to held the kindergarten, of\ncourse in clandestine. Very very clandestine. So , the daughter of my wife, my\npresent wife, she went also to the kindergarten and one day Mrs. ___\u2014_\u2014s comes to me,\n____, and says we must arrange for the children, for the poor children, some joy. It's\n__, wantstobe \u2014_\u2014_, and we have to make some festivity of the poem, and for that\npurpose I need colored paper (laughter)...colored paper because, you know, they have to\nhave colored paper. So I...the way she asked me, I couldn't say no, but where can you\nget it. I hardly got the paper for...needed for the secretariat, for the for the Jewish office,\ncommunity offices and the departments, so I used to go to the city and make an order\nwith the with the civil authorities, German civilian authorities, the stock commissar.\nThere was a form that uh you filled out, and I put in there colored paper...red, yellow, so\nwhen I came and presented this _\u2014___...itcalls_\u2014\u2014\u2014._:\u2018It 1s...you order...an order...a\nformal order, and the quantities. Said what do you need the colored papers for. So I told\nthem, what do you mean?

To cut a long story short, he gave me half of the portion that I\nneeded, but I was the happiest man to come back in the ghetto (laughter) and she teased\nme when I gave her the the paper, you see, and then they played...you know, the famous\nplayof = ~\u2014=andEsther =\u2014=and =~=\u2014s was waselectedtobethe \u2014__...

        "A: Yes. Now uh the the situation prior to our being incarcerated in the ghetto behind barbed\nwires, the uh terrible attacks and killings of uh Jews in the streets of Kovno, right after\nthe outbreak of the war until the the incarceration in the ghetto, called for immediate\nresistance because we had a...also even under the Soviet occupation, 1940, June 1940 to\nJune 1941, we had also a clandestine Zionist...Zionist uh movement or leadership let's say\nit was, but this is entirely different character. While under the Bolsheviks it was our\nmain aim to assist the families economically. Of the leaders we were being arrested right\non the first days of occupation, they were arrested. They were taken to Siberia. Second,\nto try and ourselves try and avoid our own exile to Siberia. It was very clear that uh\nthe...under the Soviet occupation, not only were we were able to to to maintain our\nHebrew schools, Hebrew education. They closed up immediately. They closed\nup...liquidated all the Jewish institutions leave alone the Zionist parties and movement\nand so on, but what we had is a really in the very sense of the wor...of the word, to try\nand to keep away from arrest and to keep out hiding. We were hiding. I, for instance,\nwere were hiding from the moment when I was told my brother-in-law was not a Zionist.\nMy sister, means my sister, she was religious and Zionist-minded woman and she was the\noldest sister, . She didn't allow me to live in a pri...in a in a...somewhere\nelse but with her, to stay with her all the years that I studied at the University of Kovno\nlaw. Yes. She was very much devoted. She was Zionist and she was religious. To the\ncontrary, my my brother-in-law, her husband Benjamin, a very decent, very honest and\nvery fine person, he wasn't...he was uh in the so-called...there was a movement of Jewish\nleft, Bundists (ph)...",

He told me...my\nbrother know this what I've told you but remember, it was...he told me, look Avraham,\nyou're on the list to be exiled to Siberia, so just try to to to...from the surface...disappear.\nSo I told him wait a minute. I will sleep with you. He says what? You'll sleep with\nme...if they want to find you, you will...they will come to me. They know that I am your\nbrother-in-law and they know that...your sister. So I finally tried hiding in various places\nin the outskirts. I run away to Vilna (ph), to Vilna. Yes...which was then the capital of\nLithuania, and in Vilna I found out who...with whom could I make contact, also Zionist\nleaders, but they themselves were hiding, so we are hiding together in a park, ina ina\nlane, you know, uh somewhere out...in the outskirts of the city, and it was an absolutely\nimpossible situation.

Sometimes\nwe meet in the center of the village because...or or in the or in the cellar of the of the uh\npharmacy. Because for us was...we were cut off of the outer world. This was exactly the\nvery meaning of the Germans by setting up the ghettos. First of all to keep us behind\nbarbed wire. We cannot go out. We cannot have any contact. We didn't have\ntelephones, and later when we had telephones, it was also for the...only for the\ninner...1nner communication between the pol...Jewish police and the and the and the\nGerman commando of the ghetto for even...for his convenience, not for the convenience\nof the Jews. Or there was a a telephone in the Jewish committee, in the labor department,\nand so on, for the convenience of the Germans, not for us. But we knew to exploit also\nthese. For instance, the telephone...there was at the gate, there was a service police\nstation at the at the ghetto gate, Jewish police station. For the other side, outer side, there\nwas a German's and the Lithuanian's police.

        "A: Oh, this is a good question. You are a very intelligent interviewer, I will tell you.

        "A: What?\ntheir...to their respective __ in Vilna and we and the same Silverman gave these ten\nletters. Of course, it's not easy to take out ten letters from the ghetto because if they\nwould find...if they would check him on the date when he goes out as head of the brigade\nand finds the letters, it was the end of him and of all the brigade, so you you you had to\nbe very, very careful.

        "A: Yes. So first of all, we are telling them in a in a in a very...1n our own language to make\nthem understand that we are trying with them...saying that we are organized, that we are\ntrying tokeep _ together, and from time to time we meet, and we are trying...we are\ntrying to keep the the mood of ____ and give them the feeling they are...they are not\nalone.

        "A: First of all, he tells me, for instance, this 1s what he said. First of all I am very pleased to\nhear that you survived, that you live, that you are among the living.

        "A: Of course. Of course. This was the first thing which we have done, and we wanted for\nthem to _. Then we wanted to know...certain family when they started to write, they\nwanted to know about their members...there were certain families that part of them were\nin the Vilna ghetto and part of them were in the Kovno ghetto. For instance, my wife, her\nbrother, two brothers were in Vilna, and this was the first time that she learned that that\nhe is alive while the other brother was killed, and this was the first time, and the very first\nuh communications. So when more more letters were sent and we had to distribute the\nletters to to the to the inmates of the ghetto, we used the...we had an office of statistics in\nthe ghetto, administration. We didn't speak about it but uh statistics. We...they wrote\nevery birth and every passing away from the ghetto, every marriage. We had marriage in\nthe ghetto. Life went on. Of course, a good...there was a bar mitzvah in the ghetto and\nuh and and I want to tell you...I must tell it. Once I was sitting in my office in the Jewish\ncommittee and all of a sudden I got a call from the workshop, big workshops in the\nghetto. We had big workshops that worked eighteen hundred, mostly women who could\nnot go out of work from outside the ghetto, and there were a carpentry and tailorship and\nand plumbers and uh and uh and uh washing, cleaning...all for the German army, but\nwe...and so so uh the German supervisor of the ghetto used to come to the Jewish\ncommittee or he used to come straight to the workshop.

Miller was the deputy commissar who were at the supervision of\nthe ghetto and when Miller says I should come immediately, I have to come immediately.\nSo on my way from the Jewish Committee to the ghetto workshops, I passed by a small\nlane, a street... it's not a street...1t 1s a a...",

He directs me in inside in a and the and\nthe...so I told him, ...he was . He was a Haisidic (ph). In Lithuania, we are\nnot Hasidic. In Lithuania, mostly...ninety-nine percent were not Haisidic...opposing, but\nthis were several Haisidic.

Where where have you been? I said Miller, I just fell because on the\nway I run and while running I fell and I got hurt in my in my leg, so I had...I had to to to\nto...that's why I was late. You see, I find something out but you see, in the most hard\ntimes of the ghetto, the spirit, the devotion, the heritage, it is today and you have\nto the say the blessing sso you can say that you fulfilled the mitzvah (ph) of sitting in\na ____ and make the blessing, and this...my son is bar mitzvah, so I have to drink...it\nwas...most certainly it was not vodka, but it was something of...there was...I certainly\ndidn't care very much but I was overwhelmed of the spirit. This is, my friend, part of the\nresistance. It's nothing but revolt against the German order, strict order to press us, to\ndehumanize us. We shouldn't think of bar mitzvah and we shouldn't think of holy days,\nand we should think only only slavery, work, on the very hard work that we should think\nonly how to get another piece of bread and not think of \u2014 and not think of holy days\nand not think of bar mitzvah and so forth and so on. This is the day in, day out resistance\nof the common man, the inmates inside the ghetto, and this is what kept them alive,\nbecause _\u2014s isa great meaning. \u2014___1s when the...the Jews were in the desert and\nthey had no place to live and they built tents and they were lived forty years but they live\nin tents where they lived.

And uh it it keeps...1t moves me so\ninnerly to the bottom of my heart when I think of it.",
        "A: But of course we had much more serious things to do. We...the four of us or more\nprecisely the five of us, the leaders of the underground, before they found us,\nleadership, we made a final decision...after the 28th of October, no\nmore respond to orders of concentrating on one place of all the...of the all the ghetto or\nnot even part of it. No more. And to resist, to oppose and really it happened so that I\nthink a month or six weeks afterwards, there was the order to report on the very same\nsquare. They need five hundred workers to be sent to Riga (ph), from the Kovno ghetto\nto the Riga ghetto. We believed no more what they say because they said the five\nhundred, they were to to the archive and they were killed. They said they need to to to\nmake order to divide between those who get more bread and those who get less bread,\nand they killed ten thousand so this __ that we had no confidence whatsoever and we\nmade up our minds no more response to...and then they tried...they started to grab people\nfrom the street, and they could grab three hundred because most of the people from the\nghetto were at work outside the ghetto and when they didn't succeed in getting the\npeople, so they took these three hundred and brought them to the place, to the democratic\nsquare. I went there and saw the sight. At that time there was __ and the supervisor\nof the ghettoin =~. He was a mass murderer, and he...all of a sudden I hear that he\nsays maybe those will want to volunteer to walk to walk to Riga should make five steps\nahead, and I was sure nobody will will go, but there were five who stepped ahead, and\nfinally I disclosed that these five were insane or very...not insane but crazy people. For\ninstance, I...one of them was a former high officer of the Lithuanian army and I thought\nwhat what... was his name...soI said \u2014\u2014_\u2014s, why did you volunteer? Do you\nknow...are you sure that you want to to work in Riga? Don't you know what happened\nwith the five hundred. He says he's _. Kovno alone must know that I am a crazy\nman. _.. LetalsoRigaknowthatI am __and this only showed you who you are\ntalking with, and also this type of people were in the ghetto. Now this was one thing.\nFir...second, for...when Elkes was going in town to meet the chief of the Gestapo, I\nalways tried to escort him...from a distance, of course, Just in case something happens.\nNow we...we...our clandestine uh uh ___ that lasted for five months and then they were\ncaught andthe man, _\u2014\u2014_\u2014S was put in the Gestapo. He was always almost killed. They\narrested the the the main clerks in the Jewish Committee...first of all the secretary of the\nJewish Committee, Berenstein (ph). He had not the slightest idea because I have done\nnothing. They arrested the chief of the statistic bureau although he had no idea but his\nassistant deputy. They arrested the main uh the mainuh clerk __ of the of the office\nof the altestenrat. They had not the slightest idea but Elkes turned heaven to earth and\nearth to heaven until he got them free. You see, and this was...but he was not allowed to\nbe any more the secretary of the of the Jewish committee and so I became the secretary in\nMay '42. Then when we had in course of our correspondence we were told that they have\npartisan groups in the forests around Vilna and this was far behind...from Kovno more\nthan a hundred kilometers, and that they will be ready to assist if we send a group to\nthose forests so they should come to Vilna and from Vilna they...so we had a contact and\nthen we started very seriously in training our movement, our Zionist underground\nmovement, in in uh weapons and we had among our ___ two officers who were\nofficers in the Lithuanian army and were very well-trained in in in ammunition, and they\nwere the instructors that instructed these small groups, of course, in two, in three...not in\nalways in the same place. Always in some other place. You understand? And they...I\nthink I told you yesterday that the first gun that we bought was in 1941 in the beginning\nwhen whenthe __, the teacher...master of the Hebrew schooland _, a lawyer\nfrom Charlotte (ph), that I knew them very well before...they came to me and said\nwe'll...we have a possibility to buy a gun. Could you provide the money for it? And I\nwent to Garfunkle, the Deputy and he said what are you talking about. It will be a\nterrible risk for all the ghetto. So I didn't give in. I went to Dr. Elkes. Dr. Elkes didn't\nsay another word. He says go...go to the treasurer and tell him that I ordered to give the\nmoney uhtototo \u2014\u2014\u2014sryes,and_ ~\u2014_ and this was the first gun we had in the ghetto,\nbut this really was the first but not the last one. And then, little by little, we used to try\nand how can we bring in weapons to the ghetto. So first of all, == worked in many\nplaces, workshops where they had...especially those who...to repair German weapons in\nthe in German units, to repair weapons, so he is planning to steal and and how did they\nsteal? For instance, they were about thirty or forty people working in that place where\nthey...you know, where the ammunition stores and the Germans, for them it was a uh a\njust a lost uh let the Jews try to repair it, so each one of them used to take a part of a gun\nin the pocket, and when they used to come to the ghetto, they...",
        "A: But to pass with a part of it is also...it was not so...believe me, it was not so easy.\nUnfortunately, one of our best men was caught with a weapon. He...he dared to take a\nweapon himself home, and they thrash (ph) him and they killed him on the spot. So we\npaid very high price, very, very high price, but uh when the...yes...and now I want...when\nthe first group of the Zionist underground was ready to go to the woods, and we knew\nthat there will be the...yes...and we knew that there wasa____ from the Soviet Union in\nthe woods, a top uh officer of the Red Army who trained them and who supervised them,\nso we knew that they are going in a place where there will be a communist surrounding\nand there will be also many non-Jews. It was very important for me that they in their\nleisure time could have talks about Zionism, about __ Israel, about the events in\nJewish history, sing Palestine songs, so I came to some let's say understanding...we didn't\nsign any contract... with the the communist leader in the ghetto who later as I said they\nhad also their own underground. I said look Heim (ph)...he was a very...he he was an\nidealist. He was a communist, but he was also one of the circle, of the cultural circle that\nwe met once in two weeks, you see. He was also a writer, so I tell him, Heim, I am\nsending...we are sending the Zionists, first Zionist group to the partisan woods. I want\nyou to to see to it that in their leisure time they could sit together and hold conversations.\nWhen there is a real Jewish holiday, they could just mark it. They would sing Hebrew\nsongs and they could tell each another, so he says Avraham, of course, of course. We are\nwant to convert them to communism. This is what he said. He was a very honest man\nand I believed every word that he told me because he was a very, very honest man. But\nfortunately they came to the to the Vilna ghetto. From there they brought them to the\nforest, but then a month later I got word that they...not they were to mention Hebrew and\nnotasongof _ Israel, andnot mention __Israel, leave alone prayers and so on.\nYou understand? And I was very much uh disappointed. Yes. We...when the...when in\n1943 when the the communists raised also and and organized their their resistance in the\nghetto, aided by Heim \u2014\u2014_\u2014_\u2014=s+O_ so we made an agreement among us to join forces. For the\nGermans a Jew is a Jew, whether he is a communist or whether it is religious or whether\nit is combat or whether...whatever it is, so uh we had a uh joint command. Two from the\nZionist underground and two from the communist underground. I together with three\n______ represented the Zionist underground in the joint command, but after this incident,\nI said I'm...I know it's not you but we'll... know you cannot do anything about it but I\njoined a communist...a command joint with communists. II I resign. I cannot...it's\nagainst my my concept of life. Iam a Zionist from early years, and then came in...instead\nofmecamein __ from the the pharmacist. See. There were problems. There were\nproblems. They _ their own problems. There were the problem of __ to to... when\nthey when they went a group of thirty, forty, yet to a woods, they had to have clothes.\nThey had to have overcoats. They had to have everything. And how did we do it? We\nhad the Jewish workshops in the ghetto, the big workshops in the ghetto, so we used to\nsend them to work there. Those who were the first to go to the woods, they should go\nand work in the place where they repair the German uniforms, see, and then they used to\nadjust to . Also, we needed German uniforms just to...you know, as a mask so there\nthey used to take, to measure (laughter) and not plainly fabricated but to measure.\nEveryone was equipped with everything. We just stole from the German stores and from\nthe German repair and it worked very good. The...unfortunately, the the main man who\nled the groups from the Kovno ghetto to the Vilna ghetto to the forest was the leader of\nthe communist and uh he used to to dress himself as a as a Wermacht officer,\nyou see, with the all equipment and he came to take a group out of the ghetto, all the\npartisans, and we hired...was a truck and the and the driver was also dressed in German\nuniform, so that they came into the ghetto. There was at the ghetto gate there was",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Oh, for money you get everything. You see? So we we had the money. I want to tell\nyou...in the ghetto I perhaps the only Jewish committee that worked together with\nthe underground. They helped them. They didn't work together but they helped them.\nAnd they...for reasons once so he he was...I want to finish with him. So he used to take\nthe lead and bring them to the forest and come back. It took him, of course, a week, two\nweeks, so he used to were a German officer. The driver is a German and here were the\nJews, workers, so they take...went through clearly through the gate, mounted the uh the\ntruck and went to to the for...to the woods. Some...one day in a such movements, I was\ngoing to the city with a permit because as the secretary of the Jewish committee, but\nHeim ___, the head of the all the communists, he used to go in clandestine. He had\nwith him a gun always in in the pocket and one day he was caught by the Germans, and\nhe run away from them. Inone \u2014\u2014_\u2014_\u2014sziAhe yump _ from one place to the other one and\nfinally they caught him and they brought him to the to the Gestapo. He did not disclose\nhis identity. He never said that he was from the ghetto even. You understand? Caught.\nAnd nothing came out of all =. He was killed and this is...he he died as a hero,\nfighting with his gun against the Germans, in town. So this is...gives you...I can...I can\nspeak about the underground as much as you want but one...one thing I want to say about\nthe part of the Jewish committee in the underground. One...we didn't have the money to\nto to rent a truck. We didn't find the...the guy...so we came to the _ to send a group to\nthe woods, so I came to to the...Dr. Elkes and I told him, look we need to send out a\ngroup of twenty-five and would you permit us to use the wagons...there were wagons in\nthe ghetto...to bring firewood, to bring uh all kinds of supplies from outside to the ghetto.\nThey will go in the morning and they'll come in the evening, the wagons, so we took five\nwagons...three wagons...excuse me. Three wa...five...five, of course, and they went out\nand they didn't come back in the evening and they didn't come back the next morning and\nthey didn't come the next evening. It was a terrible...because where are the wagons?\nWhy don't they fulfill...why don't they come to to town to take the bread, the flour, the\nfirewood. It was a mess, so Elkes said that they uh the something happened after\napparently the the wagons after the horses are not well, all kinds of ___, and then only at\nthe...well, well, look...1f 1t would be disclosed they all, the altestenrat would be killed but\nnow no excuse whatsoever, no pardon and we didn't sleep the nights. _\u2014\u2014_\u2014s from the\n_____, from the leadership of the partisans and myself especially because we were in close\ncontact with the with the Jewish committee and because of the relationship between me\nand Dr. Elkes and he agreed to do it, so I had sleepless nights. Don't...don't envy me. In\nwhat a position I was these three days. Terrible. And we were on the outlook...they were\non the outlook and far away we sent outside the ghetto at the bridge that\ncontact...connects with the Kovno and the and the Slobodka uh and the Slobodka suburb\njust to see may...if they they are there or something happened to them. We didn't know\nwhat happened. Maybe they were caught. And only after we felt...they...after midnight\nthey came back worn out, torn out terribly because they...1t was not a journey to go...you\nhave to...you have to stop certain places when you see a German uh...let's say on the road\na German squad is going or a Lithuanian partisan or whatever, so that's why it took them\nvery much...because they were succeeded in hiding on on crucial moments on the on the\nroad, and that's why it took three days that took us out the the all all inside...what went\ninside went outside and you know, there were two rabbis in the in the...1 mentioned Rabbi\nSchumuckler and Rabbi _\u2014_\u2014__... They really went and prayed in the synagogue\nespecially for . You see? So this was avery...nothing _atall. Not...\nAnd I I must in two words also to mention, we had the confiscation of books which was a\nterrible...it was aktion not of men but of books, but books. We arethe _..",
        "A: It happened in February 1942. There came a special envoy from Rosenberg .\nRosenberg was the minister for the occupied territories and he was the man that ordered\nthat all books, all printed material that are in the ghetto should be confiscated and taken\nout and sent to Germany, so uh when they came uh to from the Rosenberg __,, Dr.\nBehnker (ph)...it was in '42. I remember it until today. I'll remember it to the rest of my\nlife. This Dr. Behnker who came to the ghetto and he came to the Jewish committee and\nsaid all books should be...and we should write announcement all over the ghetto that they\nshould bring in certain places, concentrate...concentration places to bring the books to be\ndelivered to the to the Germans, and all the wagons of the ghetto were mobilized to bring\nthe books from the various parts of the ghetto to the to be handed over to the Germans, so\ninthe underground, \u2014_, we decided the very...most valuable books we want to to to\nrescue, so we mobilized the teachers which will accompany the wagons and take out\nfrom the wagons valuable books that they consider of historic value _\u2014\u2014_\u2014s and putitina\nseparate wagon which was accompanied and they would...little children...the..you know,\nthe _, the messengers, so they were not...and you see, and they...and this the wagon\nwhere they stood, took these wagons and they used to send it to...bring it to some hiding\nplace for us. I knew that the the yeshiva __\u2014_\u2014sihad a verry big library and needless to\nsay for hundreds of years, so I went to the to the to the head of the yeshiva, Rabbi\nand I told him, Rabbi __, you know that there is an order for the Germans to deliver\nall the books and uh we are trying to rescue the most important books so may I ask you\nplease, pick up to take out from your library...there were about thirty thousand\nvolumes...thirty thousand volumes of the Yeshiva library for ages...take out the books,\nvaluable books...\nEND OF TAPE 5",
        "A: ...SO he says brother, what are you talking about? All the books of the yeshiva are very\nimportant, the most important. So I said, I was myself in the yeshiva in my young days\nand I know that even in the yeshiva there are books more valuable and less valuable. We\nhave to rescue what we can. We cannot ask the thirty thousand, but we can rescue\nperhaps five hundred or six hundred. . Sohe says...he says ss We will\nhide ourselves. We know how to hide. If you hide them, they will get our books. I\ndidn't succeed to persuade him...his stubbornness, you know, and the religious Jews, the\nmore they are religious, the more they are stubborn, and you cannot fight in the common\nlanguage. There is no sense. Common sense. Sol told him, Rabbi _, I am very sorry\nthat you don't take advantage of the opportunity of rescuing at least the most important\nbooks we have. Go home. Go home. Don't worry about our books. We will worry\nourselves. We will rescue all our books, not the part of it. The next day was the was the\nuh the books had to be delivered and from all parts of the ghetto the wagons took books\nand there is...one of the pictures of the children with the wagon they are go, you see, and\nwhile we are , I'm...I was... was the liaison officer between the Jewish Committee\nand Dr. Behnker from the Rosenberg and before, the day before, he wanted me\nto show him the the from the ghetto, the most important thing what is can be seen\nin the ghetto, the sights...(laughter). So in the ghetto there was a synagogue that one day\nthe Germans ordered...",
        "A: Good.",
        "A: Yes. So uh the Germans ordered that all...to bring all cats and hounds in from the ghetto\ninto one Jewish ancient synagogue, the most ancient synagogue in Slobodka, and bring\nall the cats so people brought every cat . What did the Germans do? When all the\ncats and and hounds were there in the synagogue, they killed them, but they didn't allow\nto take out the the corpses of the of the of the killed cats and hounds, just to make\nmiserable the holy place of Jews, the holy...holy sanctuary of the of the Jews. And one\nof...just to to to cause terrible pain, because for us a synagogue is a holy place and to\nbring in in itself cats and...1s already a a crime but to kill the cats, the cats and hounds and\nleave them around them stinking for months and months...this was a thing that we\ncouldn't...for for miles you hear the stink so he...when he told me that he wants me to\nbring him, to show him the most valuable and sighting of the ghetto, I took him to the\nsynagogue and I and when I came to the entrance of the synagogue, he orders me that I\nshould go in front. So I said no, uh Mr...Dr. Behnker. I cannot go in. The entrance is\nfree. You can go and see what for yourself, and I didn't go in and regardless of his\ncommand and you know, this is...1t's a mess. He he could kill me on the spot but I said\nno, here I stay. The doors are open. Everything is open and you can see for yourself and\nwhen we...when he went out, and this is a man of culture...this is a man of of of German\nculture from Berlin which is...it's the capital of world culture, so he understood. He says\nyeah. \u2014\u2014\u2014._- Yes, I understand you. I am...he understands me. He told...Dr. Behnker\ntold...said to me when he went out from the synagogue, he says he understands me why I\ndidn't...why I couldn't go in. So then the next day we...I was sitting with Dr. Elkes in the\nJewish Committee. Only Dr. Elkes was...it was in the morning. It was ten o'clock, and\nwe sat both on the sofa. He didn't sit at his desk. Only the two of us. I didn't want to\nshow up because I had to stay and get reports...only the books had been rescued and...you\nsee and give orders from there go in. I even ordered that we should go and try to talk to\n______. Maybe in the last minute...no. But while we are sitting in the room with Dr.\nElkes, all of a sudden the door cranks out with the boots...with the boots and the body of\nof...and comes inaa high fat German, redasaasa__\u2014\u2014,abeer__\u2014_\u2014_.~ Those who drink\nmuch beer...this is how red their faces, and not saying anything jumps in...\nwe were seeing him for the first time and the second one was was Dr. Behnker whom I\nknew and announce him and he says, ., yourheadisin.__.. It\nmeans that you take off my head, and in this moment comes into the room ;\nescorted by the commander of the ghetto, the German commander of the ghetto, not not a\nplain sentry. was pale like you know, and then I immediately understood what\nhappened. WhenI saw __ escorted by the commander, disclosed\ntheir...the the library of the yeshiva. What did they do? They hid hidded the the...all\nthirty thousand books in their horse stable. They thought the Germans are so, you know,\nclean they will not go to the stable, just ===. -~ They looked...the underground has also\nto have brains. You have to plan. You have to think and to understand the the Nazis who\nhad time enough to learn their mentality, so they disclosed the whole thirty thousand\nbooks of the library of the...of the ancient library of of the ghetto and they take, of course,\nimmediately Rabbi __\u2014_\u2014_\u2014___ so Dr. Elkes stood up and he said, excuse me, gentlemen. I\nam here the the the chairman of the Jewish Committee. I am the overjuden in their\nlanguage. I am responsible. I personally am responsible for all what's going on in the\nghetto, so if there is something, talk to me. You see? So he says you don't know me.\nYou will know me. He was.... am the new Deputy of the =~ who came instead of\nJordan (ph), the former Jordan was the supervisor of the ghetto. _ | Weidman (ph) his\nname, and you will learn to know me, you dirty Jews, uh crooks, thieves. What _,\nand you...points out at my finger, and this your heads shaking. It means that they want to\nkill us, so what happened if I would be a religious Jew, I would say it was something\nincredible. Dr. Elkes is a doctor. In first place he's a physician and he's a first-class\nphysician, and as soon as Dr. Elkes saw that Dr. Behnker 1s getting so excited,\nand escorted I am responsible for this for this for the\nlibrary of the of the... . You are responsible for this for this hiding the books. I'm\nresponsible for hiding the books, but this was no joke. It was no joke. So uh and when\nhe got so hot and crying, crying, crying so Dr. Elkes sees in his eyes, in the eyes of Dr.\nBehnker that there is something symptoms of a of before an attack...attack of epilepsy,\nepilepsy. He looked at him and he says...so he gets up and says, _\u2014s\u2014_\u2014_\u2014sy I... am... am\nthe head of the comm...of the Jewish community but I am also a doctor and it is my duty\nas a doctor to tell you, please calm down, sit down on the sofa, take off your belt. I\ncan...I can see symptoms in your eyes, some symptoms, warning symptoms. He says,\nwhat warning symptoms? What they talking about...? You know. He said, I am a doctor\nand what I can see is in your eyes are signals of a immediate attack of epilepsy, so please\nlet's...first of all. He says what they talking about...epilepsy. I have nothing to with\nepilepsy but I have a friend of mine who was a...suffering of this illness, so tell me, tell\nme, tell what you have to do. So Dr. says before I tell you, order that and Rabbi\n____ be out of the room. I cannot talk to you in their presence. You see? So he says,\nout you go. (Laughter) He goes out of the room and Rabbi _\u2014_\u2014__ and the commandant\nof the ghetto didn't go out with us. He he he remained here because he's ordered that you\nshould stay here. Behnker ordered. So first of all, Dr. Elkes \u2014\u2014_\u2014souta little bit aside\nof the danger, you see, and he says to him, and I can hear every word when Dr. Elkes\nspeaks to him. He says, a doctor...take off your belt. Free your your your collar. Take\noff your your boots. Lay down. I'll open the window, so you have more fresh air. And\nthen he starts and he tells him, he said and then in minutes...he ordered the commandant\nof the ghetto...that's why he didn't let him go out with us____ and then ordered\nimmediately from the from the headquarters of the Gestapo brought a car, an ambulance.\nThe ambulance pulled inside the ghetto and they took away Behnker and and _\u2014__ and\nthe commander and all went away. Therestof _\u2014__..._ I'm telling you...so Dr. Elkes\ngoes out and he tells me, ==\u2014\u2014_\u2014.:~YBehnker has now...his own worry is to worry about his\nhealth, not about you and will not think about you and he was taken straight to Berlin.\nHe wasn't left here. And then because it's true I I...a...a...and so we got this uh Rabbi\n. He couldn't meet me at my eyes. To tell you the truth, I couldn't look at his\neyes too but at that time it was not to look in his eyes or not to look in his eyes. We were\nsaved all alive, just simple. And __ stood aside and he said the prayers before\nyou see, that one was recused of this so he says the prayer, . And\nand he prayed all the time. You couldn't stop him. Prayed all the time\nthat __ saved us from the ends of the...1t was the really a miracle and this is what I said\nallthe time, _\u2014_\u2014did...was a miracle. And for him it was clear, and you know, this\nended the story of the...this I the story of the books and now will you want me\nto talk about...",
        "A: So...the 9th Fort was built two hundred years by the czars of Russia...",
        "A: Yes. So the 9th Fort in the time of the Germans used...was their...they they made\ncaves...digged out big big uh big uh...",
        "A: Big uh...",
        "A: Holes...uh pits for thousands, for three thousand and there they brought the Jews from the\nghetto, from each aktion they brought them straight to the 9th Fortress. They led them in\nbelow the surface and there they used to bring them in...hundreds...kill hundreds and then\nand another hundred above the the bodies of the...and it happened so that the upper part\nof the bodies were...people that didn't get killed but they did...others the bullet didn't\nreach, so they they had terrible pain until they and they and they passed away and there\nwas one...one boy of twelve that his mother kept him around her arms and she kept so\nthat he should...can breath, so the mother was dead. The child, the twelve years old child,\nremained alive and it it's again an unbelievable story. It it...when when the when the\naktion was over, you see, he just squeezed out from the from the up...he was in the upper\npart of the...went out in the field and went and escaped from the Fortress through the\nfields far away...the highway, but they're far away. They didn't go...and and they didn't\nexpect him, a child, a boy...and he came into the ghetto. He was the first one to tell about\nthe killings in the 9th Fortress, but we didn't believe him. First of all, it's a twelve child.\nHow couldn it happen? The fort is all around...the all four parts is with high towers of\nguards with all the time swinging around lights and they are armed in each and every in\nevery inevery towerupupa___, there is a guard and a machine gun. Not only with\nguns.

Later on, there was a...all the\ntime groups were being killed or were not killed in the...but sometimes they used to be in\nthe Gestapo and only then brought to the 9th Fortress and then killed.",
        "A: From the ghetto? Yes. There were also people...uh Jews were caught in black marketing.\nThey used to take then not even back to the ghetto. They used to take them to the 9th\nFortress and kill them. So uh so uh but after the 20...the 28th of October, this was the\nbiggest and we were told by the...the pits were were digged by Soviet prisoners of war,\n____ and uh and one of these prisoners of war was Captain whose name was\nthe czar and he was a prisoner of warin__ and two years they didn't\ndisclose until one day they took him to bath and then they discovered that he is a Jew.\nAll the time they said he is akozak (ph) _ and they brought him straight from the\nprisoners of war camp to the 9th Fortress, and then it was already 1940...1943 when the\nGermans were in retreat, so they wanted to...gave the order to dig out from the pits the\ncorpses _ burned them, put them on fire, so that there remained no...no sign of the\ncruelty and and the murder, so there were I think sixty-four uh Jewish...sixty-three Jews\nand one Polish woman...sixty-four, and they were in __ five, six in each A\n___ 1s acell, very strong, be...below, again below the surface and they used to...used to\ntake them out of the \u2014\u2014_s in the morning and they used to work while chained.

They put uh\ngasoline on the wood and fire, put on fire, and then again a a row of corpses and a row of\nwood. It was a terrible thing, but before putting them on the fire, they used to take out\nthe golden teeth. They would take out...you see. Some uh some uh they're buried with\ntheir clothes, so they used to find sometimes valuables and so on...two kilograms of gold\nthese sixty-four, brought to the ghetto after after...I'Il tell you they escaped which was aa\nlegendary escape,souh ___ said from this fort, none...no one of us will will be...can go\nout alive unless we try to escape. So he told them that from the fortress is a hundred and\nfifty years nobody escaped, but he was a specialist of fortifications and he just knew\nhow...to cut a long story short, very short...he blocked out a plan and he led all the sixty-\nfour, all the sixty-four on the night of Christmas, on the 25th of December, 1943. They\nbribed the...they they took...of course, they killed the the watchman and they killed other\nones. Since we are short in time they succeeded to take out all the sixty-four. They\nprepared ladders from from from from _\u2014\u2014_\u2014_\u2014__, you know, to...because the...there\nwas...the outer wall was six meters high, so they prepared the ladders from from and in\norder not to then they should not be recognized so they went in groups of five, six and\nkeeping aside a white linen so it was the snow and the white linen so they...they were\nnot...nobody could see them. You understand? And this is the way they reached the\nouter wall and they and they passed over and when they all were outside...outside which\nfor the first time in the history of the fortresses that they escaped. The group...the\nJews...the...those who were from the ghetto, they said we have to come to the ghetto and\nin the ghetto the underground will bring us to the Vilna forest.

        "A: Right before that...before I must tell you about the about the the Mack story. Mack was\none...a regular boy in the ghetto. He was a jeweler. When all people in the ghetto leave\nhim all their gold and silver and money and valuables, he digged a...below the earth and\nhe remained with two kilos of gold and coins and silver and whatever it is, and he tried to\nescape from the ghetto. He was in a contact with a Lithuanian group that promised him to\ntake him through the Baltic Sea to Sweden, and paid a lot of money, but they had to go\nthrough the ghetto, so he tried...he and another...another friend of him, to go through the\nbarbed wire.

        "A: Short-sided, yes. So he caught...cut the barbed wire and they went out. He just jumped\non the commander of the ghetto, Fleishman. And he...even that and this 1s not\nenough...he took out a gun from his...from his pocket and says, commandant, get away\nfrom here. Otherwise I will... will shoot. He didn't finish the word and the and the and\nthe commander had already his hand on his gun and everything and it was a mess in all\nthe ghetto. Immediately all the ghetto was surrounded by machine, you know, from the\nGestapo and military and police and whatever you say. The Germans brought him to the\nto the commander of the ghetto and they wanted him to disclose...the other one who was\nwith him, he retreated inside the ghetto, disappeared. And they wanted from Mack...the\nname of the man was Mack...and they wanted from Mack that he should disclose who\nwas the second man that uh that retreated, that disappeared. They beat him up. It was\njust terrible. When when we came...so what did they do? They didn't succeed in in in in\ngetting the name so they so they called the...as hostages took the the Jewish committee,\nthis Garfunkle and Goldberg and Dr. Elkes was sick in bed for...he had a very hard\nrheumatism, so so the secretary should come, so they took me, so the three of us came,\nwere brought and came here, were brought to the to the to the uh commander of the\nghetto and the first thing that they wanted us that we should influence, impose upon\nMack that he should disclose who the second was. We had an iron rule in the ghetto...not\none Jew be handed over to the Germans by us. So we keep quiet. When I saw Mack in\nthe...in the commander's... commandant's office, you couldn't recognize a person because\nall his head was a piece of of flesh. You hardly could see his eyes, so was he beaten, and\nmind you, Mack was not a member of the underground, not of the Zionist and not of the\nCommunists. He was just a plain man, but he did not disclose...more they beaten and\nbeaten and beaten and he didn't open his mouth, so then they said...",
        "A: We have to pick up?\nEND OF TAPE 6\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: That's right. Well, I'm talking...we are talking about the escape from the ghetto and not\nfrom Kovno. It is two different things. Well, as I already mentioned before, I was one of\nthe four founders of the Zionist underground movement which was a resistance, and we\nwe...there prepared in the very end when the when the ghetto is...before liquidating the\nghetto, the leaders will escape to the woods, to the partisan groups, and this was the\nplanning. It was a matter of timing when should we escape from the ghetto and this was\na very important question...which one of the four leaders of the Zionist uh resistance\nmovement were all the positions in the ghetto life, so it wasn't just a matter of once a\ndecision. It had to be a decision with the consent of the chairman of the Jewish\ncommittee and so on. But it happened so as I also told you that I was very much engaged\nin this looking and finding a place of hiding for _____ which was then seven years. When\nI found such a place and the legendary escape of ______ from the ghetto, she fell very ill\nand when she came into the farm of hiding, it was absolutely necessary that Pnina should\ngo there at least for a week because we couldn't bring a doctor.",

We had excellent doctors in\nthe ghetto and she took along and the priest was very opposing it because it was the\ndanger. Anyhow, I said it would have meant nothing if she would die, _, from from\nillness. It's the same we didn't do nothing, so she was there but instead of being there a\nweek, Pnina stayed there four montheses. And she worked there in the farm in all works\nas was she was considered as a as a relative, far relative from town that she run away\nfrom Kovno from bombardments and from the war, but she was for all things and\npurposes worked with the with the family and she got very well acquainted with them\nand uh it was a woman, a widow whose husband, the boss of the farm, fell from a from a\nthunder...from a thunderstorm and he was buried in in in this farm, and the widow was a\nvery good-hearted, that was very religious, and that's why the priest could talk her in that\nshe should take the child for hiding and uh and uh then she was really happy that Pnina\ncame because she didn't know what to... \u2014\u2014\u2014_s was crying all the time... Momma,\nMomma...and uh I...as I said she lived there instead of a week, she stood there for about\nfour, five months and then she was acquainted there...one...one...the the woman, the\nwidow had three daughters and one son. The son was about eighteen years, but because\nhis father was dead so he was the head of the family and around the farm and he couldn't\nattend school. He was illiterate and he very much wanted to learn to write and to ready,\nso Pnina told him, look... == was hisname... =, [have aman. He is a lawyer and\nhe is a educated man and he will edu...educate you in writing Lithuanian and uh...",
        "A: And then he was the one who who agreed that to to...that I should be brought and he\nhimself prepared a special hiding place for me inside the the farm, faraway from\neveryone, and so I came to the farm. So one day I was surprised by from the priest for\nme that a wagon will be waiting for for me on the 23rd of February, 1944, for the farm. I\nwas, as I said, prepared to go for the woods but not for the farm, but since I got such a a\nword from Pnina so it was nothing doing, so I had to escape from the ghetto. The night\nbefore...so I told...of course, I told Dr. Elkes about my plans, that I have to escape from\nthe ghetto, and the the last night I spent in the house, in the tiny dwelling of Dr. Elkes, the\nhead of the community, and his deputy Garfunkle and Mrs. Elkes which was a lady in the\nvery full sense of the word. Just a lady, and the two people, I disclosed to them and I told\nthem that my...the hiding place of the five crates of my diary and collection and they\nshould know where it is but Garfunkle, the deputy, said \u2014_\u2014\u00ab, youcannot do it. It is\nalready no ghetto. It's already a concentration camp. And you are going to commit\nsuicide. Who can escape now from the ghetto? And how will you make the fifty-four\nkilometers? I beg of you, don't do it. It is terrible. It's dangerous. Don't you know the\ncase of Mack. Mack was the one who was caught...they caught at the at the... when he\ntried to to escape through the barbed wire. He was hanged publicly. Don't you know it?\nYou were there at night, the whole night in the Gestapo together with him in the cell. But\nDr. Elkes said go. If you would be my son, I would tell you go because you are the only\none who know best what expired in the ghetto. You kept a diary and you have a\ncollection and documentation and it 1s...you have a mission to go and bring the\nknowledge to the world, to the outer world that it shall remain to the future\ngenerations...the Germans digged out the corpses of the sixty thousand that were killed in\nthe 9th Fortress, so that there remain no sign of it. That's why...that's why I think...I'm\nsure you have courage. You have knowledge. You have the persistence and you will\nsucceed I'm sure about it, so uh in order to encourage me more, he took out from his\ndrawer his last will. His two children...a son, Prof...now Professor Elkes, and a daughter\nSarah, were studying in London and he says here is my last will. Give it to my children.\nI rely upon you. You...your...your wisdom and your courage and I...what you have done\nin the ghetto for the three years, you have shown that you have enough power will and\nyou'll...you'll make it, and this is what gave me the courage really to escape and it was\nvery, very exciting for us and we embraced and we kissed each other and then I left his\nhome, two...after midnight, two-thirty after midnight. Two hours later I was already at\nthe main ghetto gate and there were my two friends, the...one of the most activists of the\nunderground, Zionist resistance movement. was an officer in the Lithuanian\narmy. He trained in in in the underground and he and the second one was\n. He's now in New York. He...we called him the savior at the gate. He knew\nhow to bribe the sentries at the gate and when one gate...one sentry will be and what\nsentry is good, so he fixed it all. At five o'clock in the morning when only one sentry is\nat the gate...they start only at six o'clock they start move from the ghetto, so you come at\nfive o'clock in the morning and he bribed the the the sentry. He...he sd they were on\nthe on the...we had...at the ghetto gate there was a station of the ghetto Jewish police and\nof the legal department, so they were officially the ghetto, so they let me through the the\ngate and and then and this way I escaped from the from the from the ghetto with the\nwagon of another four people, allegedly to bring from the wagon uh bread for the ghetto.\nThey returned, of course, without me, but this is how I succeeded...succeeded to pass\nthrough the gate and then the very dangerous time when Geck was the liquidator of the\nghetto, he would not spare a minute just to put a bullet himself in the , but when\nI escaped, I got known later that the Gestapo and the ghetto commander uh announced\nthat they'll...five thousand marks they give the one who disclose where...the whereabouts\nAvraham ___ or his dead body. Dead or alive we need him. You see? And this will\nshow you how important it was, the great help of my very close friend. _, the\npoliceman was was questioned at the 9th Fortress. He was the one who knew, who saw\nme last. Where did I go and how did I go? And they beat him to death, but he didn't say\na word. Even they took one of his eyes out and then they killed him, but he didn't\ndisclose a word. I want to tell you and when I came...when I escaped from the ghetto, I\ncame to the priest and the priest told me the the the widow, the the the...from the farm,\nshe is here with a wagon and two horses and I should take the wagon and the horses and I\nshould cross the bridge that between Kovno and the and the other and the other suburb,\n, which leads to the farm where the where the...they had the farm with the\nwidow, but the the the priest said he wouldn't want to rescue the life of the of the widow,\nthe very good Christian woman in case they are be caught at the at the at the bridge,\nbecause on both sides of the bridge were stationed military gendarmes, and they checked\neach and every one, the documents and everything, so it was not very easy. I had no\nother choice, so and he said that we will meet two miles after the bridge, after the second\npart of the bridge, and when we...I came to the horses you know, and they had a very big\ncoatasaa__ and they came to the bridge. There wasaJewof _\u2014_\u2014s and because\nthey checked and double-checked, each one will take..so I had false documents as a as a\n,_, you see. Anyhow, so all of asuddenI see thatone \u2014\u2014s Jew with his\nwagon and he passes by the the the sentry, the gendarme and he says heil Hitler, and he\npasses by and they let him go. So I say, well, wait a minute. I can also say heil Hitler.\nYou see? So...but it was a a...to to decide in a second...this is your life or you live or you\npossibly don't, but I had nothing to to loose, only to win, so I take out my horse...with the\nhorse my wagon aside and I pass by and I say heil Hitler and with the with the...what\nweapon I had in my sack then, I showed them below that the wagon is entirely empty.\nThere is nothing, only straw, you see,so _\u2014_\u2014, and I said heil Hitler, and without _, I\nshowed them there is an empty wagon. The wagonis ___, in German, and I passed\nby (laughter) with the greatest of my surprise, you see, and then on the...it's a long bridge\nand when you come to the second part of the bridge, again the same...the same story.\nAnother sentry and he 1s checking again, you know, checking again and again I say heil\nHitler. The wagonis _\u2014\u00ab, the wagonis___, and they let me go, and this way I\ncouldn't believe what had happened. If one would be a religious man, he would say it is\nheaven. It is...1t is a miracle, but I don't believe in miracles. I believe in persistence, in\nhard work, in making up your mind and know what you do and know where you go, and\ndon't give in and don't take no as an answer. And they...nothing like that not permitted.\nWhat was permitted for us? The German was really...in the ghetto he came in and they\nsaw in in in a dwelling and they saw a woman lying in her bed, so he said why don't you\nwork. What are you so lazy in the bed, so she said, , I'mill. I have thirty-nine\ngrade of uh temperature. It was a very high temperature. I must stay in bed, so he tells\nher, I knew that . A Jew must die. All others he must not. All others he must\nnot. He must not lie in bed even if he is ill. So uh this is what I knew exactly and uh but\nI didn't want to die, so at three miles after the bridge it was...I was... I was beating\nthe horses and I was saying and when the woman stood there, she didn't believe\nher eyes. She was...",
        "A: The the widow...the peasant, the owner of the farm. She didn't...the priest didn't want that\nshe should risk her life passing by the control at the both sides of the bridge, so she went\nby foot and waited there until I come and then she...she mounted the wagon and she took\nover the horses and we ride. And and and what happened unfortunately happened\nunhappy... the...there were wonderful good woman, good hearted woman but she was a\ndrunk so she...at every...wherever it was only a a saloon, she stopped and went in and\ndrink and she drank not a regular vodka but homemade which 1s a terrible thing, so I told\nher ...her name was , Maria...Maria, I beg of you, I beg of you.\nI'm...every...every moment when you go in to a saloon they can...they can...they can\narrest us, both you and me.",
        "A: Stopped at the side of the...of the...of the road, went into a saloon and to drink, and I...and\nit was a matter that continues instead of going it should take us from the morning at mid-\nday until one or two o'clock we should be already at the farm, but see she stood in every\ncorner and in one place she found relatives, so she took me in into her house with the\nrela...to the relatives and she said who...please meet...it is a relative of the of the priest\nfrom Kovno, so I was a priest so they offered me eat and and and a whole meal, so I said\nwe are ina hurry. We cannot stay here. To cut a long story short, she was...in the end of\nthe day we came...it was night. It was evening. It it was night and she and she was\nentirely drunk and she went not the the wrong way and I had to go and to knock on the\ndoor of the peasants 1n order to find out which way we have to goto _\u2014__.._ This 1s the\nname of the farm, and and we came and when we came only at three after midnight, at\nthree after midnight, and when we came into the farm, Pnina was...she was sure that the\nGestapo took us and that's why we didn't come in time. Andit was sin such cases.\nWell, to tell you...my meeting with Pnina at three o'clock in the midnight...I\nwanted...from from afar there was some little light. You know, a candle was...and I trust\nto listen to her. I can see light there. Is this your farm? So she said oh yes, yes, yes, yes.\nYou see she was...but she was drunk and this how we met in the in the farm, of course.\nThe son, Joseph, eight years. He was prepared already for me a hiding in...not in the\nhouse where the farmers lived, but where where the storage for winter...for winter uh\n__,insummer forsummer _, the winter __ to summer, and | had to go in to\nsqueeze in, you know, like not...less than this space, you see, and I could not stay there\nin__ hiding. You had to either to seat or to lay down and uh they had in the farm a\nworker, a hired worker, and he was an anit-Semite terribly and all the time he questioned\n______ whether she's Jewess and when does she pray and when does she go to church and\nso on and so on, so he shouldn't...needn't have an idea that I'm hiding in the...",
        "A: Four consecutive monthses. Six days in the week I didn't go out from the hiding places.\nOnly on Sunday when the hiding...the the man...the the hired laborer went to church. On\nSundays I used to go out and breath the air, so when I breathed the fresh air, I was\nentirely, you know, my my head was...you know, from this...but this is how we were and\nthen one night the the Red Army came closer to the farm and uh all around was\nbombardments and fire so I couldn't stay in that place, in that hiding, because every\nmoment also this hiding should be...could be on fire, but they had a most strategic uh uh\ncanal in the in...around the whole farm. The farm was, let's say like this...uh longer and\nthen...and around this two rows of high woods, __ trees, and between the trees very\nclose was a canal, so I went out from this hiding place and I laid down in the canal at\nnight and I fell asleep. All of a sudden I feel that on my belly a boot presses me very\nhard, and a and a strong light flash on my eyes. I couldn't see what's in front of me, and I\ncould see only that a gun is before my nose and I could immediately... but I couldn't\nsee way infrontofmeor _I couldn't understand that this must be a Russian because\nwe knew that the Russians is coming, the Red Army, so I saw...told him, Russian, don't\nkill me. Iam aJew. Don't kill me. Iam a Jew. But they didn't move and the belly was\npressing, so I told him my wife and my child are also hiding. We...I escaped from\nKovno, from the Nazis and my wife and my child is also...don't kill me...also in the...they\nare in the in the house, in the front of the farm. Don't kill me. So then he took away the\ngun from my nose and he took off the the belly and told me stand up. And I stood up so\nthat...take off your clothes. Entirely naked I stood and then they could see that I am a\nJew and then he told me if you escaped from Kovno from the Nazis, what are you doing\nhere? We already liberated Kovno five days. So I said...I could see that they're very top\nup top officer of the army, but he looked to me like a Jew but he didn't disclose a word\nabout his Jewishness, so he said, why didn't you go back to Kovno. So I said, how would\nI know? I'm hiding here. So he said if you'll give me...1f you will be kind of enough to\ngive me the the name of the places where I can move because he said there are\nnineteen German tanks are trying to cross to to close the way for the Red Army and are\ngoing to break in, so he said come exact on the on the German tanks, and\ncould you give me...show the map, your maps, so I'll know which way to go. To my\ngreatest surprise the top...top officer did not have a map with him at all but he said to me\nyou know, you stay here. Don't go anywhere and tell your wife and your child that here\nwill be big fight. This will be the fire line because we are making here...this is a strategic\npoint and this farm exactly suits us to be...have the headquarters of the fire line, so run\naway as soon as possible but wait two hours. I'll come and then I'll tell you the names of\nthe villages or the farms where you can go on the way to Kovno, and I\nimmediately...when he went away I immediately went to the to the to to the farm, to\nMaria, and I told her, Maria, I just spoke with a Russian top officer and he said here there\nwill be big fightings and there will be the fire line. Come with us. Take your children.\nTake your...and and and uh we'll go. You will stay with us in Kovno until the until the\nthe the the battle is finished here.",
        "A: I | appreciate two minutes. You see...\nBREAK IN TAPE",
        "A: No. First of all, when we came to Kovno, I...we went..we went to the place and\nthen I went to the ghetto to see whether my diary is is there.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: When we went...the the peasant, the Maria rejected... they didn't want to leave the farm.\nSays this is my farm. In is my husband buried that I will not leave my farm, my my my\nhorses...so we we embraced and kissed and we we left the farm and the the officer...when\nthe officer came exact after two hours he came, and he told us five places where we can\ngo, five farms in order not to fall again into the hands of the Germans, and so we did. On\nthe...on the way, we found a truck, a military truck that turned back empty and we\nstopped him and he let us in and we stood on the on the in the on the back of the truck\nand we kept __ in the middle, Pnina on the on the side andI on the other side of\nand we kept so and we say, we are free. We are free. We breath free. We are free. We\ndidn't...we couldn't be more excited than we were that all of a sudden hiding and being\nafraid...this we will see...this will _...all of a sudden we go and we go to Kovno and\nthen we come to Kovno and the and the and the driver was so polite. He says where are\nyour home? I will bring you home? But neither Pnina nor I didn't want to come to our\nhomes. We felt like absolutely we left the homes and our families are not there. Her\nhusband is not there and my my my wife was also killed by the Nazis, so we couldn't\ncome to to our homes, so there was an empty house where the...where the survivors, they\nkept kept together in one house and they gave us a room in the house. We needed an\napartment. A room for us was a luxury instead of the hiding places and then the first\nthing we went to the priest and we embraced and Pnina kissed him and he kissed Pnina\nand we drank wine. We shouldn't drink wine that it was...and it was something that\nincredible and then I went immediately to the site of the ghetto to see what is about my\nhiding, my crates, five crates whether with my uh entries of the diary and the and the\ndocumentation and I found out that part of the big building, the block C, block C in in the\nroof of which...1n...not in the roof, in the cellar of which two meters below the below the\nsurface that it was entirely in ruins and you cannot get...there is no access, so I uh said I'll\ncome and take shovels and then...but when Icame home I was arrested by the \u2014__,\nthe the Soviet...the Soviet secret police and they took me in there and they asked that I\nshould give them the diary, so I said what are you talking about, a diary? You got in in\nthe in the room was one of the survivors of the ghetto Kovno. He was a communist and\nheard that this _ that had a diary. I want to tell you I was upset like that but don't\nloose nerves and when he says I should give there, what are you talking about? So the\nhouse is ruined, so no diary. There is...there is ruins and there's no access to it all, so they\nsaid listen, now you...we are giving you an order. You should not come close to the\nplace, one kilometer...1t means three-quarters of a mile, at the place of the block C\nwithout being accompanied...escorted by one of the secret police of ours. At the very\nsame day, I said to Pnina we are going that night, after midnight to to to dig out the diary\nand luckily survived also Goldschmidt who helped us in digging in the diary,\nyou see. It was just a happy occasion and all come the news that I am not supposed to to\nto... have to give them back the diary, so and I shouldn't go there, so asked\nme, Avraham, did you get the permission from the fromthe \u2014__.._ I says of course, of\ncourse I would...I would take it because I wanted that all the risk and all responsibility\nshould be mine in case we are being caught, you know, so he could say I told\nhim that I have aapermit fromthe \u2014_\u2014_.. And after midnight... Goldschmitd\nfrom one from one side came, from...Pnina from another direction and I from a third\ndirection, each one with a shovel behind the the the overcoat and with a a rugsack each\none, and we came and we only came to this...to the place, was after midnight at twelve-\nthirty... can remember... as 1f he would be eighteen years old in workshop.\n______ want start the digging. Here we have the the first crate. Open. Quick check, very\nrapidly. Quick. We put in a in a in a in a rugsack and then he goes to the second\nplace...in the...he hid the five crates, one, two, three, four, in four corners. In the middle\nthe fifth one, so we count out one, two, and the middle. The other two were on the other\nside below the \u2014\u2014 soimmediately the \u2014\u2014_ and in in ten, fifteen minutes we had all\nall the rugsacks full with with diaries. I cannot tell you how happy I was. I was the\nhappiest man in the world. Also Pnina, and then we apart go...each one went separately\nin his direction so that you should not...you see? And so I I...the work of my life, it is my\nlife work. I could...three crates alright and then the next morning I had to hide it because\nif the...they used to come back every day, the secret police, and they wanted this _\u2014, so\nPnina had a very good friend of her husband, the town engineer of Kovno, a Lithuanian\nwho were very nice fellow, so his wife was very good uh in best relations with Pnina, so\nshe...Pnina tells her excuse me, I have here Hebrew writings and the the...might be...the\nGermans might come __, so could you hide it for me for a few days, uh so she said\nno, no problem and she took it. She hide it in...also in the cellar and until we found aa\nbetter hiding in the cellar somewhere you see, and until we escaped we...I had to escape\nfrom Kovno because all the time they used to question me, where's the diary.
