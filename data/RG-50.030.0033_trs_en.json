        "Q: We are on camera. Would you tell me your full name please?",
        "A: My name is Avraham L...stands for Late Bomba.",
        "Q: Where were you born and when?",
        "A: I was born in a little place. It was Germany at that time. Boyden-Oberslazen, but when I was\na little kid...I don't even remember anything. My father he comes from a...a city by the name\nof Czestochowa. And they moved to Czestochowa. I was brought up over there. I was raised\nover there, went to school, and I lived over there until the last days of the liquidation of the\nJewish population in Czestochowa.",
        "Q: Tell me about your childhood in Czestochowa. What was it like living there.",
        "A: My childhood was not a rosy one. I come from poor parents. What do you mean, poor\nparents? In..in Poland, I would say about 70 percent, maybe more than 70 percent of the\npopulation were poor. Poor, I mean poor. Actually, they had no food on the table. And to get\na job was very, very hard, especially for the Jewish people. Jewish people were not\nemployed by the government, not by the legislature. Their trade was tailor, shoemaker, some\nof them a barber, hatmaker. Even in factory, in Jewish factory where the people they owned\nthe factory, also Jews, they didn't want to employ Jewish people. Maybe there's some reason,\nmaybe not. Some of them they didn't want to have the sin on their own conscious because he\nhas to work on Saturday. So the best thing for them was not to employ them. So and actually,\nit was very, very hard...the upbringing. In my house, my father he married off my mother. He\nwas married. His wife____ passed away. He had a son and a daughter. I have never seen\nthem. When my father married my mother, my brother left for Paris. After that when I was\nabout 9 months old, my sister left, also for Paris. They lived over there, married, had\nchildren, and we remained in the city of Czestochowa. Why I knew? Because after I got a\nlittle older, I wrote letters to them. I knew I have a brother and sister over there. Besides\nthem, my mother had...had me count three brothers and two little girls. The two little girls\npassed away when they were...one of them was about a year old. Another one was about\nthree years old. The main reason of it, there was no food. There was no milk 1n the house.\nThere was nothing in the house. Why I think that was the reason, I remember they'd be sick\nor other thing. My mother tried to help my father whatever she could, but there was no work.\nOn one job, 50 people grabbed it. And that was going on until I, myself and my brother got a\nlittle bit older. My brother went to work. He started to work by a relative of ours, shoemaker,\nwhich he was a good one. Even by having a trade was a difference between a good and a bad\none. So he was working, helping out. And then by the age of 12...when I was 12 years old I\ncouldn't go to learn a trade. I got myself a job in a factory by making dolls. They had\nsomebody over there, liked me, took me in when I was 12 years old. I worked there for 2 and\na half years old and then my mother decide and myself that's not a trade for a young man.\nGotta have a real trade. What's the real trade? I had a cousin of mine, he had a barber shop.\nIn my town, that's considered as a good trade. Was nice dressed, mixed with nice people, all\nkind of people they came in, and he took me in to learn. Learning time was 3 years for\nnothing. Alright, I got a few pennies like you call it here for tips, other things you know.\n_And this I brought into the house. That was after those two kids passed away. And there was\na little boy that time. It was about 3 years old. And that's how we got together. We provided\nfor the house. My mother was...I would say not in a bad condition, because food, clothes,\neven had electric which for that time, it was a big thing. We had a radio in the house. You\nknow, we didn't spend the money like the kids today, throwing it away, because every penny\nwe maked we brought to the house, needed. And that's how we grew up until my brother got\nmarried. I myself tried to go to school. I went into a school after the hours of work and I\nfinished it. It's one of the finest schools. And besides that I was very active in an\norganization. I was active in the Zionist organization...uh...called the ___, The Right One,\nBen-Gurion's party. I was in the youth group. I was the leader also with them. I remember I\nled a branch of girls, about 20 some girls....also not young ones, 18, 19 years old in which I\nwas myself at that same age. Was the ___ branch. You know about the ___. And beside\nthat I was very much in love with books. Up to date, I cannot eat, I cannot go to sleep. I got\nto have a book. That's my thing. And real I learned by myself. I would say like self\neducation.",
        "Q: Did you go to seder?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Did you to go seder like everybody?",
        "A: Oh, naturally, every...every child when to seder. Every one went to seder. I myself went to\nseder for the money because my mother had no money to pay so went into a seder which\nthere was provided by the Jewish ____. You know what that means, the eldest of the Jewish\npeople. And we didn't pay for it, and I learned there. I was very good student. I was very\ngood in the...1n a bible and all kind of kings, in____ which I know up to now very well. And\nbesides that, I was very interested in literature, all kinds. American, French, English. And I\nknow about a lot of it. And so I'd say by the age of 18, start going around with a girl from my\nhome town. We were...we were...we would say here in love. Not the same way people here\nin love. That time was a different style. It's already 50 years ago, don't forget. More than 50\nyears! So we were going around about 7 years. We couldn't afford to get married.",
        "Q: Tell me about her. What was she like?",
        "A: She was a beautiful girl. Blonde. She was beautiful. In my eyes, you know, well especially\nwhen you're alone, every...everything is beautiful. But she was a nice girl, very nice girl. And\nwe're going around and we started, you know, to save for the time when we get married to\nbuy some stuff. We didn't have any money. It wasn't like...1t wasn't like here. You want this\nand that. And we saved up until the time came in 1939. And that was the bitter time had\ncome. Everything was separated. The German came into the town on a Friday morning,\nSeptember, the Ist, the war started. Our town was almost on the border with the German,\nwas 4, 5 kilometers which is about 3 miles from the border. In the morning, they were\nalready in the city. So we lived...separated. My brother was living with his wife. He had a\nson about 4 years old, and I was living with my mother and my younger brother and my\ngirlfriend was with her parents. Different place! To tell you the story how it was, you know,\nthe first thing when the...when the German came in, it was not a ball. First thing, they came\nin on a Friday, I mentioned it. Friday, it was quiet. At the beginning of the war, everybody\nstart running. We did to. We ran about 40 kilometers, walking. Me, my wife...not my wife, I\nmean my mother, my little brother, also my girlfriend was with me. And then we decided\nwhere will we camp? The Germans were there already. So we...where we going to hang\naround? Decided to go back. Went back...came back to the same apartment. Monday\nmorning, like a magic thing happened. The Germans were all over the place. Everybody out\nof the house. And they start dragging the men, just the men, to public places, like school,\nsynagogue, churches and open place on the market. We were a couple of days and but seeing\nthat stuff, shooting, killing some people, a lot of people. Matter of fact a friend of mine\nwhich was together with me in Treblinka by the name of Rappaport, Moshe. His father was\nkilled the first one. First ____ from Czestochowa. His name was Rappaport, Lazer\nRappaport... And a lot of them. We...we were over there about 3 days. They took away\ncouple of thousand people and the rest of them they sent back home.",
        "Q: Can you describe what you saw?",
        "A: What...what was like? I'll tell you what...excuse me. I'll tell you what was like. You come\ninto the house. Imagine yourself. You were in my shoes. Somebody comes in without\nanything, without any reason. Out from the house. Not allowed to take water, not allowed to\ntake bread...bread, not allowed to take anything. And in the street. In the street with guns,\nthey start running after you until...until you got to the place. I myself...they took me into a\nchurch. The church was the...the holy...the name was the Holy Family CHurch. We had a big\nchurch. We had a very big church. And we went over there 1n that church. They weren't...the\npeople they couldn't get so fast in in the back of the church. They got killed in the front going\nin through the door. And they killed a lot of people that way. We were there. There was no\nfood. There was no water. There was no places, you know, for the humanbeing with ___.\nWe were over there, a priest. I'm gonna mention him. His name was ___.. He was one of\nthe finest gentlemen of the Catholic priest I have ever met. He said to us, \"Children, never\nmind you're without any church. You do whatever you can. You...this place or that thing, as\na...you know, and the other place. He tried to bring in water for us. And really, I admired him\nas a gentlemen. He knew that we are Jews which was also some Christian people living in\nthose neighbors, mostly they took his from the Jewish neighbor. Let's say...I would say...I\ndon't know about Washington...Let's say when you this side, this that, that kind of a neighbor\nthey took. We're there for 3 days, came out from over there, went back home. Thank God,\neverybody's fine. My brother was in a different place. He also came home. I was working in\na barber shop about when I came to the age 17, 18, my boss passed away. His wife passed\naway, and the family...they decided to sell the shop to me because I was working there. I was\nworking there for about 4 years. And was 20 years I bought that shop. Not the money that I\nhad. I had no money, but there was another barber which he had a little bit of money. He\ncame in with me as a partner, and we owned that shop from I would say 37, 38 until 1942 we\nwere partners. A very wonderful man as a partner. Very wonderful man. And that's how we\nlived. Every one...every barber had a quota for taking care of the Jewish people...people they\nworked for the government. They worked for the Judenrat, so we had a quota about a week,\n30, 35 people to shave them, to cut hair without money. We did it. So we were not obligated\nto go dig ditches or other thing for the German. And for us that was good thing. At least we\nwere employed. And we had a card that we...uh...that we are not obligated. And that what\nwas going on until May 41. May 41, they decided to make a ghetto. So that call in the\nlanguage of our town, it calls the big ghetto. Why the big ghetto? Because was many streets\nincluded in the ghetto. Also the streets were more wealthy people lived, not just the\nneighborhood where the poor people lived, also where... And from that ghetto nobody could\nleave. Nobody could go in like Catholic people. Situation was going from bad to worst. It\nwas impossible to get along. For instance, before 1939 a loaf of bread, in Poland was a loaf\nof bread 5 pounds. The price of 1t was 50 cents. During 1941, the price of it was already 15\nslotas. In my trade where the price of getting a hair cut was 50 cents, getting a shave 25\ncents, the price didn't go up. Instead to get from a customer one loaf of bread, we had to do\nmore than 15 customers for the same thing. Well, naturally was the situation was very bad.\nBut we lived and some kind of hope it's gonna end. One day it's gonna end. Everybody\nknows that, this...that. We're gonna pray. It's gonna end. It didn't end. That was going on\nfrom May 41 until September the 22nd, 1942.",
        "Q: Were you married during this time?",
        "A: Yes. I got married in 1940. I got married 1940 because we couldn't go from one place to the\nother. Our dating...the time...we were almost 7 years together, so we decided to get married\nand to live together. We got married. Wasn't a marriage... marriage like they make it now,\nbut we married off. Two years after that, my wife she got pregnant and we had a son. Was\nborn September the 31st, 1942. That is almost 20 days...not 20...little bit...only 20 days...little\nover 20 days when it started the liquidation of the Jewish people in Czestochowa. But\nbetween 41 May - September 42, they took out a lot of people. They send them...they put\nthem places, especially young people. They sent them to work which most of them did not\nreturn and it was not always in that big ghetto. But we could live with communicate also\nwith the outside people, with the...with the Polish people. Some of them, you know, not the\nGerman...they didn't look, they looked away they didn't see it, they could bring in some stuff.\nBut when the liquidation started on September the 22nd, it was exactly a day after Yom\nKippur in 1942. At Yom Kippur 1942, we were at the prayer house and people came in from\nwork because people they had to work even on Yom Kippur. They said at the station, the\nrailroad station, there is a lot of cattle trains and there are Ukrainians around. We heard the\nword Ukrainians, we know something it's going to happen. So the prayer was interrupted.\nWe seen going here and there, looking what's going to be, where we're going to go. We\nknow already that they're going to take us away. They're going to take us somewhere.\nMiddle of the night, around 12, | o'clock, all of a sudden, all the lights were on, which\nnormally since 1939 was not allowed to have any light in city or in apartment and here the\nlights...lit lamps were on bright, shining. Four o'clock in the morning, the Germans started to\ntake out the Jewish people. They started first the poorest neighborhood where the poor\npeople lived. That was on September, the 23rd, 1942. I was living with my wife, my mother,\nmy little brother, child of mine in that poor stretch called ___, which was the poorest\nneighborhood. They took us out to the transport...taking out you know you take people they\ntransport who wasn't fast enough got killed and left on the road. We were the lucky ones. We\nmaked to the transport. When we came to the railroad station and there was over there I\nwould say thousands of people. Thousands and thousands of people! They had, accordingly\nthat I know, over 60 wagons, cattle wagons. Each one contained over a hundred people.\nChildren were not counted because the children...",
        "Q: Excuse me. I want to stop this and we will go back. Would you stop the tape, Bonnie? The\nPA is coming through into the studio and will be on the tape, and I can't have it. Alright?\nAnd this is not the time for it. Bonnie, just do it. Just do it. We will back up a minute. Wait\none minute until they do it. I'm sorry. This is not the time for this. Would you resume the\ntape as quickly as possible please? Bonnie, I suggest that we proceed while somebody else\ngoes the checking on that to find the source of that. This 1s no time to stop, so if you'll tell me\nwhen the film's rolling. Barney, I want to move please. I want to start now. Alright, tell her.\nBonnie, I would like to start now please. I'm sorry about this. They had to check the wires.\nAlright, Bonnie I would like to...can we start this while someone else deals with it. Okay.",
        "Q: Alright. The tape is on. I'm sorry about that. Can we go back a little and can you start again\nyour description of what it was like when you were rounded up and taken? Is that possible?",
        "A: As of...as of...as of 39?",
        "Q: No. No. No. You are in the synagogue. It's after Yom Kippur.",
        "A: Oh. Alright. Yes. So when we were taken out from the house, they took us to the railroad\nstation. And on both sides there were German Ukrainian. Whoever couldn't walk that fast,\nthey got rid of him by killing. So we went in to the railroad station. It was not the general\nrailroad station. It was the railroad station for cattle. And over there, they pushed in people.\nThey threw in children, one on top of the other until they're loaded. Those ones...over 60\nwagons. Myself and my wife, the kid, my mother, and the little brother, we couldn't go in. It\nwas about 2,000 more people. They couldn't go in because they had too many people already\nin the wagons so they decided to send in...send us back home. Now this was unbelievable a\nstory. All of a sudden, people start to panic. People start to dance. Happened? They were the\nlucky ones. They got their amount what they need to be taking out from the ghetto, and the\nrest they will not touch anymore. The people they were together, the families were together,\nthey were very happy because nobody was missing between them. People were taking away\nlike brothers or sisters or parents...1f somebody remained of them, there was crying going on\nin the city. We were sent home. We were sent home, but one thing whoever could\nunderstand the situation was not finished. They didn't take away the Germans. They didn't\ntake away the Ukrainians, and the light was still on for day and night. So we know\nsomething is going to happen to us again. We didn't have to wait too long because on the\n25th, 4 days after the first transport, the same thing was going on again. September, the 25th,\n1942, which on the Jewish calendar was____, again they took us out. Now this time we\ndidn't go straight to the railroad station to be sent off. We went to the market which over\nthere the German the head man from the Gestapo was the man over there by the name of\nDegenhof, he was the leader from them. He was the murderer of the...not only this city, but\nmore cities. And that was...when he decided who should live and who should die. With the\npoint of the finger, he said this way, the other way. A little bit younger, not too many asking\nquestions, \"What is your trade?\" Somebody had a trade like electro mechanic, which was\nvery few people in our town, or engineering, other thing, to the right. Ninety five percent of\nthe people which they took out from the houses, he pointed to the left which means to the\ntransport. But before that, it is another thing I have to mention. People were running around\ncrazy, starting to get a paper from the Judenrat and also from the Germans that...all kind of\npaper: red, green, with a stamp, without a stamp and everybody tried to do the best even\nwith money to get the right paper. But nobody know what the right paper was. Each one was\nhappy because he's got the right paper. Coming in to that place where he decided... Degenhof\ndecided who's going to go right, who's going to go left, the paper was not important. It was\njust worthless. They took the paper, tear it up. So I was with my mother and the kid, my wife\nand my brother, and it was most of my family who went to the left to the transport. Went in\nto the transport where the cattle transport they had, and they took us in to the wagon. That\nwas the last time I saw the city of Czestochowa before I came back from Treblinka. Now to\ntell you a story in that cattle train, I don't know how to start and I don't know how to end\nbecause it was like living through a whole life in that thing. First thing, people one on top of\nthe other. You couldn't stand straight. You couldn't bend. You couldn't sit down. It was just\nlike one on top of the other. They took us 6 o'clock in the morning into that train. We were\nover there until about finished it loaded with all of us 2 hours maybe, more than that. Then\nthey took us around back to the main station and over there we were waiting a time. Across\nthe railroad station, there was another train that passengers...Polish people, they could go.\nThey could ride, handle anything they wanted. When we stood each other, happened I was\nthe lucky one...I was near a little window, where was with wire closed around that people\nshouldn't be able to escape. I looked through. Most of the people what they did to us, they\nspit on us. It happened one girl I know her. She worked for a Jewish family from my...not the\nhouse where I lived but house where I had my barber shop. When she saw me she said, \"Oh,\nyou are too here?\" And in a way, she started crying. But more than 90 percent of the\npassengers in the other side of the train, they spit on us. And so we start rolling...start rolling\nto went nobody knew where we're going. In the middle of the night, was already about 18\nhours in the train, we came to a side station which they pointed out this was Warsaw. Stood\nover there for awhile and inside that train, with God's help, it was hot like Hell and that was\nalmost the end of September where usually in Poland, end of September is nice and cool. But\nat that time, just God helped them, not us. After about 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock start rolling\nagain and we went through wilderness and all kind of thing. We came to a halt. I looked out\nand I see a sign which didn't mean nothing to me. The sign was Treblinka. Today, everybody\nalmost knows what that word means. At that time was just a name, not a...a little bit...a tiny\nlittle...maybe...maybe it was over there 40 families altogether, all waiting with them. Stayed\nlooking out the window. More things came. From other parts of the country. They went in,\nafter about 2 hours they came out. And all the trains empty. Another train also...over 60\ntrains with the town people, they came in. Went in, disappeared, 2 hours came back. And\nnow was the time our train start rolling and we went in. Gate opened up, rolled 1n to the\ncamp of Treblinka. 10 men over there. We got in over there. The trains didn't go in like, you\nknow, the first goes in. The engineer takes a train, but backwards because the engineer and\nthe people they're working in the locomotive of the train, they shouldn't know what's going\non over there. They were not supposed to...to see what is going on. That's why the pushed in\nthe end of the train. And we went in. Out! Started yelling, \"Out.\u201d It opened up. I don't know\nhow many dead ones was a...in the train because nobody counted we had in our train. We\nhad on out...men on the right side at the open telling...woman at the left side at the barracks.\nWe didn't know what it is. And we didn't believe something what's going wrong. I know\nsomething is not usually that this is the last time we see each other. My wife, the kid and my\nmother went in to that left side. I my...mine little brother was at that time was 13 years old.\nAnd some of the Germans, Ukrainian and also the Jewish from the red kommando. \"Take off\nyour clothes.\u201d Took off the clothes. Start taking off the clothes. All the people did. But\nmyself...I don't know what it happened. A man...a Jewish man which he had a band, a red\nband, what called a red kommando went through...he recognized someone which was near\nme and he said, \"What are you doing here?\" \"You see what I'm doing here.\u201d So he said to\nhim, \"We need a few people. Go to the side.\u201d \"You need more?\" \"Yes, need more.\u201d They\ntook out about 16, 17 people. I was between them. Now this man which he recognized, he\nwas married to a cousin of mine. They took out his brother-in-laws, three of them; myself;\nmy little brother they couldn't take out because was a kid, 13 years old. And a few more\nstayed on the side. We didn't see. People went in through the gate. Now we know what the\ngate was. It was the way to the gas chamber and we have never see them again. That was the\nfirst hour we came in. After that, we...the people, 18 or 16 people...more people came in\nfrom the...working people what they worked already before in the gas chamber, we had a\norder to clean up the place. Now clean up the place is not something you can take it clean. It\nwas horrible. But in 5, 10 minutes this place had to look spotless. And it looked spotless.\nLike there was never nobody on the place. So the next transport when it comes in, they\nshouldn't see what's going on.",
        "Q: You were cleaning up the place?",
        "A: We were cleaning up in the outside. Tell you what mean cleaning up. Taking away all the\nclothes to those places where the clothes were. Now, not only the clothes, all the papers, all\nthe money, all the...the...whatever somebody had with him. And they had a lot of things with\nthem. Pots and pans they had with them. Other things they had with them. We cleaned that\nup. Still didn't know what's going on until this guy with the red bands, when we asked him\nwhat's happened to them? He said, \"Be happy we're here because they're finished.\u201d At night\nwhen they took us into the barrack...the barrack was near, I was just about... would say 50\nmeters from the gate to the gas chamber. It was at the same place where the people\nundressed themselves. The men undressed themselves, there was a well....just take out\nwhatever... And over there we had the barrack we went to live in. Why I mention the well,\nbecause I tell you what the well was. People they knew already, not from the beginning like\nfrom Warsaw they transport...they started on the 22nd of July 1942, so people they know\nalready what Treblinka 1s. That is not a working camp. That is not a concentration camp.\nThat is extermination camp. From there nobody goes out alive. The minute when they came\nin, we find over there...took out from over there from that well, over 50 people. They jumped\nin. Instead to go into the gas chamber, they just jumped into the well.",
        "Q: Jumped into the well. I'm sorry.",
        "A: The well. Yes. They drowned themselves. Took them out and that water we used to drink.\nNobody got sick. Nothing happened. At night, couldn't sleep. Some of us which were...there\nwere religious people and they found out that their parents or their wife or their children\nwere killed which they didn't take out...people...where they're people which they have\nchildren. Mostly they took out people 25, 26, 28 years old. Some of them they were religious\nand they start saying the traditional Kiddish. That was the first night I was over there. In the\nmorning, 5 o'clock the morning, the order. Out! Went out. Stayed in line to work. What was\nthe work? The work in Treblinka like mostly was those clothes which were there were taking\naway from the people the night before, they day before they killed and there was piles up on\nthe big places with clothes. They had to be divided. Like coat to coat, shoes to shoes, shirts,\nand also the quality of it. A cotton, other things, wool...that was the job. We called it sort\nkommando. Maybe you heard that name. Maybe not. So we worked over there. I myself I\nwas a barber. Then at the third day or so it came...it came another order. They need barbers.\nIt was mine town between the 16 people they took out, there was one more barber. But I had\nsome with me friends ____ you do. You're gonna be barber. They took also from other\nplaces, mostly from Warsaw. They got themselves about 14, 15 barbers. And they took us in\nto the other side of the place which is called Treblinka No. 2. Treblinka No. 2 means only the\nwork by dead people in the gas chamber. What they wanted us to do is to cut off the\nwoman's hair. They took us in to the gas chamber...1n the gas chamber before they gassed\nthem. There were benches, about 20 benches...maybe less. And on a row of benches women\nwere sitting and the barber went through cutting hair, with me cutting hair. The way the\ncommandant...he was Jewish who...the way I know after that...I find out that he was\nconverted but that doesn't mean anything. His name was Glesk. Maybe you heard the name.\nEugene Glesk. He was the commandant of Treblinka. He was a very nice man. Very fine\ngentleman. He came over. He had a speech to us. He said, \"Look, people. I don't want that\nthe woman should know that they're going to be gassed. Make believe you're giving them a\nhair cut. They...they're going in to take a shower. It is...take a bunch of hair from here. Take a\nbunch of hair from here. Don't take off all the hair. Don't make them look like monkeys. And\nso we did it.",
        "Q: Tell me what it was like?",
        "A: What was like it? We had scissors. From them we took bunches of hair. Cut off. Threw on\nthe floor to the side, and about 2 minutes have to be finished. Not even 2 minutes\nbe...because there was a line waiting to come up the next group. And that's how we worked.\nInside it was very painful. Most painful was because some of the barbers they recognized\ntheir dear ones, like wives, mothers, even grandmothers. Can you imagine that you have to\ncut their hair and not to tell them a word because you were not allowed. If you say a word\nthat they going to..uh..be gassed in 5 or 7 minutes later, there would be a panic over there\nand they would be killed too. After that, the transport was finished.",
        "Q: Excuse me. I'd not to leave the gas chambers for a minute. Can you tell me a little more?\nYou've talked about a friend.\nTape #2",
        "Q: You started to tell me about your barber friends who worked with you in the gas chamber.\nWould you tell me about some of them and some of the families that they met there?",
        "A: It was just families like any other family. But the most thing it hurts when you know people.\nWhen a transport came in, you don't know the people. Those are people, but when it comes\nin somebody you associate or you are related, that's an entirely different thing. It hurts a lot\nmore. We have..I have friend. We worked together. We were friend in the same town\ntogether. Was a barber, a very good barber too. And he was working gas chamber with me. It\nhappened that there came in one time his sister, one time his wife, came in his sister-in-law\nsame thing. He start hugging and this and that. To take a half a minute more with her than\nwith any other one. But this thing has to be done. He couldn't help himself. It was very hard.\nIt was very, very horrible. But any other way it was, you get killed. Which it happened. Now\nlet me...let me tell you a story. I had a very close a friend of mine. I worked with him\ntogether for years. His name was Dorfman Slamic. Very fine gentleman. Now two men from\nall the time where I was over there, they didn't want to stay with us together and work\ntogether. They run into the gas chamber by themselves. He was a barber, and the other one\nwas a neighbor of mine. He did the same thing. That's two and the history...when the history\nof myself being in Treblinka . I didn't have the guts to do. I wish I could. I did not.\nBut what could he do? Or get killed! To go together with him or wait maybe another day.\nAnd I want to tell you something. If a humanbeing is in a situation like that, he thinks of\nevery second, every minute...maybe...maybe there will be a change. Maybe something\nhappened. Maybe there will be a miracle that he will survive. That people were not ready to\nget killed. People were not ready even to try to escape. And it happened to myself which I\norganized my escape. I organized another escape from 11 people which they escaped from\nTreblinka. But people that were not ready for it, they didn't want it. I had a friend of mine\nwhich is...was a leader from the...from the organization of the workers and I approached him.\nI said, \"I'm planning an escape. Maybe we'll escape. You interested?\" He said, \"Look, Abe.\nI'm here already. Where I'm gonna go outside to the Pollack. They will kill.\u201d\u2019 Which 1s...was\nthe truth. It was the truth. \"So I rather stay here. So it's gonna be, it's gonna be. I'm gonna live\nanother day...I'm gonna. If not, be killed.\u201d Now that is one thing. Another thing 1s...which I\nwant to mention..I hear that story many, many times and it hurts me a lot. I'm going back to\nthis same time that...uh...Jewish people went in like the sheep to the slaughter house. It hurts\nme a lot about that. I explain that to you why. People are not sheep. The way the Germans\nare organized to get the people killed is entirely different way. The first thing of not allowed\nto go out. The second thing is of not bring in food. Then they starve the people. They take\naway the clothes from the people. They take out the furniture from them, the better one.\nThey take away the...the force, and then to starve them little by little until the people they\nlost their will to fight even the will to live. And to them was the same thing. What I'm gonna\nlose. I'm starving here. I got nothing here. Maybe if I go away and they would send me\nsomewhere away, they promised...maybe over there I will stay. And this is entirely a\ndifferent story than the story like some people they say, here especially people...Jewish\npeople, \"Why you went?\" They don't understand that looking at a wife, at looking at a child,\nand not to have a drop of milk, even a drop of water for them...what could those people do?\nHow could they fight? And with what? First thing, you went...somebody was lucky. He went\nacross the gate. Got killed on the other side because he got paid from the Germans. He got\npaid. For each Jew he got paid a liter of vodka. That was to them and he got paid with salt.\nHe got paid with sugar. And even not for that time he was willing to do because to get rid of\na Jew. And that is not happen to I, a thousand, or ten thousand. It happened to lot of them.\nThe people they didn't go like sheep to the slaughter house. They were already willing to go\nthe last way even to the gas chamber because their will was not decided by them. It was\ndecided by hunger, other thing what they went through. Sicknesses, all kind. And now I want\nto tell you...I want to tell you about the thing...the gas chamber. Always, they ask me already\nabout this thing. The gas chamber. How it looked? Very simple. Was all concrete. Was no\nwindows. There was nothing in it. Beside on top of you, there was wires and it looked like,\nyou know, the water going to come out from it. Had two doors. Steel doors. From one side\nand from the other side. The people went into the gas chamber from the one side. Like\nmyself, I was in it doing the job as a barber. When it was full the gas chamber, the size of it\nwas...I would say 18 by 18 or 18 by 17. I didn't measure that time. Just looked like I would\nsay I look here the room around, I wouldn't say exactly how big it is. And they pushed in as\nmany as they could. It was not allowed to have the people standing up with their hands down\nbecause there is not enough room, but when the people raised their hand like that there was\nmore room to each other. And on top of that they throw in kids, 2, 3, 4 years old kids on top\nof them. And we came out the whole thing it took I would say between 5 and 7 minutes. The\ndoor opened up, not from the side they went in but the side on the other side and from the\nother side the...the group...people working in Treblinka No. 2 which their job was only about\ndead people. They took out the corpses. Some of them dead and some of them still alive.\nThey dragged them to the ditches, and over there they covered them. They digged ditches\nand they covered them. That was the beginning of Treblinka, the time when I was there.\nLater, they changed the situation over there by killing people the same way, but not take\nthem to the ditches but to take them to be burned, to pile them on top of the other top, they\nburned. It was for those people...I brought you the picture. Three of them, they worked only\nby dead people. I myself which I worked in Treblinka No. 1, was little bit easier. Why was it\neasier? Because we...the people working in Treblinka No. 1...1, we took in the transports\nliving people. All living people. And from living people, we got something. We went\nthrough a pocket. We find a piece...a piece of bread. We find sometime a bottle of water\nwhich was a really...some of them they brought in other thing to eat, but over there those\npeople they worked in Treblinka No. 2, they had no chance. All they got is naked people\ngoing in and dead people taking out from the gas chamber.",
        "Q: How long did you work as a barber in the gas chamber?",
        "A: In the gas chamber we were working as a barber over there between 2...little more than 2\nweeks. Not for 3 weeks. And then they decided that the barbers will not go in anymore to the\ngas chamber to cut off the hair of the woman over there, but in the undressing barracks, they\ndivided a part...let's say like you take here, divide a part and on this side they put the same\nthing. Benches around and we cut the hair off, not in the gas chamber anymore. That was the\nlast time...the 3...the 2 or 3 weeks we worked over there, we worked. Nobody else worked\nmore from Barrack No. | because they did not allow it. It was a gate between Treblinka | and\nTreblinka 2 to the gas chamber, also with barbed wires and it was some kind like trees, other\nthing through the wire it shouldn't be visible.",
        "Q: Abe, I need to ask you, if you can, before you...before we leave and...and go to this other job\nbecause now we don't know enough. Can you tell us...during those 2 weeks you were in the\ngas chamber working and I know it's hard, but can you tell us about some of the other people\nworking in the gas chamber with you. Your friends first. What...what who were they and\nwhat did they do?",
        "A: They were common people like myself....growing up together. They were people I know.\nThey're the people I know. Like there were people from Warsaw, people from other places I\nnever knew. We just met over there. Same like I say about those people. Some of them I\ndon't know. And like...uh... you know, ____ I mentioned to you. I never...I never knew him. I\nsaw him in Treblinka. So the people I knew...what kind of people they were? I'd say mostly\nwere people...hard working people. One of them specially was a man...he was a fireman.\nMatter of fact, he was related to Danny Kaye because Danny Kaye come from our place, his\nparents. And his name was also Daniel Kamiski which was the name of...uh... Danny Kaye.\nHe wasn't a barber. I took him in. He was a nice man. He was next to me standing. And they\nwere looking for a barber and I said, \"Danny, how about you.\u201d Fine. What's happening?\nThey go in. Because over there, he did that job. He wasn't in the eyes of the German which\nanother thing I have to tell you. People working in Treblinka, there wasn't a job that you\nwork, you gonna work tomorrow. Every day they changed the people they worked there. If\nsomebody worked in Treblinka a week, he was an old worker. He was very old because he\nworked there, he survived a week. Mostly they did...they changed. Every day they killed 2, 3\nhundred, 4 hundred people of the people they worked in Treblinka and from the transport\narriving, like myself they took out, they took out other people. So they were working over\nthere the same way. And those people that I know they worked with me as a barber. The\nsame they did. The same thing as I did. They had over there sometime ______ their sisters\ncoming, and I said it before. They had to do a job. The job was to prepare...to go...people to\ngo into the gas chamber. Not any other thing. Now, after that we worked over there only a\nfew hours because a transport like cutting their hair... Let's say a transport like myself when I\ncame in. When I came in, I came in from the town of Czestochowa. Then came a transport\nfrom other places. It was 18 thousand people. Eighteen thousand people they took out, 16 or\n17 people from the 18,000. And it happened a day I was there and I can remember...it was 4\nor 5 days like that. Not all the time. Most of the time was between 12 and 15 thousand\npeople. But happened 4 or 5 times there were 24 thousand people in one day. And it took\ntime. Each transport took between 2 hours. No more than 2 hours. And it was ____.\nEverything spotless. The train would come in. You couldn't see any dead one. You couldn't\nsee any blood one. Everything was shiny. The rest of the time...talking about myself because\nnot everyone was a barber over there. But we did...after our job as barbers we worked in our\nplaces in the sort __ ko mmandbo, picking the clothes up, bringing the bundle from one place\nto other place. Taking the bundles to the...to the railroad place to load in the...in the wagons\nbecause they have to take those things in. Now there was a question also or some did ask me,\n\"Why did they have to cut the women's hair?\" Was simple, simple answer to that. Because\nthey needed it. What they did from that was to make saddles for the horses. Now if you cut\noff hair from a humanbeing, those hair it just like cutting off the feathers of a goose. If you\ncut the feather from a goose, when the goose 1s alive, that will never die. Whatever you do,\nyou push it down, it goes up...stays up. And with human hair the same way. When you cut\nhair from a dead person, this hair just like the person. It's dead. But if you cut the hair from a\nlive person, if you put in the saddle, the saddle will not push down because that was...that's\nwhy they cut their hair off. Just to be send back to German to the practice over there when\nthey...where they make the saddles with it. Now the...while working over there...did all kind\nof work. At the time...let me explain the...the start of the...of the day. In the morning, 5\no'clock we had a order to get out. Get out. Went to the kitchen. Not just going forth like\nsoldier 5 in a row to receive coffee. A little bit of black water and slice of bread. Daytime\nnothing. After the work, we received some kind of soup. And it was people working in the\nkitchen...excuse me the expression, the toilets and all the places. The hardest job and I think\neven harder working in the gas chamber cutting women's hair was when the transport came\nin and you had to take out people from the wagons. Crippled people, small children, which\nthey lost their parents between like let's say they took one...the mother into one wagon, the\nchildren into another wagon they were not together so they were separated. But we have to\ntake is...to take those people, the old, crippled people and the small...little small children is to\nthe lazarette. Maybe you heard what...about the lazarette. Now lazarette usually means a\nhospital. Now over there wasn't a hospital. Was a big, very big ditch. And it was also with\ntrees around. You couldn't see what was going on inside. In front of it was a man in a white\nthing with a red cross. It's just like going into a hospital, but going into that ditch...over there\nwas Ukraine or German...shot in the head and into the ditch. And that was the hardest job to\ndo. To take people, specially to have children... children a few months old...to take them in,\nthrow them into the ditch where the...over there the fire was burning day and night at that\nditch. All the thing what we find papers...all kind of thing, we threw 1n that ditch and that\nwas going on as long as I was there. The fire was never off. All the time it was on. And on\ntop of that, people and people are killed. Somebody...let's say...anytime when we couldn't go\nin to the latrine...to the toilet, we went to the side to do his, right away they killed. That\nhappened to a close friend of mine. His brother's a barber. He's alive. A guy by the name of\nSliska. He just stood on the side to do his...took him killed, into the ditch. And that happened\nall the time. Every time and all the time. Now it happened that one...one time it happened. A\ntransport came from Ketrzyn. Ketrzyn 1s a little town next to Warsaw. Came a transport over\nthere and a woman came out from that transport. Why I mention it? I'll tell you the story\nwhat it happened. That the one story which very, very seldom. She came out. In front of her\nwas two men...two was moving with the red finger on. One of them...tall fellow about six\ntwo or six three, blond hair. Real German, but he was a Jew. And another one...his name was\nSolic Matter of fact, he was a barber. Well, he did a good job. What you mean a good job?\nFor the Germans I would say.",
        "Q: Explain.",
        "A: And he was active. What that mean good job. There are people doing good, bad. He was\nquick. He organized it quick. He took the people away quick into the...out from the trains.\nBut he didn't know they are Jewish people. He came out from the train with a razor and she\ncut the throat of both of them. Specially the tall fellow. I never knew his name. Was very,\nvery handsome. He was more...looking like Germans than all the Germans together. And\nnaturally, on the spot they killed her. Not with guns, with their shoes with anything they had,\nthey killed her. And they took those two men into a hospital. I don't know where, but out\nfrom Treblinka. And they tried to arrest them whatever they want. This tall man they couldn't\nhelp. He died. They brought them back to Treblinka. The other one...he got killed, also\nbrought back. When I left Treblinka___. But the first man...that's the only funeral in\nTreblinka which was from the beginning until the end. What they did, they took him. They\nmaked a grave for him, and wood thing. They buried him. Everybody stood...an order. That's\nthe only one grave which a man...Jewish man was left in that Treblinka. A woman from\nKetrzyn. Now during the time when...when I was there, it happened a lot of thing. What it\nhappened? In the barrack I was in it, we were about 70 people one barrack. Every night of\nthe work people, 5, 6 was missing. What mean were missing? They killed themselves.\nHanged themselves with their...whatever they could get on them to strangle themself. Even\nmy brother-in-law did the same. Uh...He married...he married a sister of my wife by the\nname of _____\u2014\u2014_\u2014, a highly educated man. He was the leader of the...he was the leader of\nthe Socialist Party Bundt had the name Bundt in Poland. He was a leader from that. He\nhanged himself. He couldn't take it. And that happened every single night. Three, four, five\npeople. Beside people which they were killed by the Germans exchanging them for new ones\nwhich they came in from the new transport. Oh, it happened at one time to me. I got very\nsick in Treblinka. Very, very sick! And I went over to the commandant, to the German, I\nsaid, \"Take me to the lazarette.\u201d When I say take me to the lazarette, he knows exactly what\nit means. To be killed! Because I had an attack of the...how you call it? kidney and that was\npain...I couldn't take it. Unbelievable! So he said to me, \"How long are you working here?\"\n\"Oh,\" I said, \"I work here about 5 weeks.\u201d \"5 weeks.\u201d Go to the kitchen and ask them to give\nyou some Snupps.\u201d And I was surprised. And everybody was surprised that he didn't take out\nof the gun and took care...what for you need that. Not that Jew. Could get 10,000 of Jews.\nGet the other one. I went over there to the kitchen and I told him what____\u2014\u2014\u2014.\u00ab~ Whose\ngoing to give you whiskey? A little bit water you can have. I got a little water and then he\ntold me to go into the barrack. That was the first time somebody went into the barrack in the\nmiddle of the day not going to work. And I laid down in the barrack. I had two cousins over\nthere. They worked together with me, which they were taking out at the same time transport\nwith me. One of them, he risked his life to find out what had happened to me. He came in to\nthe barrack. He saw me. He never said a word to me. He run out and he said, \"Abe is in the\nbarrack.\u201d At the night, they came in. Everybody on top of me. \"Oh, you must be really the\nlucky one that they didn't kill you.\u201d They didn't kill. I still was in pain. Over there, we had a\ntransport coming in. Not one, but many transports coming in from Czechoslovakia. A man\ncame in by the name of Zello. He was captain in the Czechoslovakia army. Another one\ncame in by the name of the Messiadic which was not the president Messidic. He must be\nsome kind of a relation. He had a wife. He was Jewish or his wife was Jewish. I don't know.\nThey came in. Was a doctor. What happened? When I told, he took out the tablets and said,\n\"Abe, take the tablets,\" to me. I took the tablet. The following morning I never knew what\nthat mean the sickness until three years ago now I got sick in Israel, also on the kidney. Now\nanother practice. I worked in... worked 1n a barrack where people were hiding. I did it\nmyself too before I escaped from Treblinka. What was...the barrack was full of\nclothes...bundles maked out of clothes. So what we did we put the bundles in the barrack one\non top of the other until to the roof. People they tried to escape. What they did they went\nin...in the day time during the work in the barracks and they remained over there. And they\nhid themselves between the clothes. Both it happened by accident when the clothes moved,\ncould never go out and got choked there. At one time we took out from a barrack the size I\nwould say maybe about 40, 60...40, 50 meters, over 30 people. Dead ones! I did the same\nthing when I escaped. But before that, I worked over there and I tried to help some people\nany way I could. At one time he came in, he was a kapo. His name was in Jewish Ben Yamin\nYakoski. Have you heard that name? You did. He had a brother over there. Very, nice,\nreligious individual boy. He was from a town of Yen Jeif, which is not far from Kielce. He\ncame in he said, \"Abe, I trust you. Tonight, my people...my brother ___ they\ngoing...they're planning an escape. Eleven of them. What should I do?\" He said. You know\nyou...you have some landsmen from your town working outside...not in the barrack, but\noutside?\" I said, \"Yes.\u201d \"Tomorrow morning after the appell you bring in your friends. If\nsomebody comes in to you and tell their friends, they're working all the time here.\u201d\nNaturally, I did whatever he told me. In the morning...group I worked with them...Il of them\ndisappeared. Then it came in...the assistant commandant...friends which we call them the\nlackger, that name you heard already many times. He came in the barrack and he looked at\nme. \"What are you doing?\" I said, \"I'm working on the cloth...looking what is there, cotton,\nthis that.\u201d \"Are the same people working here what they worked yesterday?\" I said, \"Yes.\nEverybody's the same we're working.\u201d It wasn't true. What those people...by crouching the\nother side of the gate, they left some kind of sign from the trees. At night they couldn't take\naway the little...this from the trees. And he saw that somebody went through that. He came\nover to me. He took my...I had...had a hat..he took mine hat...he start knocking in a wooden\nblock which hold ___, but I was like paralyzed. Didn't feel at all. Just for the thing what they\nhad. I was scared. They're taking out to kill me. I didn't feel it all. Behind him, was a friend\nof mine by the name of Sidman, Eisack Sidman. He was standing with a knife over there\nbehind him. And if he would take out the gun, he would kill him. But it happened that he\nknocked and knocked and I didn't say a word to him, so thought maybe I didn't know\nnothing. He let me go. Then at night after work, people came in. \"What happened?\" I told\nthem. For those people, they escaped. After that I found out what happened to them. From all\nthose 11 people, 2 were alive when I returned from Treblinka to Czestochowa. All nine other\nones, they were killed by the Pollacks. They went back to their home town in _Yan Jeif, and\nthey were very, very rich. They were like, I would say, the Rockefellor. They had a\npossession. They owned ____ to ____. They call themselves I would say in German, The\nBundt's. They got killed. Two of men they tie your hands to escape. I met in the ghetto of\nCzestochowa, when I came back from Treblinka. They couldn't stay there and they went\nsomewhere away. I never saw them again. That was one part, but the second part we...what\nwe decide to run away. The first thing is we had to get money. When you go out...when you\ncome to the Pollacks, it's impossible to live without it. So we tried to get some money and\nthat wasn't a hard job to get. The money wasn't a hard job to get the money but to get the\nmoney was our job. If they find on you one slota or one dollar, you get killed. So ____ about\n8, 9 from our hometown. One 1s still alive. He is today 85 years old. He lives in Israel. Yakia\nBisner. A friend of mine. And this one, particular this one. I took him away from the gas\nchamber three times. He had such kind of eyes...you look at him you get scared. And twice\nthe German took him in, told him to go to the gate which going into the gas chamber. And I\nwas from the...from the side. I threw clothes on him. I took him away. And the third time he\nwent and he worked together with me. We...we were together all the time and we collected\nmoney together to escape. And matter of fact, he escaped before me. Also organized this\nthing. We decided who's going to go. He went away with two other ones, which the other\nones got killed where he's still alive. When we collected the money...and going in to the\nbarrack, the Ukrainian...they did something which is not normal. Why? In the middle of the\nnight we came out from the barracks not walking, but crawling to the wires...to the barbed\nwires. We want to go through them. We were 7, 8...one was still inside and we had the\nmoney with us. Also the same one the Sidman which I mentioned before. And the Ukrainian\nthey jumped on us. We...we were the last straw... went back to the barracks, back to our\nplace. We don't know anything. But they got him. And they're going to kill. What you got?\nWe showed him. Got money, a lot of money. It happened they let him go. Why they let him\ngo? I'll tell you why they let him go. They took the money. And they escaped. Those two\nUkrainians workmen...they escaped from Treblinka. Then we decided a group of 9 people is\ntoo much at one time. We're going to organize a different way to escape. Three at a time.\nAnd we organized it. One group went the first one. Then another group they didn't succeed.\nTwo of men run away. They third one got catched by a Ukrainian. His name was Ella\nLoddick, Ella. When the Ukrainian jumped on him, he jumped on the Ukrainian and he bit\nthrough his neck. With his teeth he killed him. And he run away. I met him in the ghetto of\nCzestochowa. He was over there, married. He got married in that little ghetto after he got\nback from Treblinka. I was at their wedding. A few weeks after he got sick and he passed\naway. Now the third group I went with a friend of mine and a cousin of mine. And we did\nthe same way I mentioned before, hiding between the clothes, make also...you know, each\nwent into the ditch. Three of us. We kept the clothes apart. At night, the Ukrainians, the\nGermans come in start hollering, \"Rouse, Rouse.\u201d We don't know anything. Then with their\npicks from their rifle, they start picking if somebody is not over there. They left. We worked\nover there until about 6 o'clock. About 8:30 was...winter beginning of January 43, we decide\nto leave. Now to escape from over there is...was one chance. What was one the one chance?\nWe had to go through that lazarette what the fire...what the dead people was burning. We\nhad to go through there. Otherwise, it was impossible because it was six or seven row of\nbarbed wire. You went through one, you had to go through the second, the third. Over there\nwas only one. When we maked through that ditch of the burning fire, we had the gate of\nthe...with one barbed wire. We decided that on a Saturday night to leave the place. We took\nclothes. We throwed the clothes on the barbed wire and lucky ones, nobody was in the\ntower...watching towers. There was all around watch towers. Saturday night we figured out\nbecause we saw so many times they disappeared. They went to uh...to drink or they went\nwith girls, out to Ukrainians, so we maked that. We came out about 9 o'clock at night\nthrough that, start running and running. We run all the way. In the morning we find out about\n6 o'clock in the morning, we were at the same place. Almost a kilometer away. And we\nheard the Ukrainian talking, so we were in Ukrainian place surrounded. Finally, I looked\nthrough the stars and I went a different way. Went _different way, went to the River of Bug.\nStayed there until about...1n the morning about 8:00, 8:30 in the morning. Met a woman not\nfar away. She said, \"What are you doing here? The Germans are all over.\u201d \"Let us in for just\nfor over a day.\u201d Nothing doing. So we stayed there...stayed there a whole day like in a\nwilderness around us. Then the following morning, we saw a man with his wagon and horse.\nOne of us went over...was a little village or something. He said it's not far away, about 6\nkilometers which is not far. \"Can you take us?\" He said, \"I'm going with my horse and\nwagon. If you want to go...after I don't know...I'll think about you. You go.\u201d So he went from\nover there and we came in. It was not a village, even smaller. Maybe was about 15, 20\nfamilies living there. And that time was...uh...the hard job started. We were liberated from\nthat...but we were not liberated from the...from the war...from the Germans. And it start\nanother painful, painful time. Being outside, the head man from that little village came over\nto us. He said, \"I know who you are. I know from where you come because we only 6\nkilometers from the place. We can smell. You know...when the corpse are burning, we could\nsmell it. When the wind goes out our way. What do you want to do?\" We said, \"We want to\ngo...we want to take the train to go to...back to Czestochowa. \"And that's a rough time. I\ndon't know how you're going to do it.\u201d \"Okay, show us where it is the nearest station.\u201d\u2019 He\nsaid, \"First stay over here. Stay over night. Early in the morning, we'll see what we can do.\u201d\nWas a really nice man. He brought over some milk and something to eat. We left. He said,\n\"Don't go with the way. I take you around the forest. Usually it is about 17, 18 kilometers\nfrom that place, Treblinka, to that village where he took us by the name of San Draniki. I\nremember every name of it. He took us over there, said goodbye. We was in the...we was\nalso in the...in the...one night we stayed in the forest. Second night we decided to go into the\nvillage. A woman opened up the door. This friend of mine went over. \"What do you want?\"\n\"We want just for the day, give us a place.\u201d So she goes in to her husband, \"Go up to the\nstable.\" They had a stable. Nothing was in the stable. They were poor people. So I went in.\nWe stayed over there. Cold. Ice. Cold. It wasn't a stable like...stable you know, just a part\nwas open. Wide open. WE were freezing over there. We were over there for about a week.\nAt night, came up and they told us to go into his house. His house was one room divided\nwith something like this...some kind of paper_____. We stayed in the back. In the front\nthere was a....his sister from Warsaw. She was a nice, young girl. And all the boys they came\naround, and they had a good time and we couldn't breath. We were afraid to breath. To\nsneeze, forget about it. And that was____\u2014\u2014\u2014_. This one fellow by the name of Berkewitz.\n___ was a fairly good one, but we paid a lot of money to stay. Every day we paid a lot of\nmoney in this room, and actually they didn't give a thing. Potatoes cooked almost raw, that\nwe shouldn't be able to eat a lot. And when I explained the deal we paid them like thousand\ndollars a day. We did give them the money to buy material. We maked for them clothes,\nwinter clothes. Day to days, and all that. Was very good material. A brother-in-law of hers\nfind out about...where you got so many clothes. She said, \"I'll tell you, but nobody has to\nknow. I have some Jews.\u201d \"Where is he?\" \"He's my house.\u201d So he came over, he said, \"You\ncome with me. I take the machine...the sewing machine. You come to me and you make for\nme clothes.\u201d I said, \"Yes, I will make for you but they are my friends. I will not go without\nthem.\u201d \"Come.\u201d Now this a...some kind of little story. I wrote that in a book. It is in a book.\nWhen we came over to that one, it was magnificent. There was a man and a woman...what\ncan I tell you. Diamonds. Didn't take money. Just for the food what we ate. And she maked\nthe best food you can mention. We didn't sleep in the stable. We slept in the house. In a bed.\nAnd for us we didn't see..first thing we didn't see anyone. I myself for 4 months I didn't see a\nwoman with clothes. All I did is my job in the gas chambers. All these people were all naked\nwithout any clothing. First time I see a woman it was strange to me to see a woman. And she\nwas so nice. They had a son about 9 years, daughter 7 years old. His name was____.\nAnd we were over there over a week until I find a paper...newspaper and it was...a\nnewspaper was a month from over there to Warsaw, from Warsaw to Czestochowa, which 1s\na far...far away. From over there to Warsaw is far, I would say about 68 miles and from\nWarsaw to our town it is about 150 miles. Far away. To walk is impossible. We decided to\ngo by train. Whatever will be will be. We'll go by train.",
        "Q: At this point, we need to stop, change tapes, and then we can pick up with the train.\nTape #3",
        "Q: Abe, the tape is started. We left as you were about to board a train for Czestochowa.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about that.",
        "A: Before I boarded that train, I got into a family. I mentioned it before by the name of Suppel\n____. We stayed there about 8, 10 days. Very, very nice people. And he had a...uh...brother-\nin-law. He and his brother-in-law was taking us to the railroad to pick up the train. Before we\nleft (coughing) excuse me...their house...his wife start crying and she said, \"Somebody from\nyou survive, please write me a letter.\u201d And that was the end we saw them. We went through\nthe forest. They went first. They didn't want to go together with us naturally. Before coming\nto the railroad station, from the forest under a tree...1t came out a few Germans from the SS.\nAnd how...where do you have your passports. We find out that time that the German they\ntook away all the passports from the public to change for a different kind of passport. And\nwe knew that. So we told them, oh, yes. Yes. It's true. \"Where are you going?\" \"Oh, we're\ngoing to take the train.\u201d Start looking around. I was shaking. I was afraid. That's a true.\nBecause I didn't want to come in to their hand alive again. So my mind was to escape and let\nthem kill me, but this cousin of mine start, you know, pushing me like coming out from a\ntrance...my, myself...where I am. Who I am. And I didn't say a word. They let us go. Coming\nto the railroad station those two people, Mr. Suppel and his brother...was his brother-in-law\nwent in to buy tickets, but the cashier at the railroad station saw us. He said, \"What you want\nto get tickets for them. There are three of them. You are two. No, you cannot get any\ntickets.\u201d\u201d Why? You gotta pay money. And they came out and we told them to give them as\nmuch as as they asked for. He did give them money and we had a ticket. But luckily enough\nthose people there didn't leave us. They went with us to Warsaw which 1s about 60\nkilometers from there. We traveled. Even they were not allowed to travel at night, but they\nwent with us. We arrived at Warsaw about 8 o'clock, and the train we supposed to take about\nquarter til 12 at night. They went over to buy for us tickets, and the cashier said, \"You must\nbe crazy. You know the law. We can't sell tickets only 25 kilometers from this place. And\nwhen you travel over there, then you buy other tickets for another 25 kilometers.\u201d And I was\nstanding nearby and I took out a bunch of money and I put in the front of the window. \"Oh,\"\nhe said, \"Oh, yes. Yes. I have...uh...all the papers from the...from the ____ (which means\nlike the President from the city)...he had the papers...he wrote on the name whatever we did\ngive to them and we had already papers to go to Czestochowa. Right we said goodbye to\neach other, we left. We took the train. Everyone in a different compartment. We don't know\neach other. In the morning, about 7 o'clock in the morning, 7:30 was still like half dark, we\ncame into this station, Czestochowa. A cousin of mine, he lived before in a section which\nwas mostly...uh...Christian people. And this place wasn't included before in the ghetto, not in\nthe first and not in the second ghetto. Over there, went down, didn't see any Germans around,\nbut Polish police. We took a doreska_ if you know what that is. I don't know how to say that\nin...1n English. What...what I call 1t in English. I never know. In Jewish they call it\nkind of thing, but it is a wagon driven by horses, a special passenger. It took us to this place\nover there where he lived. Over there, we went in. Also in the hiding, it happened a friend of\nmine...very close of mine and ___ he recognized me. We grew up I was in the same house.\nHe didn't mention a word to me. He never saw me in his life like...and I never saw him. But\nwe know it...we know we saw each other. We stayed the whole day hidden. At night through\nthe forest, we went close to the ghetto. We came over to the ghetto. We wanted to go in and\nthe ghetto was surrounded by Polish police, Ukraine, other kind. Was very seldom, in fact\nwas never was somebody wants to get smuggled into the ghetto which normally people\nwanted to get out of the ghetto. So I went into the policeman, Polish policeman, \"We want to\ngo in.\u201d \"You want to go in? You must be crazy. What for you want to go in?\" We took\nout...I don't remember how much money. We give it. He looked away. We sneaked in...in the\nghetto. Was a small ghetto. Beginning of January 1943. People in the ghetto. What can I\ndescribe to you. Very, very poor. Without clothes, without food, without anything. We got in\nover there. I met a friend of mine. Very close friend. We grew up together. Up til today we\nare the closest. He is the first one. \"Abe, what are you doing here? You were sent away.\u201d\n\"Yes, I was sent away. I am here.\u201d Met a cousin of mine ____. \"Where are you coming\nfrom?\" \"Treblinka.\u201d \"What is Treblinka?\" We explained it to him. Went into his room and\nwe Start to explain to him. We start to explain to different kind of people. We start to explain\neven to the Jewish police. Nobody but the closest friends of mine or of theirs...they didn't\nwant to believe it. They said, \"What do you want...why you wanta tell me a story that\nnobody who was transported from here is not anymore alive?\" I said, \"That's right.\u201d \"They\nare.\u201d \"You people must be crazy? And where you come from? A sick house?\" I said, \"No.\u201d\nBut one thing...because we didn't ask them for anything...we didn't ask them for food. We\nhad money. We didn't ask them for clothes. We wore clothes. Until one to another, the whole\nghetto knew. And the ghetto was about 5,000 people, all of them working in ammunition\nfactory outside the ghetto which they took them every morning out from the ghetto and they\ntook them to the factory. Over there they worked by ammunition, and at night they brought\nthem back. We had no...no place of ours. We went...uh...escorted to no place, but we hanged\naround. It was very dangerous to be over there. Young people not doing any work. They\ncame back at night. Everybody noticed, especially me. \"Hey, Bomba, is back. He's from\nTreblinka. He tells horrible stories which is unbelievable.\u201d And we had coming in many\nfriends, asking about their families. One I said, \"They're dead.\u201d \"How can it be? How they\ndie?\" Just asking question, \"How? How long did they go? When they die? And how they\ndied? Who was together with them?\" Whatever we could, we answered him. I could answer\npeople which I was with their family in the same wagon...how they locked it and how they\nlived through the journey to Treblinka and the last time I...when I saw them. It came so far\nthat we were afraid that they're going to kill us because we're bringing in all kind of\ninformation which wasn't good for the Germans, wasn't good for the Ukrainians, even for the\nJewish police wasn't good. We're hiding different places, and then I had some\nfriends...barbers. One of them by the name of Balsome...he was the person...the personal\nbarber of the man which he maked the selection. He was the biggest murderer of the ghetto\nby the name of Degenhof. And Degenhof said to him, \"You know something. I got\ninformation there are people here coming from Treblinka.\u201d He said, \"I do not know,\" which\nhe know very well. He was also our friend, and we worked together as a barber and a few\nbarbers worked with us. He said, \"I don't know anything.\u201d He said, \"Don't tell me. You\nknow.\u201d He said, \"I don't know.\u201d So he said to him, \"You know something. If they\ncould...uh...run away, if they could escape from Treblinka I don't want to bother with them. I\ndon't know anything.\u201d And myself was a barber. I went into the barber shop of the ghetto.\nHad a barber shop working over there about, I would say about 10, 12 barbers. They took me\nin. And I worked and I lived with them together. We ate together. Two women. One was the\nwife of the Balsome which he was the head man, like big leader, and the other was the wife\nof a partner of mine from before the war. They did the cooking, everything. At that time I\nhad money. Naturally, I supported them with everything I could. And they had anything they\nwanted. We did also in that small ghetto organized like a little restaurant where people, you\nknow, cooking, buying this that. What we did....I had a brother-in-law, and this other\ngentleman by the name of Eisner, he had a brother-in-law also. And they were running\naround almost naked without anything. What we did...we took out money and we said, \"Here\nis aroom. You buy all kind of food you can get. So who's gonna buy? Alright. You just do\nwith it whatever you can. Was three of us. Jacob Eisner, and this friend of mine. He just\npassed away not so long ago, Rappaport, Moshe Rappaport, and myself. We went down in\nthe street. People coming from work, hungry, dirty, beaten up. We handed them money. Go\nup over there at the first floor. There is a restaurant. And you get food. We supplied the food\nand we sent them over the customers that the people shouldn't go in like without anything,\nand I tell you this is the honest truth. We did it as long as we could. And we're working over\nthere. We organized also in that small ghetto some kind of resistance against...a few of us.\nOne was also from Treblinka by the name of Eislevich. He came from a town not far away\nfrom_Rabonska. And then it was also in January. They tried to liquidate a number of people,\nlike to take out from five thousand, about thousand of them in to be killed. I was also on that\nplace. That was on the market place. They took out all the Jewish people from that\nmarketplace. They divided them in groups accordingly the place where they worked...40, 50\nin a group, and took out groups and they sent them away. This friend of ours from Treblinka,\nEislevich...he had a gun. I don't know how he got it. He took out the gun and he start to kill\none of the Germans...the Gestapo man by the name of Ron. That was the German's name,\nRon. But he didn't kill him. He didn't even want to kill him. He took apart...apart from the\nclothes. Because of that they took out 27 people. From the people they actually...I don't\nknow they wanted to stay or not, but they took out a group of people...27 of them, and they\nkilled them. Shot them in front of our eyes. And this Eislevich with their boots, with their\nsticks they killed him. And this friend of mine, who was also close with that Eislevich like\nmyself. He had his knife and I had a stick and I said, \"What are you going to do? Don't do it.\nThere will be more killing.\u201d He let it go. And I still sounds the...the voice from one of my\nfriends by the name of _____ when he got killed, before he got killed. He said to his\ngirlfriend, \"Goodbye, Honey Sauce.\u201d After that we went in back to the ghetto. But the\norganizing inside the ghetto didn't stopped. There were other groups. It went out a group to\nthe forest...some boys, younger...little older than myself and for a time we find out they got\nkilled, but not by the Germans. By the Polish ARKA. The ARKA that is they called\nthemselves they fighting for the liberation of Poland. But actually, they were fighting for the\nliberation of the Jews in Poland which they helped the Germans to liquidate the Jewish\npeople. And until June the 22nd, 1946, they find out that a group is organizing a resistance of\nthe ghetto in Czestochowa. They want to know who the leader is. They took out a man, a\nfriend of mine...very close friend of mine by the name of Poltashavichs. He was such a nice\nfellow, such a quiet man. They took him out to an open place and all the Jewish people\naround that place had to stay to look how he's beaten up almost to the end, just to say who is\nthe leader. But he didn't say it. They killed him, and he didn't mention a word. Now, that was\nthe last day in the ghetto. A day after, they start liquidating the small ghetto which at that\ntime was between 4 and 5 thousand Jewish people working in four different factories in\nCzestochowa. One of them was by the name of Hassack _. The other one was Hosa\nHassack, Bata, and there was one Slavanka where people worked. The biggest amount of\npeople they worked on ______ which was almost about 3 thousand of them. And I was\nworking was in this same place here after the liquidation of the ghetto. By liquidating the\nghetto, there was a lot of people which they belonged to uprising group, and many of them\ndigged holes, bunkers to be hidden and also I was in...I was involved with a group which we\ndigged a bunker, a big bunker...a bunker about 50, 60 people in it. We had inside food for 2\nyears hidden. We had beds in the bunker. We had everything you wanta mention. And also\nwe digged a way to go through the ghetto into the other side, to the Christian side. Going in\nthrough that we had to go in to a big pile of garbage. Under that garbage, we had hidden a\ntiny little door from the top to go into that. At that time I knew already my wife...I met her\nthere after I got back from the Treblinka...something like that I met her, and I said, \"Regina, I\nhave a place.\u201d We went over there...",
        "Q: Do you mean the woman who later became your wife?",
        "A: Became my wife. Yes. Regina.",
        "Q:",
        "A: _____ Regina. And I'm going over to that place. I'm opening up this and she said, \"I won't go\nin. If you want, you go in. I don't want to go in.\u201d I said, \"If you're not going in, I'm not going\nin either.\u201d What it happened, people went in and they with dynamite they destroyed the\nwhole land of that strip about 6, 7 houses. Took out 3, 4...3 stories, 4 stories, 2 stories and all\nthe people got killed. The rest of the people the Judenrat and most of the police they took to\nthe cemetery and they killed them. Before that it happened...I got to mention it. Before that it\nwas on Purim, 1943, the guard came over and he said to the Judenrat before...just shortly\nbefore that, because that what happened in June and Purim was in the end of March. He said,\n\"We got a contract with the British government. We're going to release part of you and\nthey're going to release some of our soldiers which they are under the British. Some are\ndoctors, engineers, rich people, electricians, and all kind. By among they took 152 people.\nWe will give you passports. We will transfer you to Palestine. Everyone was happy. From\nthem gonna give all they have, more than they had to be included in that group. One of\nthem...a doctor, Doctor Connon, with his wife. An elderly man, a doctor, he fell asleep. He\ndidn't go. What do you think they did to that group? They took all those girls, about 150\npeople into the cemetery and they killed them. And this doctor, because he fell asleep with\nhis wife, was missing. And then they liquidated the ghetto and they got rid of those houses\nwith the people they were hidden in it. They took us to the labor camp...to the...1n\nCzestochowa ____. Over there, we worked there from the end of June 1943 until the\nliberation. The 16th of January 1945 we were liberated through the Russian troops. And\nfrom over there... worked there in my trade. Only my trade a working, as a barber. They\nneeded barbers over there, so I worked over there. I was very... was almost fluently in\nthe...in the German language, writing, and also in speaking it. I never wanted to be any of\nthis big people. I was plain working man. As a matter of fact, the director of this factory, it\nhappened that this one of humanbeing I would call from the German government...a name by\nDirector Litt_He was in the parliament and he was also from the family of Franz. He took\nthe people and he said, \"This is your home. You're gonna stay here as long as you will be\nalive. You're gonna be...you're not going back anymore to that ghetto.\u201d At that time I was...I\nwas still in the ghetto, but when I came over he called, \"Who knows German?\" I said, \"I\nknow German.\u201d \"You're going to be the foreman of the barbers.\u201d I said, \"No, There's an\nelderly man. I respected him very, very by the name of Goldberg. He was in our city a\nlegislature, and he was a big man. I said, \"The job goes to him.\u201d And I...and I worked as a\nbarber until almost the end of it, when they start in 1945 when the front with the Russians\ncame closer, they start to liquidate that factory too where we worked. They took away every\nday people. And I said to myself and also to a few friends, \"I am not going anymore into a\ncattle train. I know where this thing goes. If anything happens, they're going to take me I'm\ngonna escape.\u201d And I even said to Regina, \"Don't go after me. You don't know me any more.\nI don't know you any more. Just you wait. If I go, I will escape. I will not go in the wagons.\nIf they kill me, I will not go in the wagons.\u201d At day time, they took out...a day before, over\n2,000 women. Day after, they took out a thousand men, and they send them...the women\nthey send to Ravensbruck, Bergen-Belsen. The men they sent to Buchenwald. I didn't go\nwith that group. And the afternoon, seeing what's going on over there, that the Germans are\ngetting nervous. Some of them did try to escape, and I tried to go through the wires. So one\nof the Ukrainians said, \"Look, don't do that.\u201d The voice was different than a day before. He\nbegged us...not he ordered us, but he begged us that we shouldn't escape now. Later it was\ngonna get dark. What happened? We saw...myself and some other of them...some of the\nGermans, they were carrying bombs to blow up the factory with the people, but it was so\nfast. I wasn't there already. I went outside by myself. Then it happened that I...there was too\nmany Germans. I couldn't go through. I came back and I said to Regina, \"This time, you're\ngoing with me.\u201d I took her out the wires. We went around. Imagine that I...I would say I was\nalmost like born in the city, and I didn't know where to go. The place where I wanted to go\ncouldn't go through. It was full of Germans. On the other side I wanted to go to the old town\nof the city. Everything inside was burning. Well, I decided to go a different way, just to go\nnear that place. I had a friend of mine, a Christian friend. I had many, many of them before\nthe war, by the name of Berenski, Adolph Berenski. Very, highly educated man. And I tried\nto go...to get to him, but wherever I went I couldn't get through. And there's another story\nwith him either. It is worthwhile mentioning it. This friend of mine, when I got back from\nTreblinka, he had a factory. He had a big factory. A rich man, rich boy. He was married. A\nrich boy, fine educated. He wanted to divide a part of the factory and to make a small room\ninto...put me in that part. Me, the two friends of mine from Treblinka and Regina and some\nof...one friend...one of our other friend had a girl or so. He said, \"I have everything ready. I\njust want you to come over there.\u201d I don't know. I had no feeling for it. I had no heart to do\nit. In my heart, even we grew up together I didn't trust him. Don't ask me why. I don't know\nwhy. And I didn't go. Now listen carefully to it. He did a lot of for some of his friends,\nJewish people. He sent in food. He sent in clothes to the concentration camp where we were\nand he helped them a lot. After the liberation I found out a story, an unbelievable story. One\nof his girlfriend, which was a friend of mine. In fact she is now...she's living now. I just saw\nher not so long ago. He did a lot for her and for her sister and some of the family. He had a\ngirlfriend, a Christian girlfriend. You know after going around a time with her, it happened\nshe got pregnant. A Christian girl got pregnant. Why I'm telling you this story 1s she...this\ngirl, she was with a sister. They had two sisters, Jewish sisters hidden in their house. He\nknew about it, but he wouldn't believe it. When he ordered her to get rid of the pregnancy\nand he didn't want to marry her, he went to the Gestapo and to the other...and he told them\nthat those two sisters had hidden two girls in their bunker. They took them out and they\nkilled them, and the two sisters...they took away. They send them to Ravensbruck. This girl\ngot rid of the pregnancy and she was working in the Ravensbruck for a time. She was\nliberated. She got back to Czestochowa, and he was in the city already a big man. Everybody\nknew him. Nice, fine man. Nobody knew about...knows about his story. When she got back,\nshe went to the...Polish police at that time, and she told them the story. And they called them\nin. \"Is that this?\" He said, \"Yes, it's true.\u201d They jailed him, and he got 15 years in jail. After\nliving in jail or a year, a little more than a year, he committed suicide. That's the man I didn't\ntrust him. I didn't go to him. And something...something 1s luck. We had all kind of people.\nWe had in the ghetto even Jewish people...I don't have to tell you, if you are in this\nkind...they working...they were working against the Jewish people. _ I'm sorry to say that\nthis true. And that happened. It happened in our...in our town. We had a few men. I don't\nhave to mention the names. If you want I could mention it. Yes? I don't think so which is\nvery...because we are Jewish people, we shouldn't tell stories like that. But for the, you\nknow, documentary and for the history, everything has to be open. One of them was a\nRosenberg. He was a policeman. The other one was by the name of Slemmer. There were\ntwo brothers. One of them was involved. The other wasn't involved. Was a barber. Nice man.\nBut because he was with his brother all the time, take him also. One of them was a baker. He\nwas head man before the war from the bakers, even he could write and read. Well, he got\nrich. His really name...they call him Kollibike. That's how they called him. And there were\ntwo more boys. I don't want to mention the names because their two brothers are alive, and\nI'm close with them. They were working against. What that mean against? They organized a\ngroup from those...one of them, the Kollibike, and that policeman, Roseberg, he worked with\nthe German together. Announced it for the Germans, whatever was going on, who is\norganizing an escape, who is organizing an uprising. We find that out. And in our ghetto, we\nhave a group of people...we took not all at one time...one everyone...a wife to a house...it was\nnot far from my house. Over there we had lawyers, real lawyers. We had also a prosecutor.\nWe had judges, real judges before the war. It was a trial. They tried him for treason against\nthe Jewish people, and we decided death penalty. And death penalty was done on the spot.\nOn the spot and in a bottle, wrote down the whole story, buried the bottle. And we did that\nwith him and the other one. The other group of four people, they didn't do that. They didn't\nwork together with the Germans, but what they did is they organized themselves a little\ngroup and they went in the name of the partisans to the people...Jewish people which they\nknew they had money, hidden money. We offered the partisan. We don't want money and\nthis and that and in the meantime, they grabbed the money and spent the money, all kind of\nthing. And people ___ and they didn't like it. And they decided to get rid of them, and they\ngot rid of them. That was going on and on. And barely liquidation...and I tell you liquidation\nwas very horrible because there were old people in bunkers hidden all the time. There were\nyoung people and people that went to work and they had their parents in the bunkers. People\nwent to work and they had their children in the bunkers and all of a sudden, you know, you\ncannot go back. And there were bunkers, some of them which because of children they were\ncrying and other thing. They find out about it, and all the people got killed. And that is\nalmost til the end of this... Now I want... wanta go back to the time in Treblinka. I didn't\nmention that, but I have to mention it. When I worked in the gas chamber, that is very, very\nimportant voice to me. By cutting a woman's hair, I met a girl over there. What can I tell\nyou? Miss America 1s a beast according to this girl. A beauty. A beauty from beauty land.\nWhile cutting her hair, she looks at me she says, \"Look, I see you are a young man. Do\nsomething that you should be able to escape and go over...tell the people what is happening\nhere. Especially, go. Maybe my father is alive. I know he 1s alive because he was a\npharmacist in a little town.\u201d I said to her, \"Look, what are you trying to do? Can I escape\nfrom death?\" She insisted, she said, my name 1s Salli Levinson . I am from a little town by\nthe name of Koanst in Poland. My father is the head man from the Judenrat. Now he is a\npharmacist and tell what is going on what happened to me. And you know something,\nbehind my mind I had all the time in me and in a little way that pushed me a little bit because\nof her words to do it. Over there 1n that...in that little ___. Oh, I tell you...I tell you the\nreaction with this with other people, they came in. Coming in to the gas chamber, the woman\nmostly...the men we didn't do. We didn't cut their hair. Only women. But when they came in\nthey people from Poland...from what city they come forth doesn't matter,..about 50, 60\npercent they knew already they're not going to take showers. They're going to be gassed.\nThey knew it. There wasn't any...any outcry. There wasn't any panic. They were I would say\nreleased from their pain, from their going through what they went through all the time until\nto the end of their life. But most what it happened when we have transports from other part\nof Europe, like from Czechoslovakia, from...from Austria, from Germany, from Yugoslavia,\nthose people they didn't know. Until going in to the gas chamber, they couldn't believe that 1s\ntheir last wake. First thing, they didn't come by cattle train. They came in..1n the big wagons,\nthe pullman wagons and they were sitting in comfortable. Some of them were playing cards.\nSome of they...some of them, you know, they were having a good time. At the railroad stops,\nthey could walk out the trains to go over to the places where they could buy coffee, drinks,\nother things, and go in back to the train. When they came in and I remember at one time, I\nhappened I went into the train in Treblinka like that. And told the people to go out. One of\nthe...was from the Germany, they came. He had a fight with those people. He wanted to take\nhis umbrella with him. He wouldn't...he wouldn't go with umbrella, and... Anyway, we\ncrossed. I told him the way you go you don't need anymore umbrella. Well, it didn't come to\nhis mind. Those were the people they didn't believe. Absolutely. But the people from Poland,\naround Poland. They all...they believers. Now one particular transport I will tell you. Come\nto Treblinka from a little village not far away, about 12 kilometer away. This time when it\nwas Poland I...1 went over there. They came in not by train, not by wagon, but Ukrainian and\nthe German took him by foot. It was some kind of holiday. Don't remember what kind it was\nexactly. They went in...covered head, and calling up the out-cries,___\u2014_, and they went\ninto the gas chamber at that time when outside we didn't work. It was long time we didn't\nwork. What was on? This...uh...commandant or was commandant...lager,____. He was a\nsportsman. He organized a box match. Fighters, really fighters. We had a man. He was in his\nclass,___ in Poland. You heard of thing. Now there was another...another one from\nWarsaw and this one came from the...from the...from jail. He was not kosher man. Even in\nTreblinka was... Yomkuller they called. They had a fight. A regular fight. Here you gotta\nfight. You got entertainment and 10 feet away a bunch of people I would say maybe 200,\n250 men, woman, children walking into the gas chamber. If we could sit 2 hours more...it's\nvery hard to describe and to tell every second, every minute and every hour or day what was\ngoing on in Treblinka. Treblinka wasn't a camp for work. It wasn't anything. Only what we\npeople did, we worked by dead people. And that was going on until the uprising in\nTreblinka. The uprising I wasn't there. I know a lot about it. I was almost involved about it. I\nknow exactly how it happened. I know who was involved. The uprising was in August 1943\nwhere the camp was liquidated. Everything was liquidated and nothing 1s showing over\nthere, besides what they put up...the Polish government put up just symbol stones. And\ncoming over there that I had to mention that because this is the first time...and I don't know\nI'm gonna go again. I was there a couple months ago. At that place when I went in with all\nmy family, and I looked at the place and had arguments this and this, this and that. I said,\n\"No, this place was only a Jewish place. If you say Auschwitz, if you say Buchenwald,\nDachau, there were other nations which they were gassed too. I cannot deny this. But this\nplace in Treblinka was strictly for Jewish people. Besides 3 or 4 wagons, not trains, but\nwagons shipped...ships, they took them in and they gassed them together with the Jewish\npeople. Not any other one. If somebody came in, let's say what it was a Aktion against\npeople, and they took him into the wagon and someone had business in the ghetto at the\nsame time he didn't know because nobody knew, it could happen, 1, 5...little more, maybe a\nlittle less got in in the trap and they couldn't get out...go out for no money at all because\nwhoever was in Treblinka, there was no way out. Whatever they saw, they had to finish them\nup. So it could be. Beside that, there was no other camp which was strictly Jewish people.\nNow also for the story, if you say mostly...",

        "Q: Tell me about...very briefly, about liberation and Czestochowa and what you and your wife\ndid afterwards.",
        "A: Oh, liberation in Czestochowa going. We were liberated ourselves, January 16. Going out\nfrom there we had no place where to go. Luckily we went in at the night before the...we were\nliberated...that I escaped from over there with my wife, went into a Polish house, and the\nfight was going on. We pretended we were Christian which I couldn't. My face has a good\nface. I mean for _____. And we stayed in their house. In the morning, one woman came in.\nShe said, \"So many people is outside. I think that concentration camp people 1s all outside.\u201d\nWhen my wife heard this and I did also she said to me in Yiddish because she did...the\nwoman where we were 1n that place and there were so more friends, neighbors, they didn't\nknow that. She said in Yiddish, \"Come.\u201d I go out and I see. So I went over there and I went\nto that friend of mine which I mentioned before, Adolf Berenski. I was in his house for\nawhile, then I met another Pollack. He said, \"Abe, you gotta come to me.\u201d I went over there\nto him. I was in his house for two days I think and then a rumor what's going on that the\nGerman is coming back. So what he did he said, \"Oh, Come here. __. So I went to other\nfriends. They want...I was in Treblinka with them. I went over there to them and we stayed\nfor awhile. Until we start to get together but I don't want to be too long in my home town. I\nwent back to that place, Boyden-Obersladzen, met some other friends, and I met another\nfriend from Treblinka by the name of Borax, Gustaf Borax. Maybe you heard that name.\nHe's now an elderly man. He's about 90 years old at least. Lhear he lives Haifa. I met him.\nWe opened up a barber shop in...over there and we had a very...that was in beginning of\nMarch 1945. We had a nice apartment from the Germans. The apartments were empty\nbecause they...they run away. They were afraid for the Russians. Most of them they went on\nthe...on the west side, because they wanted to be behind American or English instead of the\nRussian. Any way it happened it didn't took too long, just across my barber shop was a\njewelry store. A man, their brother, their two sons...staying in the barber shop working over\nsomething...shots across the street came in from the ARKA. They killed the son and the\nfather. The same day I came home and I said to the children, \"Pack whatever you got and\nthat's last time we're going to see _.\u201d The following day we left and we went to the border\ntown of Germany. I had papers over there ready Germany. We went through Czechoslovakia\ninto Germany. And we stayed one time in Bamberg and then we went to a little place in near\nRegensburg by the name of Fogenstein. I had over there also to do. In that...in that little\nFogenstein...we came in over there. We were a handful of people. We were two or three\nwomen, about 8 men, 8 or 9 men. I was the one...I spoke German, so it's going into the\nBergenmeister which you call mayor of that little town. The whole population was about 2\nthousand. We went over there because over there we could get food. And in a big town like\nin Bamberg, it was very hard. And we had a little...not...we had a little fight. We were people\nfrom concentration camp. The governor...the American governor, he said that we have a\nright to get the same thing what the German people. We don't have to stand in a line behind\ntwo thousand people. We're sick people, suffered, so whenever we came...and altogether we\nwere Il people, so the mayor said, \"No, you have to stand in line just like anybody else.\u201d And\nhe was...find out, a big Nazi. And I was with a friend of mine. He raised a chair to hit him\nover the head. Yes. And I hit him once. I never in my life I never had a fight. I was...I wasn't\na youngster running around, never fight, nothing. This thing I never had. But I hit him once.",
        "Q: You hit the mayor?",
        "A: Yes. I hit him once in the nose and all the thing was...was like coming off. And all what\nhappened...oh, a big thing in __, the little town of Germany.

So he said, \"I'm gonna send\nfor the...for the mayor. Mayor came over with the secretary. He said, \"Look, you are from\nthe Jewish people. He is from the German people. Shake hands. Let's fight this.\u201d I said, \"We\nJewish people have suffered enough.\u201d \"Okay. Okay, I ready for it.\u201d He said, \"No, he doesn't\nwant. He want us in jail, and he is going to try us and we have to be in jail.\u201d So this governor\nsaid, \"Okay. In the meantime, don't touch these two men. Let them go home.\u201d We went\nhome. It passed about a week, maybe 10 days...all of a sudden I'm going down in the\nmorning. What I see? I see about 100, 150 soldiers, American soldiers, surrounded the whole\nhouse of that mayor. You know what had happened? They took him away. Some of his\nfriends, they knew that he was a SS man in the Panzer Brigade. And they took him away. He\nwas in jail for 6 months...for 6 years.

        "A: I was born in a little place. It was Germany at that time. Boyden-Oberslazen, but when I was\na little kid...I don't even remember anything. My father he comes from a...a city by the name\nof Czestochowa. And they moved to Czestochowa. I was brought up over there. I was raised\nover there, went to school, and I lived over there until the last days of the liquidation of the\nJewish population in Czestochowa.",
        "A: My childhood was not a rosy one. I come from poor parents. What do you mean, poor\nparents? In..in Poland, I would say about 70 percent, maybe more than 70 percent of the\npopulation were poor. Poor, I mean poor. Actually, they had no food on the table. And to get\na job was very, very hard, especially for the Jewish people. Jewish people were not\nemployed by the government, not by the legislature. Their trade was tailor, shoemaker, some\nof them a barber, hatmaker. Even in factory, in Jewish factory where the people they owned\nthe factory, also Jews, they didn't want to employ Jewish people. Maybe there's some reason,\nmaybe not. Some of them they didn't want to have the sin on their own conscious because he\nhas to work on Saturday. So the best thing for them was not to employ them. So and actually,\nit was very, very hard...the upbringing. In my house, my father he married off my mother. He\nwas married. His wife____ passed away. He had a son and a daughter. I have never seen\nthem. When my father married my mother, my brother left for Paris. After that when I was\nabout 9 months old, my sister left, also for Paris. They lived over there, married, had\nchildren, and we remained in the city of Czestochowa. Why I knew? Because after I got a\nlittle older, I wrote letters to them. I knew I have a brother and sister over there. Besides\nthem, my mother had...had me count three brothers and two little girls. The two little girls\npassed away when they were...one of them was about a year old. Another one was about\nthree years old. The main reason of it, there was no food. There was no milk 1n the house.\nThere was nothing in the house. Why I think that was the reason, I remember they'd be sick\nor other thing. My mother tried to help my father whatever she could, but there was no work.\nOn one job, 50 people grabbed it. And that was going on until I, myself and my brother got a\nlittle bit older. My brother went to work. He started to work by a relative of ours, shoemaker,\nwhich he was a good one. Even by having a trade was a difference between a good and a bad\none. So he was working, helping out. And then by the age of 12...when I was 12 years old I\ncouldn't go to learn a trade. I got myself a job in a factory by making dolls. They had\nsomebody over there, liked me, took me in when I was 12 years old. I worked there for 2 and\na half years old and then my mother decide and myself that's not a trade for a young man.\nGotta have a real trade. What's the real trade? I had a cousin of mine, he had a barber shop.\nIn my town, that's considered as a good trade. Was nice dressed, mixed with nice people, all\nkind of people they came in, and he took me in to learn. Learning time was 3 years for\nnothing. Alright, I got a few pennies like you call it here for tips, other things you know.\n_And this I brought into the house. That was after those two kids passed away. And there was\na little boy that time. It was about 3 years old. And that's how we got together. We provided\nfor the house. My mother was...I would say not in a bad condition, because food, clothes,\neven had electric which for that time, it was a big thing. We had a radio in the house. You\nknow, we didn't spend the money like the kids today, throwing it away, because every penny\nwe maked we brought to the house, needed. And that's how we grew up until my brother got\nmarried. I myself tried to go to school. I went into a school after the hours of work and I\nfinished it. It's one of the finest schools. And besides that I was very active in an\norganization. I was active in the Zionist organization...uh...called the ___, The Right One,\nBen-Gurion's party. I was in the youth group. I was the leader also with them. I remember I\nled a branch of girls, about 20 some girls....also not young ones, 18, 19 years old in which I\nwas myself at that same age. Was the ___ branch. You know about the ___. And beside\nthat I was very much in love with books. Up to date, I cannot eat, I cannot go to sleep. I got\nto have a book. That's my thing. And real I learned by myself. I would say like self\neducation.",

And\nwe're going around and we started, you know, to save for the time when we get married to\nbuy some stuff. We didn't have any money. It wasn't like...1t wasn't like here. You want this\nand that. And we saved up until the time came in 1939. And that was the bitter time had\ncome. Everything was separated. The German came into the town on a Friday morning,\nSeptember, the Ist, the war started. Our town was almost on the border with the German,\nwas 4, 5 kilometers which is about 3 miles from the border. In the morning, they were\nalready in the city. So we lived...separated. My brother was living with his wife. He had a\nson about 4 years old, and I was living with my mother and my younger brother and my\ngirlfriend was with her parents. Different place! To tell you the story how it was, you know,\nthe first thing when the...when the German came in, it was not a ball. First thing, they came\nin on a Friday, I mentioned it. Friday, it was quiet. At the beginning of the war, everybody\nstart running. We did to. We ran about 40 kilometers, walking. Me, my wife...not my wife, I\nmean my mother, my little brother, also my girlfriend was with me. And then we decided\nwhere will we camp? The Germans were there already. So we...where we going to hang\naround? Decided to go back. Went back...came back to the same apartment. Monday\nmorning, like a magic thing happened. The Germans were all over the place. Everybody out\nof the house. And they start dragging the men, just the men, to public places, like school,\nsynagogue, churches and open place on the market. We were a couple of days and but seeing\nthat stuff, shooting, killing some people, a lot of people. Matter of fact a friend of mine\nwhich was together with me in Treblinka by the name of Rappaport, Moshe. His father was\nkilled the first one. First ____ from Czestochowa. His name was Rappaport, Lazer\nRappaport... And a lot of them. We...we were over there about 3 days. They took away\ncouple of thousand people and the rest of them they sent back home.",
        "A: What...what was like? I'll tell you what...excuse me. I'll tell you what was like. You come\ninto the house. Imagine yourself. You were in my shoes. Somebody comes in without\nanything, without any reason. Out from the house. Not allowed to take water, not allowed to\ntake bread...bread, not allowed to take anything. And in the street. In the street with guns,\nthey start running after you until...until you got to the place. I myself...they took me into a\nchurch. The church was the...the holy...the name was the Holy Family CHurch. We had a big\nchurch. We had a very big church. And we went over there 1n that church. They weren't...the\npeople they couldn't get so fast in in the back of the church. They got killed in the front going\nin through the door. And they killed a lot of people that way. We were there. There was no\nfood. There was no water. There was no places, you know, for the humanbeing with ___.\nWe were over there, a priest. I'm gonna mention him. His name was ___.. He was one of\nthe finest gentlemen of the Catholic priest I have ever met. He said to us, \"Children, never\nmind you're without any church. You do whatever you can. You...this place or that thing, as\na...you know, and the other place. He tried to bring in water for us. And really, I admired him\nas a gentlemen. He knew that we are Jews which was also some Christian people living in\nthose neighbors, mostly they took his from the Jewish neighbor. Let's say...I would say...I\ndon't know about Washington...Let's say when you this side, this that, that kind of a neighbor\nthey took. We're there for 3 days, came out from over there, went back home. Thank God,\neverybody's fine. My brother was in a different place. He also came home. I was working in\na barber shop about when I came to the age 17, 18, my boss passed away. His wife passed\naway, and the family...they decided to sell the shop to me because I was working there. I was\nworking there for about 4 years. And was 20 years I bought that shop. Not the money that I\nhad. I had no money, but there was another barber which he had a little bit of money. He\ncame in with me as a partner, and we owned that shop from I would say 37, 38 until 1942 we\nwere partners. A very wonderful man as a partner. Very wonderful man. And that's how we\nlived. Every one...every barber had a quota for taking care of the Jewish people...people they\nworked for the government. They worked for the Judenrat, so we had a quota about a week,\n30, 35 people to shave them, to cut hair without money. We did it. So we were not obligated\nto go dig ditches or other thing for the German. And for us that was good thing. At least we\nwere employed. And we had a card that we...uh...that we are not obligated. And that what\nwas going on until May 41. May 41, they decided to make a ghetto. So that call in the\nlanguage of our town, it calls the big ghetto. Why the big ghetto? Because was many streets\nincluded in the ghetto. Also the streets were more wealthy people lived, not just the\nneighborhood where the poor people lived, also where... And from that ghetto nobody could\nleave. Nobody could go in like Catholic people. Situation was going from bad to worst. It\nwas impossible to get along. For instance, before 1939 a loaf of bread, in Poland was a loaf\nof bread 5 pounds. The price of 1t was 50 cents. During 1941, the price of it was already 15\nslotas. In my trade where the price of getting a hair cut was 50 cents, getting a shave 25\ncents, the price didn't go up. Instead to get from a customer one loaf of bread, we had to do\nmore than 15 customers for the same thing. Well, naturally was the situation was very bad.\nBut we lived and some kind of hope it's gonna end. One day it's gonna end. Everybody\nknows that, this...that. We're gonna pray. It's gonna end. It didn't end. That was going on\nfrom May 41 until September the 22nd, 1942.",
        "A: Yes. I got married in 1940. I got married 1940 because we couldn't go from one place to the\nother. Our dating...the time...we were almost 7 years together, so we decided to get married\nand to live together. We got married. Wasn't a marriage... marriage like they make it now,\nbut we married off. Two years after that, my wife she got pregnant and we had a son. Was\nborn September the 31st, 1942. That is almost 20 days...not 20...little bit...only 20 days...little\nover 20 days when it started the liquidation of the Jewish people in Czestochowa. But\nbetween 41 May - September 42, they took out a lot of people. They send them...they put\nthem places, especially young people. They sent them to work which most of them did not\nreturn and it was not always in that big ghetto. But we could live with communicate also\nwith the outside people, with the...with the Polish people. Some of them, you know, not the\nGerman...they didn't look, they looked away they didn't see it, they could bring in some stuff.\nBut when the liquidation started on September the 22nd, it was exactly a day after Yom\nKippur in 1942. At Yom Kippur 1942, we were at the prayer house and people came in from\nwork because people they had to work even on Yom Kippur. They said at the station, the\nrailroad station, there is a lot of cattle trains and there are Ukrainians around. We heard the\nword Ukrainians, we know something it's going to happen. So the prayer was interrupted.\nWe seen going here and there, looking what's going to be, where we're going to go. We\nknow already that they're going to take us away. They're going to take us somewhere.\nMiddle of the night, around 12, | o'clock, all of a sudden, all the lights were on, which\nnormally since 1939 was not allowed to have any light in city or in apartment and here the\nlights...lit lamps were on bright, shining. Four o'clock in the morning, the Germans started to\ntake out the Jewish people. They started first the poorest neighborhood where the poor\npeople lived. That was on September, the 23rd, 1942. I was living with my wife, my mother,\nmy little brother, child of mine in that poor stretch called ___, which was the poorest\nneighborhood. They took us out to the transport...taking out you know you take people they\ntransport who wasn't fast enough got killed and left on the road. We were the lucky ones. We\nmaked to the transport. When we came to the railroad station and there was over there I\nwould say thousands of people. Thousands and thousands of people! They had, accordingly\nthat I know, over 60 wagons, cattle wagons. Each one contained over a hundred people.\nChildren were not counted because the children...",
        "A: As of...as of...as of 39?",
        "A: Oh. Alright. Yes. So when we were taken out from the house, they took us to the railroad\nstation. And on both sides there were German Ukrainian. Whoever couldn't walk that fast,\nthey got rid of him by killing. So we went in to the railroad station. It was not the general\nrailroad station. It was the railroad station for cattle. And over there, they pushed in people.\nThey threw in children, one on top of the other until they're loaded. Those ones...over 60\nwagons. Myself and my wife, the kid, my mother, and the little brother, we couldn't go in. It\nwas about 2,000 more people. They couldn't go in because they had too many people already\nin the wagons so they decided to send in...send us back home. Now this was unbelievable a\nstory. All of a sudden, people start to panic. People start to dance. Happened? They were the\nlucky ones. They got their amount what they need to be taking out from the ghetto, and the\nrest they will not touch anymore. The people they were together, the families were together,\nthey were very happy because nobody was missing between them. People were taking away\nlike brothers or sisters or parents...1f somebody remained of them, there was crying going on\nin the city. We were sent home. We were sent home, but one thing whoever could\nunderstand the situation was not finished. They didn't take away the Germans. They didn't\ntake away the Ukrainians, and the light was still on for day and night. So we know\nsomething is going to happen to us again. We didn't have to wait too long because on the\n25th, 4 days after the first transport, the same thing was going on again. September, the 25th,\n1942, which on the Jewish calendar was____, again they took us out. Now this time we\ndidn't go straight to the railroad station to be sent off. We went to the market which over\nthere the German the head man from the Gestapo was the man over there by the name of\nDegenhof, he was the leader from them. He was the murderer of the...not only this city, but\nmore cities. And that was...when he decided who should live and who should die. With the\npoint of the finger, he said this way, the other way. A little bit younger, not too many asking\nquestions, \"What is your trade?\" Somebody had a trade like electro mechanic, which was\nvery few people in our town, or engineering, other thing, to the right. Ninety five percent of\nthe people which they took out from the houses, he pointed to the left which means to the\ntransport. But before that, it is another thing I have to mention. People were running around\ncrazy, starting to get a paper from the Judenrat and also from the Germans that...all kind of\npaper: red, green, with a stamp, without a stamp and everybody tried to do the best even\nwith money to get the right paper. But nobody know what the right paper was. Each one was\nhappy because he's got the right paper. Coming in to that place where he decided... Degenhof\ndecided who's going to go right, who's going to go left, the paper was not important. It was\njust worthless. They took the paper, tear it up. So I was with my mother and the kid, my wife\nand my brother, and it was most of my family who went to the left to the transport. Went in\nto the transport where the cattle transport they had, and they took us in to the wagon. That\nwas the last time I saw the city of Czestochowa before I came back from Treblinka. Now to\ntell you a story in that cattle train, I don't know how to start and I don't know how to end\nbecause it was like living through a whole life in that thing. First thing, people one on top of\nthe other. You couldn't stand straight. You couldn't bend. You couldn't sit down. It was just\nlike one on top of the other. They took us 6 o'clock in the morning into that train. We were\nover there until about finished it loaded with all of us 2 hours maybe, more than that. Then\nthey took us around back to the main station and over there we were waiting a time. Across\nthe railroad station, there was another train that passengers...Polish people, they could go.\nThey could ride, handle anything they wanted. When we stood each other, happened I was\nthe lucky one...I was near a little window, where was with wire closed around that people\nshouldn't be able to escape. I looked through. Most of the people what they did to us, they\nspit on us. It happened one girl I know her. She worked for a Jewish family from my...not the\nhouse where I lived but house where I had my barber shop. When she saw me she said, \"Oh,\nyou are too here?\" And in a way, she started crying. But more than 90 percent of the\npassengers in the other side of the train, they spit on us. And so we start rolling...start rolling\nto went nobody knew where we're going. In the middle of the night, was already about 18\nhours in the train, we came to a side station which they pointed out this was Warsaw. Stood\nover there for awhile and inside that train, with God's help, it was hot like Hell and that was\nalmost the end of September where usually in Poland, end of September is nice and cool. But\nat that time, just God helped them, not us. After about 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock start rolling\nagain and we went through wilderness and all kind of thing. We came to a halt. I looked out\nand I see a sign which didn't mean nothing to me. The sign was Treblinka. Today, everybody\nalmost knows what that word means. At that time was just a name, not a...a little bit...a tiny\nlittle...maybe...maybe it was over there 40 families altogether, all waiting with them. Stayed\nlooking out the window. More things came. From other parts of the country. They went in,\nafter about 2 hours they came out. And all the trains empty. Another train also...over 60\ntrains with the town people, they came in. Went in, disappeared, 2 hours came back. And\nnow was the time our train start rolling and we went in. Gate opened up, rolled 1n to the\ncamp of Treblinka. 10 men over there. We got in over there. The trains didn't go in like, you\nknow, the first goes in. The engineer takes a train, but backwards because the engineer and\nthe people they're working in the locomotive of the train, they shouldn't know what's going\non over there. They were not supposed to...to see what is going on. That's why the pushed in\nthe end of the train. And we went in. Out! Started yelling, \"Out.\u201d It opened up. I don't know\nhow many dead ones was a...in the train because nobody counted we had in our train. We\nhad on out...men on the right side at the open telling...woman at the left side at the barracks.\nWe didn't know what it is. And we didn't believe something what's going wrong. I know\nsomething is not usually that this is the last time we see each other. My wife, the kid and my\nmother went in to that left side. I my...mine little brother was at that time was 13 years old.\nAnd some of the Germans, Ukrainian and also the Jewish from the red kommando. \"Take off\nyour clothes.\u201d Took off the clothes. Start taking off the clothes. All the people did. But\nmyself...I don't know what it happened. A man...a Jewish man which he had a band, a red\nband, what called a red kommando went through...he recognized someone which was near\nme and he said, \"What are you doing here?\" \"You see what I'm doing here.\u201d So he said to\nhim, \"We need a few people. Go to the side.\u201d \"You need more?\" \"Yes, need more.\u201d They\ntook out about 16, 17 people. I was between them. Now this man which he recognized, he\nwas married to a cousin of mine. They took out his brother-in-laws, three of them; myself;\nmy little brother they couldn't take out because was a kid, 13 years old. And a few more\nstayed on the side. We didn't see. People went in through the gate. Now we know what the\ngate was. It was the way to the gas chamber and we have never see them again. That was the\nfirst hour we came in. After that, we...the people, 18 or 16 people...more people came in\nfrom the...working people what they worked already before in the gas chamber, we had a\norder to clean up the place. Now clean up the place is not something you can take it clean. It\nwas horrible. But in 5, 10 minutes this place had to look spotless. And it looked spotless.\nLike there was never nobody on the place. So the next transport when it comes in, they\nshouldn't see what's going on.",
        "A: We were cleaning up in the outside. Tell you what mean cleaning up. Taking away all the\nclothes to those places where the clothes were. Now, not only the clothes, all the papers, all\nthe money, all the...the...whatever somebody had with him. And they had a lot of things with\nthem. Pots and pans they had with them. Other things they had with them. We cleaned that\nup. Still didn't know what's going on until this guy with the red bands, when we asked him\nwhat's happened to them? He said, \"Be happy we're here because they're finished.\u201d At night\nwhen they took us into the barrack...the barrack was near, I was just about... would say 50\nmeters from the gate to the gas chamber. It was at the same place where the people\nundressed themselves. The men undressed themselves, there was a well....just take out\nwhatever... And over there we had the barrack we went to live in. Why I mention the well,\nbecause I tell you what the well was. People they knew already, not from the beginning like\nfrom Warsaw they transport...they started on the 22nd of July 1942, so people they know\nalready what Treblinka 1s. That is not a working camp. That is not a concentration camp.\nThat is extermination camp. From there nobody goes out alive. The minute when they came\nin, we find over there...took out from over there from that well, over 50 people. They jumped\nin. Instead to go into the gas chamber, they just jumped into the well.",
        "A: The well. Yes. They drowned themselves. Took them out and that water we used to drink.\nNobody got sick. Nothing happened. At night, couldn't sleep. Some of us which were...there\nwere religious people and they found out that their parents or their wife or their children\nwere killed which they didn't take out...people...where they're people which they have\nchildren. Mostly they took out people 25, 26, 28 years old. Some of them they were religious\nand they start saying the traditional Kiddish. That was the first night I was over there. In the\nmorning, 5 o'clock the morning, the order. Out! Went out. Stayed in line to work. What was\nthe work? The work in Treblinka like mostly was those clothes which were there were taking\naway from the people the night before, they day before they killed and there was piles up on\nthe big places with clothes. They had to be divided. Like coat to coat, shoes to shoes, shirts,\nand also the quality of it. A cotton, other things, wool...that was the job. We called it sort\nkommando. Maybe you heard that name. Maybe not. So we worked over there. I myself I\nwas a barber. Then at the third day or so it came...it came another order. They need barbers.\nIt was mine town between the 16 people they took out, there was one more barber. But I had\nsome with me friends ____ you do. You're gonna be barber. They took also from other\nplaces, mostly from Warsaw. They got themselves about 14, 15 barbers. And they took us in\nto the other side of the place which is called Treblinka No. 2. Treblinka No. 2 means only the\nwork by dead people in the gas chamber. What they wanted us to do is to cut off the\nwoman's hair. They took us in to the gas chamber...1n the gas chamber before they gassed\nthem. There were benches, about 20 benches...maybe less. And on a row of benches women\nwere sitting and the barber went through cutting hair, with me cutting hair. The way the\ncommandant...he was Jewish who...the way I know after that...I find out that he was\nconverted but that doesn't mean anything. His name was Glesk. Maybe you heard the name.\nEugene Glesk. He was the commandant of Treblinka. He was a very nice man. Very fine\ngentleman. He came over. He had a speech to us. He said, \"Look, people. I don't want that\nthe woman should know that they're going to be gassed. Make believe you're giving them a\nhair cut. They...they're going in to take a shower. It is...take a bunch of hair from here. Take a\nbunch of hair from here. Don't take off all the hair. Don't make them look like monkeys. And\nso we did it.",
        "A: What was like it? We had scissors. From them we took bunches of hair. Cut off. Threw on\nthe floor to the side, and about 2 minutes have to be finished. Not even 2 minutes\nbe...because there was a line waiting to come up the next group. And that's how we worked.\nInside it was very painful. Most painful was because some of the barbers they recognized\ntheir dear ones, like wives, mothers, even grandmothers. Can you imagine that you have to\ncut their hair and not to tell them a word because you were not allowed. If you say a word\nthat they going to..uh..be gassed in 5 or 7 minutes later, there would be a panic over there\nand they would be killed too. After that, the transport was finished.",
        "A: It was just families like any other family. But the most thing it hurts when you know people.\nWhen a transport came in, you don't know the people. Those are people, but when it comes\nin somebody you associate or you are related, that's an entirely different thing. It hurts a lot\nmore. We have..I have friend. We worked together. We were friend in the same town\ntogether. Was a barber, a very good barber too. And he was working gas chamber with me. It\nhappened that there came in one time his sister, one time his wife, came in his sister-in-law\nsame thing. He start hugging and this and that. To take a half a minute more with her than\nwith any other one. But this thing has to be done. He couldn't help himself. It was very hard.\nIt was very, very horrible. But any other way it was, you get killed. Which it happened. Now\nlet me...let me tell you a story. I had a very close a friend of mine. I worked with him\ntogether for years. His name was Dorfman Slamic. Very fine gentleman. Now two men from\nall the time where I was over there, they didn't want to stay with us together and work\ntogether. They run into the gas chamber by themselves. He was a barber, and the other one\nwas a neighbor of mine. He did the same thing. That's two and the history...when the history\nof myself being in Treblinka . I didn't have the guts to do. I wish I could. I did not.\nBut what could he do? Or get killed! To go together with him or wait maybe another day.\nAnd I want to tell you something. If a humanbeing is in a situation like that, he thinks of\nevery second, every minute...maybe...maybe there will be a change. Maybe something\nhappened. Maybe there will be a miracle that he will survive. That people were not ready to\nget killed. People were not ready even to try to escape. And it happened to myself which I\norganized my escape. I organized another escape from 11 people which they escaped from\nTreblinka. But people that were not ready for it, they didn't want it. I had a friend of mine\nwhich is...was a leader from the...from the organization of the workers and I approached him.\nI said, \"I'm planning an escape. Maybe we'll escape. You interested?\" He said, \"Look, Abe.\nI'm here already. Where I'm gonna go outside to the Pollack. They will kill.\u201d\u2019 Which 1s...was\nthe truth. It was the truth. \"So I rather stay here. So it's gonna be, it's gonna be. I'm gonna live\nanother day...I'm gonna. If not, be killed.\u201d Now that is one thing. Another thing 1s...which I\nwant to mention..I hear that story many, many times and it hurts me a lot. I'm going back to\nthis same time that...uh...Jewish people went in like the sheep to the slaughter house. It hurts\nme a lot about that. I explain that to you why. People are not sheep. The way the Germans\nare organized to get the people killed is entirely different way. The first thing of not allowed\nto go out. The second thing is of not bring in food. Then they starve the people. They take\naway the clothes from the people. They take out the furniture from them, the better one.\nThey take away the...the force, and then to starve them little by little until the people they\nlost their will to fight even the will to live. And to them was the same thing. What I'm gonna\nlose. I'm starving here. I got nothing here. Maybe if I go away and they would send me\nsomewhere away, they promised...maybe over there I will stay. And this is entirely a\ndifferent story than the story like some people they say, here especially people...Jewish\npeople, \"Why you went?\" They don't understand that looking at a wife, at looking at a child,\nand not to have a drop of milk, even a drop of water for them...what could those people do?\nHow could they fight? And with what? First thing, you went...somebody was lucky. He went\nacross the gate. Got killed on the other side because he got paid from the Germans. He got\npaid. For each Jew he got paid a liter of vodka. That was to them and he got paid with salt.\nHe got paid with sugar. And even not for that time he was willing to do because to get rid of\na Jew. And that is not happen to I, a thousand, or ten thousand. It happened to lot of them.\nThe people they didn't go like sheep to the slaughter house. They were already willing to go\nthe last way even to the gas chamber because their will was not decided by them. It was\ndecided by hunger, other thing what they went through. Sicknesses, all kind. And now I want\nto tell you...I want to tell you about the thing...the gas chamber. Always, they ask me already\nabout this thing. The gas chamber. How it looked? Very simple. Was all concrete. Was no\nwindows. There was nothing in it. Beside on top of you, there was wires and it looked like,\nyou know, the water going to come out from it. Had two doors. Steel doors. From one side\nand from the other side. The people went into the gas chamber from the one side. Like\nmyself, I was in it doing the job as a barber. When it was full the gas chamber, the size of it\nwas...I would say 18 by 18 or 18 by 17. I didn't measure that time. Just looked like I would\nsay I look here the room around, I wouldn't say exactly how big it is. And they pushed in as\nmany as they could. It was not allowed to have the people standing up with their hands down\nbecause there is not enough room, but when the people raised their hand like that there was\nmore room to each other. And on top of that they throw in kids, 2, 3, 4 years old kids on top\nof them. And we came out the whole thing it took I would say between 5 and 7 minutes. The\ndoor opened up, not from the side they went in but the side on the other side and from the\nother side the...the group...people working in Treblinka No. 2 which their job was only about\ndead people. They took out the corpses. Some of them dead and some of them still alive.\nThey dragged them to the ditches, and over there they covered them. They digged ditches\nand they covered them. That was the beginning of Treblinka, the time when I was there.\nLater, they changed the situation over there by killing people the same way, but not take\nthem to the ditches but to take them to be burned, to pile them on top of the other top, they\nburned. It was for those people...I brought you the picture. Three of them, they worked only\nby dead people. I myself which I worked in Treblinka No. 1, was little bit easier. Why was it\neasier? Because we...the people working in Treblinka No. 1...1, we took in the transports\nliving people. All living people. And from living people, we got something. We went\nthrough a pocket. We find a piece...a piece of bread. We find sometime a bottle of water\nwhich was a really...some of them they brought in other thing to eat, but over there those\npeople they worked in Treblinka No. 2, they had no chance. All they got is naked people\ngoing in and dead people taking out from the gas chamber.",
        "A: In the gas chamber we were working as a barber over there between 2...little more than 2\nweeks. Not for 3 weeks. And then they decided that the barbers will not go in anymore to the\ngas chamber to cut off the hair of the woman over there, but in the undressing barracks, they\ndivided a part...let's say like you take here, divide a part and on this side they put the same\nthing. Benches around and we cut the hair off, not in the gas chamber anymore. That was the\nlast time...the 3...the 2 or 3 weeks we worked over there, we worked. Nobody else worked\nmore from Barrack No. | because they did not allow it. It was a gate between Treblinka | and\nTreblinka 2 to the gas chamber, also with barbed wires and it was some kind like trees, other\nthing through the wire it shouldn't be visible.",
        "A: They were common people like myself....growing up together. They were people I know.\nThey're the people I know. Like there were people from Warsaw, people from other places I\nnever knew. We just met over there. Same like I say about those people. Some of them I\ndon't know. And like...uh... you know, ____ I mentioned to you. I never...I never knew him. I\nsaw him in Treblinka. So the people I knew...what kind of people they were? I'd say mostly\nwere people...hard working people. One of them specially was a man...he was a fireman.\nMatter of fact, he was related to Danny Kaye because Danny Kaye come from our place, his\nparents. And his name was also Daniel Kamiski which was the name of...uh... Danny Kaye.\nHe wasn't a barber. I took him in. He was a nice man. He was next to me standing. And they\nwere looking for a barber and I said, \"Danny, how about you.\u201d Fine. What's happening?\nThey go in. Because over there, he did that job. He wasn't in the eyes of the German which\nanother thing I have to tell you. People working in Treblinka, there wasn't a job that you\nwork, you gonna work tomorrow. Every day they changed the people they worked there. If\nsomebody worked in Treblinka a week, he was an old worker. He was very old because he\nworked there, he survived a week. Mostly they did...they changed. Every day they killed 2, 3\nhundred, 4 hundred people of the people they worked in Treblinka and from the transport\narriving, like myself they took out, they took out other people. So they were working over\nthere the same way. And those people that I know they worked with me as a barber. The\nsame they did. The same thing as I did. They had over there sometime ______ their sisters\ncoming, and I said it before. They had to do a job. The job was to prepare...to go...people to\ngo into the gas chamber. Not any other thing. Now, after that we worked over there only a\nfew hours because a transport like cutting their hair... Let's say a transport like myself when I\ncame in. When I came in, I came in from the town of Czestochowa. Then came a transport\nfrom other places. It was 18 thousand people. Eighteen thousand people they took out, 16 or\n17 people from the 18,000. And it happened a day I was there and I can remember...it was 4\nor 5 days like that. Not all the time. Most of the time was between 12 and 15 thousand\npeople. But happened 4 or 5 times there were 24 thousand people in one day. And it took\ntime. Each transport took between 2 hours. No more than 2 hours. And it was ____.\nEverything spotless. The train would come in. You couldn't see any dead one. You couldn't\nsee any blood one. Everything was shiny. The rest of the time...talking about myself because\nnot everyone was a barber over there. But we did...after our job as barbers we worked in our\nplaces in the sort __ ko mmandbo, picking the clothes up, bringing the bundle from one place\nto other place. Taking the bundles to the...to the railroad place to load in the...in the wagons\nbecause they have to take those things in. Now there was a question also or some did ask me,\n\"Why did they have to cut the women's hair?\" Was simple, simple answer to that. Because\nthey needed it. What they did from that was to make saddles for the horses. Now if you cut\noff hair from a humanbeing, those hair it just like cutting off the feathers of a goose. If you\ncut the feather from a goose, when the goose 1s alive, that will never die. Whatever you do,\nyou push it down, it goes up...stays up. And with human hair the same way. When you cut\nhair from a dead person, this hair just like the person. It's dead. But if you cut the hair from a\nlive person, if you put in the saddle, the saddle will not push down because that was...that's\nwhy they cut their hair off. Just to be send back to German to the practice over there when\nthey...where they make the saddles with it. Now the...while working over there...did all kind\nof work. At the time...let me explain the...the start of the...of the day. In the morning, 5\no'clock we had a order to get out. Get out. Went to the kitchen. Not just going forth like\nsoldier 5 in a row to receive coffee. A little bit of black water and slice of bread. Daytime\nnothing. After the work, we received some kind of soup. And it was people working in the\nkitchen...excuse me the expression, the toilets and all the places. The hardest job and I think\neven harder working in the gas chamber cutting women's hair was when the transport came\nin and you had to take out people from the wagons. Crippled people, small children, which\nthey lost their parents between like let's say they took one...the mother into one wagon, the\nchildren into another wagon they were not together so they were separated. But we have to\ntake is...to take those people, the old, crippled people and the small...little small children is to\nthe lazarette. Maybe you heard what...about the lazarette. Now lazarette usually means a\nhospital. Now over there wasn't a hospital. Was a big, very big ditch. And it was also with\ntrees around. You couldn't see what was going on inside. In front of it was a man in a white\nthing with a red cross. It's just like going into a hospital, but going into that ditch...over there\nwas Ukraine or German...shot in the head and into the ditch. And that was the hardest job to\ndo. To take people, specially to have children... children a few months old...to take them in,\nthrow them into the ditch where the...over there the fire was burning day and night at that\nditch. All the thing what we find papers...all kind of thing, we threw 1n that ditch and that\nwas going on as long as I was there. The fire was never off. All the time it was on. And on\ntop of that, people and people are killed. Somebody...let's say...anytime when we couldn't go\nin to the latrine...to the toilet, we went to the side to do his, right away they killed. That\nhappened to a close friend of mine. His brother's a barber. He's alive. A guy by the name of\nSliska. He just stood on the side to do his...took him killed, into the ditch. And that happened\nall the time. Every time and all the time. Now it happened that one...one time it happened. A\ntransport came from Ketrzyn. Ketrzyn 1s a little town next to Warsaw. Came a transport over\nthere and a woman came out from that transport. Why I mention it? I'll tell you the story\nwhat it happened. That the one story which very, very seldom. She came out. In front of her\nwas two men...two was moving with the red finger on. One of them...tall fellow about six\ntwo or six three, blond hair. Real German, but he was a Jew. And another one...his name was\nSolic Matter of fact, he was a barber. Well, he did a good job. What you mean a good job?\nFor the Germans I would say.",
        "A: And he was active. What that mean good job. There are people doing good, bad. He was\nquick. He organized it quick. He took the people away quick into the...out from the trains.\nBut he didn't know they are Jewish people. He came out from the train with a razor and she\ncut the throat of both of them. Specially the tall fellow. I never knew his name. Was very,\nvery handsome. He was more...looking like Germans than all the Germans together. And\nnaturally, on the spot they killed her. Not with guns, with their shoes with anything they had,\nthey killed her. And they took those two men into a hospital. I don't know where, but out\nfrom Treblinka. And they tried to arrest them whatever they want. This tall man they couldn't\nhelp. He died. They brought them back to Treblinka. The other one...he got killed, also\nbrought back. When I left Treblinka___. But the first man...that's the only funeral in\nTreblinka which was from the beginning until the end. What they did, they took him. They\nmaked a grave for him, and wood thing. They buried him. Everybody stood...an order. That's\nthe only one grave which a man...Jewish man was left in that Treblinka. A woman from\nKetrzyn. Now during the time when...when I was there, it happened a lot of thing. What it\nhappened? In the barrack I was in it, we were about 70 people one barrack. Every night of\nthe work people, 5, 6 was missing. What mean were missing? They killed themselves.\nHanged themselves with their...whatever they could get on them to strangle themself. Even\nmy brother-in-law did the same. Uh...He married...he married a sister of my wife by the\nname of _____\u2014\u2014_\u2014, a highly educated man. He was the leader of the...he was the leader of\nthe Socialist Party Bundt had the name Bundt in Poland. He was a leader from that. He\nhanged himself. He couldn't take it. And that happened every single night. Three, four, five\npeople. Beside people which they were killed by the Germans exchanging them for new ones\nwhich they came in from the new transport. Oh, it happened at one time to me. I got very\nsick in Treblinka. Very, very sick! And I went over to the commandant, to the German, I\nsaid, \"Take me to the lazarette.\u201d When I say take me to the lazarette, he knows exactly what\nit means. To be killed! Because I had an attack of the...how you call it? kidney and that was\npain...I couldn't take it. Unbelievable! So he said to me, \"How long are you working here?\"\n\"Oh,\" I said, \"I work here about 5 weeks.\u201d \"5 weeks.\u201d Go to the kitchen and ask them to give\nyou some Snupps.\u201d And I was surprised. And everybody was surprised that he didn't take out\nof the gun and took care...what for you need that. Not that Jew. Could get 10,000 of Jews.\nGet the other one. I went over there to the kitchen and I told him what____\u2014\u2014\u2014.\u00ab~ Whose\ngoing to give you whiskey? A little bit water you can have. I got a little water and then he\ntold me to go into the barrack. That was the first time somebody went into the barrack in the\nmiddle of the day not going to work. And I laid down in the barrack. I had two cousins over\nthere. They worked together with me, which they were taking out at the same time transport\nwith me. One of them, he risked his life to find out what had happened to me. He came in to\nthe barrack. He saw me. He never said a word to me. He run out and he said, \"Abe is in the\nbarrack.\u201d At the night, they came in. Everybody on top of me. \"Oh, you must be really the\nlucky one that they didn't kill you.\u201d They didn't kill. I still was in pain. Over there, we had a\ntransport coming in. Not one, but many transports coming in from Czechoslovakia. A man\ncame in by the name of Zello. He was captain in the Czechoslovakia army. Another one\ncame in by the name of the Messiadic which was not the president Messidic. He must be\nsome kind of a relation. He had a wife. He was Jewish or his wife was Jewish. I don't know.\nThey came in. Was a doctor. What happened? When I told, he took out the tablets and said,\n\"Abe, take the tablets,\" to me. I took the tablet. The following morning I never knew what\nthat mean the sickness until three years ago now I got sick in Israel, also on the kidney. Now\nanother practice. I worked in... worked 1n a barrack where people were hiding. I did it\nmyself too before I escaped from Treblinka. What was...the barrack was full of\nclothes...bundles maked out of clothes. So what we did we put the bundles in the barrack one\non top of the other until to the roof. People they tried to escape. What they did they went\nin...in the day time during the work in the barracks and they remained over there. And they\nhid themselves between the clothes. Both it happened by accident when the clothes moved,\ncould never go out and got choked there. At one time we took out from a barrack the size I\nwould say maybe about 40, 60...40, 50 meters, over 30 people. Dead ones! I did the same\nthing when I escaped. But before that, I worked over there and I tried to help some people\nany way I could. At one time he came in, he was a kapo. His name was in Jewish Ben Yamin\nYakoski. Have you heard that name? You did. He had a brother over there. Very, nice,\nreligious individual boy. He was from a town of Yen Jeif, which is not far from Kielce. He\ncame in he said, \"Abe, I trust you. Tonight, my people...my brother ___ they\ngoing...they're planning an escape. Eleven of them. What should I do?\" He said. You know\nyou...you have some landsmen from your town working outside...not in the barrack, but\noutside?\" I said, \"Yes.\u201d \"Tomorrow morning after the appell you bring in your friends. If\nsomebody comes in to you and tell their friends, they're working all the time here.\u201d\nNaturally, I did whatever he told me. In the morning...group I worked with them...Il of them\ndisappeared. Then it came in...the assistant commandant...friends which we call them the\nlackger, that name you heard already many times. He came in the barrack and he looked at\nme. \"What are you doing?\" I said, \"I'm working on the cloth...looking what is there, cotton,\nthis that.\u201d \"Are the same people working here what they worked yesterday?\" I said, \"Yes.\nEverybody's the same we're working.\u201d It wasn't true. What those people...by crouching the\nother side of the gate, they left some kind of sign from the trees. At night they couldn't take\naway the little...this from the trees. And he saw that somebody went through that. He came\nover to me. He took my...I had...had a hat..he took mine hat...he start knocking in a wooden\nblock which hold ___, but I was like paralyzed. Didn't feel at all. Just for the thing what they\nhad. I was scared. They're taking out to kill me. I didn't feel it all. Behind him, was a friend\nof mine by the name of Sidman, Eisack Sidman. He was standing with a knife over there\nbehind him. And if he would take out the gun, he would kill him. But it happened that he\nknocked and knocked and I didn't say a word to him, so thought maybe I didn't know\nnothing. He let me go. Then at night after work, people came in. \"What happened?\" I told\nthem. For those people, they escaped. After that I found out what happened to them. From all\nthose 11 people, 2 were alive when I returned from Treblinka to Czestochowa. All nine other\nones, they were killed by the Pollacks. They went back to their home town in _Yan Jeif, and\nthey were very, very rich. They were like, I would say, the Rockefellor. They had a\npossession. They owned ____ to ____. They call themselves I would say in German, The\nBundt's. They got killed. Two of men they tie your hands to escape. I met in the ghetto of\nCzestochowa, when I came back from Treblinka. They couldn't stay there and they went\nsomewhere away. I never saw them again. That was one part, but the second part we...what\nwe decide to run away. The first thing is we had to get money. When you go out...when you\ncome to the Pollacks, it's impossible to live without it. So we tried to get some money and\nthat wasn't a hard job to get. The money wasn't a hard job to get the money but to get the\nmoney was our job. If they find on you one slota or one dollar, you get killed. So ____ about\n8, 9 from our hometown. One 1s still alive. He is today 85 years old. He lives in Israel. Yakia\nBisner. A friend of mine. And this one, particular this one. I took him away from the gas\nchamber three times. He had such kind of eyes...you look at him you get scared. And twice\nthe German took him in, told him to go to the gate which going into the gas chamber. And I\nwas from the...from the side. I threw clothes on him. I took him away. And the third time he\nwent and he worked together with me. We...we were together all the time and we collected\nmoney together to escape. And matter of fact, he escaped before me. Also organized this\nthing. We decided who's going to go. He went away with two other ones, which the other\nones got killed where he's still alive. When we collected the money...and going in to the\nbarrack, the Ukrainian...they did something which is not normal. Why? In the middle of the\nnight we came out from the barracks not walking, but crawling to the wires...to the barbed\nwires. We want to go through them. We were 7, 8...one was still inside and we had the\nmoney with us. Also the same one the Sidman which I mentioned before. And the Ukrainian\nthey jumped on us. We...we were the last straw... went back to the barracks, back to our\nplace. We don't know anything. But they got him. And they're going to kill. What you got?\nWe showed him. Got money, a lot of money. It happened they let him go. Why they let him\ngo? I'll tell you why they let him go. They took the money. And they escaped. Those two\nUkrainians workmen...they escaped from Treblinka. Then we decided a group of 9 people is\ntoo much at one time. We're going to organize a different way to escape. Three at a time.\nAnd we organized it. One group went the first one. Then another group they didn't succeed.\nTwo of men run away. They third one got catched by a Ukrainian. His name was Ella\nLoddick, Ella. When the Ukrainian jumped on him, he jumped on the Ukrainian and he bit\nthrough his neck. With his teeth he killed him. And he run away. I met him in the ghetto of\nCzestochowa. He was over there, married. He got married in that little ghetto after he got\nback from Treblinka. I was at their wedding. A few weeks after he got sick and he passed\naway. Now the third group I went with a friend of mine and a cousin of mine. And we did\nthe same way I mentioned before, hiding between the clothes, make also...you know, each\nwent into the ditch. Three of us. We kept the clothes apart. At night, the Ukrainians, the\nGermans come in start hollering, \"Rouse, Rouse.\u201d We don't know anything. Then with their\npicks from their rifle, they start picking if somebody is not over there. They left. We worked\nover there until about 6 o'clock. About 8:30 was...winter beginning of January 43, we decide\nto leave. Now to escape from over there is...was one chance. What was one the one chance?\nWe had to go through that lazarette what the fire...what the dead people was burning. We\nhad to go through there. Otherwise, it was impossible because it was six or seven row of\nbarbed wire. You went through one, you had to go through the second, the third. Over there\nwas only one. When we maked through that ditch of the burning fire, we had the gate of\nthe...with one barbed wire. We decided that on a Saturday night to leave the place. We took\nclothes. We throwed the clothes on the barbed wire and lucky ones, nobody was in the\ntower...watching towers. There was all around watch towers. Saturday night we figured out\nbecause we saw so many times they disappeared. They went to uh...to drink or they went\nwith girls, out to Ukrainians, so we maked that. We came out about 9 o'clock at night\nthrough that, start running and running. We run all the way. In the morning we find out about\n6 o'clock in the morning, we were at the same place. Almost a kilometer away. And we\nheard the Ukrainian talking, so we were in Ukrainian place surrounded. Finally, I looked\nthrough the stars and I went a different way. Went _different way, went to the River of Bug.\nStayed there until about...1n the morning about 8:00, 8:30 in the morning. Met a woman not\nfar away. She said, \"What are you doing here? The Germans are all over.\u201d \"Let us in for just\nfor over a day.\u201d Nothing doing. So we stayed there...stayed there a whole day like in a\nwilderness around us. Then the following morning, we saw a man with his wagon and horse.\nOne of us went over...was a little village or something. He said it's not far away, about 6\nkilometers which is not far. \"Can you take us?\" He said, \"I'm going with my horse and\nwagon. If you want to go...after I don't know...I'll think about you. You go.\u201d So he went from\nover there and we came in. It was not a village, even smaller. Maybe was about 15, 20\nfamilies living there. And that time was...uh...the hard job started. We were liberated from\nthat...but we were not liberated from the...from the war...from the Germans. And it start\nanother painful, painful time. Being outside, the head man from that little village came over\nto us. He said, \"I know who you are. I know from where you come because we only 6\nkilometers from the place. We can smell. You know...when the corpse are burning, we could\nsmell it. When the wind goes out our way. What do you want to do?\" We said, \"We want to\ngo...we want to take the train to go to...back to Czestochowa. \"And that's a rough time. I\ndon't know how you're going to do it.\u201d \"Okay, show us where it is the nearest station.\u201d\u2019 He\nsaid, \"First stay over here. Stay over night. Early in the morning, we'll see what we can do.\u201d\nWas a really nice man. He brought over some milk and something to eat. We left. He said,\n\"Don't go with the way. I take you around the forest. Usually it is about 17, 18 kilometers\nfrom that place, Treblinka, to that village where he took us by the name of San Draniki. I\nremember every name of it. He took us over there, said goodbye. We was in the...we was\nalso in the...in the...one night we stayed in the forest. Second night we decided to go into the\nvillage. A woman opened up the door. This friend of mine went over. \"What do you want?\"\n\"We want just for the day, give us a place.\u201d So she goes in to her husband, \"Go up to the\nstable.\" They had a stable. Nothing was in the stable. They were poor people. So I went in.\nWe stayed over there. Cold. Ice. Cold. It wasn't a stable like...stable you know, just a part\nwas open. Wide open. WE were freezing over there. We were over there for about a week.\nAt night, came up and they told us to go into his house. His house was one room divided\nwith something like this...some kind of paper_____. We stayed in the back. In the front\nthere was a....his sister from Warsaw. She was a nice, young girl. And all the boys they came\naround, and they had a good time and we couldn't breath. We were afraid to breath. To\nsneeze, forget about it. And that was____\u2014\u2014\u2014_. This one fellow by the name of Berkewitz.\n___ was a fairly good one, but we paid a lot of money to stay. Every day we paid a lot of\nmoney in this room, and actually they didn't give a thing. Potatoes cooked almost raw, that\nwe shouldn't be able to eat a lot. And when I explained the deal we paid them like thousand\ndollars a day. We did give them the money to buy material. We maked for them clothes,\nwinter clothes. Day to days, and all that. Was very good material. A brother-in-law of hers\nfind out about...where you got so many clothes. She said, \"I'll tell you, but nobody has to\nknow. I have some Jews.\u201d \"Where is he?\" \"He's my house.\u201d So he came over, he said, \"You\ncome with me. I take the machine...the sewing machine. You come to me and you make for\nme clothes.\u201d I said, \"Yes, I will make for you but they are my friends. I will not go without\nthem.\u201d \"Come.\u201d Now this a...some kind of little story. I wrote that in a book. It is in a book.\nWhen we came over to that one, it was magnificent. There was a man and a woman...what\ncan I tell you. Diamonds. Didn't take money. Just for the food what we ate. And she maked\nthe best food you can mention. We didn't sleep in the stable. We slept in the house. In a bed.\nAnd for us we didn't see..first thing we didn't see anyone. I myself for 4 months I didn't see a\nwoman with clothes. All I did is my job in the gas chambers. All these people were all naked\nwithout any clothing. First time I see a woman it was strange to me to see a woman. And she\nwas so nice. They had a son about 9 years, daughter 7 years old. His name was____.\nAnd we were over there over a week until I find a paper...newspaper and it was...a\nnewspaper was a month from over there to Warsaw, from Warsaw to Czestochowa, which 1s\na far...far away. From over there to Warsaw is far, I would say about 68 miles and from\nWarsaw to our town it is about 150 miles. Far away. To walk is impossible. We decided to\ngo by train. Whatever will be will be. We'll go by train.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Before I boarded that train, I got into a family. I mentioned it before by the name of Suppel\n____. We stayed there about 8, 10 days. Very, very nice people. And he had a...uh...brother-\nin-law. He and his brother-in-law was taking us to the railroad to pick up the train. Before we\nleft (coughing) excuse me...their house...his wife start crying and she said, \"Somebody from\nyou survive, please write me a letter.\u201d And that was the end we saw them. We went through\nthe forest. They went first. They didn't want to go together with us naturally. Before coming\nto the railroad station, from the forest under a tree...1t came out a few Germans from the SS.\nAnd how...where do you have your passports. We find out that time that the German they\ntook away all the passports from the public to change for a different kind of passport. And\nwe knew that. So we told them, oh, yes. Yes. It's true. \"Where are you going?\" \"Oh, we're\ngoing to take the train.\u201d Start looking around. I was shaking. I was afraid. That's a true.\nBecause I didn't want to come in to their hand alive again. So my mind was to escape and let\nthem kill me, but this cousin of mine start, you know, pushing me like coming out from a\ntrance...my, myself...where I am. Who I am. And I didn't say a word. They let us go. Coming\nto the railroad station those two people, Mr. Suppel and his brother...was his brother-in-law\nwent in to buy tickets, but the cashier at the railroad station saw us. He said, \"What you want\nto get tickets for them. There are three of them. You are two. No, you cannot get any\ntickets.\u201d\u201d Why? You gotta pay money. And they came out and we told them to give them as\nmuch as as they asked for. He did give them money and we had a ticket. But luckily enough\nthose people there didn't leave us. They went with us to Warsaw which 1s about 60\nkilometers from there. We traveled. Even they were not allowed to travel at night, but they\nwent with us. We arrived at Warsaw about 8 o'clock, and the train we supposed to take about\nquarter til 12 at night. They went over to buy for us tickets, and the cashier said, \"You must\nbe crazy. You know the law. We can't sell tickets only 25 kilometers from this place. And\nwhen you travel over there, then you buy other tickets for another 25 kilometers.\u201d And I was\nstanding nearby and I took out a bunch of money and I put in the front of the window. \"Oh,\"\nhe said, \"Oh, yes. Yes. I have...uh...all the papers from the...from the ____ (which means\nlike the President from the city)...he had the papers...he wrote on the name whatever we did\ngive to them and we had already papers to go to Czestochowa. Right we said goodbye to\neach other, we left. We took the train. Everyone in a different compartment. We don't know\neach other. In the morning, about 7 o'clock in the morning, 7:30 was still like half dark, we\ncame into this station, Czestochowa. A cousin of mine, he lived before in a section which\nwas mostly...uh...Christian people. And this place wasn't included before in the ghetto, not in\nthe first and not in the second ghetto. Over there, went down, didn't see any Germans around,\nbut Polish police. We took a doreska_ if you know what that is. I don't know how to say that\nin...1n English. What...what I call 1t in English. I never know. In Jewish they call it\nkind of thing, but it is a wagon driven by horses, a special passenger. It took us to this place\nover there where he lived. Over there, we went in. Also in the hiding, it happened a friend of\nmine...very close of mine and ___ he recognized me. We grew up I was in the same house.\nHe didn't mention a word to me. He never saw me in his life like...and I never saw him. But\nwe know it...we know we saw each other. We stayed the whole day hidden. At night through\nthe forest, we went close to the ghetto. We came over to the ghetto. We wanted to go in and\nthe ghetto was surrounded by Polish police, Ukraine, other kind. Was very seldom, in fact\nwas never was somebody wants to get smuggled into the ghetto which normally people\nwanted to get out of the ghetto. So I went into the policeman, Polish policeman, \"We want to\ngo in.\u201d \"You want to go in? You must be crazy. What for you want to go in?\" We took\nout...I don't remember how much money. We give it. He looked away. We sneaked in...in the\nghetto. Was a small ghetto. Beginning of January 1943. People in the ghetto. What can I\ndescribe to you. Very, very poor. Without clothes, without food, without anything. We got in\nover there. I met a friend of mine. Very close friend. We grew up together. Up til today we\nare the closest. He is the first one. \"Abe, what are you doing here? You were sent away.\u201d\n\"Yes, I was sent away. I am here.\u201d Met a cousin of mine ____. \"Where are you coming\nfrom?\" \"Treblinka.\u201d \"What is Treblinka?\" We explained it to him. Went into his room and\nwe Start to explain to him. We start to explain to different kind of people. We start to explain\neven to the Jewish police. Nobody but the closest friends of mine or of theirs...they didn't\nwant to believe it. They said, \"What do you want...why you wanta tell me a story that\nnobody who was transported from here is not anymore alive?\" I said, \"That's right.\u201d \"They\nare.\u201d \"You people must be crazy? And where you come from? A sick house?\" I said, \"No.\u201d\nBut one thing...because we didn't ask them for anything...we didn't ask them for food. We\nhad money. We didn't ask them for clothes. We wore clothes. Until one to another, the whole\nghetto knew. And the ghetto was about 5,000 people, all of them working in ammunition\nfactory outside the ghetto which they took them every morning out from the ghetto and they\ntook them to the factory. Over there they worked by ammunition, and at night they brought\nthem back. We had no...no place of ours. We went...uh...escorted to no place, but we hanged\naround. It was very dangerous to be over there. Young people not doing any work. They\ncame back at night. Everybody noticed, especially me. \"Hey, Bomba, is back. He's from\nTreblinka. He tells horrible stories which is unbelievable.\u201d And we had coming in many\nfriends, asking about their families. One I said, \"They're dead.\u201d \"How can it be? How they\ndie?\" Just asking question, \"How? How long did they go? When they die? And how they\ndied? Who was together with them?\" Whatever we could, we answered him. I could answer\npeople which I was with their family in the same wagon...how they locked it and how they\nlived through the journey to Treblinka and the last time I...when I saw them. It came so far\nthat we were afraid that they're going to kill us because we're bringing in all kind of\ninformation which wasn't good for the Germans, wasn't good for the Ukrainians, even for the\nJewish police wasn't good. We're hiding different places, and then I had some\nfriends...barbers. One of them by the name of Balsome...he was the person...the personal\nbarber of the man which he maked the selection. He was the biggest murderer of the ghetto\nby the name of Degenhof. And Degenhof said to him, \"You know something. I got\ninformation there are people here coming from Treblinka.\u201d He said, \"I do not know,\" which\nhe know very well. He was also our friend, and we worked together as a barber and a few\nbarbers worked with us. He said, \"I don't know anything.\u201d He said, \"Don't tell me. You\nknow.\u201d He said, \"I don't know.\u201d So he said to him, \"You know something. If they\ncould...uh...run away, if they could escape from Treblinka I don't want to bother with them. I\ndon't know anything.\u201d And myself was a barber. I went into the barber shop of the ghetto.\nHad a barber shop working over there about, I would say about 10, 12 barbers. They took me\nin. And I worked and I lived with them together. We ate together. Two women. One was the\nwife of the Balsome which he was the head man, like big leader, and the other was the wife\nof a partner of mine from before the war. They did the cooking, everything. At that time I\nhad money. Naturally, I supported them with everything I could. And they had anything they\nwanted. We did also in that small ghetto organized like a little restaurant where people, you\nknow, cooking, buying this that. What we did....I had a brother-in-law, and this other\ngentleman by the name of Eisner, he had a brother-in-law also. And they were running\naround almost naked without anything. What we did...we took out money and we said, \"Here\nis aroom. You buy all kind of food you can get. So who's gonna buy? Alright. You just do\nwith it whatever you can. Was three of us. Jacob Eisner, and this friend of mine. He just\npassed away not so long ago, Rappaport, Moshe Rappaport, and myself. We went down in\nthe street. People coming from work, hungry, dirty, beaten up. We handed them money. Go\nup over there at the first floor. There is a restaurant. And you get food. We supplied the food\nand we sent them over the customers that the people shouldn't go in like without anything,\nand I tell you this is the honest truth. We did it as long as we could. And we're working over\nthere. We organized also in that small ghetto some kind of resistance against...a few of us.\nOne was also from Treblinka by the name of Eislevich. He came from a town not far away\nfrom_Rabonska. And then it was also in January. They tried to liquidate a number of people,\nlike to take out from five thousand, about thousand of them in to be killed. I was also on that\nplace. That was on the market place. They took out all the Jewish people from that\nmarketplace. They divided them in groups accordingly the place where they worked...40, 50\nin a group, and took out groups and they sent them away. This friend of ours from Treblinka,\nEislevich...he had a gun. I don't know how he got it. He took out the gun and he start to kill\none of the Germans...the Gestapo man by the name of Ron. That was the German's name,\nRon. But he didn't kill him. He didn't even want to kill him. He took apart...apart from the\nclothes. Because of that they took out 27 people. From the people they actually...I don't\nknow they wanted to stay or not, but they took out a group of people...27 of them, and they\nkilled them. Shot them in front of our eyes. And this Eislevich with their boots, with their\nsticks they killed him. And this friend of mine, who was also close with that Eislevich like\nmyself. He had his knife and I had a stick and I said, \"What are you going to do? Don't do it.\nThere will be more killing.\u201d He let it go. And I still sounds the...the voice from one of my\nfriends by the name of _____ when he got killed, before he got killed. He said to his\ngirlfriend, \"Goodbye, Honey Sauce.\u201d After that we went in back to the ghetto. But the\norganizing inside the ghetto didn't stopped. There were other groups. It went out a group to\nthe forest...some boys, younger...little older than myself and for a time we find out they got\nkilled, but not by the Germans. By the Polish ARKA. The ARKA that is they called\nthemselves they fighting for the liberation of Poland. But actually, they were fighting for the\nliberation of the Jews in Poland which they helped the Germans to liquidate the Jewish\npeople. And until June the 22nd, 1946, they find out that a group is organizing a resistance of\nthe ghetto in Czestochowa. They want to know who the leader is. They took out a man, a\nfriend of mine...very close friend of mine by the name of Poltashavichs. He was such a nice\nfellow, such a quiet man. They took him out to an open place and all the Jewish people\naround that place had to stay to look how he's beaten up almost to the end, just to say who is\nthe leader. But he didn't say it. They killed him, and he didn't mention a word. Now, that was\nthe last day in the ghetto. A day after, they start liquidating the small ghetto which at that\ntime was between 4 and 5 thousand Jewish people working in four different factories in\nCzestochowa. One of them was by the name of Hassack _. The other one was Hosa\nHassack, Bata, and there was one Slavanka where people worked. The biggest amount of\npeople they worked on ______ which was almost about 3 thousand of them. And I was\nworking was in this same place here after the liquidation of the ghetto. By liquidating the\nghetto, there was a lot of people which they belonged to uprising group, and many of them\ndigged holes, bunkers to be hidden and also I was in...I was involved with a group which we\ndigged a bunker, a big bunker...a bunker about 50, 60 people in it. We had inside food for 2\nyears hidden. We had beds in the bunker. We had everything you wanta mention. And also\nwe digged a way to go through the ghetto into the other side, to the Christian side. Going in\nthrough that we had to go in to a big pile of garbage. Under that garbage, we had hidden a\ntiny little door from the top to go into that. At that time I knew already my wife...I met her\nthere after I got back from the Treblinka...something like that I met her, and I said, \"Regina, I\nhave a place.\u201d We went over there...",
        "A: Became my wife. Yes. Regina.",
        "A: _____ Regina. And I'm going over to that place. I'm opening up this and she said, \"I won't go\nin. If you want, you go in. I don't want to go in.\u201d I said, \"If you're not going in, I'm not going\nin either.\u201d What it happened, people went in and they with dynamite they destroyed the\nwhole land of that strip about 6, 7 houses. Took out 3, 4...3 stories, 4 stories, 2 stories and all\nthe people got killed. The rest of the people the Judenrat and most of the police they took to\nthe cemetery and they killed them. Before that it happened...I got to mention it. Before that it\nwas on Purim, 1943, the guard came over and he said to the Judenrat before...just shortly\nbefore that, because that what happened in June and Purim was in the end of March. He said,\n\"We got a contract with the British government. We're going to release part of you and\nthey're going to release some of our soldiers which they are under the British. Some are\ndoctors, engineers, rich people, electricians, and all kind. By among they took 152 people.\nWe will give you passports. We will transfer you to Palestine. Everyone was happy. From\nthem gonna give all they have, more than they had to be included in that group. One of\nthem...a doctor, Doctor Connon, with his wife. An elderly man, a doctor, he fell asleep. He\ndidn't go. What do you think they did to that group? They took all those girls, about 150\npeople into the cemetery and they killed them. And this doctor, because he fell asleep with\nhis wife, was missing. And then they liquidated the ghetto and they got rid of those houses\nwith the people they were hidden in it. They took us to the labor camp...to the...1n\nCzestochowa ____. Over there, we worked there from the end of June 1943 until the\nliberation. The 16th of January 1945 we were liberated through the Russian troops. And\nfrom over there... worked there in my trade. Only my trade a working, as a barber. They\nneeded barbers over there, so I worked over there. I was very... was almost fluently in\nthe...in the German language, writing, and also in speaking it. I never wanted to be any of\nthis big people. I was plain working man. As a matter of fact, the director of this factory, it\nhappened that this one of humanbeing I would call from the German government...a name by\nDirector Litt_He was in the parliament and he was also from the family of Franz. He took\nthe people and he said, \"This is your home. You're gonna stay here as long as you will be\nalive. You're gonna be...you're not going back anymore to that ghetto.\u201d At that time I was...I\nwas still in the ghetto, but when I came over he called, \"Who knows German?\" I said, \"I\nknow German.\u201d \"You're going to be the foreman of the barbers.\u201d I said, \"No, There's an\nelderly man. I respected him very, very by the name of Goldberg. He was in our city a\nlegislature, and he was a big man. I said, \"The job goes to him.\u201d And I...and I worked as a\nbarber until almost the end of it, when they start in 1945 when the front with the Russians\ncame closer, they start to liquidate that factory too where we worked. They took away every\nday people. And I said to myself and also to a few friends, \"I am not going anymore into a\ncattle train. I know where this thing goes. If anything happens, they're going to take me I'm\ngonna escape.\u201d And I even said to Regina, \"Don't go after me. You don't know me any more.\nI don't know you any more. Just you wait. If I go, I will escape. I will not go in the wagons.\nIf they kill me, I will not go in the wagons.\u201d At day time, they took out...a day before, over\n2,000 women. Day after, they took out a thousand men, and they send them...the women\nthey send to Ravensbruck, Bergen-Belsen. The men they sent to Buchenwald. I didn't go\nwith that group. And the afternoon, seeing what's going on over there, that the Germans are\ngetting nervous. Some of them did try to escape, and I tried to go through the wires. So one\nof the Ukrainians said, \"Look, don't do that.\u201d The voice was different than a day before. He\nbegged us...not he ordered us, but he begged us that we shouldn't escape now. Later it was\ngonna get dark. What happened? We saw...myself and some other of them...some of the\nGermans, they were carrying bombs to blow up the factory with the people, but it was so\nfast. I wasn't there already. I went outside by myself. Then it happened that I...there was too\nmany Germans. I couldn't go through. I came back and I said to Regina, \"This time, you're\ngoing with me.\u201d I took her out the wires. We went around. Imagine that I...I would say I was\nalmost like born in the city, and I didn't know where to go. The place where I wanted to go\ncouldn't go through. It was full of Germans. On the other side I wanted to go to the old town\nof the city. Everything inside was burning. Well, I decided to go a different way, just to go\nnear that place. I had a friend of mine, a Christian friend. I had many, many of them before\nthe war, by the name of Berenski, Adolph Berenski. Very, highly educated man. And I tried\nto go...to get to him, but wherever I went I couldn't get through. And there's another story\nwith him either. It is worthwhile mentioning it. This friend of mine, when I got back from\nTreblinka, he had a factory. He had a big factory. A rich man, rich boy. He was married. A\nrich boy, fine educated. He wanted to divide a part of the factory and to make a small room\ninto...put me in that part. Me, the two friends of mine from Treblinka and Regina and some\nof...one friend...one of our other friend had a girl or so. He said, \"I have everything ready. I\njust want you to come over there.\u201d I don't know. I had no feeling for it. I had no heart to do\nit. In my heart, even we grew up together I didn't trust him. Don't ask me why. I don't know\nwhy. And I didn't go. Now listen carefully to it. He did a lot of for some of his friends,\nJewish people. He sent in food. He sent in clothes to the concentration camp where we were\nand he helped them a lot. After the liberation I found out a story, an unbelievable story. One\nof his girlfriend, which was a friend of mine. In fact she is now...she's living now. I just saw\nher not so long ago. He did a lot for her and for her sister and some of the family. He had a\ngirlfriend, a Christian girlfriend. You know after going around a time with her, it happened\nshe got pregnant. A Christian girl got pregnant. Why I'm telling you this story 1s she...this\ngirl, she was with a sister. They had two sisters, Jewish sisters hidden in their house. He\nknew about it, but he wouldn't believe it. When he ordered her to get rid of the pregnancy\nand he didn't want to marry her, he went to the Gestapo and to the other...and he told them\nthat those two sisters had hidden two girls in their bunker. They took them out and they\nkilled them, and the two sisters...they took away. They send them to Ravensbruck. This girl\ngot rid of the pregnancy and she was working in the Ravensbruck for a time. She was\nliberated. She got back to Czestochowa, and he was in the city already a big man. Everybody\nknew him. Nice, fine man. Nobody knew about...knows about his story. When she got back,\nshe went to the...Polish police at that time, and she told them the story. And they called them\nin. \"Is that this?\" He said, \"Yes, it's true.\u201d They jailed him, and he got 15 years in jail. After\nliving in jail or a year, a little more than a year, he committed suicide. That's the man I didn't\ntrust him. I didn't go to him. And something...something 1s luck. We had all kind of people.\nWe had in the ghetto even Jewish people...I don't have to tell you, if you are in this\nkind...they working...they were working against the Jewish people. _ I'm sorry to say that\nthis true. And that happened. It happened in our...in our town. We had a few men. I don't\nhave to mention the names. If you want I could mention it. Yes? I don't think so which is\nvery...because we are Jewish people, we shouldn't tell stories like that. But for the, you\nknow, documentary and for the history, everything has to be open. One of them was a\nRosenberg. He was a policeman. The other one was by the name of Slemmer. There were\ntwo brothers. One of them was involved. The other wasn't involved. Was a barber. Nice man.\nBut because he was with his brother all the time, take him also. One of them was a baker. He\nwas head man before the war from the bakers, even he could write and read. Well, he got\nrich. His really name...they call him Kollibike. That's how they called him. And there were\ntwo more boys. I don't want to mention the names because their two brothers are alive, and\nI'm close with them. They were working against. What that mean against? They organized a\ngroup from those...one of them, the Kollibike, and that policeman, Roseberg, he worked with\nthe German together. Announced it for the Germans, whatever was going on, who is\norganizing an escape, who is organizing an uprising. We find that out. And in our ghetto, we\nhave a group of people...we took not all at one time...one everyone...a wife to a house...it was\nnot far from my house. Over there we had lawyers, real lawyers. We had also a prosecutor.\nWe had judges, real judges before the war. It was a trial. They tried him for treason against\nthe Jewish people, and we decided death penalty. And death penalty was done on the spot.\nOn the spot and in a bottle, wrote down the whole story, buried the bottle. And we did that\nwith him and the other one. The other group of four people, they didn't do that. They didn't\nwork together with the Germans, but what they did is they organized themselves a little\ngroup and they went in the name of the partisans to the people...Jewish people which they\nknew they had money, hidden money. We offered the partisan. We don't want money and\nthis and that and in the meantime, they grabbed the money and spent the money, all kind of\nthing. And people ___ and they didn't like it. And they decided to get rid of them, and they\ngot rid of them. That was going on and on. And barely liquidation...and I tell you liquidation\nwas very horrible because there were old people in bunkers hidden all the time. There were\nyoung people and people that went to work and they had their parents in the bunkers. People\nwent to work and they had their children in the bunkers and all of a sudden, you know, you\ncannot go back. And there were bunkers, some of them which because of children they were\ncrying and other thing. They find out about it, and all the people got killed. And that is\nalmost til the end of this... Now I want... wanta go back to the time in Treblinka. I didn't\nmention that, but I have to mention it. When I worked in the gas chamber, that is very, very\nimportant voice to me. By cutting a woman's hair, I met a girl over there. What can I tell\nyou? Miss America 1s a beast according to this girl. A beauty. A beauty from beauty land.\nWhile cutting her hair, she looks at me she says, \"Look, I see you are a young man. Do\nsomething that you should be able to escape and go over...tell the people what is happening\nhere. Especially, go. Maybe my father is alive. I know he 1s alive because he was a\npharmacist in a little town.\u201d I said to her, \"Look, what are you trying to do? Can I escape\nfrom death?\" She insisted, she said, my name 1s Salli Levinson . I am from a little town by\nthe name of Koanst in Poland. My father is the head man from the Judenrat. Now he is a\npharmacist and tell what is going on what happened to me. And you know something,\nbehind my mind I had all the time in me and in a little way that pushed me a little bit because\nof her words to do it. Over there 1n that...in that little ___. Oh, I tell you...I tell you the\nreaction with this with other people, they came in. Coming in to the gas chamber, the woman\nmostly...the men we didn't do. We didn't cut their hair. Only women. But when they came in\nthey people from Poland...from what city they come forth doesn't matter,..about 50, 60\npercent they knew already they're not going to take showers. They're going to be gassed.\nThey knew it. There wasn't any...any outcry. There wasn't any panic. They were I would say\nreleased from their pain, from their going through what they went through all the time until\nto the end of their life. But most what it happened when we have transports from other part\nof Europe, like from Czechoslovakia, from...from Austria, from Germany, from Yugoslavia,\nthose people they didn't know. Until going in to the gas chamber, they couldn't believe that 1s\ntheir last wake. First thing, they didn't come by cattle train. They came in..1n the big wagons,\nthe pullman wagons and they were sitting in comfortable. Some of them were playing cards.\nSome of they...some of them, you know, they were having a good time. At the railroad stops,\nthey could walk out the trains to go over to the places where they could buy coffee, drinks,\nother things, and go in back to the train. When they came in and I remember at one time, I\nhappened I went into the train in Treblinka like that. And told the people to go out. One of\nthe...was from the Germany, they came. He had a fight with those people. He wanted to take\nhis umbrella with him. He wouldn't...he wouldn't go with umbrella, and... Anyway, we\ncrossed. I told him the way you go you don't need anymore umbrella. Well, it didn't come to\nhis mind. Those were the people they didn't believe. Absolutely. But the people from Poland,\naround Poland. They all...they believers. Now one particular transport I will tell you. Come\nto Treblinka from a little village not far away, about 12 kilometer away. This time when it\nwas Poland I...1 went over there. They came in not by train, not by wagon, but Ukrainian and\nthe German took him by foot. It was some kind of holiday. Don't remember what kind it was\nexactly. They went in...covered head, and calling up the out-cries,___\u2014_, and they went\ninto the gas chamber at that time when outside we didn't work. It was long time we didn't\nwork. What was on? This...uh...commandant or was commandant...lager,____. He was a\nsportsman. He organized a box match. Fighters, really fighters. We had a man. He was in his\nclass,___ in Poland. You heard of thing. Now there was another...another one from\nWarsaw and this one came from the...from the...from jail. He was not kosher man. Even in\nTreblinka was... Yomkuller they called. They had a fight. A regular fight. Here you gotta\nfight. You got entertainment and 10 feet away a bunch of people I would say maybe 200,\n250 men, woman, children walking into the gas chamber. If we could sit 2 hours more...it's\nvery hard to describe and to tell every second, every minute and every hour or day what was\ngoing on in Treblinka. Treblinka wasn't a camp for work. It wasn't anything. Only what we\npeople did, we worked by dead people. And that was going on until the uprising in\nTreblinka. The uprising I wasn't there. I know a lot about it. I was almost involved about it. I\nknow exactly how it happened. I know who was involved. The uprising was in August 1943\nwhere the camp was liquidated. Everything was liquidated and nothing 1s showing over\nthere, besides what they put up...the Polish government put up just symbol stones. And\ncoming over there that I had to mention that because this is the first time...and I don't know\nI'm gonna go again. I was there a couple months ago. At that place when I went in with all\nmy family, and I looked at the place and had arguments this and this, this and that. I said,\n\"No, this place was only a Jewish place. If you say Auschwitz, if you say Buchenwald,\nDachau, there were other nations which they were gassed too. I cannot deny this. But this\nplace in Treblinka was strictly for Jewish people. Besides 3 or 4 wagons, not trains, but\nwagons shipped...ships, they took them in and they gassed them together with the Jewish\npeople. Not any other one. If somebody came in, let's say what it was a Aktion against\npeople, and they took him into the wagon and someone had business in the ghetto at the\nsame time he didn't know because nobody knew, it could happen, 1, 5...little more, maybe a\nlittle less got in in the trap and they couldn't get out...go out for no money at all because\nwhoever was in Treblinka, there was no way out. Whatever they saw, they had to finish them\nup. So it could be. Beside that, there was no other camp which was strictly Jewish people.\nNow also for the story, if you say mostly...",
        "A: Yes. Yes. I knew him very well.",
        "A: Oh, I was in Treblinka. I saw Ivan the Terrible. I remember him very well. I saw many times\nI did not work under his control because after liquidating the cutting the hair in Treblinka\nNo. 2 in the gas chambers, I never went back again to Treblinka 2, so I got not involved with\nhim, but I know him. I saw him going around in the...in Treblinka No. 1 where we worked\nand our people from the Sort \u2014 kommando and other work what the...we people did. Many\ntimes I saw him and that is without hesitation it 1s him. It is the same. The same one. And I\ngot friends of mine, at least five, six of them. I was together with them. Every one of them\nrecognized him.",
        "A: As Ivan the Terrible.",
        "A: John Demyonim. Yes. Everyone recognized him. And let me tell you, if they say that people\nsometime they..uh... don't recognize, they forget and the other thing. I was a few times as a\nwitness in Germany against some Nazis 1n...uh...in...uh.... in Treblinka?",
        "A: I was a..for instance, __. You heard the name? His was in...in...uh...Frankfort. There was\nno trial like it's going on in the other part of countries and especially the United States. When\nI came in we were over there 10 or 12 witnesses. Riceman. Maybe you know the name? Sam\nRiceman was my friend from Montreal. He's not alive anymore. Passed away. Catholic. He\nwas from my home town. Was many of them. At times we were at least 12 or 14 witnesses at\nthe trial. Coming in over there, it was a different style of trial. I have never seen that trial. I\ncan tell you my part. I cannot tell you other parts because I wasn't there when testifying from\nother ones. When I came in...State your name, so and so, so and so. Fine. Okay?\nSit down. Swear. Okay. You know against who you are a witness? I said, \"Yes, I'm a witness\nagainst Joseph ____\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014.\u00ab His name in Treblinka was ____. And I'm here to testify it. \"Well,\nif you're going to testify, you know who the man is?\" \"I know.

        "A: Oh, liberation in Czestochowa going. We were liberated ourselves, January 16. Going out\nfrom there we had no place where to go. Luckily we went in at the night before the...we were\nliberated...that I escaped from over there with my wife, went into a Polish house, and the\nfight was going on. We pretended we were Christian which I couldn't. My face has a good\nface. I mean for _____. And we stayed in their house. In the morning, one woman came in.\nShe said, \"So many people is outside. I think that concentration camp people 1s all outside.\u201d\nWhen my wife heard this and I did also she said to me in Yiddish because she did...the\nwoman where we were 1n that place and there were so more friends, neighbors, they didn't\nknow that. She said in Yiddish, \"Come.\u201d I go out and I see. So I went over there and I went\nto that friend of mine which I mentioned before, Adolf Berenski.

They want...I was in Treblinka with them. I went over there to them and we stayed\nfor awhile. Until we start to get together but I don't want to be too long in my home town. I\nwent back to that place, Boyden-Obersladzen, met some other friends, and I met another\nfriend from Treblinka by the name of Borax, Gustaf Borax. Maybe you heard that name.\nHe's now an elderly man. He's about 90 years old at least. Lhear he lives Haifa. I met him.\nWe opened up a barber shop in...over there and we had a very...that was in beginning of\nMarch 1945. We had a nice apartment from the Germans. The apartments were empty\nbecause they...they run away. They were afraid for the Russians. Most of them they went on\nthe...on the west side, because they wanted to be behind American or English instead of the\nRussian. Any way it happened it didn't took too long, just across my barber shop was a\njewelry store. A man, their brother, their two sons...staying in the barber shop working over\nsomething...shots across the street came in from the ARKA. They killed the son and the\nfather. The same day I came home and I said to the children, \"Pack whatever you got and\nthat's last time we're going to see _.\u201d The following day we left and we went to the border\ntown of Germany. I had papers over there ready Germany. We went through Czechoslovakia\ninto Germany. And we stayed one time in Bamberg and then we went to a little place in near\nRegensburg by the name of Fogenstein. I had over there also to do. In that...in that little\nFogenstein...we came in over there. We were a handful of people. We were two or three\nwomen, about 8 men, 8 or 9 men. I was the one...I spoke German, so it's going into the\nBergenmeister which you call mayor of that little town. The whole population was about 2\nthousand. We went over there because over there we could get food. And in a big town like\nin Bamberg, it was very hard. And we had a little...not...we had a little fight. We were people\nfrom concentration camp. The governor...the American governor, he said that we have a\nright to get the same thing what the German people. We don't have to stand in a line behind\ntwo thousand people. We're sick people, suffered, so whenever we came...and altogether we\nwere Il people, so the mayor said, \"No, you have to stand in line just like anybody else.\u201d And\nhe was...find out, a big Nazi. And I was with a friend of mine. He raised a chair to hit him\nover the head. Yes. And I hit him once. I never in my life I never had a fight. I was...I wasn't\na youngster running around, never fight, nothing. This thing I never had. But I hit him once.",
        "A: Yes. I hit him once in the nose and all the thing was...was like coming off. And all what\nhappened...oh, a big thing in __, the little town of Germany. The Jews tried to killed our\nmayor. I ran away from over there with that other man. Went into Regensburg. Over there\nwas a major from the army. He was just very funny, Mayor Levine. Mayor Levine.

So he said, \"I'm gonna send\nfor the...for the mayor. Mayor came over with the secretary. He said, \"Look, you are from\nthe Jewish people. He is from the German people. Shake hands. Let's fight this.\u201d I said, \"We\nJewish people have suffered enough.\u201d \"Okay. Okay, I ready for it.\u201d He said, \"No, he doesn't\nwant. He want us in jail, and he is going to try us and we have to be in jail.\u201d So this governor\nsaid, \"Okay. In the meantime, don't touch these two men. Let them go home.\u201d We went\nhome. It passed about a week, maybe 10 days...all of a sudden I'm going down in the\nmorning. What I see? I see about 100, 150 soldiers, American soldiers, surrounded the whole\nhouse of that mayor. You know what had happened? They took him away. Some of his\nfriends, they knew that he was a SS man in the Panzer Brigade. And they took him away. He\nwas in jail for 6 months...for 6 years. That incident I have over there. And then I left.",
        "A: Well, we left. We came here to this country. We come...we came here '51. We were at\ndifferent places. Then we came here. We had a rough time here too. Came without a friend.\nBelieve me, . And in my trade, you cannot be...whatever you're doing here, you cannot\nbe a millionaire.
